yes sir cheers Cheers and we're live and we're live there's obviously like about so much to talk about years it's been a while there's been a while and one of the reasons why you're here is because I was supposed to have Jackson we should just get right into this you know every how let them I haven't even to eat breakfast I specifically didn't eat breakfast I'm like I'm a drink beer would you already know he's getting me beer and that way it can hit me a lot faster and I'll loosen up my lips a lot sooner we could do whatever you want what's up - you look dude how much do you weigh now man so I've been so here's a crazy story i go to i go to the pi/2 because Dana tells me I can't go to 55 so I go to talk dude he told you you can't go why look at he says I'm getting old and older Mike's just say he said old I'm getting old and you are right so I said I'm gonna go to the to the P I you guys have this amazing facility with the P R stands for a performance Institute for people young UFC Performance Institute and they have trainers and dietician nutritionist right so I'm going there to meet with them to get a a guideline and some kind of plan that we can attack so I can go down I can look I met with your guys they said it's okay while I'm there second day into all this like crazy testing you do right they have all kinds of tests that they run where you get on these bikes and I mean like fuck I was like a limp ik training center testing I wanted to say Joe Silva walked in but then that's not right cuz he's not there anymore so I'm a nerd no Sean said he comes in and says cowboy uh my prayer really wants to fight you want to take this fight and I was that uh I thought I was going to 55 he said yeah he called y'all really wants to fight you and I was like well fuck okay I'll find it sure done that's fine but next one can I go to video you know like goddamn so though how this Perry thing all started was Felder's opponent got hurt I called to fight gay cheetahs cuz Vic got hurt so I was like I'll go to 55 i th e the crazy should just happen and then para fight they offered me and I called Perry say hey man I know we're trained together but this is 10 days notice let's do this is like fuck you might be great let's do this so that's how that started and then when I didn't get the fight that was the end of it for me I went to USC to go back to under 55 then all sudden he's calling me out so Felder winds up fighting Perry Perry were you were gonna fight Perry are you at least thinking about it yeah I was like in the mix right but I couldn't I didn't get cleared because stitches good I just fought what I don't know ten days before so plus I was in the hospital having my new son so it's kind of a weird time for everything but it was wild wild wild shit and out now now fighting Perry November 10th than ever well what was what was gonna happen was Jackson and Winkeljohn were supposed to be here today right well you had I mean you've been with them for how long man I want to say before my WC days so I went on more than 10 years yeah easily yeah easily more in ten years I I don't think there's another athlete there that's been the longer besides Diego Sanchez who's been there since the beginning but he left for a little while left for the while came back um so me you know Holly but she was with wink before he merged so but like with actually Jackson Jackson and I'm like there I'm like the one like it you know you know everyone else kind of either left the jam wars retired so what the fuck happened like how did they decide that they were gonna corner Mike Perry who by the way I like a lot and I have nothing against this a Perry either I don't this this this has nothing to do with it with Perry as a fun dude no problem with him I mean I took on the boat I'm shooting with me and when he was down there part of part of the action you know Frank Lester who's helping him with his pads friend of mine you know so he comes out shooting with me would go in the boat and have fun and so this has nothing to do with them I just asked when I went to go to 55 and Perry called me out and once if I sure no problem but I went to talk to Greg and wink and say hey this guy's brand-new to the gym right he's only been here one camp couple of months I said I don't think that it's okay for him to come in and call me out like that's not not right so if he is doing that I don't think we should allow him to to train here for this fight fucking Winkeljohn tells me yeah you know I thought you called him out and Paul she's just a there's a shit ass and lies like to your face so to me he was like yeah sure no problem I'll I'll clear it up and we won't have any issues and then the next day he calls me on the phone says you know what I thought about it if we won't have periods and I don't get paid and I need to get paid for this fight and could you just pay Greg I'll make any money for the gym so we're just gonna go with him and then basically tells me I'm no longer welcome in the gym and he is he said the team had a meeting oh sure the team didn't have a meeting I talked to everybody the I mean that there was no meeting there's no I so to me it's like the loyalty of link taking over this gym is just if she's shit man turned into like a puppy mill it's all it's all about money now and not the old Jackson when when I used to work out we're just getting into this I guess huh all right start search hug and shit back when I first moved down here and I went to Craig's when the tapout guys picked me up and introduced me and all that right back when you're on the tapout show remember yeah reality show well mask called Greg and gotten that's how I got involved with that right I I left Linda Garcia was fighting Roger war to where my best friends Rajoy call like that was by the way to him right fucking Mexican god yeah we got about that fighter who'd go to fight pass yeah right bring that up later still wildest do ever met my man and so he calls me I come I need to come down for a week come for one week help me get ready for Roger he took the fight on my three weeks notice some growl and it's just like me and Leonard do right so I go down there I literally never left when I went down first day I walked into Jackson's in Rashad Keith saint-pierre Joe daddy Stevenson I mean the list goes on and on and on and I was like wow this is what a real gym is like this is what and they all accepted me like I was like in the family right I call I owned a house in Denver I call my grandma and said I'm never coming home I'm staying here sell the house right and I literally never went home she would just slowly come down to visit me and bring me truckloads of shit literally I lived in a closet man fuck third as big as this room we had a bunk bed me and Leonard and if one person was standing up the other person had to be in the bed that's how small this room was and I lived there for two years above above Jackson's and would train every day with him and I said I never left and Gregg asked me he sat me down after about I don't know couple weeks of being there he said man I wants you to be my 55 and at that time he had a there's a the list of 50 fibers were nuts that he had and I was like wow fuck Greg Jackson who at the time was the man man right that the gym was okay 90% winning great in he's just he's such a knowledgeable awesome dude man and to see where the gym was to where the gym is now is like heartbreaking to me to be honest and you want to talk about loyalty which is the biggest thing and this conversation that we're having right now is how they pick someone over me through being loyal I stuck by Greg even when the gym started going down when Winkeljohn merged over all the big pros left it turned him like a puppy mill you know it wasn't for for back when Greg had it and it was its own school you couldn't turn up to a pro class like like some guy couldn't just come here knock on your door like you say you get weirdos hero time next you know he has shin pads on he's sparring there's literally at the new gym bums come in off the street I swear to God and we'll fight these and we'll come in and put stuff on a fight that's a true story you random bums off the street and that would never happen back in there so Greg doesn't run it anymore no he has he's like so out of the loop Winkeljohn runs the entire thing and that's what it's Greg doing he kind of stepped back for a couple years man like kind of started doing other things and just kind of got burned out I guess which is why I created the BMF ranch I needed somewhere to go and something to do so I created my office which is wings argument with me right now saying you be at your old place you don't ever come here but I said why don't ever come here because you the people you let in here is outlandish like anybody you pay $150 you can get on the masters in spar with Holly Holmes you know I mean that's that's what it's come to down there and then back in May it was like private and just us and good pros everyone there for the same mission trying to trying to get better you know but I've talked to some other people that I want to name sure they've said that when they go down there new guys will come in and it's literally a fight is a fight it's a there's no there's no there's no a b c class anymore it's literally these guys come in they want to make a name of you is sometimes when you're towards the end of a fight camp you don't need those new guy you don't need that crazy sparring right right you ain't you need the guys you trust and right not some random guy don't know right so it's just it's fascinating to me man what what they turn that that still happens in MMA because you're never gonna find that in boxing and boxing all sparring is control control bring in the sparring partners you know who you're working with so I mean we talked to again to me with Greg his name is on that building it's not it's week Jackson week right Jackson fucking wink your name's first even when it came time to pick the decision and they said we want to go with Perry why the fuck didn't you stand because Greg still with me he's like yeah I'll just come to the ranch and we'll sort this out and I'm like what the fuck are you talking about right you tell me I can't come into the Jackson wing gym but you're gonna backdoor and come to my fucking house and we're gonna train to fight me wall Perry's there at the gym you see everything he does and then you're gonna come and you're gonna train me not to mention you're holding classes there and he's watch I mean you might not be training him to beat me but there's a lot of people there that have trained me for fucking years so to me that was the the point I was saying like men can we just not have him there for this camp I mean there's a lot of Secrets that I that like inner seekers that I have like yeah I'm fucking scared to death to fight like that's that to say he can that they can tell him like or they tell him you know get Kowboy mad you know that he doesn't fight well when he's pissed off so fucking piss him off poke out and poke the bear piss him off get him out of his element giving up you know that shit like this right so there's a lot of other things small dumb things that I do and tendencies I've seen over over the year yeah right yeah to me that's it's very intimate between a coach and a fighter is is very it's very intense so for someone to violate that in that way and you know I don't think there's anything wrong with guys from a camp deciding to fight each other and you got to work that out but for them to tell you that you killed condit I agree with right we're it out right cause you go that way out right these are your times your hours affect each other right friends any partner the new guy who just came in I guess I got nothing against Perry he's looking for a he wants a home right he's look he felt like Jack's great I like that guy lot enough that's not him I mean what is he gonna do right and and I just said hey Frank was gonna go and train with him wherever I heard stories he was looking to go to Vegas anyway I don't have any idea man I was just I was just like man could we just not do it for this fight and then Winkeljohn called me on the phone didn't have the fucking balls or the backbone to say it to my fucking face and I was right there with him called my phone like oh yeah we're actually gonna oh go with Perry you know he pays money and if again it comes back to the money I'm like so Perry pays him a percentage and you don't pay Greg I fell for my entire career I've ever been there because I don't like Winkeljohn style and like his way he hold mitts I don't like the way he trains me what's different about what he does it's the same thing right for you for me for John Sam they're all the exalted it's the cookie cutter everything's got the same and it never changes it's I don't understand how you could be a coach of the one of the greatest at one time the greatest gyms on the planet you know and then don't ever evolve don't ever change and don't run class and it's to me it's he just drove that place into the ground man turned literally turned into a puppy mill it's only about making money and for you guys wrong I'm talking about a puppy mill when someone has a dog and they just fucking breed it and sell puppies and breed it it's obvious that's what's happening that's the the infrastructure of this gym now let's talk about training there let's talk about coaching right Greg's supposed to be the the the general right I'm just a soldier how come I have to be now a general a nostalgia that's the might that's what's fucking up in my my career I can't I need someone to tell me what to do tell me what not to do and I had to start my own school at the ranch bringing my own coaches but then now I'm making all the executive decisions when we're training what we're training what we're doing and I'm not I'm no longer just a soldier I'm having to fucking run this whole thing that's important for fighters the problem for me - I like - I'm a fucking super alpha male and I like to communicate my coaches and get everything done and the guys I have fucking standing by me and I love them to death but I need someone to like you know what you crazy fucking bastard you going too hard don't you creeper arms taper off let's pump the brake or let's pick it up right right the fucking fun fuck off party life is taking over into your training can we step it up a little bit right I need that I need I need fucking directs I need today we're working on this not just me going in there's and let's fucking wrestle today you know what to do but it's also nice for someone else who knows what to do who's completely objective standing on the outside because there's bits I'm in this so long there's bright I could literally Joe never spar from now until the parry fight and probably not even do one jujitsu role and I would be okay to fight like mentally right but that's probably not a fish smart idea right like it's not you at your optimum exactly um so it's just it's fucking asinine to me and the coaches down there so not only can somebody just ring the doorbell and show up and train pay the money you can pay the $25 drop in or you pay the hundred fifty a month come to any class you want but if you're a coach you can just coach the class it's but it's that asinine do you I see a new striking coach a new wrestling coach or a new jujitsu guy in there twice a week probably and they're coached in the class the hour rest main wrestling coach of Jackson wink the greatest school in the fucking world is a reception to a chiropractic upstairs he's great his credentials whereas he was a junior assistant coach at a college don't know the college name who got fired for selling the kids steroids that's our wrestling coach added one of the greatest schools in the world Zoo good coach it was terrible he's fucking god-awful terrible he watches videos on YouTube and tries to teach people things that don't even fucking work it's asinine which is another who I had to hire my own coach and bring him in you know it's like like whoa wait what and now they don't even drill they just go live they want to know why people get hurt every day it's like you can't just go in and say okay and we're wrestling go so do you think that people just get burnt down on doing things the right way and they just they just figure look I'm just gonna do this the way that makes the most money well I think and I wish I had I had the answer for that I do because I'm not in that position to I'm not running a gym and that's I've never done that because I don't want it me showing up to class every single day would wear me the fuck out yeah it wears everybody's got to yeah but you should have an infrastructure set in place that takes especially if you're the greatest at one time right if you're winning percentages are in the 80s and 90s and now they're in the 20s the guy I don't I have no clue what our what our rating record of the gym is but it's it's nothing like it used to be right yeah and it's fucking it's asinine so the way you were doing is it you have the BMF ranch right you everything set up you bring in all your sparring partners and you would be doing all your training out there and how would Greg interact you we do the show up down at Jacksons and spar because they self got their still bodies down there right but still guys we'd show up knowledge tomorrow we'd bring all the guys out or Greg would come up you know three or four times a week to the ranch and we know far as your rents from 50 miles BALCO a good hour solid hour dive into the vast Nolan's of New Mexico do you like living out there I do I love it I fucking love it so I sold my house I moved here I fucking planted roots now I could never ever sell my place I'm stuck in New Mexico I'm moving back to Colorado my body never saw because I have this sounds like a crazy cult leaders of anybody out there listening wants to operate a cult 40 acres 40 acres plenty of rooms buildings animals in your vicinity yeah this may be where we start there's there's about an hour drive you running some milk we have we got antelope everywhere which is crazy thing about you know they don't jump fences yeah they won't jump fences crazy right you could just literally corner him into a Hindu it into a they'll occasionally jump offense they've been known to jump offense occasionally it's very very rare you know they evolved before the Ice Age they evolved to get away from cheetahs how are you so smart that's what I want to know I'm not smart I just remember that it's fucking insane there was a mass extinction of giant land mammals it's somewhere around 12,000 years ago in North America and before then there was cheetahs there was actual North American cheetahs right there was a North American lion that's bigger than the African lion how about that shit giant ass fucking lion and that's where these fucking things is you want to another chew yes mainly whenever I meet boomer our guy says I do I can't believe you got rogue and if I could take a chill I do not just take it I swallowed it I didn't know what I was doing like a man yeah all right round two here we go - it's a winter green Copenhagen under your lips you want it take just a little one too late take a bigger liver so is that turkeys out there oh god I love Turkey I'm a bird hunting fanatic man yeah yeah I love birds how many acres you got 40 acres oh wow it's nice though yield to 40 acres and mule number but birds I'm like a bird junkie how did you find that spot um so when I moved out there and after I was in the gyms like a year and a half Leonard I was like bro you're like winning a bunch of UFC fights now I'm in the WC we're starting to get a little bit of money let's get a house together right let's find a house so I started looking kind of in the remote areas around where I knew I could commute in but I wanted somewhere I could ride my dirt bike shoe guns just be cowboy and we found that place and I called my grandpa and I said hey I found a house and he said I'll be right there and my grandma drove and he walked up to the lady and he handed her an envelope full of cash and said we'll take it just like that Wow yeah it was probably 60 or 70 thousand less than they're asking but he had real cash real cash I said we'll take it Johnson wants it and we'll take it Wow and I was like oh I was just showing like okay thanks grandma right like we used bought me a house and he like believed me no matter what I did I used to be one a magician I just like Loveman magic right so he'd always buy me magic shit and sit there and watch me do it and who's such a fucking cool dude man used to do magic mm-hmm you ever do shows no no I mean I was like 12 13 I would do shows to my grandma grandpa and my friends and I still have like a toolbox full of magic stuff I should bust it out and bring it out here one time that's cool um not like good like out you would be like blue but there's some some of that sleight of hand I was pretty fun and like the coin coin magic is good and how do you keep this shirt from going in your mouth you just because it doesn't for me it doesn't so you want to stay put well you keep drinking on top of it you gotta like bury it with your tongue and then drink over it hmm hi fuckin love it so yeah greatest dudes man taught me a lot taught me a lot about loyalty respect man and I called my grandma on my way here today and I said I'm gonna fuckin set fire to this bridge to Jackson's and she wrote me back and said what you need to like are you attacking them logically are you out of anger which direction are we going here awful grandma right on the ball which direction are we going and she said and start spitting soon yeah he's definitely got a spit she said make sure you know always in life don't ever paint yourself into a corner like these are major lessons over to me don't burn bridges you can't cross em hmm look she told me today fuckin and let it go let them have they they want to step across the line they drew the line in the sand let them want to burn there I'll make them feel so bad they want to burn their own fuckin gym to the ground you know hmm it's like to me having a moment for Greg to say you know what wink my name's on this fucking Jim Cowboys been with me from the start there's been times two or three camps ago where I've trained Greg maybe one or two times I still write him a check I still write him a check and I pay him because he got me into this motherfucker and loyalty to me is that the top top-of-the-line thing right it's top of the line to me too that's why you're here right and that's why they're not and you know and it's unfortunate because I like Greg a lot and I was great I don't know much about Winkeljohn other than his work right what is done with Holly and a lot of other people and I was real torn up about this that's why I contacted you sure sure you know when when you told me this is like a crazy scenario all around for everybody across the board like wait what do you like what what the fuck you mean what's happening here yeah you know and it's it's it's crazy it's wild I appreciate you sticking by my side no it was a situation where I didn't know what to do yeah you know I was like I can't just the nor it mm-hmm I would have to bring it up when they were here and then I wouldn't get a full representation of it sure I mean do you feel like beautiful [Laughter] [Music] right it's a skill you'll learn how to tuck it in your yeah it's all over the place it's in my mouth mine is in a little ball right here I don't know mine is not is not controlled I'm gonna wind up swallowing this again so if your name's on the on the thing like right there you go put a spit it out now you got to open another beer and wrench it you gotta give it a wrench a wrench yeah yeah open beer rinse it out spit it out that way you don't get it anymore swallow that way you're not sick again I wasn't sick last I was fine good wasn't weird I swallow the whole thing um fuck yeah I missed you man I missed you it's been a while so much has happened I'm glad we got that gun out of the way I'm sure I'll circle back on I drink a little bit more yeah I'm sure too it's it's unfortunate and I know what it must be like to try to keep the lights on in a big gym and now they have dorms that's huge giant ass place huge overhead I'm sure all these people coming in coming out and then you know how fighters are not you but some fighters they don't give a fuck about loyalty they just care about themselves they're on their path it's a it's a very solitary singing show there's you're very selfish sport you kind of have to be yeah and I think that's kind of where the team got cowboys really selfish he has his own gym now I had to fucking had to man for the better of my family and me I had to keep evolving I couldn't spiral down this drain with you guys you know now Michelle Waterson just built a new gym she's doing the same thing in her backyard love her to death you know not to doing it to her husband build a badass little gym all on it all on it fucking really yes bitching man it's cool yeah good for her yeah Michelle whoa you know but if you look at the track record since link is taking over the gym everyone's left I mean it's like you don't see a pattern here wink like maybe you should change something up or just not allow he's been fighting for a long time in training for a long time I mean he was a badass kickboxer before he ever got in training and you know I think one of the things that happens with people you just get this holes selfishness of the sport it wears people down to a certain extent there's camaraderie but there's also selfishness and they're all constantly going against each other sure and you know having a gym like that the expenses the overhead and then you know dealing with people that just grab and grab and grab and it's just it's got to get overwhelming and you see a guy like Mike Perry who you know is a potential big star he's a colorful kid he's a knockout artist he fucking loves to fight if I was a coach I'd be like this is the kind of guy I want my gym he's a fucking animal you know it's uh it's a super excited to fight him because this is the one of those fights where we're gonna go into the little ring and we're gonna we're gonna fucking fight the old school fucking you know let's fight yeah so um fucking I'm pumped on it I love the kid you know he's cool he's crazy him and I would get along just great you know so I got nothing like sitting by him or Frank Frank his coach who well that's what Perry's working with with Frank the another striking coach who Frank Lester Lester who is holding holding the the infrastructure of the gym together almost single-handedly you know there's a co couple wrestling guys and it's Brandon Gibson still yeah brain so that Brandon has a full-time job just got promoted again in his government job he's like a real government job job job job being a super job yeah yeah how the fuck's he do that man I have no idea he has like a 9 to 9 to 6 job maybe maybe seven to six job really he's every morning up early take care his family he's a great dude I got nothing bad nothing but love for Brandon Gibson man nothing to him and I just separate only because I need to I just want a different angle of striking it wasn't it would mean he had nothing to do with he's a bad coach I lost my fight I'm firing you it's just fuckin just trying something new just trying something new that's all but yes gives it to the kids and kind of just works you know with John Dodson with and it kind of mean he doesn't have the time to go in there and just hold that gym together right so he actually has a real job and he just got another promotion so he's like the top of the he started off as a lifeguard worked his way all over the city now he's damn there governor I think that's next governor is next for it's not hard I had Gary Johnson in here I think I could be governor no offense Gary let's legalize pot and mushrooms is it not legal there it's it's recreation I mean it's medical bills yeah aides like that that's yeah it used to be a lot of places but like Vegas used to be like that now Vegas is loosey goose open wide Vegas got full on dispensaries man doc in Vegas man Vegas is definitely a two-night town man yeah it's rough on the liver it's rough on everything just it just takes you it takes you the fuck in man I was just there last night I was out there for a big monster conference and it's just like you sit in your room like well I could just go down and gamble I guess and then you start gamma have you ever played baccarat I'm for sure I have never either and I decided we tried baccarat like double-oh-seven like we'll be like double 7 we'll go in there I played with with one of the higher-ups in monster

just like if I was coming here and someone out in the parking lot said sounded mad with foot good fucking talking to you like that you know like we'd have it be a moment there yeah yeah yeah so that's how I still feel today but well that's why you cowboy yeah where you who you are sure know what helped you a little bit yes a new mood numr that this is super super new mood okay some of the real new mood that's it that's a gift for me to you I'm glad you enjoy your your buddy Paul Paul Stamets cost amis and light fuck okay let's let's back this up let's bounce at all let's take this train back just okay so you speaking about DMT I'm okay let me look back up one more one more I've never done any drugs in my entire life after a lot of drugs here already I don't look back poor backed up I've never done any drug ever never ever use this two years ago oh you did booze I don't that's legal Oh legal your product of drugs I am product to drugs J just a fantastic truck it's made for great jokes fun times sounds good drug I'm well regulated you know you know what one bottle does that's what I like makes you want to you know does makes you want to that's on you man one bottom you have some goddamn self-control one bottle you know what a bottle of Budweiser does it's really clear true it's like you eat a fucking pot brownie who it could be anything you know you could be you who knows the fuck you're getting at that limit and you tell everything is 3.2% poor people in Utah you know that research you know the Mormons re Brandon I found out this last night they don't call Mormons anymore Eric Griffin was telling me calling a Mormon a Mormon it's like calling a small person a midget yep pretty called latter-day saints shout out to the Latter day Saints it's a magic underwear you can had you underwear god yeah so no drugs okay no drugs talk you hear you talking about DMT everyone's on is DMT ride just sponsored by a little company called on it which is now fucking huge company which I love by the way the gut health oh yeah probiotics most my ovaries my favorite yeah DEET kimchi or anything like that your now he should you should get it get involved get involved with some probiotics you know kefir is really good Kim treats really good now your people are Mike how you talk about your diet again the ha man it's good it's good people need to know like you gotta take care of your internal you know it's you know you don't see that gut health man but it affects your depression your mood the way your brain works where your immune system functions God helps everything those little on and packets are key man I know I don't travel without those bitches I don't go a day without them their new pack they got a new package for them now they're not animal box more high-tech yeah well they exists on the substrate that's in those capsules that's one of the ways you don't have to refrigerate it so good for travel right because it's just I think you should have a variety of probiotics but I think it's one of the most critical things that people don't think about anyway anyway drugs drugs drugs Aubrey said hey why don't you come out we got a little group people doing some DMT did he do the whole ceremony just music chance every throws everyone the whole thing we smoked tobacco out by the fire talking about I won't play some of that ich arose to talk about talk about what direction we wanted this to go you know what we wanted the journey to consist of I call them my best friends up take them with me and we go out there and we fucking we do this we sit in this room we go through the chants and the ceremony and I'm scared to death because I've never done anything right here scared never done I wish that's it waking to wake it up the spirits you just have that here it's on oh dude this is just gonna make me trip if I listen to this if I eat a pot brownie listen to this and get in the tank I'll start tripping alright because when you do GMT and you're you hear this they dance for you right the whole the the experience you realize what this is this is like a technology to maximize being free and while while you're on this DMT this is playing in the background on a drum and chanting yeah that's that's what's going on I wasn't in a super spooky night camera room like this but it was just audrey has a nice he knows what the fuck you know the fuck he's doing yeah you know the real way like a my really spiritual in the room he might be a beautiful man beautiful body and looks like he's running a sex cult but what he really is doing is doing it the right one say it looks like legitimately doing it the right way I can maybe sell the ranch Aubrey and sex Colby and I are partners let's talk apps this podcast is over I just need to know what kind of zoning you watch you got a well oh well two wells actually so what happened all right so this music plan they load the pipe which to me looks like pink cocaine right like pink dust and they load it in this pipe and he says just light it and you want to breathe fresh air out of the corner of your mouth as you're taking this harsh smoke it smells like burning plastic market it's it's harsh he says just hit it - you can't even like what the fuck does that mean I try you're gonna hit this rubber so I hit it I hit it and then all I said I say oh you hit it until you can anymore and he starts getting wavy and then I just the pipe balls out on out then I fall back the entire world comes like zooming in to me like they like war good flat and I shoot do this fucking kaleidoscope of colors maybe 10 seconds and blow out the top like Superman out of the top of this tube of colors and if it's total black darkness and I'm looking at myself from like the third person I'm just hovering in midair and everywhere that I've ever been injured or hurt is growing blight like super white like the whitest white fire I've ever seen like my head's on fire like something out of a fucking movie I'm just suspended in the air burning and I keep like asking myself questions and and then I don't know if it's me but I answer back to myself right and I'm bugging the fuck out because you could still hear this music going I can hear the people giggling next to me I can hear the next guy lighting the lighter and he's now going and meanwhile is burning and I'm talking to myself about whatever question I answered right and also just as fast as I came in I kind of eyes woke and I woke up and I still see the rest of the guys room because they like systematically go around the room in an order they're in there and there and she hits now the pipe comes around again and now it's my turn again now I'm really excited I almost wish halfway through the trip you could fucking hit it again and go back in it's right and this time I'm thinking yeah I want to go back to that again I want to go back to where I just was so I fucking hit the pipe hit the pipe hit the pipe now I hit the pipe so goddamn hard now hold my breath I fall over to the side I fly don't fall to my left side and I'm tipped over well I'll sit back up because you're still there right you're not like in another dimension you're not out of your body experience so I sit back up with the entire trip now is sideways I'm looking at this trip I'm looking at crazy black rainbows and I can't explain what a fuck of black rainbow looks like but they're waving with sparkles and black into a few holdouts turned sideways and blue keyhole a crazy light shapes and darts and every time I almost get through this keyhole it just sucks back more so I got moved up joy Ward and I crawl to it again I try to get in the keyhole and it sucked back again and there was no words spoken this one it was me just trying to get to this sideways keyhole now just get my hand to crawl through it and it would fucking take off again and I woke up and that was that was my DMT experience he's only done it once only not at one time I want to do it again yeah yeah so they talk about marijuana okay done they talk about marijuana being a gateway drug no DMT is a gateway drug for me what's a gateway drug to it allows you to do other drugs and now I do a lot of mushrooms well it's one of those things would lets you know that all your ideas about what drugs are or out the window right all your idea are all your ideas about what reality is are out the window because you didn't think that this was a part of reality how could anybody ever think it before you experienced it but what I don't get is things that shit shapes and colors that I couldn't almost like you don't see today where I could see him there and I could have expected sand the movements it was just so weird like you're right like reality is how is that reality and it seems more vivid than reality more vivid but the cool thing I want to tell people listening like you can just open your eyes or I mean you would be real hazy and kind of gone but I can open my eyes I can see the candles burning over there I could hear lighters going and then you're like oh I'm I'm okay I'm not in another dimension I'm gonna get stuck in this crazy other world and then I'd close my eyes and not go back into it and you're I mean it's like the most of the realest dream you've ever seen right yeah there's another one called 5m EOD mt5 methoxy DMT and it's tonight does a different one what that one makes people really scared I'm different one because you see you cease to exist on that one right it's more powerful actually more and more potent yeah which is crazy to think there's something more potent than DMT but it's more psychoactive in some ways and it's it's one of those weird ones it doesn't have visuals either but you just go to you go to everything you go to heaven you did I'm a part of it all it'll just how it's crazy how clear and since you could make of the uncensor a like I try to explain now and it sounds weird but when I was in it it's like everything's so clear yeah but you realize how much of what's holding you back in this life is like insecurity and fear and and and just just not knowing you know and confusion and all this and then it just sort of like pours water on the stuff that's dirty and clean all the bullshit out and goes no it's all love well happiness friends experiences life camaraderie those are the important things that's that you have a particular channel if-- to spread more of that and help other people spread more than keep this ball roll and that could really change the world to change the world because the people that you impact ripple out and they they infect other people or you could just get caught up in arguing with people online now you can get caught up caught up in the water over the dirt and just the chaos of it all it doesn't take much to get me caught up so that's also why you're a great fighter you know those things go hand in hand if you're a person just accepted bullshit maybe you wouldn't be the guy that gets up in the morning when you don't want to trim you wouldn't be the guy that takes those fights on short notice and goes fuck it maybe you'd be the guy that would be like you know what this is not the right move for my career I have to sit back after you're not a you're you're a wild man and that's why people love you but that's also that needs to be kind of it needs to be appreciated but also manage like the chaos of your personality and how you approach things I mean you almost fucking die in the cave yeah bro yeah this is what you do that's my other drug adrenaline yeah yeah you got adrenaline yeah and the things that people are scared of you flock to it's like you want to prove that you're not scared of them and I am I'm just as scared as you are sure like skydiving I love it because it's like whoo yeah and we go yeah there's no there's no if ands or buts when you jump out of a fucking plane i'm flying planes now get my pilot's license really yeah I'm putting I've I started a little while back quit for a while but now I'm back I'm all in I'm flying and I'm loving it I was just telling you I watched that learning Skinner documentary don't don't fly shitty play that's how we lost large Skynyrd yeah they did need to get their fucking plane fixed hogs trout fucking pill head two years I come back before I'll fly up fly out here yeah man so wow that's a that's a bold move man learn how to fly that's the ultimate right that's that's that's uh bring a beer little campfire we fucking said slice him dearly you should definitely do that one of these days you should come to us till lanai with us okay you would love it man it's the craziest hunting ever it's like one of the most ethical you have to kill them to thirty thousand deer on this one I took note twenty thousand deer and three thousand let's touch that little subject for a minute about we now have to kill these animals why because there's so many people out there they're like fuck you hunters what do you why why would you want to take a life yeah but the lanai is a different example because it's an island so traveling I don't fill with deer and there's no wolves and there's no mountain lions like people have to eat them they're fucking everywhere yeah because if they don't there's gonna throw overpopulated of course yeah but I mean I think the hunting thing the anti honey thing is probably real similar to what we're talking about with psychedelic drugs it's people who haven't experienced it they don't there's always yeah they don't know what it really is yeah and they Sal OTT of them still 97% of the people in this country meat I'm one of them yeah it's a crazy number when you think about how many people get hated on for hunting that means for sure some of those people that are hating also eat meat which is one Epocrates ever crazy right I mean when you look at it like that yeah with the numbers yeah because they are there like they as they're eating their hamburger on the same breath they're telling you would appreciate you are we killing ducks yeah yeah and it's disconnections do you think vegans if a mosquito lands on do they do they slap it and kill it about that all time yeah do they kill mice that are nibbling in the corner of their house and making noise where they can't sleep they set a mousetrap house good question well they shoot do they shoot the fly with the badass new salt fucking shit are you me I'm picking the bitches up I even that I open the door I let him Bluff them in from the horseshit come on in boy they doing here flap so uh yeah I mean just a mosquito or a fly and I have the soul I went to an ashram once and the lady had ant spray out I was like we doing with that she's like all we have an ant problem here I go you got an ant problem here I go see kill them with the spray I got that's fucking crazy this is a swamp right this is a Buddhist ashram and you are spraying ant spray you're poisoning death from the sky from the sky yeah you like your fucking air warfare on these poor little beings cuz you don't like that they get too close to your garbage hey heavy it's heavy it's crazy when you when you put in perspective like that mm-hmm they don't have an answer that I doing a washer so what about all those microbiome on your body killing all that shit with no soap what are you doing what are you doing Holocaust Holocaust killing all this life-forms right right no no if ands or buts every I mean it's just a batter of what lot and the other problem is there's real evidence that somehow or another plants communicate with each other that they are so I'm sort of an if not awareness they have some sort of information exchange between each other and they change their tastes based on whether or not other ones are getting eaten it activates certain responses in the plants and they they become like really bitter and disgusting to animals so that animals don't eat them right you know and they do this with like they can have a recording you could play recording of caterpillars eating leaves next to a plant it'll change its flavor profile it excretes some sort of a chemical so the same discourages predation there's some intelligence that's just evolving right you having to it's like no we're no longer gonna exist if this happens we have to we have to evolve weather change what you talk about us becoming who we are today yeah super primates - right uh-huh and I think now we're caught in an era where the weak are still allowed to coexist with us fucking great they don't want to be weak right now but but yeah you laugh at that way it's true yeah yeah it's true yeah and I just had a baby boy and I can't wait to stand on the sidelines of the soccer games at football games and I can't wait to show up the fucking track day and I'm bringing fucking medals and trophies because my kids not getting the fucking participation ribbon he's here to win right when do we draw the line back of of you know just just because you are weaker you get a participation ribbon there's no more competition and there's no understanding of psychology you can't protect people from bad feelings like losing those that's what propels you this is what makes you better that's what we're doing so you're telling me if my kid is an awesome awesome football player and he's on the team running touchdowns he has to sit the bench because Tommy didn't get enough time to play and not only that Tommy you're his weak-ass dad who fucking secret emails the coast behind my back you mean like that shit to me what the fuck so I I'm so excited to join this new new journey of Parenthood Parenthood it's so crazy man these kids and that's not all parents though you know some parents realize how stupid it is there's parents out there just like you this is ridiculous this is a guy that's his daughter goes school with my daughter and I always gravitate towards him because got a neck tattoo yeah I immediately I'm like anybody with a neck tattoo I'll relate to this because that's a life see ya your neck tat you motherfucker we gonna be all right because we're wait I don't have a neck tat but I know how you live it so I'm with you and with you these kids were playing rough and and he looked at me goes whatever happened to like getting hurt whatever happened to like falling down learning how we should do that that hurts yeah well now learn how to fall better now learn how to not do that anymore this this thing was gonna make you slip and scuff your knee it's okay yeah like that's part of learning you can't nerf the world you can't nerf the fucking world when you nerf the world and then you empower these people that have lived in a nerfed environment that's a problem they'd haven't experienced real adversity and they're mean yeah one of the reasons why they're mean is because they're scared yeah like a lot of these these people on social media that are really mean they're the ones who are the most scared and they're the ones are the most weak for sure and the the fact that they're so vulnerable is what's leading them to lash out and try to hurt other people because they're so easy to hurt and there's damaged and that's that's literally a the living in a nerfed world but these people that you say are so weak how is that satisfying them to disable somebody that it's not they don't know what to do they're hurting and they just lash out how are they writing an email this motherfucker send you and they see this like what that's gratifying for them they're like that's not even it seems like it would be because they're just sure they're trying to hurt you they're trying to like get you but then eventually it comes back and gets them it's like they have to understand LeBron James isn't doing that no you're like no winners are out there doing that this is loser behavior yes you're lashing out at others who are doing while you're not unless just like if you ever oh the gym a problem with someone talk about LeBron like what in the NBA they don't just sit him down because the other player 22 hasn't got enough play time right no no fucker go ahead and score again okay with you right here right it's good it's good in the when we're paying to watch it on TV but when your kids in it I don't get it man but I haven't experienced yeah I don't have friends who have some fucking so excited too it's fascinating just to watch them evolve watch their little minds grow what's talking to them you know just experiencing life through these new eyes and seeing them definitely you'll be a little fighter he's a little rotten son of a bitch he sleeps with his hands up and we have this she sleeps with his hands up both hands up what are you doing and he's like flexes him out and he'll put him back and he flexes him out you doing it's so coolest at home in this little jumper and he has to he has blue frog and this red fish yeah I don't know what this red fish did to him but that motherfucker will just slide sideways and just look stank on my for you sit there stare at him 20 minutes no movement no crying just slouched already any corner pairs of this red of this red fish right and I'm like dude what are you doing it you know what I'll like I'll spin him and like play with them and then he just finds him again just has a staring contest with this fucking hilarious his practices practicing well I think that shit definitely carries on through the child it has to right past it has to it has to I mean there's only those things that people learn like well why kids scared of monsters well this is you have to be careful of predators yeah you know there's there's lessons you learn you see things are scary like why do people have like a fear of snakes oh yeah here's the last one now we got all show the perfect okay these bowties go down so smooth they do go down so smooth yeah I think for sure that some of your personality is gonna be transferred through your DNA your life lessons I can't wait man I'm so excited yeah so cool to see see him hmm and how are you gonna start training him right away so he'd never knows anything else he's in not only Joe is he not gonna easy not gonna know anything else but we're dirt biking we're wakeboarding were fucking scuba diving were every crazy thing I do he's gonna do and he's gonna be fucking launching huge air and he's gonna get around his other kids and he's just kind of think that's just what you do right this is right oh you guys don't do that right oh that's I've been doing that for five years yeah I thought was just so he won't know any different and yeah I would definitely train him in wrestling and jiu-jitsu and kickboxing absolutely absolutely and I'm gonna be the dad when he goes and beats a kid up at school I'm like what danger you fucking animal how good am is danger your son's name is this boy's name is Dax and my name is Donald and Lisa Rowe knees of his name's DAC my initials and then Sol and so he's my son danger Cerrone dachshund dangerous roni no mistake danger what are you doing in here giving beating these kids up and Sudi in the hallways fucking fist bump whatever you want boy let's go well you already have evidence now on video yes I do you need to watch this video I mean that's if if he's in there you know defending their sisters or doing every us do I'm with him yeah get you some boy what's gonna the world gonna be like just ten years he's yeah when he's think about how weird it is from ten years ago how where's he going my high school we had beepers that's right beepers remember when people had beepers that also could send text messages like what the fuck you taking it too far I had a void leave a voice message on mine you can talk about that you can call this into it but yeah I mean these kids your kids are have no idea what it is to pass a note right or call mr. mr. Rogan house I was just wondering if I could talk with Sara with that it's after nine o'clock idiot quick yeah after nine o'clock deal right yeah so what time you call Jackson a bad precedent picture taken but I think the picture taken is also taking a lot away from life like even me I get caught in and I'll go to lunch with three and my friends and two minutes into lunch we're all Instagram who's Rogan got on the show today you know yeah yeah I know it is a problem you lose a lot of your life to these fucking things a lot of it yeah and it sucks you in but it's also so awesome because so much is learned like you said these needs to be managed and you see in it like that's it right now if you want to talk about we were just discussing the different kinds of releases on the bow right whoa maybe I don't know about you like literally two seconds after I leave here I can YouTube it and I can I can you know it all I can know at all yeah that's crazy I can have experts on every single release make my own judgment and decide what I want to do you know and that's crazy nowadays you know and that's the world is so much better in the sense I think because you can do that but it takes away a lot of the bullshit people used to have do you probably wouldn't you are in school and the guy tells you I'm this this this and this yeah there's nobody a Google search other than Jimmy saying uh-huh yeah I was there yeah yeah you never knew never now you just go ahead like wait what nah man that uh yeah that's that's negative you you are not a gold medal still floating around this is a few those guys are still floating around let somehow another made it through the net and there's like the dark they came in the dark net floating around right now like kind of like skating on the boundaries of incredulity yeah there's a lot of frauds out there they're still still kind of operating fake black belts fake gold medalists fake yeah why would you want to be a fake black belt they don't know any better they just they just been lying their whole life mostly it's like the demons that you experience when you do mushrooms they got their own demons and you know maybe it was childhood motion don't feel that lie that it's just nature that's just what they do they're probably beaten as kids their parents were shit everybody lied to them why does it have to be that person why does why can't it be the rich kid was born in Beverly Hills that has everything and he lost you still a liar he still why can't he be this big of a piece of shit is then he could be but I bet a lot of those like real severe lighters they come from abuse because they have to like create a false life but you get a lot of abuse in rich households too especially like you know maybe the dad has to work 16 hours a day as a banker or something like that he's never home the mom's on drugs no one's taking care of the kids they're hanging around with a bunch of other lost kids and their school and they're all doing drugs together and fucking off and crime and all kinds of shit just to be just to have excitement in their life because they're so bored and confused and lost and lonely and they start lying too right I mean all comes from the same place where their comes from a rich kid or a poor kid it comes from your life being fucked up and you you not you not liking who you are you know I need to eat mushrooms that'll help and deal with the demons deal with the demons and then go do something go do something so that you know that you could you could experience some nerves you know and and you could you could rise to the occasion sure you know I mean and learn about yourself that you could overcome you could make mistakes and fail and then try it again and succeed and then what the the bad feelings that you get like when you're worried about losing you know in these these these fears it's because winning is so high man I've seen you win so many times are called so many of your fights and you know I look right in your eyes whenever you win and there's just like this dude's on fire right yeah you're just like there's no other I couldn't even explain you that feeling because no one can nobody can I have to do it that's but it's fuck you at times like a million who you know you know and in god it's it's the highest highs man it's just insane how how cool it feels um I've seen it like will be with you particularly like Kos right like there's something about chaos when you just crack someone then it's over and then you're walking around like you like glowing I mean my DM did yeah you did it you went through all the fucking demons and all the darkness and all the fear and all the insecurities and then he landed and then it's over and then it's just as fast as it started it's over and that's crazy so yeah that's over Mac and then it's like a four weeks from now blah blah blah fell out yeah what are you gonna do like we're gonna fucking do it again I start over yeah I start a lower and the people are like how long are you gonna fight til I'm gonna find out I don't love it anymore Joe I really am and that's I don't have an answer for anybody like to good answer the day that I wake up and I'm like nah huh what we need is medical science to catch up where they could fix everything a hundred percent right like head injuries or known injuries everything just put put people in some sort of microwave machine whether it is bring you back to a hundred percent thank you sir so then fighting becomes a matter of temporary injury rather than permanent injury and then it's a hole and then it's a whole nother ball of wax it's a whole nother ball what everyone's fighting a hundred percent healthy yeah and you also don't have to worry about like your long-term health which is like one of the big problems with fighting yeah you're like you want to armbar me and break it break see the guy who got his motherfucking off crack the last fight was it last Friday Lincoln Nebraska I didn't see it who got armboard gotten Colorado I watched the AG fight he the Brazilian guy took him down armed barred him had snapped it no didn't snap it popped it pulled it only back and had it been he said man I felt it pop I told myself Wayne losing this and he just kept kept on over it says moments like that you could just say fuck it break it because I'm going to microwave yeah I'm going right from here ambulance to the to the microwave 10 mins I'm fucking him that's possible some day maybe it's not in our lifetimes but it's possible some day and Fighting's gonna be a different thing like that was what was so impressive about John when Vitor got his arm right Vitor tears Jesus wait till II wait till II he oh man this is nasty this is right rate tab you tabs right here but before before I don't see ya before this they he he puts it behind his back and he has it fuckin bowed this guy used to train in Jackson's to the Brazilian guy on the bottom hmm yeah when John got tapped by Vitor that was so nasty I mean he was fully hyper-extended and just didn't and his arm is fucked up for a while after all right that's why he had to host The Ultimate Fighter correct he really couldn't train properly with it yeah that's that's it's gonna be a different animal in the future when people aren't worried as much about permanent damage right I hope I need it because I do a lot of yeah most damage today is permanent damage all these wild excursions I go on yes tell me about the the cave doc you wanna learn about cave diving okay so first of all cave diving is the last certification someone can get caving right in diving like you started off your open water then you move geared advanced open water get your your nitrox and you start you start learning the rules of mother nature because mother nature is never gonna take a loss she wins every time the only bitch I know that wins a hundred percent of the time right you cannot you cannot fuck with her and come out winning so when she when she wants to take you she takes you so you learn about all these different rules of the water and of the nitrogen levels that you're taking in your body any cave diving is about five years ago I got my certification in high school and I am a super cave diver man I love it I love it I love I love diving I love everything about diving I love ship diving so no days Caves you name it I love it so we're in Koza mail a couple weeks ago and one of my old you could almost call him instructor he's taught me a lot of what I know about diving today we go three or four days and somebody's in mind that we're down and goes Mel just went through some ships went through some kr like it's the coral reef just playing around down with them and then we go and do a serious die always he's getting a little bit older his mind is still very very very sharp but his motor skills don't keep up with him much anymore right and in in cave diving it uh it's very necessity that you need so we jump in this cave it's rewind twenty minutes I just kissed my girl in my new baby and she's I don't I don't really want you to go like right I don't he just I don't want to say his name but the guy you're going with I'm worried mm-hm I said what are you worried about I said I'm coming home dumb this is what I come home every time coming home I don't know so I pick up another I order another cylinder of air just fresh so I have to originally I'm going with order another cylinder air just I told her just for just first just to fucking have it right no one's ever died because they have too much air in cave diving you dive in third so if we have 300 psi we'll do a thousand psi n we'll do a thousand psi out and we have a thousand psi in case something fucking happens also in cave diving they have lines you run these in a cave they'll already have a line run a bunch of guys like me Tech divers have gone into caves discovered them they mapped them they named them and they put put lines so you can follow them in case something happens right get in and get out lines and lines in none of the lines really connect to fur like the main lines they'll have like three or four main lines down big channels of the cave those caves are huge right from an entrance to the main line usually no one has a cave you have that you have to make it what's called a jump you have to make your own own line because they just don't want someone listening on deer today to go find a cave jump in and swim down and be able to get in and out and get lost in there and also we have a Thailand incident we're fucking winning as a people so we make a jump tie off you put these direction arrows down they're called cookies right pointing out towards the direction out of the cave that way if something happens you come out when you make a jump you take your light you wrap it around your neck and then you have two hands that work on the line the guy I was with didn't follow some of our rules and in cave diving it's kind of an unwritten fact that you only worry about you I'm coming home right I'm fucking staying alive so Joe you mean I reach cave diving something were to happen I'm not going in there to get you no reason for two of us died when only ones in there can die so he tries to tie off his buoyancy fuckin he hits the roof of the cave kicks his feet spins an ALICE on this line that's supposed to be tied off which is our fucking lifeline is now wrapped around him so I swim over to him and I try to help him unhook this line and he goes into panic and panic kills everybody involved everybody involved dies the panic and something that I can't express enough so he starts fucking freaking out hitting the roof spinning silt fucking over and I just back out take about four or five big strong steps back when I grab ahold of the main line now it's silting out now and I say something silting out there's all this like sediment that ends on the bottom of these caves and you're like a little tiny room so if you pick your fin hard it kicks up like dark dust mud sediment silt you can't fucking see anything blocks it out so I back out of the silt I grabbed the line and I see him they're fucking freaking and panicking spinning and rolling around getting all caught up in this in his line and I'm like fuck why did you stay calm this was the exit I know where it is because I know where I am there's the exit he was making a jump to go down another tunnel there he is now what I just tell you about the rule that someone comes home right I broke the rule and I went in to get him I said fucking bow down so I let go of the line and I go in to get him because his light fucking is off now and I'm thinking god damn he spun up in this line his lights off did he drop his regulator is he have air is he okay soon as I go into the sill fucking lose everything man lose my way where I am my up my down I don't know where I am I'm fucking panicky now I'm panicking fucking freaking out more than any I've ever breathing hard bang hit my head on the fucking ceiling and I just closed my eyes I'm like god damn it Kevin calm the fuck down calm the fuck down calm the fuck down breathe can't see my hands in front of me I have two watches on they're glowing right those are my dog let me know my death my time everything right up to to to dive computers I check them look calm I check my light I gotta turn my light and burn burn my are pressure gauges they're glow-in-the-dark right so I charge with my light and I look at okay err check my second one okay err I know my third ones good because I haven't even opened it yet that's just just in case I breathe down I fucking think and I came see my hands in front of me and Tuesday I closed my eyes and it gives me nightmares right now just thinking about it cloudy dark can't see anything all I can see is the home of my light so I turn my light off I'm trying to think like fine just just just calm calm yourself figure this out where's where is our partner I start feeling around and he's nowhere to be found right nowhere to be found so I'm now I've call myself a little bit and I start feeling the walls I start moving around I'm trying to think where am i but I don't know because we haven't been down this channel yet so I don't visually haven't made an imprint of oh there's that there's this right kind of like a mental imprint in my mind because that's what we're doing as we're coming in landmarks right I don't have any of those I don't have any feel I don't have any touch and I'm moving around moving around what took a compass reading of the direction of the front when we've tied off at the first jump right so I know 126 degrees is the way out but in a cave they twist and they move and they're up and they're big and they're deep and they're low right they there's no like rhyme or reason how the water made the cave so it's kind of a direction I can think of the first thing comes my mind I started swimming that way now I hit a wall boom and I go down and hit a wall and I'm fucking in panic mode again I fucking swim now just are swimming and kicking and fucking going crazy I make my way out of the silt and I fucking turn on I'm back on the main line right I find the main line to the cave again which is 800 yards to the front to the door I grab a hold the main line I fucking real edenia okay now the entire behind me deeper into the cave is free it's no problem silt free I can see everything's good more I need to go is fucking self it out and blown gone completely fucking wash I I can't I couldn't see you sitting there but I can see everything behind us can't see you I have the main line but I don't have the jump line to get the fuck out so I started thinking I was looking the cave maps trying like before we went just try get a vaporizer of the direction I'm trying to remember landmarks but I can't see anything and I can't feel and I'm like fuck there was a split up here so I start I go back and back into the silt again and I started feeling around and I'm feeling and I find a hole and I'm like is that the right way is that the one I want to go down where does that one go okay maybe remind me I remember I remember that's that's not ok let's go to this next one going on the next one and now this is this is where I Scott to be I'm going but all of a sudden I'm swimming against the current and I remember when I came into this cave there was very slow current which is why the entire cave is now washed out from that point on right the current is taking us all like fuck you're swimming against the current so you're going the wrong way I somehow work that into my fucking panic mind like we're swimming into the car were swimming in the car that's all going the wrong way so I fucking turn swim back I'm back on the fucking main line again right to find the main lines clear out into the clear main line fuck fuck fuck I start like hyperventilating panicking and I'm thinking man I you fucking you piece of shit this out people died what the fuck are you right and I'm keep her mind kissing my wife I keep my kids saying I'm coming home today I'm coming home coming home so I do it again fucking venture into the fucking great unknown fucking abyss total blackout another panic another panic fucking freaked out can't find my way hey my head kicking losing air by the fucking second bro because now I'm breathing hard I'm breathing fucking irrational and I'm sucking my tanks dry right mind you I'm on air so I don't have there's no there's no answer to this after I breathed my last breath keep checking my thinking from my time look in direction time time air time fuck slow down slow down slow down DOM and pitch fucking black can't see anything trying to figure out where I'm at what I'm thinking what am i doing okay we're running out of air how much time do we have cowboy we're at 28 feet I know we're at 28 feet I could probably breathe on this for about another hour on this tank another hour so we got another hour okay we've been in here fucking 38 minutes already how what are we gonna do start trying to find my way out I can't trying to find my way out I can't now I started thinking what am I gonna do I'm not gonna drown Joe drownings like my biggest fear of my life so ever thing that's called a BC we carried on our back it's buoyancy control device that's how you that's how you control your buoyancy when you're scuba diving right it probably holds 20 big huge strong breaths so I feel that motherfucker up this is my plan Phil my BC up which throws me to the top of the cave bunk right now I'm only now I got a flip upside down have like crawl on the ceiling trying to figure out where the fuck I am how am I now I got to get out of a cave upside down and I'm thinking all right we've switched to our last bit of air how are we gonna do this cowboy what are we gonna do Phil tower BC up when I run out of air I'm now thinking in my mind how am I gonna die Joe right tell my wife tell my kid I'm not fucking I'm coming home now I got a fucking realize how am I gonna die I have a notepad that you carry in your pocket to draw on right on I'm thinking what what what are you gonna say what's your what's your letter gonna be your writing fucking death letter you're awake you're a fighter we figure this out you don't fucking find a way to quit you fucking bitch is the conversation I'm having one myself well I'm in fucking complete panic mode in complete darkness thinking that there's no this is how people die what the fuck are you doing you're gonna write a letter to your fucking kid and tell her how you how you fucked up I'm sorry daddy's not coming home so I'm fucking thinking I'm not gonna drown I'm not gonna breathe my last breath so I'm gonna breathe this b/c that I just filled up with air and I'm a fucking breathe it until the oxygen level no longer happens and I just pass out that's that's my that's what I've come to realize how I'm gonna die I'm gonna fucking just slip away and pass out keep breathing the same air until I go away and I start thinking you fucking piece of shit you you're you're giving up you're having like legitimate conversation with myself while fucking in complete panic like you're gonna quit that you're writing a letter and you're gonna fucking breathe your last air until you pass out you fucking pussy you're a fighter figured the fuck out so I'm upside down I'm crawling on the ceiling I remember when I came in we came in the big cave there's like a huge fucking crack that runs along the top turn both my watches off now at this point because they're giving off light and I killed my light I said that crack gonna fucking lead to the surface that cracks gonna fucking give us something so I just call start panicking me panicking again because I'm panicking I don't know what to do I'm sucking air and I'm fucking breathing hard and I'm hyperventilating I'm crying on something crawling on the ceiling looking for this fucking crack and goddamnit I found it I found the crack and I followed the crack and the crack got bigger and also I see fucking glow like green glow crawl crawl crawl find it try to get up my tanks are too big I can't fucking get out of the little hole I can't get out of the hole I'm fucking Big B Bink Bink fucking hitting screaming freaking out calm down count like calm down Kerry this is the way calm the fuck down reel it in reel it in we're here we made it grab control follow the croc some more opens up out boom there's the cave fucking I'm out made it you're coming home you are Wow that was the feeling meanwhile my guys out there I can't be mad at him because he panicked he grabbed a line he fucking ran out the hole he looks at me and he says so we're not diving together Regan are we I said no that was it those it and I text my girl love you baby and today was a fucking scary moment but daddy's coming home it was fucking so crazy because that was I mean I've almost died numerous times but almost dying slowly was puts it in perspective me like these guys on death row what I always thought like yeah fucking kill a murderer man that's fuck them dude knowing the time and how much time you have left that's some scary shit Joe knowing that you have two hours left how much air do you have left at the end maybe another hour probably an hour and some change but could you imagine how I had to talk to myself how I was gonna die like to me that fucked me up that fucked me up really bad look I probably had to go do some mushrooms and ask myself so the question is now because that fucked me up bad but the inner me the fighter that you do new fair at the fuck out but was I gonna write a letter I was fucking damn close to writing a letter it was crazy man is wild yeah hope I explained that good for everybody you explained it like a mother dude that is crazy yeah man and I'm gonna do it again like I'm not scared of it like that it just needs to be done better I'll run my own motherfucking line shows you how important it is like what your wife was saying yeah can't she you know she knew something she had a sense like right when people fuck up a lot or when they're just that person that just can't keep it together you gotta be real careful around those people yeah yeah fucking crazy shit man I mean that's why people kill those people in war yeah you know they just like look we can't do this yeah we had everybody killed yeah your your your panic is yeah yeah you're not hanging in there you you've become a detriment fuck dude that is one of the craziest stories I've ever heard of my life fuck I'm glad I got to share it with you let's move so as as the tapout guys did for me I'm starting a new fight series cowboy fight series man amateur and we're traveling all around the country and we're gonna be putting shows and I'm gonna try and find these new up-and-comer kids and bring them to the ranch what are you doing it on a lot of talking with antlia fight past I think wearing it on UFC fight pass nice and yeah we're gonna have probably eight undercard fights probably two local guys in that area and then we're gonna do a four-man tournament for design weight class will probably go I don't know maybe a 70 or 85 maybe 55 first and the winner of the four-man tournament gets to come live with me train get brought up I know everybody man I can make a call and get them on all the local promotions you know what I mean get them build these guys up and try and give back man and do like with the cow with the tab ball guys did for me and just really I don't know some great idea do you do you think you're going to transition into promoting or managing or anything or training when you're done I won't do any training no no I don't think one night when I round the corner in life I mean looking back Joe yeah I finally made the corner I'm looking back but I'll definitely help these dudes out man I'll figure it out him her whatever whatever it may be you know I've noticed I train people people tell me I can teach very well I just don't agree I don't know [Laughter] maybe it'll be something that would be more interesting to you when you're not competing right exactly you know what I'm hoping I'm moving into the movies don't be a movie star yeah well that sounds like fun I just uh yeah I just did evil eyes or two with Denzel Washington it was a lot of fun I had a small part number I'm with the dashnaw Brand X guys and doing a lot of stunts and having fun with that and though he's great hmm yeah great dude great dude yeah it was cool he was super cool to me super nice was fun some work um you know I worked on movie with Jay her on you know Jay oh yeah he's in that - yeah he's in that - as a cool easy fight denzel's an uber driver in and Jay fights him in a car and we cool themselves one of the greatest actress ever absolutely I agree with you I member saying you go over like some of the greatest actors that's ever lived you gotta have him on that list like you got a chance to work with one of the all-time greats and he so he's cool as the Cadillac out there and he's just you know just isn't where to be working with him it kind of was but he was real I mean on set watching Denzel and then Denzel on set it's kind of different but he um you know a lot of the lot of there's Jay oh man that's cool right it was fun man it was it was such a learning spirited that mile 20 - yeah and I just got on a new Mark Wahlberg movie so I got a small thing on that but I'm he asked me to do the fight core graft for the whole movie so yeah pumped on it man I'm excited working working working with the guys doing that this should be fun so you enjoy it love it it's cool it's just another avenue yeah you know there's something funded you know that'd be a good transition for you you know so that's kind of my plan but last night over a game of baccarat I gonna be a new racecar driver how that happened my buddy Ricky Stenhouse jr. he has a dirt track race team so January January it's called the Chili Bowl chili for it - Chili Bowl three hundred three hundred entries and you take over five days you raised you work your way up to enter the Saturday night at the Chili Bowl and you get down there there these are 400 horsepower cars you know and they're extremely weigh 400 pounder what it is I can't I don't know I don't know we were there for in two pounds right there four horsepower by they weigh 900 pounds really yeah oh my god dirt track that's insane give her video of Chili Bowl for 400 horsepower 900 pounds is insane yeah and they just shit and get right and so yeah that's it I'm gonna January I'm going to the Chili Bowl and I'm uh I'm fucking gonna give it hell wow how fun that's sounds like a good time and I said so is there like a couple warm-up days or practice or ya hear these things look at this whoa a dirt oh my god that is insane so you're just going sideways everywhere not just drinking the whole thing is like halfway drifting right it's just so there's all those people Oh myself going completely sideways around these corners ol arias so in January toast Oklahoma that's gonna be me Wow running it I can't wait it's gonna be so fun Wow though it's a good time and I said hey man we like have like I've I want to tell you just because my ego right that I'm a good racer but I don't really know if I am a first race go-karts I for you if you want to go down to the local go-kart track we'll give it hell but I've ever done that never I'm so excited you gonna practice I said I said isn't like there's some warm-up or a practice day and they said no you just you can get five laps before the race and I said that's not enough no no you need a couple hours hours days couple weeks someone to show you like where do you in the apex of the term when do I jump on the gas so what fast forward into January Kelby is gonna have five laps fuckin get it and then I'm on is there a place you can go practice I guess you can to rent a track and but I thought I was at the monster thing last night I was talking with all the drivers right and they're like no we don't practice we just race just grace to race there's no practice and I was like I was huh you don't let you just race okay so can I pick up one of these cars you all got a little owner I can get in there like yeah we got to man you show up so Chili Bowl is kind of like I guess there's 300 injuries over five days you just just like to get after it it's Christ get away so excited it seems like that would be a skill though that like yeah I weighs in the dirt like that you would have to learn how to a skill that I don't have no and they're gonna let you race with pros yeah that seems silly that seems like jumping into seems like going to Jack's right off the street slapping on some shin pads that's exactly what the fuck's happening that is so crazy are you motherfuckers in Tulsa Oklahoma in January Chili Bowl cow was coming in hot hot Sun anytime I gotta pick a number I don't know what number to pick you get a pick a number and he pick letters behind the number well just I need I need a good number followed by BMF because I definitely need that right what would be a good number for you know would it be the year of your first pro fight would it be the year your grandparents bought you the ranch who that's not a bad one these have to be weighed full year with that what's here is that I think 2011 11 BMF sounds pretty fun being a fit that sounds pretty good 11 BMF that sounds pretty good right yeah fuck yeah almost any video so you'll be able to play it here like my head just not a bad one 11 BMF is good liam 11 BMF and it's the ranch why not have it the birthday to the ranch yes accurate you know there it is there 300 I'm putting you in the wall very little control almost now control if you think you want to see me down in the pits and come out take your helmet off and get crazy she's just going down what other shit are you doing that's ridiculous you probably shouldn't be doing mounted mounted shooting on horse on horse do you put your muffs on the horse yes of course really yes stuff them down in arrears Wow yeah what kind of rifle shooting Colt 45 oh my god yeah so here's the rules you can't have more ammunition than targets are on on the field right so there's ten targets and targets so we load five shots in the each six shooter Wow right and you show you has to be a gun exchange while riding full speed shooting targets so you shoot one-handed while you hold it on with the other hand yeah I'm right no no I'm a right-handed so I run the reins on my left and I shoot with my right so this is it so on hand is where you shoot on hand off hand is when you put it over over your arm so this is often crazy some Cowboys in there right there oh look at this you run around shoot balloon yeah that is hilarious these people in the stands are to let you shoot you're just shooting black like blanks oh yeah so just the Gunpowder is burning the balloons isn't that crazy that just the blanks can do that much goddamn message there's a guy in Hollywood when I first came here in like 94 who was on a set and he didn't know that right and he thought it'd be funny to put a blank up to his head and shoot himself the head yes some people shoot themselves shoot the horse I mean you shoot your horse doing he's probably I don't want to do it anymore yeah what the fuck yeah they think that it's just noise it's not just a noise so learning learning - getting your horse training get him around gun fire and doing it's fun it's good time that's like they're practicing for some old school revival yeah it's called SAS single action shooting society and what it is and during the competitions and during the shows it's it's like they take it back and they and everyone dresses up and that's hilarious those are still to this day my all-time favorite movies like The Unforgettable on westerns are some of the greatest movies ever ever I'm with you I love them I love this up about them it's like that's a short period of United States history but that's the period where people were like fuck it let's see yeah let's see what goes on over here let's see the cross this divided a week guy yeah hey mega Diddy that's one area if I if if there was a time machine you can go back and see what it was like what if you could only go once and stay there that was it there's a one ticket ride I ain't going no no it's the best time to live ever they would all want to come here of course back with no D users you would want to go to 3,000 man how do you know hold on so now you say that but now how did how did the guy in 680 know that 2018 no you have to know like we know like if we went back to 618 so what you'd go give them a little here's this is a laptop you open up we have a thing called YouTube you don't have and you just search and that's where we live so if you want to come there I'll trade you they would trade in a heartbeat but if you like wanted to go to the future where everybody could read everybody's minds and no one that fix anymore because we're all reproduce through yeah it'd be over yeah orgasm button that's attached this helmet that you carry around with you because there's no more oxygen on earth and everybody's breathing some new gas this way better yeah I don't know man I think right now it's pretty fucking good I'm happy with today I like it so no no error you'd go to yeah no if I come back I'd go to like 1492 I think that'd be a good time so we have you like when they landed yeah Columbus and I'd be a fucking wicked pirate I think I'd make a good pirate you definitely make do a lot of homo so let's no no I mean they wasn't wrong with that okay a lot of a lot of fires forget how to be me as I know this that's distracting don't play that homie your iPad should be yeah no no no no I would bring right with the scarfs in the crazy earrings they're all gay makes sense each other that's what they were doing man that's a fact I'm not making that up fair enough yeah I think I'd go back to the got the Mongol days yeah I'd like to see Genghis Khan I'd like to see just what that would look like when they would take over a city and kill a million people in rape and pillage like yeah insane they didn't have any respect for anybody didn't live in tents that's how gangster those people are though you live in a house we fuck a bitch they didn't treat you like you were person I live in a tent with fire already lived felt tents everywhere yeah of them everywhere nomadic people so that would be your one-stop I would like to see what that was like what did you go what do you go back and then if you died you'd come back here so that'd be the second place would draw your sword yeah yeah there'll be a place where you could be pretty sure that you were gonna die good Genghis open arms welcome you into the Klan if I came back what would you have for sure lighter I got some shifter for Zippo kind of tell him about Dan Carlin's Wrath of Khan audio series he listened wait for him you give you give him a phone with a V no satellite tower so it would be dry right I would have to have some recorded tree loaded on yeah pre-loaded Chuck huh some videos and movies and stuff what would you wear you'd have to come and where would you come just in case Carly's here would you show up in like 2018 thermal optical lens glass you mean that you're like all right yeah with low if I could bring anything I would for sure be locked and loaded I want gun strapped to my hips knives fucking fully solution book if you show up with a gun to gang a con you now become Gamescom yes you did right in the dick he's not worthy you have fully automatic assault I'm on the roof the new sheriff in town like for sure and then like that was a jean-claude Van Damme time cop uh-huh yeah remember that shit they went back in time and he had a machine gun someone did they went back in time fuck people up and stole like Civil War gold that but just like the movies say I think if you fucked shit up you're growing everything yeah you might be in there just mowing people down machine gun and then you would just vanish mom what do you better sell you'd have to write probably or now that you're in this time do you are you no longer in our time yeah the time line changes now you see this guy's got fucking machine guns check this shit out the future faggot so that would be you meaning Genghis Khan and would you learn a little bit of his language you think are you just trying to go in there with your iPhone I think that the only way you would be able to communicate with them you'd have to learn this language for sure yeah that would be how hard would it be to learn much do they even know how to say Mongol language anymore I don't think they even understand what what the sounds were I think they're just guessing I don't think they'd almost have to go back grab one bring him here yeah you'd have to T have them in home teach you I don't know if they know how those people talked back then I think there's some real speculation because you'd be so smart and know so much but you couldn't communicate right yeah there's no like it's not like going to Mexico now where we kind of know all cervesa yeah well like you think that's what the same with the Mayans and that was only a thousand years ago we don't not we don't totally know how they were talking there's a lot of speculation they're still translating a lot of those ancient Mayan ruins and the exact same in Cancun that's where it like Tulum yeah to me when I wanted to know I want to cheat snitchy which is out Fremont there once you take the tour yeah yeah we had a professor take us on a tour so amazing ray and they talked about all the rituals and all the how they drink out the snow days and then they tell me that how they would cut their testicles and I was like wait what they're like yeah that's that's how the the Charmin or the the grande mass whatever the head religious guy I don't know what the midea when it comes that but they knew through they're very smart right the new of astrology and I knew when eclipses and what were coming so he would wait for the Eclipse to come knowing knowing that three minutes later that's gonna just go ahead and pass but all the people that were with him had no idea they didn't know right they had no idea of that he was gonna stop they thought they had done something wrong the gods were punishing them with darkness so when the darkness comes he like cuts himself and offers his blood to the to the gods Moon Sun comes back out hit ball blood all of all blood got some precious blood precious blood and out and at that moment I was like so wait a minute you were just tricking these people I've been tricked my whole life I go to fucking church and I've been tricked my entire life like you just tell these people that don't know enough and you knew the real but you told them it wasn't wait a minute what's going on here I sat back and thought and I was like you probably had to do what you got to do to control those people back then goddamn savages yeah show them a little balls away so what about today we got it look I'm controlling the Sun they covered it with the moon bitch now ever there was like oh my god you brought light back yeah otherwise no everything have any of machine gun you got a machine gun too bitch but I only have three rounds so you couldn't do I couldn't get up there and really you can't really unless you came armed up but how long would those bullets last because there's no way you're making a new bullet yeah everybody has to see it too because they're not gonna believe you have to shoot everybody and if you shoot a machine gun back to the Mayans what are the guns I'm playing with the day look like mmm yeah no kidding right yeah you'd fuck shit up talks you know for thousands of years that's the thing about guns though they get a little better over time but you didn't have a gun from ten years ago and it's state of the art but I believe I believe those gone ten years ago hundred years ago are built better than the shit ones today then the shit ones yeah but they still make real good guns today too sure but that's the thing the thing is like it's weird the technology of guns is sort of in like like you don't need it like with bows one of the things about compound bows is people a lot of people want to know the new models every year yeah because they get better sure but they don't really guns don't get that much better like a gun from ten years ago is still a badass gun well I have a bunch of hundred rifles right mm-hmm the Henry rifle from nine from years all-american made from years ago to the same gun they say now it's the same gun yeah yeah they nailed it Neil got it got it yeah but yes I wonder how much innovation is how much room for it until we start doing later yeah different you know they got they got a they got a really crazy about lasers like Star Wars type shit how come I could see him how come I could see him because there's clearly fall going around don't you see moving too slow the lightsaber they hit the thing so slow but what's there's so much faster than lasers you see maybe it's that long of a shot maybe they're bullet is that long I think a late Oh like a flying lightsaber yeah we're sending big laser aim right okay no you hit you but it just keeps going right I didn't think about it that way like you're shooting like like crossbow bolts of lasers yes the burning hot as a laser hot it's gotta be there's a cold but there are cold lasers I had a bulging disc once and I went to this therapist they put cold laser on it I don't know but I like this idea three more times this weekend we get you in you just kept doing it yeah I don't think it really worked but but the cold bursts I think I love the laser burst if it was like that like flying lightsabers holy shit yes I think I think the bullets were just huge he let off the trigger still too slow see if you can find like a scene from Star Wars one with a shooting at each other those bitches it's slower than an arrow like they're not moving that fast like if you try to watch an arrow coming from a compound bow you know in order to follow so you couldn't catch it from yeah no chance no chance no chance no 280 feet a second no chance and catching shit but that those those bolts from those laser guns look slower than that and you're probably right you wouldn't knew the new laser you wouldn't there's no way you see it you wouldn't see shit but that's just theatrical for a movies need to see it coming but it just makes me feel like they think I'm an asshole so when you when you take this time travel so if you could go forward or back you'd go back 100% I would too yeah I would too well I'm a human I don't think there's a good future for humans I think we're gonna be something different so you think if you shoot forward you might be the only one in there yeah there might be no more people everybody's an entire cage getting probed oh for sure that you're gonna test you I can't believe we found one of these what it's like the rate has Manian tiger or something like that like holy fuck lock it up look the video of the last Tasmanian tiger huh Jamie see if you can find a video of the the last Tasmanian tiger died in the zoo I want to say in like 1930 which interesting is they think they're still alive but Australia is so big Australia's as big as the United States there it is that's a tasmanian tiger that was the lab I just bought stripes it's a marsupial predator it's the last like real mammal predator or marsupial predator that lived in Australia that's what it was like it was like a crazy dog looking thing but they found look at that the mouth open picture of it look at that fucking mouth on that thing that is crazy but there are people that are real reasonable people that believe that there's still a few of those that exist in the wild there's been enough sightings of these things that they think that uh what is the actual name of that thing it's got a crazy name sigh saline right how does it spell th why CA Li ne mmm sila seen whatever it is that would be us being one of those fucking cages the last person just wandering around looking around stupid all the robots are all so if you could bring one person mmm would you bring a best friend over you bring a female counter bring a check bro go honey right oh you got it yeah I'm with you because you want to bring your friend like bro yeah but I don't want to be the last guy in a cave in China yeah what thousand pussy no no no no yeah that would be yeah yeah what if I was a pirate didn't guess it wouldn't be okay what was the gay cowboy movie was that movie Brokeback yeah we ain't going there and hell we ain't going there we are a little too intense bro this fierce that shall not be conquered no disrespect to the gay friends out there listening the cheers to you to you hmm I would definitely go in the past just to see what it was like in ancient Egypt or ancient Rome I mean I just got back from Italy right and we were we checked out Pompeii of course you know and you're wandering around where all these people died almost instantly from volcanic ash 20 feet high and you see there you saw like there right the way and you can see there mm-hmm yeah there's one where they found recently where dude got hit in the head by a flying Boulder you just see his skeleton and a giant rock where his head would be it's a way to go yeah me I got nothing boom done blackness DMT world DMT there we go you think maybe there is look at that see not kinda got him Oh got it look at the article could says fuck Pompeii pull fuck this man in particular man was blowing from the yep big chunks of rock that got spewed out of this volcano Wow yeah the whole thing's crazy like when you're when you're wandering around Pompeii and just realize like he looks like he's face forward got hit in the mug right like he saw right yeah he got yeah it's true I didn't even write that he wasn't running oh look at that one man that is fucked is that just volcanic ash notification just preserved with volcanic ash look at its teeth that is insane and it's spooky I'm deaf this this guy is coming on my next trip for sure yeah fuck that is the way to go volcanoes man yeah I have a friend who goes to the big island every year for Thanksgiving and I'm like you going back it's like fuck yeah I'm like you're crazy you're going by the things on fire on fire whatever it splits in half and sprays out like it's it's taken over then the gods we made the gods mad yeah Pele is pissed pissed well what area did you do you think you go to the Wild West where'd you go no I was I rounded towards pirates but then you super a whip shot me back so yeah we'd probably be how about Lewis and Clark if you could go on a Lewis and Clark expedition how would that be make your way across the unknown no one knew what the fuck I was out there what the fuck just taking a chance try to walk across the United States I mean that's that's that's almost saying the same error I want to go when Columbus was trying to like you know what let's just say lacrosse is Flat Earth yeah they never wouldn't fly now we're back in the flat yeah some people we discovered it wasn't flat there now we're back to fight and I have this arguing people I said while doing the pilot school that I mean like you have to keep adjusting for the curvature of the earth no no no it's not real it's not real no the world's flattest without a spot like that TV it's just a lack of education it's it's an interesting thing too because it shows you how distracted people are but that they want to argue about something that's already been figured in the videos and the the literature that people come up with for these is insane again Google fad earth you want by the time the earth by the time it's done you're like goddamn it might be flat he had a lot of good points there yeah he's not sitting across from Neil deGrasse Tyson cuz if he was Neil deGrasse Tyson be like hold on hold on that's not how it works hold on that's wrong hold on this is why we know that's incorrect see I don't have I don't have the knowledge good to be able to check this girl to constantly readjust for the curvature of the earth I know that but when you listen one fact and then the rest of their life and then and then I'm like the crazy ones the water yeah yeah good water you know water us and stay on a curve yes it does yes does gravity it's called the oceans yeah and and if gravity's not real where the fuck do you think waves come from bitch dude and what they say there's a glacier all around holding yes an ice wall around the outside edge and then the government protects the ice well why why would they why okay this is just me I'm I'm nobody I'm just joking an article why would NASA and the government spend millions and billions trillions right to protect the fact that it's around Earth when it's flat to me I would say oh we live on a flat earth this is where it gets even stupider because like how it affect my day they're trying to protect us from the truth or shield the truth from us that we live an incredible special environment we live in the firmament that's protected by a dull and dome the Creator is real and that all the elite powers want to keep this information from you it's basically people that don't have an education that are failures that use all their energy missplay to make these videos that don't make any sense they figured it out they make sense to me like because anyone making a video where no one's interrupting you no one's telling you you're incorrect right you're loud just continue to watch thank bullshit things over and over and over again unchecked and so if you listeners then they use big words they sound smooth they have you know the droids behind oh and charts yeah like clearly the picture shows I definitely don't have degrees there ain't nobody with a degree out there that's telling you there's a nice wall I don't know man you can get some pretty shoddy degrees lately well there was an article recently about schizophrenia and I think anybody that thinks is really in the i'ts wall and they have a degree they should probably go to a doctor they're probably on some sort of medication and something's wrong there's some sort of a the levels are off really there's an ice wall around a plate there seems like a plate so are they just pumping they're just pumping oxygen in or our natural habitat creates it and they believe that that's good question they don't believe in gravity so I don't know what they believe in they think what happens when we send rockets into hits the Dasara fake bro satellites are fake you know what else is fake dinosaurs no they don't believe in dinosaurs but you want to know it's really we just saw the mummy from the volcanic yeah right is he fake he's real it might be fake a picture on Google the dude who got hit in the head with the rock is real as fuck real as fuck so the dinosaurs I ain't got hit by a rock he's fake could be I wasn't there he's exactly goes a long time yeah especially with the Ursuline 6000 years old yeah he have one thing on their side and this is the one thing on their on their side this is one of the reasons why they make this argument it's because when dinosaur bones were first discovered when they were first discovered there was a whole race to find dinosaur bones and there was a lot of fuckery there was a bunch of people that were faking things and piecing things together didn't work and and hiding bones and saying they found them they were just trying to make a name for themselves but that's just greedy human nature in the face of an actual real discovery that's very valuable that discovery was that that they're dinosaurs that there was a gigantic breed of lizards that roam the earth millions of years ago yeah and so you're oh that's just propaganda so you're saying in in Colorado on the side of the mountain by Red Rocks they have a hole closed off section where there are just two nested ovations yeah and huge giant feet print in there in the rock that you can go up a culture different probably four or five different species of badass lizards my friend John he's he knows a dude who owns a ranch in Montana and they found a t-rex on this guy's ranch they pulled the t-rex out of this guy's ranch they found it in the ground and they gave him a fuckload of money for it I was like if they find some sort of discovery like that that's worth a million dollar has to be yeah it has to but that's fake no that's what I'm saying they found this one thing that was poking up and he brought in these Jiali archaeologists what would they be do you sell all but a tomb you tell me you wouldn't have a t-rex tooth hanging or not oh yeah keep one tooth one kills the person who searches for dinosaur bones like you have a bear tooth hanging I have a fucking t-rex tooth there's an archaeologist right but I was thinking archaeology being human history no our biology is what your wife daily sounds that's what they do because they're always digging up old shit yeah so they called it a paleontologist the paleontologists start cleaning off whatever this was and then he's like holy fucked he's like this is a goddamn t-rex apparently it's a lot of it you know sometimes it's like you only finally come home yeah they found a lot of shit I would like to see that man if I could go back one I'm sure a support so now - I'd like to see that too now we're going all the way better yeah that's that's Colorado right there that is fucking insane insane so what the fuck that is insane yeah do you know how much time that would take to to falsify that like going out with desert here so you got a brainwash five people and tell them what we're gonna do is we're gonna ship this rock out because we got a fucking fake a bunch of people have you seen this in person yeah I've been there walk out you crawl over it he's like well see a little gate right there if you back out a little bit tail gate but that's just a little gate I mean that's right there in Colorado Wow right by Red Rock yeah exactly it's right there it's hard to book a gig in Red Rocks man they're booked up to like two thousand twenty one twenty two you can do a live show fucking epic let's try but I can only get like Tuesday nights I know what to say you know what Tuesday nights better than never never no night yeah fucking awesome so the the people don't believe they're Earth is for the believe the earth is flat not round they don't believe in dinosaurs they don't believe in nuclear weapons either Wow that's the other one nuclear weapons are a hoax hoax yeah only a few people don't believe Australia's a hoax and a lot of people say that's disinformation to discredit solar where there's been if planes fly upside down and shit and that's all upside down where are the Australians coming from because Kyle notes in Australia right now I could probably call him he's probably a government agent bro yeah careful shit any phone call you make to have this just go straight to the Illuminati you know damn I call it Kyle Kyle are you gonna shut yeah bro yeah you gotta be real careful yeah what does he do is he retired now he's coming back he's trying to come back really well the problem is he didn't fight his UFC career out uh when he retired so they still have him under contro under contract - how many more fights don't know I haven't get into that so he wanted a retirement fight somewhere else I think he just want to retire but now he's got the itch again because it comes says I can't fuck it I'll come back through maybe whatever and they're like no you come back with us or you don't come back at all contracts contract agreements mmm tricky world we live in and I figure if he was a government agent he could sweep that under the rug right yeah pretend to be too obvious it's part of the cover the part of the cover is he got him locked in the contract so he becomes one of the regular working man he's working man they could say to you damn standard goddamn contract and you're like you're one of us Kyle meanwhile he's wearing a wire damn yeah no damn you Kyle is the earth flat Kyle it's definitely not in the water that's a water world anti-doping agency nor the the Australian side the water water might know this was water the waters upside down by your mom your mother yeah yeah they're a different breed of human over there God they just they evolved for honey cause a prisoner's yeah we just thought what a great idea bring them to the best place on earth and drop them yeah so yeah but this stupid yes wait I don't have that I'm not getting to death oh you just dropped me on a super badass island yeah it's bigger than the one you're on bigger than when you're on way better weather way better weather gorgeous and then they dropped all these prisoners off and they started like crazy hierarchy and the ones that didn't really make it just way into the bush yeah then they're still there today and then there's the Aborigines who are already there and then on top of that hot chicks I don't know what they did they grow them hot out there in Australia something about the the prisoner genes but the wild prisoner genetics Oh something about that wild fucking criminal gene well most of the while criminal dreams are our the are the crazy alpha male guys made guys out there like that the weaker 2018 liberals are saying well you can't do that yeah control going on today can't do that so you're going Australia yeah use the word faggot users faggot damn it's one of the last words the sort of um I got in trouble with the UFC for saying faggot I'm not allowed to say it anymore well you already just did I know okay because somebody it you're just making the noise yeah this is this is like a this is like a shit we're in a bubble okay so the day it's Vegas I'm drinking all night they had me do this show at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning to reflect the fight it was me and um a CM Punk and I'm reflecting the fight that DC had with Anderson Silva who I respect appreciate great dude I didn't like the way DC fought that fight so when somebody asks you guys if anyone out there like a fucking faggot and held him you know he didn't fight to win right well that was completely out of context I didn't mean that like I didn't mean like he was a homosexual I just say faggot like like you're a bitch like you're a punk so I explained myself UFC makes me put on this rainbow shirt and tell them no shirt rainbow Oh Oh rainbow they made you put on a rainbow show sure the PR team and apologized and you know because I seems homophobic you know I have I have all the all the the gay activists rights coming after me now they're wanting money how strange is that they want money from me because I offended on it I just don't I don't I did have to do it I did donate so anyways I try to get on and explain myself as admit I didn't call him a faggot like a faggot I called him a faggot like a bitch and that backfired big time yeah and I I mean that's just how I talk right like if I called you a punk bitch faggot that's just me I just when I say I don't mean it in any other way other than that but the thing is here's the thing right I don't mean maybe a whole phobias bad right but our words are words bad like what if you feel the same way like is it a real issue then I have to pee so bad good god P you got to pick your beer alright yeah I'm three in good luck I think all words are dependent upon the context and your intent like what do you what do you mean if you say to someone like come on bitch like in there your friend that it's fun but if you say to someone come on bitch and then you hate them those exact same words are taking on a totally different meaning and that's the same thing with every word except the N word then where it's like it's so toxic you can't even use it joking around and you definitely can't use it the way you could say almost any other word so like well I had a bit that I was trying out for a while but I had abandoned it where I was like the N words one word that you can't even call yourself like you can't even say god I'm such an N word because people get fucking mad at you you can't even say it but if you're but here's the catch if you're a black guy you could toss that shit around like a beach ball at a concert and it's fine and if you're a black girl you could use it as well although a little more sparingly please great they can't use the same amount black girls like tend to use it just a little bit more leniently but they could do whatever they want with that word it's one of the more fascinating words I think in human history in terms of like its its its impact what it means and how it can ruin your career like didn't that one congressman have to resign because uh Sasha Baron Cohen had him yelling out the n-word right what was he was just because of that but that probably was on the list of what was he erupted with what did he did was he representing reskin George amazing future what's up with that commode you got in there I think does everything yeah does everything she's hot water up your asshole oh it's warm when you sit down it's wonderful heated yeah you would fit in great with the Pirates if you said guys huh you trying to kill me bro come come try my commode out gives us a little hot a shower walk you're not homophobic I know you know but it's it's one of those things where if you say it I guess if you're a gay person and you hear someone say you'd be really upset like they're being homophobic the problem is like we had this either one bitch is not good enough in certain situation they're trying to get that one to remember w milk W kamau Bell wouldn't say he says he doesn't say bitch anymore I'm like all right dude you're self censoring the limiting language I did this podcast woof man I'm serious and he tells me that he and I'm not a homophobic at all I just caught me off guard did not I didn't how to take it when he told me that he experiments he didn't kind of know if he liked boys or girls and I was like oh jason Ellis yeah okay yeah and I was like what like you don't know what you like yeah I've been to couple parties you know and I just go both ways and we just have groups of people and sometimes it'd be groups of guys and I was just scratching my head and like huh okay I didn't know how to I did not take that and if you don't expect it I've known him for years years they dropped this ball on me and I was like man uh I don't I didn't know how to take it it was just it caught me off guard it was weird Brown he's like what do you think you think like I like girls but I also like or I thought I liked guys what I wanted to say and what I said what you would ever think you know it's like what you want to say I wanted to say man no offense but man you put a dick in your mouth and you are a fag so now you change them I understand that wanted to say the inner me uist wine say and I just looked at him like fuck I what like I was just so blown back by it but why is that shocking if people are definitely gay it's not shocking because you didn't expect I didn't expect it yeah but it's not shocking someone's gay yeah it's like there's a lot of gay people nothing wrong with it I don't care at all nor do I but when you don't expect someone to be gay and then you're like whoa because then you thought that he was like you yes like you and I we're just a couple of straight guys hanging out for meanwhile he meanwhile he was not he is the one thing that is odd with me with people that say things like that is that they go sometimes sometimes I like guys sometimes I like girls like I couldn't imagine that what would that that would be likely you're not sure you're not sure semi like what do you mean I'm not like straight sometimes you're not like Joe no matter what every time I go to baskin-robbins I get vanilla like that yeah that's what I'm going with strawberry you know I dabble in there but if you brought me back vanilla you know I'm gonna like that you know it's not like yet right I mean there's people that do look they're just water different there's nothing wrong with it as long as he's not trying to fuck you but why would that be a problem all setting will be a problem if you don't want to fuck him true to me that makes you realize what it's like to be a girl in the most insignificant of ways because with a girl it's obviously most more dangerous because guys are bigger than you and they're and actually hold you down and fuck you but when when you're around gay guys I used to work out of the gate gym when I was doing Newsradio worked at Gold's Gym and coal and ice to describe it I was a tasty little morsel in a big case too just it was the closest gym to the studio it's a great gym but it was filled with aggressive gay guys that had like the lessons they had those scrunchie socks like fucking they were in a music video from the 1980s like their Flashdance socks these guys like timberlands died like super tan and roided-up and just hitting on each other left and right with leather vests on us I mean it was crazy it's such a crazy scene and when you go there you realize that these guys are let their like leering at you they're not looking at you like a guy go what's up man how you doing down there use the triceps you know no it wasn't that they be looking at you if you walked into an all-female lesbian super smoke show gym that's how you'd be looking all them like oh yeah but I guess if you want me to you oh yes all lesbian feet because all lesbian gym they probably look like Tom Arnold no better in my fantasy that I'm in their Hall like superhot fitness models like in their working out if there were legit lesbians they'd be like the fuck you looking at they're saying then you would be the perpetrator you'd be feeling like the guys look at you and you're like what the fuck you looking at yeah I mean the real thing is I feel like gay and straight people everybody can get along fine as long as everyone's on the same page right and as long as they're not trying to fuck you if you don't want it and you're not trying to fuck them if they don't want it like if you're not trying to fuck these lesbians because you you you respect the fact the only like girls that's all great and the gay guys aren't trying to fuck you but then we can tell by looking at someone can we get mad at the double standard are you saying hey these gay guys they say sometimes what about these girls they're like well I sometimes like girls and sometimes I like guys and girls and then you're like yeah that sounds like a pretty good idea it does sound like a good idea and I think we should shut the fuck up about that otherwise they're gonna get insecure they gotta stop that practice let them keep going and have a good time but also my god oh my god my girls hey Joe you want to come on the guy tribute actually we're hip no no I don't I don't know Hippocrates yeah but there's something about God for straight guys the idea of a guy fucking you or making you suck his dick is the most horrific thing it'd be right next to cave diving experience for me the nightmares would be but but I have no zero ill-will towards them and I don't have any problem with them in any way in society in any way shape or form I'm not even remotely homophobic I like hate people sure but there's a reality that gay dudes are dudes and dudes are kind of gross and they will try to fuck you you know and that's the one thing I had a friend of mine who is a he was a wardrobe guy and he's a gay guy and he was always telling me about these straight dudes that he would he would lure her in and turn them I get him suck his dick we marry I see my rest that goes tell stories about that about about college how the gay guys would fuck the football players and I'm like wait the big bad football college guys are getting what yeah you didn't same same day he's down that's theirs theirs they love it they love the turn just like just like a guy would love to turn or less blood that would be a mission wouldn't it yeah I used to have a joke about that that guys believe in gay guys like I believe in gay guys but I don't really believe in lesbians I think they think they're lesbians that's just cuz they ain't got a hold of that thank God they got me like yeah yeah I know she'd think she's a lesbian let me fuck her a couple times to be nice to her like I can eat pussy way better than another girl I she she's no way and I brought the dig not only nice the dead the dead yes so men don't necessarily totally believe in lesbians but they've 100% believe in gay dudes then why why don't butch girls act more like super I mean they do they cut their hair and they were some of them do but the gay guys all got to snap in the dress I know there's some fucking like beefy bodybuilder gay dudes that look like straight guys yeah you can't tell ya do they slap your ass and Jim tell you good side whoa oh no I want to get in here after you stop right there it's like you should be a way to tell like they have different markings you know birds like oh that's a female its female bird see those extra feathers but what if it's a transgender now now you don't know what what if it's wearing female feathers but who that's an odd one right because that's one they're like we now you at work you have children so how do you feel about if your little girl has to go to the bathroom but there's a guy girl in there well that what draws the line I would hope that it would wouldn't either way like if your son is going to the bathroom you have some pedophile child molester that preys on boys and he has to be a guy and he's in that bathroom it has nothing to do with your your sexual orientation has to do with you being a predator and a piece of shit sure but that could happen okay they're straight people just as easily is it happened for gay people diseases have them for trans people it it's it's someone who's willing to prey on smaller people that are vulnerable I was just I wasn't even going there's a lot of like trans people that would be more than happy to be really friendly to your daughter and it would be an issue at all she pulls out a wiener in peace in your dentistry and your daughter's like and your daughter's like what the hell dad right but what if you had a girl dude who became a transgender girl she's big tits but she wanted to keep her dick yeah and where do where she go she's hurt high heels right now today where she go which bathroom shoes I don't know I I want to say I want to say she's got she's got the equipment right she's got the equipment the full equipment full equipment for for the male from now but just tits like his perm example go to Bailey J's Twitter page I'm just saying that that I think that would worry she feels a woman but she was born a dick yeah but she has a dick but she's asked look Bailey J is my favorite example I hope she doesn't mind me using her because she's a transgender girl that like is as much a girl as you could possibly get while still having a dick like see look at that's it right that confuse the fuck out of you right yeah hey what's going on here now go to the media her media page they kill her no I've no do they like genre I mean message she pulls her groan out this is the thing like she's got a giant dick so she's got these big tits and then hey there you go oh man yeah so where's she peeing you know I'm cool with her going to the girls room and what yeah I mean just she's gonna probably squat so long she's gonna stand there with her pants down just hosing the wall letting everybody so do you feel I mean if she went to the men's room that would cause more of a conflict yeah you imagine could you imagine so much safety you're saying let her go into the female yeah not just for a safety but just like who she identifies with look it's a weird thing right because a trans person is do you go into the family room you go in the family bathroom in between that's probably yeah this is safe bet ironic she's anti-itch I'm gonna make a family with what there's going on that's so confusing that is Sofia how does that have it pregnant yeah I mean yeah but tooten maybe you know your wave machines you can also change in gender changer that would be a way where transgender people probably the most happy where they didn't have to like hormonal II become a woman and through surgery and throw up but instead they just actually turn you into a woman my god you done oh you wanna be a girl being and maybe go back well if that's the kit yeah if you Kiko there and back where do I sign up yeah yeah yeah cuz I'm going I'm gonna go check this out see what it's like for a couple days yeah week go to Vegas yeah what a couple dudes bang yeah yeah now that's another where it's weird now it's weird it's weird again because you still have that memory when you back hmm tell my friends like dude I wanted a is it guys still taste it's always in the back you bro yeah so yeah that would be a ever giant issue [Music] so yeah you say you would try it then you had to have the memory of trying it yeah you deaf son in the middle you could maybe pass that you were a girl maybe but one of the guys trying to fuck you'd be like hey no dude no no but he's like but you're a girl would you do a random or do you think you'd do a friend of yours [Laughter] shit let's go not only would I do a rant about to wear a mask like fucking eyes wide shut no no because you as a girl you wouldn't look like you as a girl Brian when you owe me like hotter hotter kind of curly hair you had this goddamn imagine if you zapped over to the female and you were just right precious yeah they're like oh you here you go be a real problem yeah yeah look yeah so they made you wear a rainbow shirt yeah I'm sure they sold it to you about how gay people took over the rainbow I'm like it's there as a rainbow used to be in leprechauns pots of gold no not anymore not anymore they took that shit over they own I don't know I don't fully understand I'm sure someone will comment on your you paid YouTube page here and tell you why that took it over why why why the rainbow well it's just beautiful everybody could fit along its beautiful colors their flamboyant they're like a lot of colors put all those colors together like yay everyone's getting along but all the colors and flamboyant no can you say all know this bears right there has to be yes yeah cuz some of the guys still like yeah did you guys shit God shit but fuck yeah fine nothing wrong with that but the words is what kills them yeah an F word don't say it don't say Donald Cerrone dollar I know you had please please donation here it's one of those words as growing up as kids it didn't really mean a gay person like Louie CK had a whole bit about it it didn't mean you you didn't but we're supposed to evolve our I don't mean it like that it's me you don't mean this is a gay person bitch I don't mean you're a female dog I mean you're
