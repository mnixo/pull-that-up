do you think of salt lamps real do you think that thing does anything I don't know how much you'd need Hey well it keeps it's got a hat on it yeah so it's not being taken too seriously that's actually a big one you get a lot smaller than not don't ya yeah I saw that one that was the biggest one you can find on Amazon about that yeah cuz I'm a glutton big things big hot rocks yeah why not I'm like I want a big one do it it's very uh very flashy do you think that does anything no I don't know good question it's um was it just lets the the air often just breathing in the natural salt Sonya helps with the sleep as well how is it doing that that's just but by being in the room hmm maybe I should have married well isn't the light as well as a light off the heat in the light sets off the air I believe so it sounds like horse shit could be a little B yeah it looks good though right so you asked me before if if you were the first Welshman yes I think you are is that the cage Amy do you know if that's the case somebody might have snuck in and didn't tell us there we go yeah what is the thing that you brought I for I found the first washed person I've got a keeping try to keep this like a Fisher I've got to bring a Welsh dragon for you a Welsh drought Welsh dragon so there's aa flag in in Wales goes back a long time ago since we were like protecting ourselves and pride wow it's cool really know the history but there we go so this is a classic Welsh dragon Welsh dragon yeah his name like one of the coolest flags in the world you just got this big big raging dragon on a flag though this Brits off off on the first watch but God hath gotta bring you where yeah the red dragon look at it right there there's some images there we go yeah have you been to Wales before no no no how badass is it yeah beautiful it is a good place lots of mountains right on the coast there as well of course forests lakes good for training that's where I do all my train yeah yeah hardcore elements speaking of train ash tell really what you've done so I've recently only five months ago now five and a half months came back from achieving my third world first record in walking the entire length of the Yangtze River in China this was the third longest river in the world the longest to run through a single nation it's 4,000 miles it took 350 two days and it's from the Tibetan Plateau in the west of China as you're talking five thousand one hundred meters above sea level which is equivalent to Everest base camp and and yeah four thousand miles later three hundred fifty two days you end up near the near Shanghai where it pours out into the East China Sea you know what I thought when I heard that you did this I thought two things one I thought this guy's insane like what kind of willpower does it take to walk and hike four thousand plus miles but the other thing I thought is this kind of validates a lot of the ideas that people have always had about human beings migrating from Africa and through Siberia and do the Bering Strait like yes you can do that what you did what you did is not dissimilar you know that's it yeah you got trails all over the world and you're just doing it for a world record imagine if you're doing it because you're trying to stay alive to keep your family alive yeah yeah I'll tell you what yeah we would have had oh there's so much so much history in journeys that mankind kind of taken Wow I read an uh Safian no it's great really just stopped her but that's just mind-boggling with the numbers you know he's right back whoa whoa but um yes of the source of the Yangtze it was actually only discovered in 2009 the true and scientific source rizzoli yeah that gives us we have to do - it took over two years of planning so it was a case of working heavily in China finding out whether this had ever been done before it talked we had to get different teams involved globally and then we discovered that I was always I was always preparing to go from the traditional source which is most famous for for the source of the Yangtze be you actually be in there but then we only discovered about year into the planet that actually there's a true and scientific source found by the same guy who mapped the traditional source yet he partnered up with NASA used all the satellite technology was able to correct as wrong it's slightly longer than the traditional source and that was it when I write got to be the Chu in scientific source how much it's probably only a distance of 20 to 30 miles which that's only really a day's trek but it was more close to Tibet was more south southwest of China so it was closer to the Tibetan border which means it's a little bit more sensitive so it was tougher to go from from the true in scientific source for sure but it's the longer one if you're gonna walk that distance you've gotta do it the proper way yeah I agree with you I'm glad you think that way but obviously a person that's willing to walk 4,000 miles would think that way 20 miles if you skipped on 20 miles and ever was like wow you did a pretty good job actually Mike over here just did the whole thing he's the real one well that's how that happened towards the end as well so coming up near Shanghai there's an official point of where the Yangtze pulls into the East China Sea and they're like you know you only have to go to this this point I'm like no I'm walking to where the land ends so that took me an extra only an extra couple of days but Kim I didn't finish inside we didn't quite make it did yeah you were we didn't quite make it so I wasn't walking Ealing like when you know you only have two days left um well we were hit by storm storm nickimja so it was one of the biggest storms they've had in the past 30 years and not put me in to hide and you know it's a shelter up after everything that I faced over 350 days you know and that stopped me only a couple of days before I crossed into the East China Sea before the finish but at that point it's almost I visualized the completion over and over again in my head I played it so many times of what it would be like what it would feel like it's you know everything to to cross the finish line that almost when that day happened and I did cross the finish line I almost over visualized I didn't feel anything it's just like well so it's about damn time you know Wow yeah and I believe you know the law of attraction visualization I've always been a big believer in that and same with Mongolia and Madagascar which might were my previous expeditions I almost lost my life on both of those trips but that sound that I'm suffering I'm just constantly visualizing you know I was focusing on recovering getting better visualizing the finish keep getting up keep pushing on I want to get to that get to those but I want to I want to ask you when you decide to plan this trip yeah so how much had you learned from the first two crazy trips that you had and how did you calculate like how much food you're gonna need where you're gonna meet neat pit stops where you're gonna be able to like how did you do it so with that we're always looking for communities along along Route you know it's a community there's food and so and actually that brings me back to the traditional and then the true scientific source if we went from the traditional we'd go maybe one week or one and a half weeks without coming across any locals so we'd have to carry a week and a half worth of Russian packs in our backpack but that's true in scientific sauce centers back I think it was two or three weeks we couldn't find any community along the way by satellite and via the people that we were there are my logistics managers so these need to carry craziest way to try to visit people yeah find them through satellite as you're trekking through a forest yeah and then try to get food that's it and we're always maximizing as well so we're saying okay that's three weeks so let's carry food for three and a half or four weeks because if that communities now empty or abandoned then we're out of food what what are you carrying for food I would carry Russian packs so and the Russian packs were pretty good we had like chicken tikka masala spaghetti bolognaise carbonara and each Russian pack was around eight hundred kilocalories and are you using our car are these dehydrated yeah that's good so you just boil the water pour it in there you wait about 15 minutes like a mountain house like that kind of yeah yeah similar that's it so you must be so looking forward to regular food by the time that's over oh what's the first thing you ate you know the one that I was protein the one I was craving was just protein so I was thinking of peanut butter sinking cheese on toast because it's just mostly carbohydrate like chicken as well as a mean thing I was just craving all of this big time I don't know what the first thing I was your body knows what you need exactly yeah you've got to listen to your body gonna listen it's hard to listen I mean it's hard to know well I don't not really sure what I hear yeah you know yet craving sometimes I'm craving ice creams that's what I'm supposed to listen to some ice cream yeah exactly yeah yeah just listen your cravings yeah yeah and I think ya know you I think almost listening to you've got to be stripped of all the all of the protein and whatnot running for you you body currently how many I think if you full mm-hmm you crave an ice cream you know if you feel you want a dessert but I think if you're now at the point I'm not starvation but if you're really hungry and you know what's good what's not good you I think your body gives a good tale sign of what you can at the last month of mission Yangtze I was really bad I was coming across cities every day because you can imagine like the towards Shanghai you coming across cities you come across towns communities and so I was just craving protein I was craving fats and a lot the time for about last month I was just eating really unhealthy just get in starting you know there was fast food chains along the way KFC you know that's really yes I was out of the white the wilderness was like six months worth once I finished the first half it was gradual for then another two or three months but the last three months you're going from city after city all really built at high population there and I found that my body was Krause I was listening to my body scraping fats craving protein and yeah you're right it did get ridiculous I was going to these you know fast food and like that the translation I could speak Chinese a little bit I was just kind of I could get by but say Chinese like which dialect oh there's over a hundred dialects yeah so that's where it got difficult so even it was nails really difficult Mandarin would you speak your basic Mandarin business yeah enough to just about get by but I skipped all of the basics and went straight into the sentences we're all well they're bears here are there bear the wolves where the water food shelter so yes get a little basic those are two questions I don't ever want to hear yeah are there bears here and where are the wolves not not are there wolves here where are they where are they fuck I say and you're out there walking yeah for a year yeah that's it I'm for the first six months specially so the first six months is mostly hiking in the woods it's hiking in the wilderness on the Tibetan Plateau are you carrying your camp on your back yeah so you have a baby sir quick will you sleep at 10 so we have 10 really light weights with a chi last 10 get it up storm proof it's amazing how light they can get those doing student all right because I had to carry all of the the food we were filming for a documentary that's carry electronics in got too heavy now do you when you're when you're in this tent do you go with a double-layer tent so you have provides more insulation it's a little heavier or do you have like a really lightweight tent and just try to tough it out in the cold we have I had a double layer but that's because the double layer was just so small and so light no and it was a case of yeah you know that's your comfort that's your shelter right facing some big storms yeah that's what I was thinking I was like you'd sacrifice probably the weight for just something that's gonna keep you insulated in there that's it yeah you know do you have a pad that protects you from the ground yeah on top of that yeah we've got the part like the waterproof pad on the ground from the tent and then we've got a sleeping mat maybe about this this thick about a half an inch to an inch thickness mm-hmm and then I had a - 25 or minus 30 degree Celsius sleeping bag and what that is in in Fahrenheit but that was an you know you got toasty inside it goes - what is the issue with the ground though like do you have to have an insulated pad to make sure that the ground cold doesn't get to you yeah for sure that's what the the sleep and mud is so it's sort of you can roll it down it's really small really tight really lightweight as well but once you roll it out it's got like memory foam almost inside something similar and then you have to blow in it pump it up a little bit more so only takes 10 20 breaths easy to pack away as well it protects you from the cold and it protects from there because that's what you need you know the ground just to never been comfortable camping it's all like popping yeah you're awake you made it but still you feel weird yeah you can do you do get used to it yeah but especially after the trekking we were covering 50 kilometres some days well we've come about 20-25 miles especially in the Tibetan Plateau so after that day's Trek only to ration packs per day were you taken in 1,600 calories that's not a lot not a lot and we were carrying how much weight did you lose I properly but I've still lost weight now at about 13 12 to 13 kilograms I would say in weight which over the year was I lost the same amount in Mongolia 32 pounds something it's about 32 is it 32 pounds yeah so um wow that's a lot of weight to lose you're not a big guy yeah that's it fuck man that must have been you must have been really drawn out at the end big time although it kind of worked itself out because towards the end I was coming across more food didn't need my my ration packs of course someone's coming across more restaurants I can collect food as I as I go it's not so low and unsupported journey so I was just utilized and I was eating with the locals and I was you know taking as much calories down as I possibly could cost I was trucking did you pick like the cut the type of meals based on calories did you like when what I'm talking about like the mountain house type deals or I don't know what company you used what kind of yeah expedition foods I think so the house that I different ones that are more nutrient rich and less calorie rich yeah they have the smaller lighter ones as well which you got about 600 calories they are smaller they are lights are easier to pack but I need it as much as I could possibly get you know yeah they have a bunch of healthy options now because one of them CrossFitters are out there camping these days yeah yeah I don't want to get that healthy paleo food weather out there lying but the the what's undeniable has got to be for you is that once you've made those steps the first steps for the first day you have this monumental thing in front of you yeah like what was that like knowing when you started like here ready alright by a spy it was seeing here oh yeah this is exactly that it was exactly it was daunting it was so before we got to the oh he got to the source of the Yangtze River we lost I think four members when I say lost they survived but they got altitude sickness they were fearing for that house because the bears because of the wolves so before we reach day number one before we reached the start line we've already got four members of the film crew of guides evacuated taken off the mountains which brought me off the mountains as well because I needed to regroup with a different team so everyone was scared and people also got out to sickness how high are you up there we are just over 5,000 meters oh my god yes equivalent to Everest base camp I'd say oh my and get out to cheat sickness from really fucking high that's 15,000 feet right that's about that yeah yeah and there's wolves up there there's wolves yeah what how help us would you feel at 15,000 feet when you see a pack of water oh yeah and they're looking at you like hey you don't look too good buddy it's the Bears that scared me tomorrow they're scared you can't do anything against a bear can do I mean it's a wolf you can't do anything against it especially at 15,000 feet exactly tie your shoes give them as well oh my god yeah yeah we can't carry any weapon recently oh oh yeah oh sitting duck really can't carry any weaponry yet yeah you can't even have a knife I tried I took a knife out did I say yeah I took a knife out but I was it was taken from me insecurities lying out to the west so I bought another one in you shoe yeah I did have a knife for the first month or two yeah but again pack of wolves yeah you ain't gonna do shit I'd say that's it tear your legs apart yeah wolves are the the nastiest hunters big-time and we had close encounter as well with a pack there was a yeah there was a Tibetan he was trying to warn us he was trying to say well this is my this is my angle we were just talking to him he looked a little bit worried a little bit stressed while high on the mountains he keeps pointing down a valley talking to his to enter Tibetan we didn't understand sort of waved or thank you bye big smile off we go say where's me and my friend also videographer Kyle we cracked on but Kyle filmed all of that conversation and four months later we found out that from a girl from my editor team in Beijing who could speak to betting that he was saying right ahead right down that Valley is a pack of wolves and only yesterday they had killed a local lady and trying to you know they were trying to get us not to go down there saying don't go oh we didn't know so we know oh yeah well the West Thanks see ya and we cracked on for the next two days we were followed we believe we were followed by or stalked by a pack of wolves and they they cover bigger distance then then humans cover you know for two days they were just out in the same proximity same distance away far to the other side of the fuck fuck how do you go to sleep at night what's that like yeah I was luckily it was windy the wind would pick up at nighttime so would rally your tents so you couldn't hear the howling don't hit on the day yeah you still stood there your knife state soldiers that you constantly showing over to your buddy okay you're just gonna become a burrito in the middle of the night yeah yeah yeah it was scary I felt vulnerable really vulnerable at their FARC bro and the low coming days were you doing this with their walls so it was two days that they were following us but we were in sort of wolfe county if you like for the best part of two or three months i would say oh with the Bears as well and the bears became an issue because I sort of went out there with a healthy mindset as long as I leave the Bears alone the Bears are gonna leave me alone right but the locals were telling me otherwise and they would start showing me photo star showed me videos and sending me clip saying this happened only one two kilometers away from you are from where you are now able to burn people killed just running into huts killing families and they were trying to say that they're coming off the mountains because it's too cold they're looking for calories before they go into hibernation so we were there in the wrong season and it's that that terrified as the most it was the stories at the locals and you know if the locals panic then you should definitely be panicking as well there's a lot of parts of the world or you have to be really worried about wild animals all the time yeah we see here in America for whatever reason we've forgotten that I think everybody that lives in a big city is basically kind of forgotten that yeah yeah but when you make that track you realize like oh there's no rules out here they're they'll eat you that's a billion every Lily the caribou they'll eat a moose why wouldn't you yeah what do you think you're special didn't know what the fuck you are I'll say it's probably the only thing that keeps you alive is they haven't eaten a person lately yeah and they say like you said caribou they can take the best they gonna caribou like moose yeah he was a huge as well Brandon watched a moose kill or excuse me watched a bear kill a moose on a spotting scope he was looking through his spotting scope and he saw a bear SWAT down the back of a moose just break its back terrifying he said the grizzly hit the moose so hard it snapped its back like what power - ish emotion a bear and they are big on the music is a huge yes bear swatted that thing and broke its back and he said we watched it go down he watched this chase there's like this altercation between this bear and the Moose and he stayed on it and the bear gets ahold of most just fucking swats it - moose is like bitchy going nowhere yeah yeah yeah those animals are up there and China - yeah they're very similar type of bear right it's a type of brown bear yes I put brown bear yes I do you've got the big ones he's in the last night they killed them all - California everything that they had yeah that was here in California it's on our flag it's our state flag if you look at the California state flag there's a giant grizzly bear in the middle of the California state flag because he used to be an issue here they killed so many people that we just killed all the Bears not wait I was in here oh yeah so this is an orphan I wall they that's it right there yeah oh yeah they're nowhere near here you got to go up into like Vancouver British Columbia has so what's the British Columbia has a lot yeah they have montana has 'm montana has Grizzlies Wyoming has Grizzlies Colorado may or may not my friend Adam saw them there yeah but did not in California anymore it's just because they killed him there's actually a town named after the last guy who died Levesque California the last guy who got killed by a grizzly bear just out hunting was it oh just probably be dude there was a live back gen terrifying so you experience this in China you're yeah what are what are your precautions are you allowed to bring bear spray so we had an air horn we had a whistle oh Jesus whistle a whistle yeah so they say that the boat the biggest attacks happen from where Tibetans out forming doing their business in the mountains they they're in the forest and this surprise they come up the top of the hill there's a bear there and obviously the Bears shocked it's scared and it just attacks yeah those happen with bears in America that's it yeah so they would same pretty much take a whistle take an hour make yourself aware well make the bear aware that you'll get your present your function and normally they would be they would you know scare off they run away but there was a local that told me that so they have these big to better masters have you seen that's a better masters like yes dogs thank God the two live rounds were terrifying more of a problem than that the wolves they were for me because they can scare away the Wolves scare with snow leopards the Bears but this one local was telling me that he wasn't living in his ger which is like a white felt tent like a year he was living in a concrete hut and he had a courtyard with a fence the fence was open but just outside the fence it's a better must have chained up and he said that this bear wasn't fazed about the Tibet must if it was straight past it into the courtyard and was scratching its steel door whilst he was hired and in one of his empty covers and that's lasted about 30-40 minutes and was telling me this story oh fuck man they're monsters if you weren't a real thing if grizzly bears or brown bears weren't real hmm and then they were in a movie you'd be like what yeah yeah poor guy and imagine you you'd like you someone would ask someone like you like why in the world yeah if you know they're there what you're gonna want to walk for that long yeah their country yeah well that's that's it that's only people with you and towards the start so it was myself it was two guides that I had Tibetan guide so we can even communicate ah but with safety in numbers and we took a horse for the film crew but the film crew got altitude sickness and left us with the horse which I Detroit we haven't seen the movie face off yes the bad ass castor Troy a lot Solaris I've got this thing where I name like my bicycles or like carried a chicken we'll get to that kind of chicken and Madagascar I've been given them old crazy ridiculous granny names and I was like this horse is the last one standing last by my crew my my guides a serf remove attitude sickness and and being taken off the mountains you've got this horse still suffering with altitude sickness never knew that the panting horses can animals can suffer with altitude sickness but he's there like a badass still going so it's just me and him and I'm like and can't give you a granny's name my elder or daughter Gertrude and giving you cast a choke from face-off that's all a self yeah yeah we've made for that movie multiple times with the preposterous nature of switch and faces like Nicolas Cage now so the people come with you in the beginning and then they stay with you the entire trip yeah we we hope so no sorry so it be so first two guides that I had altitude sickness as well as the film crew I came off the mountains I found two new guys who were willing to join me about 50% now the UK team the China team was saying you know abandon the expedition start again start again next to you start again so yeah try again next year because it was getting too close encounter season how many days had you already worked we hadn't reached the stop point yet oh so we had truly I think it was four days it took for us to get to the stop we but just before we reached the start point that's when the film crew got altitude sickness we sent them home and then the next day my guide he was vomiting he had nosebleed we had to get him off the mountains too so we left the horse with some local nomads got him off the mountains regroup with a different team and tried again so our first attempt towards the source was it was a fail we regrouped it was myself as two guys it was the horse and we eventually finally made it to the source they just but it was on that that gap in a nearby city of regrouping with a new team with new guides that my team in the UK and China would like saying I think it's best if you if you hold back and we try again next year because you'll be in the in the Tibetan Plateau during the depths the the depths of winter which drops to about minus 30 minus 40 degrees Celsius which was a worry but I believed that we could get off the mountains it was the attitude that was the problem down into lower altitude before the deaths - for people who don't know the conversion I think that's where it meets in the middle of negative 40 is where Celsius and Fahrenheit is the same right so okay so people in this country use Fahrenheit you say Celsius yeah I think minus 14 minus 40 Fahrenheit are the same oh yeah and I think that's where it hits the button glia was it say they're just - - LC is minus 22 Fahrenheit you're right you go to minus 40 I think minus 40 is right where it is no no - 40 yeah yeah see oh yeah that's where it's exactly the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit day we all so we're yeah how the fuck does that out yeah how is it the same thing like you're never the same thing yeah how you become the same thing who's got the wonky system is that - one for our - forty it becomes the same there we go very - 40 Fahrenheit yeah right because it showed like 40 Celsius he's very hot right it's like 100 plus yeah yeah yeah 45 minus 40 is the same the fuck is going on here who's got the wax what's 40 degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit they're 4 degrees Celsius is probably one will come to that for what is it 104 yeah 104 104 yeah yeah it's hot yeah weird melting no what kind of gear are you guys taking with you in terms of like are you taking a Jetboil are you taking just matches you're hoping to find wood are you trying to stay light you have a lightweight stove like wood so we took a lightweight stove along with us we took Flint with us as well matches and a lighter no no Jetboil or anything like that because you wouldn't be able to refill on problems yeah what we had actually we had a year a bottle that connects to the stove and with that bottle you can even fill it up with gasoline but you can also use vodka whiskey and run off the vapors you get pumping up pump the bottle the vapors leak out sparks a flame and you're good to go really yeah so that's what I talk specially in Mongolia nomads get how you Russian Russian vodka Oh drinking vodka just like people think you're a drunk you really just try to stay alive out there in the wilderness yeah you know drinking it ease into fuel much does it how much does it like is it efficient like you the use of vodka like how much vodka does it take to cook your meal luckily I didn't I didn't need to try it that was just a precaution that was all I always carried enough gasoline with me because by using the the vodka or the whiskey it does ruin the stove is it like blocks that the small hole that sparks the s'mores in the flame you don't want that isn't that funny you would think that like if anything gasoline would be more fucked yeah you would yeah that's it yeah yeah it's probably because it's not all alcohol right yeah a bunch other shit in there it's gonna be it's gonna be but if you had rubbing alcohol pure rubbing alcohol probably burn even better yeah potentially how you would thought so yeah this whole idea that you you had to do this mm-hmm how much encouragement did you get from people that you told the story to and how many people like you can't do this you're gonna die up there I'd say a healthy mix for those who had seen the previous adventures that I had done they had a they had hope they held hope they had faith in you yeah they had faith come on surely he's got this they knew you'd already accomplished two amazing things that's it and it was never done recklessly first it was never really done for the record there was always environmental angle sustainability awareness etc but it's also the planning so it's not that I used to do really reckless stuff we'll get to that but now it's meticulous planets the details looking at what can go wrong but also learning how you can possibly overcome it back home a good cliffhanger yeah yeah but when you're walking what kind of equipment are using are using a GPS and if so do you have solar panels that you're using to gather electricity yeah so yeah we would take solar panels so we had solar panels we had the a couple of power banks so we'd use the solar panel to charge the power bank and then that will charge like the the GPS the the cameras can I ask you how you do that are you putting it on the back of your backpack as you want that's it yeah which strap it's at the top of the rucksack okay and you know it's Mongolia specially is known as the eternal land of blue sky mm-hmm and where I was wasn't too far so we did have a lot of blue sky with decent sun rays I was able to charge the power bank and that power bank could last up to about a week and a half of charging depend on how I use it so it's really really useful that's incredible so when you're walking how much does it take what is the milliamp hour in the so what is it I think I think I studied it by how many charges I can get from the iPhone so I think it was seven or eight or eight charges from 0% on the iPhone to 100% seven to eight straight charges and care and that sometimes requires quite a bit sometimes I was just charging the GoPro or the little satellite satellite phone and you're able to get that full charge just from that solar panel and how long just from the power bank yeah the solar panel would take a good while to charge up the the power bank so what I did is a couple days I'd say a couple of a couple of days to get to 100% yeah for sure for sure 25 to 30% per day I think it was that's interesting so it seems like you could almost get everything you need just in while you're walking everyday that's it yeah but you're right there if the days are good you know if we write access to blue sky but I took does it work at all when it's cloudy it does but painfully slow pay like maybe after an hour you've bumped up a percent how crazy is the idea though of the there stealing energy out of the sky hazy yes the Sun the energy the Sun is powering your phone that's it that's it I want to do it that way just to do it that way it just sounds so bad yeah and that's the air exactly exactly that's the way the world's moving as well isn't the energy of the Sun power and your phone I mean just the world just needs more efficient ways to use solar and they're gonna get better at it for sure yeah far better than it used to be yeah I was shocked to see it all over China as well actually so you're I'd imagine right there's a lot of rural places in particular that don't really have too much access to the grid yeah yeah so when you are you're traveling around you've got are you using the phone as your GPS or do you have a standalone GPS you so with China I was using that the GPS and that would keep me like a garment or something yeah and in an enriched didn't really oh yeah that's the one you can communicate with people right with that one you can send text only right yeah but I did I took an aviary no sorrowful Sat phone I know with a laugh for cause and that got me out of a lot of a lot of difficult situations we were you ever in a situation we like I think these people were gonna rob us I was robbed in Mongolia but in China no I've got robbed in Mongolia what happened they stopped my solar panel really they did it so politely so nicely they just came over they visit ouch chilling with them me and my ration pack they brought some food and some tea over we're all sat out in the Sun and at one point they would have slid my solar panel under my tent and I didn't see it so when I came for me to pack everything back into my tent which I did from head down fell asleep and then I always all of a sudden felt I know Jin on the tent and something was yanked from underneath it and I just said hello and then someone was just running away and I thought well maybe he came to say hi and I've just scared him off not realising but then the next morning realized the solar panels missing and then whilst I was tracking I clicked and four okay very clever came back then a few hours later at dark took it from underneath and ran so now how would he do without a fucking solar panel we have what I had a spare I was at that point I took a trailer and the trailer weighed about 120 kilograms of everything that I had in it which is about 260 pounds and so yeah I with that journey I mean how are you moving the trailer so yeah so with math Kolya it's just strapped with me it's like a four-point harness what on wheels so you're not just walking 4000 miles you walk in 4000 miles or 200 so this year this is a whole different expedition yeah so this taste I came to Robyn there was nothing in China okay okay so that's that but in China no I had difficult situations with the authorities with the police will try their bribes no they were just I was in a sensitive area you know to get to the source the planning it took over two years so I need a government support I needed national park access I needed an a green Development Foundation which is like an organization to make me ambassador I to make me doctor for a year to be able to get all of this access but when when I went through the motions of getting these different organizations on board that would give me access to the authorities and allow me to get to the source it was it was my husband blows my mind now is really really difficult to get off the off the ground but we did that but still we were so close to Tibet that the Tibetan police would would come over and threaten to you know get rid of us and the porters and whatnot so that came is worried thirteen different documents or scandal official or signed so I had to show them that I had to use the satellite phone call into the Beijing team uses translation I think that one time they may meet delete all of the information all of the tract information I needed for Guinness world record they may be delete that but I was backed up because they didn't want to have me seen walk in this region it was quite sensitive there but I was definitely in China and definitely in qinghai province sensitive household just because you've got Tibet and you've got China and they're very close to each other so I needed to make sure that I was always in in China sometimes you'd get the police come on did they think that you were a spy or something yeah no idea what they thought but it came as a shock to them they were also very worried for my safety so there was that angle as well but they were saying once they found out was official it was legit and it apologize that I should follow me on the the Chinese social media you know follow the journey so that was great but after that they did say we off just you know bringing you in for protection there's bears as wolves would not see no Western along so that got tricky and there was one stage where they they said you need to be on the other side of the river so they drove us 40 miles back on our self to a bridge dropped us off on the other side and we had to do those 40 miles all over again that was day six into the journey and we were desperately trying to get off the mountains and now we just dropped back for you we had to walk there was 40 miles again no way around it nightmare fuck so yeah it was really tricky there's the source around that area really sensitive and it was just and then we found that the locals would call the police as well they would radio to the next girl to the next girl to the next girl until eventually there was cellphone signal and they would call the police and the police would often rock up at 2 3 o'clock in the morning just our tent at the location bang on they rocked up like what are you doing here so we found out that the locals were amazing very hospitable but they were worried and they didn't know if it's in a Western ado do they report it will there be in trouble if they don't report it so they did so it came and pretty much went from Mission Yangtze to almost Mission escape and evade we had to escape the sensitive region that we were in but we had to evade the locals because we realize that it was them calling the the priests that went off about three weeks maybe think that you were an escaped fugitive right yeah yeah do you think of a fugitive in America or the UK is trying to get away yeah what better way to just jump into the middle of nowhere and China Wang yeah that's it essentially or just again quite threat from your fugitive yeah yeah maybe some sort of bank robber type guy that's it that's a guy ritchie movie so you are avoiding this sensitive area so this is a sensitive area that's close to the tibet and chinese border did you anticipate any of these things beforehand like did you guys sit down with the team like we were then do you say okay this could go wrong that's wrong how many games did you figure could go wrong there's so many things that could have gone wrong that luckily didn't this was really sketchy just the Yangtze is just known it cuts through a lot of diversity it's a beautiful stunning part one of the beautiful places that I've been but there are sensitivities there's the the elevation there is the the wildlife there's the temperatures as well did you see that video of I don't know if the girls from China or food pan it's a turned out to be fake but she's snowboarding and behind her you see a bear running yeah I did see that video yeah yeah is that possible it's not the videos fake where he's not in Japan not sure if it's Japan isn't it might be China I did see they exist in Japan as well right they do I believe so can you Jamie I'm sorry I'm double Google asking you yeah bring you one yeah it's a fun video to watch so she was oblivious she I don't think it's real I think someone just did some cool shit with CGI but it looks pretty good yeah it looks yeah it looks like if it was in a movie like oh fuck oh fuck because the girls got headphones on she's rockin out yeah this is my cycle is well recently it was India just Sprint's across the road and how fast it was going see here it is so it's really well made whoever did it it's like she's got a GoPro yeah it's on the ground and then as she's going down the hill and her snowboard at a certain point in time you looking to see a fucking bear and she has no idea she's laughing and everything's cool and then watch it turn to the side again yeah I think you see the bear my terrifying there it is yeah yeah that's the second one is where I'm skeptical because it seems like this fuck it looks pretty good there it's pretty damn good doesn't it that would be hard to do yeah a bear just gave up at that point yeah and that chick is flying I have never snowboarded from what I've heard from my friends when you snowboard yeah you two break your head see feet go up in the air and your head goes down yeah it's easy to break your head this supposed to be Japan yeah I've got that Tiger one that's I gonna ever see the one with the dudes I think he's in India they're on a bike like a motorized it's the one I'm talking though trackers chasing the plan yeah yeah get some it almost gets it yeah it does that's definitely chasing them too yeah dude that's hat you're fine that is fucking horrific here we go here it is so these guys are latest tiger just going for it almost got him almost got him on right about then my Jews renlund right there is wishing he had the cash for a bigger engine Wow this right there right there is when you oh my god what a killing machine and what's so beautiful what a fucked up way to die from like a most beautiful thing that you ever created if a tiger wasn't a murderous horrific predator that definitely eats people you would look at and go it was in a movie like Avatar something like that a tiger doesn't even look like a real creature see it's so beautiful stunning now beautiful creatures only beautiful and spectacular and murderous terrifying it's chasing you on a moped Oh speed as well same with a bay think they're gonna be slow but they can oh they've run way faster than people they run fast and Usain Bolt didn't get away from a bear and all they need is one little ankle pick yeah one little just get that ankle woo you go flying in the air I see at first they tear you apart came across your footprints and we believe that the bare footprints were fairly fresh maybe maybe passed our set exact track that we were on in West China showing with your hand how about you was maybe about this big Oh fucking got a patron on the Instagram that's big dude you got a video actually suspend Mastiffs as well gotta better myself in a nuts to me trying to attack me really yeah the guy just steps in froze the stone you don't see that bit but yeah there you go um that's a pretty good size that's not that's not as big as I was thinking but that's its front pool isn't it yeah I think yeah I'm not I mean it's like the back pool is almost like a human footprint isn't it well the big brown bears they have there's a photograph a famous photograph of a woman who is a she's a wildlife biologist they had tagged this grizzly like to put a collar on it or find its location or something like that maybe do a test on it and she's holding its foot up and it is literally like a huge dinner plate the foot see if you find that picture of God know what biologist holds up yeah well I saw that one actually what's the Grizzlies part yeah it is fucking huge and the claws on it yeah it's like it's wide as my chest that's what the the barefoot looks like and she's holy look at the fucking size you don't you don't stunned it so crazy it's so crazy that nature created that just a clean up system for the fucking woods and I think with a lamp yeah anything that's fucking around places it shouldn't be you're having too many babies who I smell I'm coming to get them done dark bar and you're you're out there with these things and you just have a little tent and nowhere yeah and no weapons and there's really three of you or four of you there was three for the first three weeks and then there was two of us for four days then from then on it was pretty much solo most of the way for the first sort of half of the expedition and then the second half was super interactive opened it up people would join in oh so we're gonna do about it yeah it was burnt pretty big in in China we'd have journalists we'd have Chinese celebrities and then we walk with you and they would Trek with us yeah sometime organize events would be rock climbing would be teaching them out of belay off the cliff and we're like do they have Instagram China no so I had to get all of the different social media platforms for bigger that's pig's liver whoa so they marinate it in vodka and Chile drinking it no you blowing it up blowing up that's paschal womb so that's like a rare delicacy can eat it raw straight from the Yangtze River how sick did you get yeah they have some serious stomach bugs over the past decade IV and all sorts the lot so there's like them towards the east so it was super interactive as well it was so these kids all knew that you were doing this yeah yeah there's a news channel there as well and we crane a documentary oh that's pretty cool one point a good heart out yeah mazing Hospital they was so friendly at one point adidas got wind of it and they invited me out to launched you know Jet Li yes yeah they a co-branded range between himself and Adidas it was like a photo shoot GQ adidas and Jackie Huang who's like a big movie star and I just jumped at the chance it was one day off one day in in Shanghai straight back into the wilderness and that was crazy contrast one minute in the wilderness next minute flying out to Shanghai got all of these stylists makeup artists like whoa photo shoot boof back yeah and I was good they wanted like a face of the East's represent the brand but also a face from the West came from nowhere so it was great you know lots of people star get wind on it again I'd say a star I think eight to nine different social media channels in in China so they have their own platforms they don't have Google instagrams buying YouTube etc so yeah add a great team onion films and Beijing you you really help support sets all of this up translate in is there a certain point time knowing these people going with you they like a pro I'm done you're on your own and was that kind of weird like when the crowds yeah yeah yeah I want to be yourself again yes the second half of the expedition it was okay so it's coming across many people but the first half oh man the first half it got quite difficult yeah it was lonely at times it was boring like though hiking I don't really a sounds fun I don't want to particularly enjoy that the hiking the walking chose to do for right and get pretty boring its average everyday like I don't really like porridge I said it's it's actually it's the survival it's the challenges and it's the people you meet along the way you know so did you ever have a point where you had large groups of people would then not yeah quite often yeah I think that the largest we had was about 35 or 40 people and then afterwards they went away afterwards they went away as I said back on the grind the emotion family must be the weird part yeah a bunch of people join in with you yeah and then they're gone that's it and then you just still trudging yeah and you've got a you know keep going guessing so welcome podcast on the earphones isn't it crack there's only two hundred ninety days to go look on the bright side yeah that's it and the first part was more so because the second half there was lots of people is very interactive the first half like I had a UK photographer fly out Martin Lyons and he joined me was supposed to join me for two weeks but there was a terrifying unlike any much it was it just blocked the way and there was only two options to cross and again you know this is in his profession that's not what he does he's a photographer so he's come into my world and he's you know seeing these two options either one could go terribly wrong you drop in a hell of a distance and you straight into the Yangtze River so he was supposed to join me for two weeks but he ended up going back on day number one after six hours just because the the danger of trying to cross it and so that for my mindset having company for two weeks of a good friend of mine as well from the UK I could speak I can converse and communicate with to then having no one but on my own means still in the wild side of China still bear still wolves and I'm solo so that hit me hard outside are you keeping a journal in your tent at night yeah I would actually stick to I did on the previous expeditions with this when I start to voice memos because it would capture my my thoughts my feelings my emotions and so I was especially for the book I was capturing as much as we possibly could and you doing this with your phone doing this with the phone yeah worried about dropping your phone and losing everything I was I was I would try each city I came across I just tried to back everything up yeah and yeah Wi-Fi are you allowed to use over there do you have to use an Android phone on their system or a Chinese system no no we were okay I just took my my iPhone connected to all of their social social media of course out of my own like bank account transactions all of that with China so it was very much on the system right you can't use Twitter or ins no you gotta get VPN what is that a virtual private network that's it yeah but I thought it was like one of their apps so what are their apps that you're allowed to use with their social so they have like Weibull which is kind of like an Instagram okay they have a WeChat which is kind we just clever it's kind of like a whatsapp merged into Facebook so are you having the Translate of their their comments like when they write things or when they write yet I can but sometimes it's too many you can't you've got a right open it open the VPN open up the Google generate it I'll just send it to the team the team would actually do most of the posting for me I send it to the UK team to post on the International social media website oh so they can send them that post then they could put it on Instagram or Twitter that's safe yeah I would send them like a voice memo or a message of text what's it what to say was there ever an issue with the Chinese government that you were doing that through a third party that you were somehow or another getting the information out into the real internet not so much no because even the satellite that we had to carry I carried like a another enos satellite vegan system if you like and that we had to register with the government and he had to sign off so they knew what I had with me and it was with that satellite that I was able to send to the Beijing team they would forward on to the UK team and from there we were able to make it one of the world's most interact fists did they have any concern at all about you using the regular internet like instead of just using the Chinese approved social media sites that you were also using the other ones that were international that's it using international and the in China if they did they have an issue with that at all the Chinese no not that I'm aware of no a lot of the Chinese are also on Instagram as well really yeah VPN of course yes sorry it's that yeah I think there's a only a certain amount of lockdown that they can they can have that's there's a lot of Chinese travelers as well so they go to these foreign countries that yeah you know get Instagram Twitter they get whoa whoa yeah the foreign countries so that that's got to be weird using their government approved social media that it feel weird why are you using it yeah yeah I got so used to think there was ten or eleven different social networks that I was on it was mainly my team so that was just too much you know do they have more over there than we do over here yeah I'd say so and they're well connected their phone is just like an extension is it different things in in what way in terms of you like do they have different apps they use more often or differently yeah they house their own up so they have everything that we have but converted just just different yeah no I we go on like we have an issue in this country with with Huawei and a lot of these Chinese companies you can't even buy a huawei phone anymore over in Maya but the ones that they sell over in China are super sophisticated let's see they're like the top of the food chain comes right on big time and the cameras as well yeah because that's what all of the Chinese love as well to be able to take good photos good videos and that's just an instant sell with the cameras come with that phone yeah they blocked them from Google though this is where it gets really interesting that's why I'm asking Google no longer lets them use Google Apps so you can't use the Google Play Store so you have to either sideload apps you get side load some apps or you have to get the Huawei version of the apps so I'm like I wonder if what happened from the United States trying to stop them from taking over mmm and they're worried that it's a branch of the government and they're gonna get their hands in all these different enterprises and businesses and they'll be able to spy on everything and extract information because they can do that with their Huawei devices yeah but it's interesting that I wonder if leaving them out of the system will make them create a system that's better and they don't even need our system anymore it's almost better to like yes you know I think that's the way it's going you know you've done of Google but they buy the bodies just like you but they roll people they'll have whatever their version is of of Wikipedia that's all government control that situation now they got so many good are they I think they've got an app as well like a delivery app where if the guy is like one minute late you can throw a complaint and then it's free delivery costs pennies is it there's any one minute yes so sometimes we'll call I'm gonna be a minute late is it okay can you not phone in because he won't get paid then oh wow it's deadline yeah and like even the bullet trains there's so advanced the bullet trains leaving on the second let alone the minute a couple of seconds before the minute if anything they're just so sufficient and you see that there everything's in house they got things coggan over there if it's made in China they it's almost like they don't need the rest of the world that's the scary thing you know it's really but it's again a pleasant place to be admired my friend Martin Berenson who's here as well say that because he joined me on mission Yangtze they have this idea that maybe it might be a little bit more suppressed and when he joined was I every one's happy everyone's doing that Taichi dancing everyone's active strong sense of community we're part of the we're part of China was this all over all over sold over so do you think that we in America have a misconception or what it's like to be Chinese yeah yeah not just in the US UK as well I think I think most countries yeah do you think it's because we don't communicate or because their language is so different it seems so different because they're there all the way over there like what is it yeah I think it's just because it's so locked off isn't it you know they're locked off the grid they don't really shout about what they do i right now that we were saying before the amount of solar panels wind farms they sent I think 19,000 soldiers out to plant trees but all of that they're not shouting to get attention that you're doing it and so I sometimes see that China aren't doing enough but on the inside when I'm over in China - you know you know like whoa we didn't know about this so I I you know I'm - supreme as well before I went to China I thought maybe it's going to be the same but that's why I go to these places you know get out there explore its interior meet the people of the country and yes a pleasant place to be for sure that's pretty badass man they get a totally different view of a country than what most people do and to do it for a full year do you think that's gonna be a place you'd go back and visit now yeah a hundred percent I think it took off so well at such immense support there that uh be ashamed not to to continue it so I will be going back you know that me and the teams out there already looking at next ideas and I'm sure you are so that is that how it works like how much time do you take when you're done walking for a year how much time do you take before you okay you barely know so as soon as I got back from Mission Yangtze I had an Asia tour so I straight back out there Korea Singapore my and more and back out to China do lectures I've been out there four times already it's gonna be aired on CCTV the documentary and yeah just TEDx talks as well so I'm all at being back four or five times already since I finished only four or five months ago every month I'm pretty much back out there when did you do the first one the first one was the first one Mongolia so the first year was Mongolia that was 2013 2013 and how long did that took 78 days so it also it all pretty much started you know living him in Wales there you know I went from high school went on to college to do an outdoor education course I was working various different so our first job what was it 1415 fish and chip shop four dollars an hour you grinding away and then I went into waiting gone then I went into life garden because I heard that the lifeguard and money for a young teenager 16 17 is pretty well paid and then it was from there that I started to save up as much money as I can got rid of my little jalopy of a car bought myself a little bicycle cycle to and from work just saving the pennies and eventually left age 19 and the first place I went was China Great War I was only there for two weeks I left China when I look back on the map I thought chart there's a big place I've barely even touched the surface you know I need to get myself back there but after that it was just Arius reckless extremely low budget adventures held around Southeast Asia when I say low budget it's like buying a bicycle for ten dollars finding string on the side of the road that we would use to strap the rucksack onto the back with no pump no pump no puncture repair kit we're about to cycle over Cambodia Vietnam over 1,100 miles why wouldn't you get a puncture America just saving the pennies we actually got at our I know we got a 10 that was $5 found out the hard way it wasn't waterproof just recklessly silly things you made it on the bike though made at the bikes no 17 times and so I was with my friend my Norma you know both I'm I named my little elder a ridiculous and I think the bikes maybe on my Instagram ridiculous low bicycle bask on the front a little pink bell off we went both of us bikes broke 17 times and so how'd you get them fixed we would rock up a local at the locals and rock up see if they can help and they would fix it really hospitable does somebody have to translate to you that word did you have a translator with you no no so we were just out there we just you know rocket with a smile I think smiling is the biggest communication sign isn't it you don't see you as a threat that buries a dad at points at the problem and then they would help me right if you walk in like a dick with a flat tire yeah that's not good yeah that's it exactly yeah yeah so we just rocker rocker in swords out which is my dogs hit by mopeds dodged by lorry so that was the first away from home adventure I'd say that that was the catalyst you said dodged by lorries yeah what does that mean that the roads were extremely sketchy okay enough only toilet trans land they would be like coming straight down the ER at the mountain pass I almost saw the brakes were good probably aware squeezing in it's going fastest we're like we need to get off this road man and I came trying to get it cycle faster and but you know after that we just found my niche found my passion for wow this is great as cheap that's reckless but after that we were in Thailand we hooked up with a local guy that said we can cross the border and to mine more to a community it's like a Burmese hill tribe and we can learn jungle survival so we did we went there and and this group living out there in the mountainous jungle region the board of Tibet and my and more they were teaching us berries that act as a mosquito repellent you can pop them rope them in your skin it will repel the mosquitoes teenagers teaching us how to hunt how to gather what berries or what leaves were edible what plants weren't edible how to build rafts and shelters using natural resources you know normally bamboo banana leaves as a bed or as a slanted shelter to for the rainwater to run off it's amazing we just continued these sort of adventures around Southeast Asia hopped over to Australia found some workers in Australia power and gas I think it was knocking on people's doors I thought this isn't miss one not one I'm traveling for him in a suit now and you know I remember I was shadowing a my boss walked up to this Drive and there was this guy the end of the drive doing all of these pull-ups at that point I've become quite unhealthy put a bit more weight on it wasn't sticking to the trainer wasn't stick to it to a good diet and he jumped down he wasn't interesting the Australian pound gas but he mentioned something like yeah I respect you guys out here 40 plus degrees Celsius I'm Jeanette Fahrenheit knocking on people's doors in the suits trying to sell them a good deal and one of them my boss replied something cringe-worthy said something like yeah but we get paid a lot of this you know I Drive a skyline so unnecessary and the guy replied the guy who's doing the pull-ups it's not all about the - the lifestyle - I don't want a certain that was a slap in the face for me that's why I started to travel so the next day I quit the job got myself a little bike with my friend again and we just carried on cycled er so he thinks I'm saying something douchey that sort of leaned you in the right direction yeah I was I was thinking for a while this isn't this isn't me you know it's foolish yeah yeah I was doing something that it wasn't wasn't right but his behavior yeah oh I know his behavior that was the sort of I was looking at this guy and I was like I'm not stood on his side and understood would not this is the way that I'm going this is my boss right they would eat like fast food every single morning you know KFC and I was just like this isn't how I man sometimes you just need someone to say something like that yeah little messes and I've had a lot of those little nudges along the way that if it was not notes I don't know maybe I would have just continued and no idea yeah I think we all have encountered those yeah sure so you said you got robbed that one time where they stole your solar panel that's it um so yeah what's it seems like you would get robbed a lot Madagascar Madagascar was more sketchy I would say come to Madagascar but yes so just before after that Australia cycle and before Mongolia slightly this Lynx is into the Mongolia it's actually then working in Thailand because the money was so low that's fine work as a master scuba diving instructor but I was also doing the Muay Thai out in Thailand which was awesome to see their discipline you know they'd be in their shins never done it before I know I come from a box and by tussles doing boxing in Wales did you not stick at all nope so when I I learned the hard way and then searched the harder actually that I you know had the boxing stance left foot in front and the Muay Thai stance it's more square on it's different and they just chucked my leg up instantly Jack just kick they didn't need to get into no no fists with me it was just Jack my leg up the next day I had to cancel work I couldn't climb out of the ladder with all of my scuba diving kit because I couldn't bend my leg and from there I just corrected I was trained in five six times a day killing my nerve endings on the shin I just loved it at a stadium thigh virgin yeah stadium it was in koh tao a little island in koh tao so a guard sail from mainland over to coat on the winner the loser you can make money of course you know so that's kind of my way of paying rent if I warned you to leave with money if you lose you leave with nothing really yeah and you've got the locals around the ringside sort of banging down on the canvas holding money up there with a pointing at you or the pointing at your opponent how do you know when you take a fight like this that it's well matched yeah well you don't really so that was my first stadium fight and apparently this guy in my opponent that was his sixth but we looked similar height he was look to be maybe more experienced because of the fighting but hadn't been fighting since a young age like a lot of the Thais have you know they start from such younger as you know and so yeah it was a little bit my my right done my trainer it was boss how many five six months in that's pretty fast you notice straight to them and you said you had box before that I posted before that impeded no not compete so it was just amateur fighter look at you yeah wow I was in yes actually playing around with my my guide but I love it yeah so you how many fights did you have over there it was probably about eight Club fights but only one stadium fight the one stadium fight was the big one you know he won that pay for about two three months worth of accommodation that was good I needed it you don't do much money as a scuba diver in Thailand was for myself so you won your stadium fight won the stadium fight yeah that's awesome yeah what made you stop Mongolia so I love this lifestyle as do enough like two years like living in Thailand for two years but I was like I missed trekking the Himalayas I missed my time with the the community the hill tribe and mine more cycling Vietnam so I was like I need to do something you know big something that'll take me to a country that I'm very unfamiliar with and that brings in Mongolia so that's the first world first record not not the first to attempt though a guy from Britain had attempted on three occasions unfortunately evacuate evacuate just before the halfway tell people the record is so is the first to walk solo and unsupported across Mongolia is length so it's from west to east and we sit unsupported that mean there's no one monitoring you at all that's right so you're you're on your own you track him by app off from the you know the people that you see along the way the communities unsupported mean and everything that I needed for to make the journey from starter to end point was in the trailer that I was pulling and it was a bog-standard trailer though in a family friends by God so you said this trailer away 201 pounds yeah 120 kilograms which i think is 260 here you are pulling this thing with a four-point harness first of all that's hard that's hard to do yeah is it a flat road like that so this is entering the Gobi Desert so it's three weeks over the Altai Mountains five weeks across the Gobi Desert and a further three weeks up for the Mongolian steppe so the Altai Mountains were excruciating you know it's no suspension of on the trailer even one little pebble or stone gets in the way and you know you're struggling - this is a sandstorm that I came across there's actually one of the smaller ones but that's a small one that's the small one yeah it's so painful as well you ever been in a Sun still no so it picks up the stones in Korea we've been effect Wow yeah I can't see anything right well I've seen some of them that roll into Iraq yeah soldiers that have taken videos of them and put them up on social media it's crazy it looks like something out of a biblical music money rather yeah you see the scary there's giant clouds of dirt have you ever seen those Jeremy sandstorm pull up sandstorm in Iraq it's it's what the fuck yeah and everybody's just got a hunker down yeah I see it just ride it out like yeah like I was able to do that go that video is so fucking bananas outside they're fine as soon as it hits the wind oh the disorients a is darkness inside and you can't hear anything and you're gonna get intent and you're gonna have to breathe through that yet there wasn't one big enough I would say that I had to hide it was still big but I carried on walking because sometimes it just come out of nowhere so I didn't it was more like this when these whips out the the wall that you can see in the distance coming towards you like that good you'll go back on that Jamie this is how you see the storm overtakes them and it literally kills the day and turns it into night yeah because it blocks out the Sun this is where it's really crazy yes I see this guy standing there and the storm starts to overtake him and everything starts to get dim and then after study that look at this difference in the color so fuss changing as well yes and now they're in the middle of it and now it literally blocks out the Sun cuz they're in the center of that fucking horrific storm that guy's just walking around breathing yeah so that looks more like a dust just storm where it's so kind of similar but the sand it moves it depends on the speed of the wind of a sandstorm you've literally got to cover up so you saw me with a mask with I to wear gloves a to wear a fleece just pounding your skin almost like sandpaper you know oh so it is how long that lasts that they would last about 15-20 minutes to keep walking a distance okay I can I'm walking yeah I did carry on walking you can see where you're gone yeah as long as you've got the head in on the compass just keep going keep going yeah but you're also following a track so this was the BSO I almost actually lost my life in the Gobi Desert so I was trying to follow a track and the track is like your lifeline if you're not following if you're off the track it could be hundreds of miles the track is where there's a water source there's a well always alongside but the Gobi took me five weeks to get across so week after week I was suffering slowly dehydration heat exhaustion slipping into heatstroke which is usually fatal at this big 20 litre water container sort of remember and just rushing in my last remaining dribbles of water if you like I was hallucinating got such a bad state one of the water wells was dry and I had to push on to the next one the hope that I had water it was a mix of hard sand or gravel and soft sand so now you can imagine pulling the wheels through soft sand they were just digging it so I pulling a concrete block through help oh my god yeah and I was just I got really skinny I got really weak the week's went by I was disoriented I was hallucinating I was sort of could feel my organs drying up if you like I was at the point I just continued to rest under my shells it was 4045 degrees Celsius no breeze no natural shelter the only shots I could find it was was underneath the trailer I remember just lying there on my back for about 45 minutes to an hour thinking well done you know I didn't have the evacuation as the previous guy had no helicopters going you're gonna come and rescue me you know the only bucket that I had was my logistics manager my fixer in a capital city needed so allow at least three to four days for him to get to me and at least another day or two for him to get me out to safety or I knew that there was a community which 100% had water it was about three or four days Trek away and I continued and I pretty much passed the option of pickup at that stage the only way to make it was pushing on those extra few days to the community but again for days it was just too much for housing agony man absolute agony do all other thoughts all of the fee the last well you know I've always but I've always been a big believer in breaking my goals down I can visualize the three or four days of course but what I could visualize is 100 metres I could see a hundred metres so I was just if I can if I can rest for five minutes not an hour and walk for a hundred meters and then rest that's all I could manage before I was just in a mess hide under my trailer again for another five minutes if I can continue to do this maybe by breaking my goals down after four days of 100 meters I can make it so the community and I did just about it's off the radars my urine was almost black you know it's in a bad way your what was black I your urine yeah yeah oh my god so you probably had severe dehydration yeah I was lucky to make it if that community wasn't there if it had been abandoned if the locals were in there I definitely wouldn't have would have made it now when you walk into a community like this how many people were talking like how big is the community talking probably five six huts maybe 20 30 people Wow yeah and you just show up so weird why do you slow pulling a big yet trailer and then you're like yeah I've been doing this they go so that's it so with this this is before I start feeling bad so with that I to run ahead of myself set up my camera on a tripod put it on a video or even a timer and with this one it was a video cuz I was trying to show how difficult it was to pull the trailer through the sand so as Lina for almost 90 degrees and how that was that's the same agonizing how many miles in the soft sand you do so it's five weeks in the Gobi Desert but not five weeks worth of soft sand I'd say maybe a week solid but scattered over the five weeks folks if you wanna this we're looking at a photo on the Instagram of ash pulling this sled leaning into it like dude you must kick ass a tug of war all yes please just go backwards just think about it think about how much time you spent dragging a fucking sled your legs must be made of steel it was painful it was painful okay yeah everybody has to recover right yeah basically lifting a little bit of weight everyday and you feel each step is just a run of lytic acids you know you're in horrible so this is why I was just resting awful did you worry about rhabdomyolysis I dunno no I was not you see I still training in the Gobi then I was trying to keep my mind set you know what are you doing I would try to stay regimented you know I have no military background of course but you know the mindset I was trying to stay focused I would do my push-ups my sit-ups always been keen into the into the fitness it's funny actually even when I came back from Thailand to attempt this I moved back in with my parents had no money of course they allowed me back in with them which was great and I didn't even have money from gym membership so had my uncle drop me off a tractor tire a war a local sledge hammer rode on like a bob bit of calisthenics and I suppose do now in the rain hardcore conditions of Wales Filipe in the tractor tire beating it with a sledgehammer trying to prepare myself not physically but mentally you know when you in you as you know you quill cover five o'clock in the morning you can hear its howl and with wind waiting outside the last thing you want to do is go out and train but I wouldn't have that option in Mongolia so again you know that's saying by putting yourself in more uncomfortable scenarios the more comfortable you become I was just trying to do that so did you develop some sort of a workout program please stick to a specific routine routine my routine was just full-on calisthenics so it'd be with that with the Mongolia I was training for two three hours a day five days a week so it was out I think actually on the Instagram the highlights there's a section fitness with a few different clips and it's yeah push-ups sit-ups pull-up flipping the tractor tire sledge hammer work I was working on ticking off all components flexibility agility balance speed reaction time coordination and I knew that my inner core was going to be crucial because pulling the trailer if you come over a over a stone you literally your hips are being pulled left and right so you need to be agile enough to be able to you know push on through that that's interesting about the core I didn't think of it that way yeah the core is vital I call of these sort of pull ups really helped as well for the young did you have someone coordinating this with you did you get some advice from like a physiologist or a personal Craner I didn't know I'm sort of just self-taught grew some clips on YouTube through a lot of it through trial and error I was training since 1314 you know based a lot around here calisthenics and the martial arts help as well I took a lot from the muay thai and still implemented that into the into the training regime I'm just I love it but body movement it fascinates me I love the trainer I get supe super ratty as well if I don't you ain't gonna even training today and there they went over to the to the pier got some rings there how straight oh yeah yeah lost a lot of weight so I'm trying it you know put some weight back on me as well I love it and the fitness is a crucial part without the fitness there's no way I would have made these these expeditions I can only imagine you're just seeing you pull that sled oh my god that looks like hell and the fact you're doing a hundred yards rest for five minutes 100 yards I mean just amazing that your body didn't break down just from over exertion amazing what the human body's capable of in general isn't it yeah and I had huge fears and massive doubts before this expedition and that's sort of my message out to everyone is you know you're far more capable than you then you think you're see little doubts into your mind don't you and that's what I was doing until Mongolia I was like you know don't have you fear I think fear is healthy but doubt can be toxic on it did you get tested for rhabdo if your if your pisses that color I think I did when I got back I was slightly worried just my organ the what I was feeling with my organs always like they were drying up and just needed to check that everything was still functioning fine and everything was good the body recovers fast and I was I was only 24 I guess then 23 what what how much weight did you lose by the end of that so that was 78 days and I lost 13 kilograms in 78 days that's it so yes I lost 13 kilograms as well off mission Yanks about spread over a year so that was like very concentrated loss a lot I was having a ration pack at 5:30 in the morning I would add this was two weeks of the Gobi Desert or a week and a half when I wake up at 5:00 have a ration pack at 5:30 and I'd go a whole 14 hours before I had my my next Russian pack about 7:30 with no food and burning insane amount of calories how many calories do you need a day just isn't it like that anyway calories if you doing like nothing if you just did it you know yeah probably close to 2,000 isn't it it depends though on your body weight mean if you're just sitting around obviously it'd be less than some of those moving around but everybody's varies mm-hmm that's a crazy thing to do to slowly starve yourself while you're pulling a plan and cheese and toast my mind but you know the guys when I rocked up to that community super friendly really nice nice yeah did you didn't speak through I didn't speak their language you know one funny story actually in the Altai mountains it was a Kazakh family so I'd always try to eat and rest up with them where I could so kazakh family in their sort of hot middle of the Altai rocked up 45 minutes inside sipping on their I try that tea eat and whatever they they gave me and towards the end I was like wow it's been 40 45 minutes I need to make a move now and just as I was about to say that I looked at the guy the man at the heart it was a man in it and his wife a girl he was looking at me very weird you know I slightly squinted slightly close like he's thinking of something you know he looks over to his wife was GILF and then he looks back to me back at his wife and then all of a sudden right there and then in hand gestures offered me offered me his wife whoa right there like that sort of ancient because to do this yeah he put it to the bed unimportant it wasn't it I didn't know what to do you know whoa you know I know that's it she's yours now bro we just it was awkward silence for about ten fifteen say we all exchange and look she was looking at me I was looking oh I just put on a fake laugh a couple of seconds later he laughed with me and I made a swift exit she continued breastfeeding the child so sure breastfeeding yeah why don't you take a piece yeah whoa no is it one of those things that this actually happened or will I leave and having a big joke right now and they're laughing away the fact that you know you just never know do you I'm gonna guess if they live in tents in the middle of Noah and there's five tents and takes forever to get there those people are probably freaks probably doing some weird freak shit they probably have no attachment whatsoever to sexuality well maybe it's like here don't you like to be really Hospital I got super hospitable you know but you do hear old school exploration I've heared it before but I didn't think in this generation in this day and age that still be going on they're probably living like old school Mongolians did yeah Wow sexually right yeah in the Far West so that was a Kazakh family so they would have come over the border which is like Mountain you got the outside Mountain so this was in Kazakhstan this was West Mongolia worst one but there's a heavy population of Kazakh they're the ones that actually hunt you know the Eagles right in there the eagle perched on that Handley some foxes well how different they look they're there look like the Kazakh is more of an area that's closer to what so kazakh has right on there on the border so you've got Mongolia sandwiched between Russia up north China down south it's just the name Kazakh yeah directly on the on the west you've got Kazakhstan okay but yeah another I think that's the second largest line where a first largest landlocked country in the world Mongolia is the second largest landlocked country in the world dude you're walking through this yes thanks tur and that was my first trip there as well so I didn't have the money to do a recce like I did with China and Madagascar I'd never been to the country I rock it with her with the trailer when you show up at some one to ten do you offer some of them something for food like how do you how do you worked that out I had a piece of paper translated it described who I was what I was doing why I'm here and you're hoping they can read yeah that's it hoping and some you write some some couldn't but again you know you see a guy looking at a mess you know big beard down looking in pain looking hungry looking skinny you pretty much no shower you need shelter food water so they did every time and they were they were socially howling are people being nice to you that's amazing yeah and that's all I've ever done you know I just that's a human rate I love it I love people they're just so so friendly so hospitable even the UK cyclin the UK is when I was 20 I was raising funds for the NSPCC it was illegal sometimes to camp in a city so go on knock and so on the door knock knock do you man if I set up my my ten in you from God and all by God and please why only had the door slammed on me once it was an old guy probably fell Freni we just talked to me slum went back inside Archie Bunker yeah for some families yeah they were they were fine and that's amazing that you that but did you have any funds like could you give them money for food if they'd weren't willing to give it to you for free yeah what did I take so I took paper and pens for education purposes they love if you can give their their child like paper pens the chance will just be their kids would just be playing with that you know so you have a like a barter thing going on yeah almost but sometimes they just wouldn't accept it they just plainly simply like no I've had that a lot in China as well so but you didn't have any money I did I have cut yeah I had cash with me but you never offered anybody any money for food ah no did that no yeah no maybe I did maybe I did yeah but they were just again they wouldn't accept it Wow especially if I was sleeping the night I would a hundred percent I take it nope no no it stuff it down my trailer they you know yeah yeah and then I learned that was it that I learned that it was offensive to offer them money because you're in their environment and they know for themselves if they see I had a guy once run run me down on a horse back from the distance coming at me at speed and it was all just to give me a bottle to take away with with tea inside was I try again trying to offer you came a distance I've been watching you for 10 minutes governor from a distance from a distance little girl I just to give me hot water tea so yes I learned that was offensive to give the money it's almost saying that I'm better than you I have money you don't but they're rich in life they've gone the livestock the products they want to be given and you're in their harsh environment sounds like wow that's that's cool so that's why stuck to the paper and pens wow that's so what a life-changing experience that must have been yeah that's sitting through a place where you don't know any language at all meeting these people and having them take you in and feed you yeah yeah Elway's incredible didn't renew your faith in people at all what's that did it renew your faith in people it did you know I should say enhanced yeah everywhere eyes everywhere all over the different countries and the troubles that I've done that people have just been absolutely amazing and I'm always trying to give back in return sometimes they'll take you which makes me happy sometimes they're just not interested and they're like no I don't want your money in China there was one that they gave me loads of food they gave me accommodation they then gave me breakfast they gave me three days worth of food to take away with me along the Yangtze and they just wouldn't accept my money would accept anything then I'm like no you know or the best incredible Madagascar was a little a little bit different Madagascar was a beautiful country but down south it's very polished people suffered with malnutrition malaria's big up there because kill I caught malaria almost died from it you can't mean that caught malaria yeah so you weren't unwary and medication yeah I was on malaria medication I came across a community that had this suffering with bubonic plague such an ancient disease and they pretty much said I had two guides with me at this time so they were able to translate the pretty much said stay in your tent you know we've had relatives die we got the suffering with the plague here that instantly made me feel unnerving on edge you know there's rats and dogs running around you go away go away zipped in so they would do the cooking and they bought me this eel smelled a little bit funky but we were hungry me and my two guys we eat the ER for the next few days we were suffering with diarrhea and I believed that the anti malaria pills they only cover you up to 80% anyway it was going in one way out of the other and I didn't have to for 80% protecting me from the strain of malaria my caught malaria and I it threw me back to the Gobi Desert so the symptoms and signs I was suffering with felt like I was just suffering with dehydration I was I was getting weak and weak I was losing a lot of weight that was vomiting and it got to a point where days went by that I was like this isn't dehydration this is this is a disease I'm suffering with something but I pushed on made it to a community that I knew had Overland transport how far did you walk with malaria I think I probably walked for days or so with malaria holy shit yeah it was brutal oh and but at that time I had no idea right so I'm like I've dehydrate so I should drink and drink and thinking I'm gonna get better soon made it to the community arrived at one of the nearest hospitals and she said you potentially made inside potentially a few hours before he slipped into a coma and that's when I realize it was the deadliest strain of malarious fall suit poram so you got four different strains of malaria got the deadliest and he usually kills you within 24 hours but I believe I lasted five days because I was taking the antimalarials and then that one you can eradicate fully out of your system now when you're on the anti-malaria medication and you're shitting yourself so it doesn't stay in your system are you taking more of it when you think you have it I know I wasn't scared sir as well overdose because you can't you know you can't you don't know how much you don't know how much is still in your system how much are you allowed to take of it I won't one pill a day it was she breaths which justin ren was saying that he experienced toxicity because he was taking five pills a day remember when Justin was talking about that he's yeah we actually researched that there's been problems with some troops that get on that anti-malaria medication and they get really sick from it yeah it actually doesn't it do something to your brain yeah remember that's the mother on that yeah that's like a strong dose isn't it what's tougher you want what in time I was on doxycycline eight I think the more along the mat merit oh how do I say how do you say it Marc Maron old family-owned covers you about 100% I think my dad was on that and I said if look win so that's a different that's right so was this was stronger but he was on it and he's gotten it Justin he runs a charity called fight for the forgotten the old wells for the pygmies he's dying three times and what strain is up yeah that was it yeah yeah I remember him talking about it because the three lowest rinsky can actually remain dormant in your system that's what they said with him he got it again after he had it malaria drug causes brain damage that mimics PTSD fuckin a malaria drug the drug the drug us insane not even just before yeah so I became a partnered up with malaria no more UK after that because and one side contracted it I was the look you want to survive and then as I pushed on still had four months to go I got a month one of a five-month journey to walk do servant from to walk south to north of Madagascar someone said eight highest mountain on the way so it took 155 days this journey did and it was 1,600 miles slightly bigger than the Mongolia journey and a lot of it was just machete in hand hacking through the jungle leeches dropping down spider bites hunting gathering hunting and gathering out there - yeah in the jungle you know where you can gather the local so I have no military background that's all doing this which is usually strangest normally a military background to come in to do the survival but everything that I've learned I've tried to get as much knowledge as I possibly can from the locals so I like the mind the mind more Hill community Mongolia how they survive Madagascar what's edible what isn't edible how to build raft etc so well I always try to take a small percent and that's what you can never take us that's so knowledgeable as to what they can eat or they can gather what they can't you know it's a lifetime isn't it so I just had to try to pick up as much as I could in a short space of time but again I was learning as we went we were yeah doing some hunting doing some gathering but we were losing weight yeah at all there was three or four weeks of jungle territory further up north of the island and we had a photographer join us for that one and it got to a point where they just hated it I did too it was the cyclone season we were covering we were walk-in about 14 hours a day and we would cover maybe three miles if we were just hacking through his sheer dense jungle down mountains one day we had to turn around and do you turn and walk three days back on myself it's a phone out different way up the mountain puts into perspective now when you do a you tune in a car right just the utens yeah three days now when you say gathering you mean like stuff to eat stuff so how do you know what you can eat and what's not gonna again we tell you we had the the local guides there so our local guide max he was nails proper Bushmen we were collecting chillies that's a great English statement nails proper his nails proper Bushmen is an American fuck this a proper Bushmen what kind of stuff did you guys gather would eat a lot of fruit a lot of plant-based coconuts mangoes we got excited oh so you see wild mango tree yeah we just scrambled on up there throw them down tenrec the little rodents kind of like head chokes will out the spikes they've burrow underneath trees I see it took a shelter with you there's max that's wild man making this little campfire yeah cooking under this shelter so that was a shelter that you use most the time I was yes as well but yeah depend on the weather we just get get this one I sleeping with a lot of creepy crawlies no Madagascar are you sure how the boa constrictor the snake but again yeah you have a machete right did you keep that bitch gripped in your hands got a machete everywhere that I went yeah we got lost a lot of time as a phone me and Max trying to find our way and we with the team just got you know demotivate they just didn't have it in them and I was the same has me all broken their blurred got a leech bite but again I love anything you know I think no matter what you do you can't always be motivated and grow become be disciplined that was the difference we stayed disciplined and we focused on the little steps 50 meters rest 50 meters and rest I bet nobody appreciates a comfortable bed like you Oh everything's so convenient I get back home I I switched the kettle on I can take a shower I can do whatever it's gonna toast push it down it's gonna pop up when it's done when you're out there you've lit you gotta stay alert gonna stay focused yeah attention to the smaller details for back at home everything's just and you do appreciate it more you get back inside wow we don't know how comfortable we actually have it was great your gratitude for that stuff must be off the charts yeah just from those experience but yeah now I do suffers awesome sounds I take it for granted after a few months of be back just do it yeah throw myself back to the Malagasy jungle and VI look No yeah could be worse that's how many so how many all told of these crazy journeys have you been on well over the past decade now so the three big ones of course the Mongolia Madagascar and the biggest one the most ambitious was was Mission Yangtze I wanted to see a photo of the the Yangtze River you were talking about yeah I think on the insta highlights you've got 2019 it starts with but you can see it goes right from west goes down south kills back up and ends nice showing high so there's these three big giant ones but then there's some other ones yes so there's the Vietnam Cambodia cycle that's trekking Himalayas which was a scary one so we wanted to check the Himalayas they said that we needed to buy a permit but we didn't believe that we did he was like a waif to get money out of it it was we were shoestring budget travelers and we were like now we can do this list let's go he got it got worse he got to a point where it was like you know you can't go there pakistan army roamed the border of indian himalayas and pakistan himalayas so you'd go on your knees if you come across the pakistan army put yeah you know your thumbs behind your ears and say Allah who Rigby repeatedly and that like sort of means Allah have mercy on me so it's at that point we were like should we obey all of that they taught you how to beg for mercy if we came across the the military as damn much of an issue I thought that was his way of trying to scare us to get us to pay for a permit that we didn't need how much was a permit I have no idea I should know this if it was reasonable I would say probably we yeah we we were such it was crazy that's so easy you got like little hammock hammock shops in Vietnam as we were cycling sometimes we sleep in the hammock shop it would cost you about twenty cents for the night in a hammock sharp hammocks or sense the hammocks yeah that's a good deal great that Hey yeah good sleep it's not hot I don't you toilets don't have any but so what MX if you're in a real woody area that seems like not a bad option yeah yeah did you get one no we're only stuck to the hammock shots cuz we're on a bicycle so we were on roads so that wasn't necessarily what's the hammock wire oh you can get super light ones now you probably get one for kilogram maybe even yeah around a kilogram I say maybe even lighter yeah that would be a great way if as long as there's enough trees that seem way on yeah that's uh you're taken away off the ground with all the creepy crawlies yeah yeah for sure did you get stung by any creepy cries I did spiders spiders I was so what went you're hacking through the jungle you've got the jungle canopy and the leeches believe or not oh fuck man how do you know that's okay so then worried I didn't feel it you know when it happened because as you hack hacking through the jungle you've got loads of bamboo shots and they all razor-sharp sting round you've got leeches at the night time you take your top off and you've got apply six seven leeches off your body flick them up then you've got this bite which infected there's a lot of aloe vera plants around that area though so you can just rip off the Olivera you know that's really infected it looks so lit up if you click on that photo with me standing on the rock with a dragon you notice anything weird about that image a bird on your back Gertrude was Gertrude Gertrude the chicken so in order to summit the highest mountain in Madagascar lugar Abreu is is tradition you must take yourself a white cockerel protect it keep it alive and it protects you from the bad spirits and witches of the rainforest the locals say so I'm all about respect in the local culture of course you have to bring a chicken how long are you carrying this chicken around how many do and a half weeks [Laughter] weeks shit yes that's all in my bag shat all over my tent it was sleep on Salman tent wouldn't leave me became domesticate like a little dog okay yeah just followed me around everywhere oh my god oh and a half week chirping in my ear pray for a little bit of rain because when it started raining he took himself inside the back you wouldn't make noises but came right in 14 hours you've got this chirping chicken on your shoulder no is he just perched on your shoulder or do you he's an asshole compartment on the on the back so you haven't strapped in we have zipped in yay can't really get away no that's why we Lam out a lot of the time he should be running training behind us was great and you got to leave him on top of that mountain so that was a swarm day is so ridiculous she's just hanging around yeah a couple of days yeah video this chicken hanging around with you DUI I don't like I do by Jennifer's on my Instagram that is hilarious but yeah goal shooing you're just chilling with a chicken here we go by the way that guy has like woman's dress shoes from shoes man said Sam she'd walk barefoot and it was only one I said you've literally missed a scorpion by a foot those sandals on so yeah like a five year old girl yeah they are right yeah the nails Bushmen look you don't give a fuck like yeah he's just there to hike that is a crazy fucking chicken man that whole thing that's so strange the end of it did you eat it no so we have to set him free on top of it we can't even take him back down so I was hoping you'd follow us down you know built a bit of a bond with a flaming chicken you know but he then we couldn't eat him either because say that the possibly it seems like a bad idea if you eat them yeah no barbecue sauce even yeah unless you were starving right what would you do if you're stuck in you're starving we have we would have no choice which we can and we have no choice and the first but you would be worried about the spirits exactly and if we took him down to a community that community would partly flip on us you know we'd be introducing the witches under bad spirits witches yeah they believe in witches chickens carry witches with them chicken no which is a scared of white chickens so that's why we needed Gertrude that is hilarious believe in witches which is well they've got some they got some mad stories as well so max my guide he said so my take on it is we were we were in the middle of this community deep in the jungle high up in the mountains in the middle of Madagascar you know the fourth largest island in the world and we came across a community and they allowed us to stay in their little wooden shack sort of hot and I woke up about two o'clock in the morning let's say I don't know what time two o'clock in the morning and it's max coming in you should have been sleeping right next to us it was max my photographer me and lever and the chicken next to max Gertrude and he came in with this machete how you're right it was like yeah yeah good and his story is that me lever and Suzanne were all convulsing in our sleep or shaking and then he looks up to the door and they hit the silhouette of this lady was stunned the outside from the moon stood in the outside of the door peering in and he shouted like I you know get away in Malagasy anyway it was freaked out we were all furry still cursed I have no I don't remember any of this I was thinking now come on you gotta be lying it takes the machete and then he chases this witch like figure into the jungle runs about 100 meters when she enters the jungle boom she disappears and then when he walks back to the to the hut he said you'd stop convulsing you woke up ash and asked if I was all right and I was like no and I was like the only one that I felt I was the only sane one there saying come on that's got to be a load of rubbish Shirley like will use sleepwalking suffered with a night Sara Mariel and he said no and the only reason that I wasn't convulsing is Gertrude was sleeping next to me susannah our photographer from Belgium which is absolutely breaking herself then you know what's going on we're always slides have we got the Blair Witch Project yeah so you're stuck in this tent now with people that are crazy yeah the old witches are like peering into the like you gotta be weirded out and then or telling me their individual stories at their which experiences is well but they were very young you know there was a time with my two guides we had many crocodile rivers to cross oh fuck yeah Monegasque is full of crocodiles and sometimes they would they would ask the local community you know whether it's safe to cross and I would say how do they know safe to cross and he replied once well they've made a deal with the crocodile what do you mean they've made a deal with the crocodile so yeah you know they've rocked the crocodiles have promised that they won't eat the locals if the locals let them be and leave them alone so you're gonna cross that crocodile-infested River on the hope that some contract has been signed or some handshake give me photo proof you know they're like yeah do it I'm not doing building a raft but I find it a different way you know than a raft yeah even oh and we did it took us four hours to construct a raft yeah just to get to the other side never knew what was in you must have been shitting your pants they target people they do this it was three ways to cross a river cross where the local suggest if there's no locals cross where there's white water who wrap it there's not that either then yeah a raft is the final option there's a terrifying story about these explorers that were I think they were on the Congo mmm and they they were in kayaks and the guy in front of him got attacked by a crocodile a guy watched the crocodile come up grab the guy flip the kayak under and then pull pull and then pop the kayak pops up without the dude in it boom and then the the guys gone scary scary snatched him out of the kayak yeah ripped him off the popped in the row popped him out of the kayak and the kayak pops up when the guys like what in the fuck he's right behind him why this thing happened oh his boy his boy just got eaten by a dinosaur you know and it's crazy muddy river right it was like fuck what do you do get to shore get that hack out you see that no we caught we were again super vigilant we crossed at the right places where there was white water and weather you know raft here maybe they could have been below but luckily we didn't say we didn't see them there at all didn't say no no crocodiles at all no no and it's all murky water she can't but they can be Anakin 1961 David Attenborough and Madagascar warship this guy's gonna feed it yeah what's he bringing over to feed them they like so they were just cutting it up here wondering so this is the people that think they have a deal with the crocodiles yeah this is long history oh yeah muddy yes so they've been feeding these crocodiles for a long time that's probably the move feed the crocodile so the crocodiles don't get into hunting mmm I mean yeah they want to preserve energy if they think they could just show up to the shore and every day you cha toss them some food yeah look help and the Crocs know normally way that people cross and they'll just try to stay away from human activity normally but there are stories of people being taken of course of course look how evil that goddamn thing was that doesn't give a fuck about you know making a deal with a croc or you know and they were laughing at me saying yeah like course we've made a deal obviously and their life in thinking I'm weird it's like but they also believe in witches too but it's interesting like without the real outside world right would take away the internet take away access to education take away all the things that we think of in the Western world and then in their world like even if witches aren't real if they operate that witches are real they're gonna they're gonna set these like very specific patterns things are allowed to do and things are not they're not allowed to do and that at least gives them this idea that carrying that chicken around is protecting them yeah you know the chickens gonna protect you from the bad witches like I say and they just keep living that like you can't take a chance yeah take a chance and abandon the chicken what if you get killed by a witch yeah yeah yeah yeah it's stuck in these patterns because life is so sketchy there as it is you're surrounded by dinosaurs you're hacking your way through fucking it's almost to protect them as well as the younger by creating these stories there was another one that if a leaf falls if you're resting in the shade high in Madagascar underneath the tree therefore leaf drops it means there's a snake in the tree warning you to get out from underneath the second leaf drops it's warning us about to spiral down and spear through your skull and again I might that's impossible right no no so I just wind them up you know our second leaf dropped and they would scan I'd still be there like sand under the tree but I do love that you know that's why I travel to amazing stories isn't it people living in so many different ways big beautiful world lots to see lots to do and that's why you know a lot is so of Madagascar upon it with the lemur Network conservation I've got 60 organizations on the ground helping to protect and preserve the unique biodiversity so with these expeditions is almost the the record is like the enticement and motivation but if but if I can do something worthwhile and highlight certain issues so with Mongolia I was actually raising awareness about climate change and the effects that has on the nomadic way of life it gets so cold out there now that the livestock struggle to survive which means that the nomads are out of work so they move to the capital city Willem Botha to find work but there's now like a good history Jewett's district you know that white felt tents a ruts around in the capital city and it gets free is one of the coldest capital cities in the world it's cold they Boone what they can a lot of it's dirty cold so the clean coal gets sent to China and plastics so there's now a smog that covers the capital city it's a difficult place to live in the winter only and babies are last in 3-4 days after birth before that suffocating oh my god just from the burning plastic and yet just difficult to breathe and the doctor just says evacuate the city get yourself out so I should try my best to raise funds for the Red Cross raise awareness of actually Mongolia you don't hear go to that picture again make that extra large a look how crazy that way of life is yeah there's all these tents everywhere in the background you see looks like some wall tents but maybe some hard structures it looks like there's a few harbors there yet there'll be different huts they'll just be most of them are just tents yeah there's one building back there a multi-story building scroll back is there see that one yes this is not the story of capital Ulaanbaatar so you have more even even in the center you know it's pretty pretty nicely developed in there but it's crazy right all dirt roads and what do they doing with sanitation and sewage yeah again I don't like hearing that noise yes the only lack access to drinking water proper sewage or internal heating yeah many are reluctant to leave behind the unique millennial old way of living yeah just shitting hole in the ground whatever whatever forever yeah so it's imagine these were all way to go yeah these were all out in the wilderness and the Mongolian wilderness it's absolutely stunning but they've been forced pretty much to move eeeh so in the camp let's stop that please go back up and make that larger again what is that a background City what is that a capital city of Mongolia Willem Botha Wow all that stuff on the outside is most people will Street yeah yeah so you can buy it jobs to like - what - 40 Fahrenheit fucking amen and so they just need to stay alive so they burn whatever they can they can find stay warm Jesus so there's always you know always environmental up my heart first and foremost especially see in the world you see and it's Rorty you know you're out madagascar trekking that's wilderness an 80% of all plant life and wildlife found in Madagascar alone it's found nowhere else in the world really literally walking past stuff on the daily basis thinking you're not found anywhere else only only native to Madagascar giant comet moths this big bright yellow - lemurs over a hundred different species so I do my best to try to meet up with as many organizations as I possibly could it will happen to protect and expand national parks who were helping to educate the local supply different means at work protect the species living within and highlight like the press were interested in the journey but I would direct and highlight you know that the real unsung heroes I call them the people volunteer and doing this day in day out how often is just a lot of you switch on the TV and it's just all negative isn't it but I believe positivity spreads more positivity so highlight these issues all of the amazing workers doing their utmost to protect the environment and yeah that make sure you want to do more as well doesn't it you know yeah well it seems like it's got to change your just your frame of reference shifts you've seen so many things that most people haven't seen just haven't been to that place and knowing that there's mass of groups of people that are living like that that are burning plastic and the wintertime to try to stay alive yeah it just shifts how you view things that's it for sure yeah and you know once you've seen it you can't unsee it right it's one of those where you just want to try to keep helping where you can that's how many people are living like that oh right so there's four million people in Mongolia but probably about three million are in the capital city probably half of that our ger districts nomads we're almost half maybe so more than a million people in tent essentially it's get in that way anyway yet on the air quality just again so poor get imagine that just giving birth the doctors over get-get out the city Wow there's a high chance that you're gonna lose your child and and the people that this day the the older people that must be taking years off their life yeah most likely and then in the summer side and experience in the winter but in the summer you still got the Gerda Street but it's warm we can't see the sky what do these people do for a living a lot of the is livestock so they raised their they yak dairy you know meats that they'll transport over to the capital city but they're just out there live in the purest way of life I remember walking through a part of Montgomery I went over eight days without seeing a single person for eight days like what how do you want to know what the world was like I don't know million two million years ago girlier is the place that you'll get to experience a bit of that you know just wilderness just out there did you encounter any wolves or anything they're wolves they were the big awards as well they were gray wolves I didn't luckily so footprints but you can see whether that was wild dogs or wolves I had a wild dog approached my tent like 2:00 3:00 in the morning just hit heavy breathing footsteps outside my tent I'm in the the gobi desert alone hunting human in days and I'm there in the middle of a tent and knife and 100 torch and the other Sheikh in a journey thinking this is a person outside I'm showering and they're not replying unzipped it's like a wild dog it was fine wasn't aggressive aggressive but yeah it was just so I remember my logistics manager my ulaanbataar based my Mongolia based logistics manager said to him he Maginot quiet how silent it's gonna be in the Gobi Desert and he replied he just said there's no such thing as silence do you mean there's no such thing as silence they have like silence rooms you know torture panic room silence with the headphones and whatnot and he was like I'm not gonna tell you you know you'll get out there and if you've hit the right spot of the Gobi Desert you'll know what I mean and I did I remember I was just again in the middle of the Gobi Desert hadn't seen anyone days and there was no breeze there was no flies there was no people there was just no noise pollution whatsoever and I was just looking around I could just hear this faint noise almost like a a high-pitched humming noise very faint though and I thought it could be like air leaking from my water container it could be my trailer so I walked a few hundred metres away from my trailer and I could still hear it talk with five to ten minutes to figure it out that I was like and as such the point of silence now so quiet I can hear my own body functioning and that's what he meant there's no such thing as silence because when you're at the point of silence you can finally hear your own body ticking over never heared it before never hear that since look what are you hearing just the faintest humming noise almost like it's almost like coming from the inside it's but you can't not not hear it as long as you're living as long as you breathing you're hearing that noise oh when everywhere and I was just like yeah nothing about it's my body it's ticking over so how long you walk in through the Gobi Desert here in your body oh no you when you walk in you can't really hit when you stop yeah yeah and it's got to be no wind a lot of the time it's very breezy those storms you know you see you're essentially walking through a dead area right it's lifeless yeah how much water you have on you when you're doing this with that so my container was 20 litres 20 kilograms but it was never always full that's a lot of weight that's a lotta weight yeah plus you have all the other stuff yeah that's why I have mounted really I think the trail on its own 40 kilograms don't know what thousand pounds 60 70 its pounds maybe on an empty load because it was mild steel she built in my family friends by garden you know really yeah just puncture-proof tires full rubber so it was heavy but it was robust and then the water container here 20 liters 20 kilograms needed at a maximum load yeah so when I was to her effectively I went through the water when I was really suffering with the dehydration so at that point the trailer was a lot lighter it was under 100 kilograms at that point but I'm low on water you know right I've sort of rationing the last remaining dribbles up to where I make it to the community so on maximum load a hundred 20 kilograms water was the biggest issue and always was the biggest issue that's when the previous guy was was evacuated on three three occasions which terrified me as was a Navy soldier desert explorer I was just a scuba diver boy-toy living in on a beach in Thailand you know so I did have my worries I did stop planning Mongolia as well because of that started to doubt myself at the same time I realized you know just because no one's found a way to do something it doesn't mean it can't be done what made you feel like Mongolia was the wildest place probably because it was really close like I'm living in Thailand my initial my initial idea is get a cheap bike ten dollars psycho to Mongolia cyclocross Mongolian walk back the other way or cycle to the stop went in the east and then walk to the west and a four if I did that would have died I wouldn't have made it I was lack of preparation so that's why I went back home back to the UK for the right preparation the right training and again as I say now it's not like Vietnam the cycle when it was all very reckless he was all meticulous planning detailed planning and Mongolia for me just struck me it's that I was on the travel route for two years at this point and I come across people if they say they plan to go here next I plan to go there next one they've come from Cambodia Vietnam but no one had ever said Mongolia really Sasha's fascinated home to the Altai mountains the Gobi does it you got your reindeer tribal community up north you've got your Eagle hunters in the West he camels down south of the Gobi these countries fascinating and from that point on I was just like I wonder maybe 100 miles let's walk maybe 200 as I heck why not go for the length when I started to look for people who'd done it before it wasn't for any record it's just for the fascination that's when I realized I can find any evidence to suggest that anyone had completed the sole on and support walk but I did find the guy who previously attempted and he was a nice guy responded I asked him what the dangers are big list the gray wolves that were nomadic drift is this stagnant no well afters it can sometimes be a problem yeah drawing without got on their hosts though Rome and their big that big Mongolians wrestling's their sport so that's stocky it's in the history as well as in it with chingus Chinggis Khaan as cold as we know it yeah you know but the air they can they could be big in issue and he just sent this huge listen I was like yeah maybe I'll look for a different country maybe I'll walk across the European country or something it's a while I didn't know much about and ton listen to Dan Carlin's hardcore history piece on Genghis Khan right yeah I think it's five episodes and saying you just realize like how do I not know all this like how many people they killed the Mongols you know they're Mikolka half the world or the world and they would rock up in the dead of winter and walk up a Russia's border and they wouldn't they just slit the jugular of the horse yeah and drank some blood I would healed yeah they would they would use that to stay alive then they apparently killed so many people that they altered the carbon footprint of human beings on earth during King it's Khan's lifetime I think that during his lifetime they killed ten percent of the population of the planet geez as many as they don't know the real number they think is the low number I think they were saying like 50 million the high number was over a hundred million people were killed by Genghis Khan during his lifetime by his fucked so much yeah he fucked so much he left so much DNA out there it's a five simple three easy percentage of people have ginga's Khan's DNA to this day us insane as Iceman nuts nuts to that it went away it's like you had this military genius that came along at the right time you know with they had these massive skill with archery and bows and arrows and catapults and just strategy they were just really good at figured out how to take over cities they invented the the bulletproof vest as well don't they did they invent that yeah they realized that the the biggest concerns it was sold to losing soldiers it was from the the air oh yeah I kept taking his men out so we want he came up with an idea how can we possibly chain me or something yeah and it was the hie male straight over a vest I find they had had that before maybe I don't know and it's the shy I was shocked to see V I went to like a museum and that was the you know the Schwartz ticker the Nazi symbol yeah Okinawa had that as well so did India yeah it was a different thing I was way back you know a few years ago it was Hitler just ruin the cool design yeah yeah yeah Hitler ruined a cool design I mean you can never bring that back oh hey man I'm just really into Okinawan karate because I went to a martial arts supply store in the 90s yeah and they had swastika and I was like what in the fuck is this yeah and then apparently was just a part of Okinawa and okinawa karate that symbol was very common so yeah pre-world War two well nobody knew what it was yeah jingis there's a there's a place I think it's in West Hills there's an Indian temple and this Indian temple is covered with swastikas and they had explained that the construction of the temple and the designs on it predate the Nazi adoption of this symbol yeah it was let me imagine look look what Hitler did to that fucking mustache you know that's no one can have that you know all the people in the world it's crazy and he ruined a mustache like not to say that anybody should have it but there's I don't remember ever a time where someone was such a piece of shit that they're ruined a hairstyle but you can never have so many years old I mean think of uh I mean there's no other mustache that's not no other hairstyle no other no just as a shoe thing you just ruined the whole thing but this see you find that Indian temple I think it's in West Hills I think what's the date how long you think it's big one in chino hills' wears chino hills' doesn't look like this no no that's beautiful no this one doesn't look that cool maybe I'm see that's a nope that's different too I don't I think it's an Indian temple I don't necessarily think it's Hindu I think it's an Indian let's just sculpt them it signs all over that's what I searched and originally in this little job that's so pretty anyway he's anyway the use of the swastika for whatever reason the Nazis just decided to look cool yeah walked everything up that's it yeah he did he take inspiration as well from like Chinggis Khaan that's why I used it they won't get almost off the world and he wanted to go in that dialogue really I think that's what someone told me hmm I don't know it makes sense as well we're not worried he was trying to do exactly what yeah Angus Condit but it's interesting that there are these people in history this sort of shift you know of the civilization in a certain way where they just become incredibly dominant and conquer every yeah there's a few of these people throughout history they pop up and then BOOM everything changes because of them I see it and he's a big one Massey you're in this area knowing the kind of history that's involved in this place like what did it feel knowing like how many battles took place on that land yeah you can and fairly recently right yeah really is the twelve hundreds that's it oh yeah and you can see how that the fields are must actually don't bite like guy who run after you know us on his horseback you came to deliver me the bottle of tea yeah imagine that in there in the thousands the noise it would make like I could see him he was a dot in the distance talking about 10 maybe 15 minutes to get to me imagine a whole line of the soldiers you know warriors Chingiz and hyah run into what the noise are you'd be terrified wouldn't ya and this must land as well the step just goes on just rolling fields of grass forever right yeah I'd see a girl in the distance it would be like a little dot in the distance I'd wake up in the morning and I'd know it's gonna send me a full day to get there that's that's comforting i affected Lee you know it save me a whole difficult day just to get there it's got to you're about fast ballsy man to take that on that is a that is a courageous journey and one of many that you've done it's gotta be a weird feeling to be walking around regular people that have never experienced all the crazy shit like if you're around privileged people that are like really kind of soft it's civilized and do you almost want to take them with you okay this will help you yeah yeah no for sure for sure and I think for the younger generation it's great isn't it I'd love to yeah and it's also the the mental health side the mindset you know take someone out let it's a Mongolia with the jungles of Madagascar or towards the source of the Yangtze in I know you just appreciate it you have more faith in humanity if they what a beautiful world we live in they do things like that with troubled kids yeah my friend Dan Doty he's do it he would uh they would take kids that were all fucked up and all sorts of problems in school yeah and he would take them camping just reconnect them to take him up there for a little longer months at a time yeah they'd live off the land they would fish and they would there's a live in tents and you know come back with a reset mindset where yeah stop pushing the little things like caliber toasters OD about you know you know that old expression you can't really appreciate the Sun unless you've experienced the rain yeah some soldiers pression but it really it seems to be true you know who had that I think Dylan Danis had that on his fucking Instagram post yeah really when he was sparring with Conor McGregor you obviously mean Connors raining on them yeah but don't ya well Connors fighting this weekend who'd you ekans go to it's ask you that you can't appreciate a son if you've never stood in the rain so truth so true ancient saying that is a hundred percent accurate if I find Cerrone isn't he oh yeah yeah yes yeah a couple days so yeah today's Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday yeah who do you think I do not know my friend no I never predict fights because I think it might feel disrespectful if we were alone I would tell you my thoughts mm-hmm no but not in this one in this yeah in this one I feel like this is a legitimate 5050 property yeah yeah same I don't know as a warrior if both warriors could go either way well also skill-wise yeah look at this guy look at a bunch of different things so look at damage Age skill motivation and then like past results going all these things yeah when you look at all those things you you give Connor a slight advantage with stand up like with his speed he's very explosive and he tends to knock guys out like not left-handed left has a piss so explosive it tends to catch guys with a lot of explosive punches yeah very fast whereas cowboy is more of a steady pace where's on you but there's also finish head kick yeah has the most finishes in UFC history most submissions I believe he has the most records doesn't he only a lot of records a lot of records against you know he's fought nothing with tough guys like for a long fucking time and head kick it and strangle and tough guys how old is he now cowboy I think is 36 six yeah and Connor I think it's 31 when is it yeah so right does it say I think 31 makes sense Connor has less miles on them for sure but Cowboys never looked better than he's had over the last few years and you give him a fight where you can really get up and this is a fight where it's like oh really I mean this is the red panties night you know Connor always talks about resting is it yeah everybody's gonna tune into that fight a jelly giant fight it's a giant prop and it's also an interesting fight because even though both guys are not title holders yeah it's still a five-round fight that has the same super fight feel that any other world title I would have yeah you want to see that fight it does the world title I've been arguing this forever it's very important it's always good to know Camero who's mon is the 170 pounds fighter in the world it's proven because he has the world title and he yeah they would beat Woodley and then he'd be Coco yeah I agree that that's important but I also agree that that's not required for a great fight what's required is a great matchup and this is a great matchup this to me is a pay-per-view batch up like I mean I am that could genuinely go either way and I'm working the event but if I wasn't working the event I'd be like what is happening here yeah how does that go now yeah how does that go down you know I don't know how it goes down it might be Connor tries to catch him real quick with a straight left it might be cowboy takes him down it might be cowboy tries to kick his legs on the outside it might you know it might be you know Connor takes a slower approach because he thinks that cowboy strategy is for him to wear himself out in the first round so maybe Connor fights light light and easy in the first yeah maybe he looks to prove a point you know who to go the long run just in case well not just that he has gone he's gone heavy as he bolt up more so 3rd 4th 5th round it's gonna be struggling joints wise it could be he could also I don't think so he's I don't think he's bulked up as much as he's not cutting weight right I mean to you starving himself to make 145 155 is more comfortable for him 175 is no weight cutting so I think he's probably gonna be walking around just a little bit over that I know Donald is Donald I think Donald in the video said he was walking around somewhere around 177 178 so that's nothing that's nothing that's a day in the sauna and Don's on weight yeah and then cowboy just rehydrates and he's good to go and he's done it a hundred times he's oh yeah he's well he's better I think he's better physically like without the drain you know and I think size-wise he's better as a 55 because those big giant guys like Darren till at 170 are just a little bit too much a little bit too powerful like but I think that at 170 with Conor at 170 they're both guys were 55 pounds they're just not cutting weight Kelly yeah so there's no I don't think there's an advantage pretty either one of them I think it's great and I think I would love to see that trend or guys just fight at their natural weight cuz I think it's terrible for your kidneys it's terrible your system you know anybody did it involuntarily yeah I mean that's when you're dying like that and you're dehydrated that's how those guys are that yeah the way in and then they have to have a fact cage fight 21 hours later it's crazy yeah made in 30 40 maybe 35 hours later at the most right for cuz they're weighing in the morning and then it's probably another 12 or so I mean shit the fight can they just go straight back to it i hydrated no what should the work they could have broken into that gently yeah you got to bring into it gently yeah do it carefully depending upon how much you've lost of course but some guys there's some guys that were enormous and they would they would go through radical weight cuts right and then for them it was very important that they didn't shock their system Andrea and some guys did shock their system and then they had to pull out of fights their body was like fuckin what do you do there's an over feeding thing that can happen to you when you just eat too much and your body doesn't know what the fuck to do why it goes into a state of shock yeah and you've been starving yourself for so long it's hard you know and I just don't store in the fact that I found like after the expedition's if I weren't really skinny and started eating a lot four notes of weight super fast your body's probably it's doing the fun yeah thinks you're gonna do it again it's amazing crazy your Bible that's the thing they think about knockouts - when fighters get knocked out it's easier for them to get knocked out afterwards yeah really yeah it's not just about damage it's about the body recognizing what's going on and trying to prevent further damage by shutting itself off yeah yeah cuz it thinks you're gonna just take the punishment and it's it's easy it thinks it's easy if it just shuts off it'll be better you say your body just go fuck guys check please let stuff down old fighters you know they did lose their ability to take a shot oh yeah so I would imagine that was the same with all the methods of the body if you dehydrate yourself it's probably easier for your body to go into kidney shock later yeah but it's like hey asshole you got to stop doing this yeah yeah yeah for sure probably harder for you hmm like when you think about these things do you worry that you've done these gigantic ones in Mongolia and Madagascar and now in China do you worry that you're gonna have to outdo the China one the China one was a whole fucking year yeah yeah oh yeah ridiculous really isn't it do you worry that okay now I'm gonna walk across the whole world but if I said that to you no no I'm you know the business is taken off but there's a lot you got the expedition's but then you've got let the books the promotion's my endorsements everything as you know the tools that go on on the outside of that so you don't feel obligated to try to kill yourself no I want to get them yeah I want to get them shorter definitely shorter shorter 52 days is ridiculous but people are not gonna want that man you already fucked up yeah it's like if you meet a girl she's your favorite girl ever and you're like oh my god she's the one and you show up at her house with a dozen roses and then you don't have a dozen roses in there so like this motherfucker appreciate me yeah that's it that's it I think if we can make it just as extreme just as ambitious even more so interactive I loved the interactivity man that's and do it with a good all I wanted it with WWF in in China so I want to work with them again okay that's not wrestling no how the fuck did they use WWF and WWF was wrestling for so wrong they did sue them didn't they I think WWE World Wildlife Fund Hudson they won so whoo World Wildlife Fund one became WWE dusty yeah I didn't know that I thought it was I hate the only recently I thought whoa yes I thought that it was because they had to admit that they were scripted so they call the entertainment whether the federation / world wrestling entertainment it was conflict with the world wildlife yeah that's interesting no make sense yeah well they were first there before Pro Wrestling yeah yeah maybe after I think that just the power its global isn't it worldwide my fund visit yeah all over all over so on potentially just cuz the size of what excites you when you start thinking about your options for potential future trips do you have anything that like seems like really bonkers that excites you what about walking all the way across Africa huh yeah you know something that has always fascinated I'm not ruling it out it's always potentially an option but I've always been drawn to the Congo do is being drawn to the Congo and I was Justin talk my friend Joe yes workers up yeah no for sure because he said he's currently got a new parasite that they don't they don't yeah he's had it for more than seven and I think more than eight months yeah and they don't know what it is oh yeah yeah they think he might even be the first person that they've ever diagnosed with it because he caught it so deep in the Congo and a lot of these people that are catching parasites and of you know and could be an evolving parasite - yeah yeah the congos of others also was there there's vibrant ecosystem of all kinds of different majors so what's he suffering with what success he's got all kinds of problems he's on also all sorts of anti anti-parasitic medication but he's who's saying that after he worked out he had to get into the shower because he was shivering had to turn on the hot water like his yeah good pale and he was shivering I think it might be in his brain they don't they don't know what's going on that's even worse isn't it the fact that they don't know what's going on they don't know how to help him and he's got brilliant doctors have been working with him for months they're trying to run the run these batteries of tacit he detailed it on the show and he's such a nice guy music one of the most selfless people I've ever met yeah while he's talking about it he wants to start praising the doctor and telling me I should get the doctor on the podcast and I say hey what's going on with you man tells me he's like even in describing his own life-threatening illness he's trying to promote people and help him out nazy that's that's the way forward isn't it that's the way I like it man I mean yeah he's got it it's a wonderful story I don't know if you ever heard it but it's I don't use that word wonderful that often but with him I do it's like was bleeding he was bullied when he was a kid yeah and then got into fighting and then became depressed and was a UFC top heavyweight and left he won he was not didn't win the ultimate fighter but it was one of the top guys in the Ultimate Fighter and then he left the UFC and just started to do all this work in the Congo and started to build well so the pygmies and then decided to come back to fighting just to sort of raise awareness for the Congo and start the foundation yeah so he starts his fight for the Forgotten foundation starts his fighting career off again comes one of the top heavyweights for Bellator malaria three times three times and keeps going back and forth to the Congo to spend these long trips out there but in the process he's gotten really sick the last one he doesn't know what he looks great still but he still fucking with him yeah what not was he I don't know I mean they were just gonna find what it is and hoping that these anti-parasitic medications are putting on they have an effect on whatever it is yeah maybe it goes away I don't know man they the worry for me is when someone says they might it might have gotten into his brain I'm like what is that what is it what happens then what something's in your fuckin brain like what's going on in there terrify you see what have you seen the disease yes was it with the womb yes okay I balls yes you see it yeah we played that on the podcast we played the video of it yeah it was frogs right and people - can't people get it people can get it - yeah dude then you're gonna go in there I was that not so much anymore you've just put me off but no this was I was planning to walk I was looking into walk in the Congo before the Yangtze the Yangtze mate made more sense but now after that I'm like no no if I'm going to the Congo it wouldn't be the duration of hike in a river that would take probably over the years shorter so much more dangerous you know got everything there so well maybe we'll just stick to a two-week holiday in the Congo a and plan my journeys elsewhere if you go to the Congo you gotta go walk through the stretch that has that giant chimp living in it do you know that giant chimp was it what's this about the bondo ape the Bund oh yeah it's a larger version of the chimpanzee it's like six feet tall huge 200-plus pounds the locals call him lion killers really yeah they nest on the corner and we got an image of where they nest on the ground like gorillas yeah yeah well this one is not that this is in images of dead ones see if you can go to theirs if you just google bondo ape there's some really good see that one in the upper left hand corner Jamie yeah but that picture mmm I don't think is real I want to say that's fake congos giant bondo 8 we see how that would show those people with the dead one okay good make that larger please can you just make the there you go that is that's the first evidence of one that they ever found Wow and then they shot this thing and they took pictures of but I believe that was in the 1930s and then they got another one that they shot at an airport and these guys are posing with this thing see if you can find them what that's it at the bottom the very bottom that right there bang look at that go go fullscreen the one below it yeah look at that make that larger look at the size of them fucking chimp so that is this thing that they call the bondo ape but it has a crest on its skull like a gorilla yeah yeah it's not like it's not skulls not shaped like a chimpanzee skull and so go back to the picture please that's okay that's big enough but because it's not a very clear picture anyway so these guys shot this at an airport and look at the hog on too but the size of that thing I mean look at the men behind it I don't know how big they are but let's assume they're tiny in their 5 foot 5 that thing is 510 511 yeah you're probably well north of 200 pounds a channel oh my god I rip you to pieces yeah but the cool thing is is this is a weird subspecies that's only in this I think it's called Billy in the Congo and they call it they either call it the Billy ape or they call it the the bondo ape but it's an enormous but sure up stop picture day where the guys are either side holding it up I'm sure I've seen that so Google bondo ape camera trap photo there's a camera trap photo of one of them walking upright and it's about 6 feet tall upper left-hand corner that one yeah they said by measuring this stuff around it yeah they think that that is a six foot tall chimpanzee walking through the fucking jungle and that's this guy there's a guy named Carl Aman he's a I think he's from Switzerland he's a wildlife photographer and he spent a considerable amount of time trying to find these things and take photos of them because of all the descriptions that the the natives have these enormous chimpanzees they got video of one of them eating a Jaguar they don't know if it killed it or if it found it dead but some locals Paul said lots in the Congo is that you know in Billy well yeah I think it's called bi Li it's not a large place but it's incredibly dense jungle it's very hard to get to where for a long time it was just legend but now they have actual video of them they have photograph they have scat samples DNA and then they have the skulls the skulls that are not quite gorilla and not quite chimpanzee Collett yeah when they first got I'm pretty sure they thought it was a hybrid they thought like a gorilla fuck - Champa come here bro yeah and then now they think it's a totally different subspecies of chimpanzee so there is a nearly yulie forest so that's where you got to go bro yeah that's not far from the sort that looks like a source there yeah could you go through there so that area looks small but it's probably awesome Florida the area where these things mean those from a young age you hear all sorts of stories about the Congo isn't it wider than the contiguous United States I think the Congo itself is wider than the United States I think there's more landmass in the Congo there's an amazing BBC documentary on the Congo from many years ago yeah I think it was like from the 90s but they spent a 29 times the United States is 29 times bigger than the Congo okay well hold on stop stop two hundred and three hundred forty two thousand square kilometres but the width of it I think it's the whiff mmm only five million people size of it oh that's it okay no it's not okay it's not as wide it's some it's close Texas yeah it's like it's bigger than Texas for sure it's like Texas and California and maybe like one other states man there it looks like it's like 30% of the United States still a lot wilderness that there was no yeah man and if there's a fucking giant chimp living in there yeah kinds of other shit all sorts all sorts have you seen that a shoe bill bird that lives there no oh my god it's a five foot tall dinosaur of a bird is an enormous face his face is like this big and it looks like like it doesn't look real like a with the way that you described it maybe photos videos oh the face that they have there there's some great high-resolution photos of the shoe bill will you look at them in the eye and you're like what the fuck is that is that real they look like the most ferocious looking bird it looked like that right there yeah imagine walking through wake you up and see you not looking down at ya or walking through the jungle and you part some leaves and that fuck we came across you know elevated elephant boots I think David Attenborough elephant Birds elephant Birds think David Attenborough first discovered it all went to Madagascar because he was fascinated by the elephant bird went extinct I don't know how long ago put their eggs were about there about was half a foot like a football yeah almost like a rugby ball football yeah in in size oh there we go oh my god be painful so big look at the size of that fucker oh look at that goose Harrison with an ostrich oh my god there you go yeah holy fuck and these were big but I came across the elephant boot eggshells they're about this thick as well maybe quarter half a centimeter and thick in thickness and they're just scattered across the southern beaches of Madagascar in their thousands so this thing is still alive no they're extinct it's just the big bags are still there yeah there you go as David a super I think you bought one box in Cardiff which is the capital city there's that many of them you can just go get one this ow yeah just crushed cuz they're so thick or look at that compare it just last forever oh holy shit they're huge how many years ago they went extinct she was couple thousand how many of these things have been capped or collected I'm not too sure don't know how many why did they ever disappear what does it say human people well yeah I believe it was the humans wasn't roll down humans may not be to blame Oh goddamn pop-ups get us every time Wow immense that's huge though isn't it yeah but do you ever see the ones they had in North America the terror birds no oh fuck they had seven feet tall murderous carnivorous birds that couldn't fly running around North America geez yeah pull up terror Birds Jaime's he's searching overtime in this episode I'm just trying to scare you with all the shit you seen your whole life these were enormous birds there's one that shows that look at the size of that thing there's one that shows to really go to back to that National Geographic thing that you just have right there Jamie in the middle yeah I think that was like a CGI documentary that they had done on one verse wolves I only want to click well I think there's so much bigger than the wolves they probably hunted them down there's a size comparison there isn't I see next to a human yes there it's far left okay yeah chasing horses and she's imagine my inspiration back then only a whole different ballgame with it oh yeah no it's so much more exciting but dangerous as well you know what when you're talking about people that believe in which is and people that believe in witchcraft back then you almost had to have some belief system to keep you going because you had no idea yeah what was around the next corner so these terror birds were alive I believe when human beings are alive right when did these things when one of these things alive if I had a guess I'm gonna guess they died out million years ago half a million years ago 62 to 1.8 million years ago whoa 62 million to one point a temporal range covers from 62 to 1.8 million years ago so I think that's 62 million that's 62 years ago okay so no yeah so definitely like dinosaur dinosaur age era so just some kind of monkey chimp type thing was all we had back then yeah I think like that was like Australia Pittacus or something like that what was that what year was that okay yeah I'm over googling you live in woods though and that's that's terrifying you did the camel spy yes where her injects you have like an anesthetic yeah they're like stories of soldiers waking up half an ear missing because they've been being injected in the middle of the night by this big-ass camel spider size of a dinner plate isn't it what is this Jim mammals of the mice Essene which are I guess the same the same era so it looks like giant sloths time period that North American bear time period look how small the horses are holy shit those giant sloths thing avital is that's a short-faced bear that's not as that's that enormous bear you've seen that thing right the short-faced bear she will face bear I haven't seen no bro short-faced bear was the most terrifying bear in all of history short-faced bear was way bigger than a polar bear and super carnivorous and they think it might have been the thing that kept human beings from successfully navigating the trek through the bering land mass until they went extinct they're huge this there's a picture of a guy standing next to a recreation of a short-faced bear and it's it's so big they think people probably hunted them off distinction or they don't they don't really really know to get an image of a short-faced bear that's ridiculous and well known I didn't even know existed until a few years ago oh this is probably so much that's why that's sappy and I don't know if it goes into the details yeah sapien just go into the details of it go with the one on the far right corner right yes that's what it looks like oh you just would not venture outside fucking imagine how big that is root isn't it it's like a cartoon comic book version of a bear like you can't believe we're looking at this thing or literally this thing is standing up these gentlemen let's just assume there's somewhere in the neighborhood of six feet tall this thing is their entire height plus a couple of feet so double their entire height I should say plus a couple of feet that's like their their head this thing's standing up and their their heads are like right around where his hip bone is although he is on a little bit of County nice it's pretty close to 14 15 feet maybe yeah but why they have a mono Mound listen bitch we know he's tall come on exaggerating you're making it look more ridiculous it's ridiculous as it is without putting him being on a mound yeah why do you have him here you're trying to make it even crazier it's crazy enough but super predatory tastes bad yeah between that and saber-toothed Tigers there was an African lion that used to live here look at that fucking we were just the bone of the food chain we soon as we invented the fire wasn't it so he discovered the fire boom change control of fire probably helped weapons Flint yeah they'll say we came first you just have to scraps wouldn't we leftovers from lions do you feel when you're doing these tracks and you're going on these these journeys and you're walking through places like Mongolia that are incredibly wild do you do you try to like envision what it must have been like to be an early person yeah all these amazing resources that you have at your disposal to help you get to this air everything going - yeah oh it would be a whole different kit and everything like so in Mongolia didn't actually even use like GPS because that failed me oh yeah all communities were in different places it just didn't work I went back to boxed and it's map and compass look you imagine even before then as well man encompass you say a fold-up map yeah let's get out yeah we we worth no no no again boxed and it low-budget journey that the Mongolia one was so on so if you lost your map you'd be fucked yeah that but also the the track that I was on as I said that you could be following goat track or camel track and I see a lifeline that leads it to the next water source so if you're in a desert storm for example it make more sense to try to keep going well no just I tried to count down hide under shelter if you lose sight of the track don't keep going yeah so if you that's why I didn't walk at night as well a lot of people say well it's hot during the day and he's suffering with dehydration why don't you walk at night I mean you've got the ammo pit vipers smokes you stand on the back end of them because you don't see it you'll you're pretty screwed but you've also got the tracks you need to be able to see in the distance the tracks but enough because you'll come across almost like a junction a four to five different tracks but you know do they actually need a map and compass to be like well which one which track should I go down you know terrified oh my god I can't even imagine you can't communicate if you come across if you're lucky to come across locals as well pointing in the wrong don't you in their community which starts after up north and you'll trying to kill East they try and say no I want to go that way no no next communities this way so I don't want the next community I want to walk to the most Eastern you know so it's difficult but yeah that was always a threat the dehydration in Mongolia really terrified me you know what happens if a stand storm comers the track up if yeah back to you map and compass and just hoping that you can be aware of the people around you hoping you've got enough water up and you make it to another community or settlement where as the jungle harsh environment that you know and spiders wise snake wise etc but at the same time always got water you can hack in the bamboo and it just leaks out water you know you always got food does anybody know where you are yeah I had a tracking device and especially for mission Yangtze because it was beginners world record we had set off a tracker and every five minutes it come up with my speed so even if I jumped in a car on a bicycle boom every five minutes it's my speed it's my altitude my longitude latitude coordinates the distance covered whether I'm active and you'll do min and you can see my current location within five meters and that was part of the interactivity so I wanted to make this expedition as interactive as possible for the full year of like sharing blogs videos live streams photos getting people to join again presenting in schools getting the kids out litter picking along the Yangtze River doing their filming for the documentary which was securing International International Documentary the mission Yangtze will go out as so that's exciting so all of this was very very well planned very in terms of the interactivity it's like six months of survival six months of you know interacting with all the locals and just share and again out there as best as we possibly could so I was heavily on the radar with the GPS systems the track isn't a lot Wow well listen man you got an infectious sort of way of you notice it makes me almost want to do some point though yeah come join me nowhere but it does make me appreciate what you've done in that way because I can see how it's affected you it's like and what we're saying earlier about things being when you when you do something incredibly difficult like that it's sort of like enhances you as a person enhances your view of the world you can you have just more things you've seen than the IKE how old you 29 yeah for the average 29 you're 29 year old person there's no comparison the things that you see in the way you've experienced them in a very difficult way and very difficult and you know it's it's a very courageous way to like the way you've just asking people for food like it's kind of nuts yeah yeah yeah that's it appreciate it but again you know I normal upbringing normal background so again I come I do all of these school tools corporate talks and that's the main message that I want to portray it's there's no financial background there's no even university degree no military background sort of working through hard work you know and if I can do it you can do it type of message you know is out there just got a hold your vision hold you doing protect it it doesn't matter what what else anyone says and it doesn't matter if they don't see it for you what's important if you can see it for yourself also go for it you have to be a special person to be able to do this all you knuckleheads out there the thing I'm gonna go walk across Africa now don't ya don't don't the city restoration yeah do it the way you've done it the right way that's it listen thank you for coming here man I really really really enjoy sorry - it was really cool and you're like I said your stories it's very very inspirational man but it's also it's it's exciting I like to know these people like you out there no
