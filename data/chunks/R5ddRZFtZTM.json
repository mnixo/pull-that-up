unless gay boom ladies and gentlemen and we're live Lanza Bolden Hawaii man what is up Jill I'm great there's somber times these are the weirdest fucking times ever r.i.p Tom Petty I guess we have to say that too yeah obviously it's it's a ridiculous time and and like everyone's been saying again you know what I mean it's like here we go again another no again another mass shooting and the I think the most disturbing graphic to me was the scorecard like they showed like this guy got 58 and then the guy in Orlando got what 40 something and so because it's like okay you just encouraged the next psycho right to try to set the record you know what I mean like it like it shouldn't be there has to be another way to say it without giving publicity to he killed more than anybody else yeah you know well for everybody's listening in the future this is taking place we're recording this on Tuesday the massacre happened in Las Vegas on Sunday so it's just a couple days ago and we were just going over all the details of it I'm reading online here killed 59 people injured 527 which is just fucking completely insane I mean 527 people shot is that right or is that like does that count people trampled I think it includes people trampled and injured otherwise but there were a hell of a lot of people shot I mean he opened up with automatic weapons into a crowd of thousands of people to where probably you know did any bullet hit the ground like there were so many people the first thing that every bullet probably hits somebody yeah you know or more than one person depend I don't know the the power of the ballistics of the weapon but oh yeah you know it definitely like bullets could have went through one guy into the next hunter sense and I'm sure they did I'm a hundred percent this guy first of all there's a you know everybody's uh this becomes a big gun control argument which it should be right but one thing that we got a really any considerations he had illegal guns these guns were illegal I think for 25 years so this isn't I don't know how much of this could have been helped by making it more illegal yeah you know that's always a debate first the first problem is what was going on yesterday when they say this is not the time to talk about guns of course it is and it did yeah of course it's the exact time to talk about guns and and and I'm not a gun guy in a sense that I'm not a gun owner but I get it with guys who are into guns I always compare it to my love of cars and bikes or you know anything mechanical or whatever I understand it but but the people most of the people I talked to who love guns don't have a problem with like registration certainly don't have a problem with education right and and what I call common-sense gun ownership and that there are some guns that I get it you want there are some guns that you know and again I'm not speaking with any expertise but from the layman's point of view it's like why do you need this semi-automatic military style weapon and in uh you know you don't tell me you have it for hunting or anything else like if there's a reason you want to collect it just like if there's a reason you want to own a racecar right and somebody says why do you need a car that does 200 miles an hour well you may have a reason you want that racecar but you don't use it on the street you can't take it you know onto the streets and and I think that should be that there should be some kind of rule with that kind of weapon that if it here's the thing it doesn't matter if there's a rule this guy there were plenty of rules yeah this guy violated all the rules this day this guy did but I'm just talking about the general attitude towards sales just the idea that you can walk into a store and buy these weapons yeah it should somehow be more difficult you know and again this is my opinion right but I think it should be more difficult to buy a weapon of that type yeah well these are all illegal weapons this guy this guy converted a fully automatic and fully automatics you legal everywhere right here's what's fucked up about this guy this guy didn't have a criminal record he had no army training no religious or political affiliations no one has any idea what his motives were he was wealthy he's a big-time high roller which is how he got this giant suite in Vegas I mean it is fucking bizarre did you see his brother get interviewed yeah yeah and it well it's that's the one thing about this that's the thing about this kind of insanity right there is usually no outward like that like how many people are like this in this country that we don't know about yeah you know what I mean that have as and particularly if you're wealthy if you're wealthy it's so much easier to hide it right because you may have a big house right you may have a compound you may have a you know a camp a place you go camping in the woods that's actually stocked with it you know a hundred weapons or something like that I mean that the randomness of this to me that is the biggest horror the worst thing about this to me is just the idea like you went to a fucking concert like that's all you did you went to a concert in Vegas and you're never coming home your family's destroyed everything I mean and and that is the utter randomness of it that you can't control well that's what's terrifying about it this is which is really strange to me the definition of terrorists nobody's calling this guy a terrorist like what do you have to be like political or religious to be a terrorist like how the fuck not a terror yes this is definitely terror this is definitely terrible because you know you know I it's tera because now are you gonna go to a big event in Vegas are you gonna go to a big outdoor calm you know Vegas in front of these towers right and if someone could do something like this and the polls you know they have those giant EDM parties at the pools all summer that are literally surrounded by the tower of whatever Hotel you're in so net so that's why it's terror because now you have to be afraid to do that well not only that like this now they're gonna have some sort of screening when you go into hotels which by the way why the fuck didn't they have them already how I've always thought this like the airports are so stringent like you go through the airports they check your dick they literally will pat your dick if you hit a Rand you know Bing I'm sorry sir we gotta check your dick your random and they literally put the back of their hand because we just really odd to me it's okay to touch your dick with them they get to smooth it down weird like it's okay sir I'm just using the back of my hand touch your dick like they might have had him grabbing and some guy was just like I'm not grabbing a hard dick you like that this down take it down the other guy like I'm not getting my dick hard by some guy who's looking for a weapon it's just it's weird that they can do that but if you go through the airport right like airports we've decided our places where terror exists right so you have like like I have TSA pre ya mean I have Global Entry you know and I have clear clears the best clear is the best way worse yeah you know we're at work yeah we're to have it yeah you just put your fingers down BAM it's got a picture of you go right through it takes two seconds right yeah but that's just a place where we've decided you have terror right and now are we gonna decide that you have terror everywhere no I don't think so I mean for one thing I'm not buying into the hotel argument like there's a bigger issue here than the hotels and and the issue is the weapons and what can we do about the proliferation of weapons proliferation proliferation of weapons yeah sorry about that you know you start a word I'm too deep into this word I got too deep into a word now there's no backing out all the damn weapons no but that but that's the issue the thing about hotels though and this being the United States the privacy issue is huge right your hotel room is basically your home away from home when do you get what are the privacy rules of checking what you bring into a hotel what's in your hotel room remember the the stoplight cameras right yes and they got sued and people got in trouble because they got that picture taken and the wrong person was in their car right that chick wasn't his wife yes yeah or this guy wasn't his husband one guy sued because he the picture was taken the woman wasn't his wife they send the ticket to your house right he got into a yeah exactly and and he won the suit in the sense that you're there's a level of privacy that's expected in your car do you understand why they it's illegal though because it's it's a third party it's not actually even the government right they farmed it off right they so you have some other company that's sending you a ticket and charging you money right and everybody was like well what do you you guys are having you're hiring people to do this yeah the commissioning yeah a place to write tickets well what they had to do they had to rename the cameras to only hit the license plate but that's not true because I got on the other day you got you showed you sent me a picture me it smiling well it's not to place a little cocky try to go right but but the point being in your hotel room like there's an expectation of privacy right and where is that line drawn the other one has to be drawn in Vegas because people get freaky in Vegas yeah right the other big difference and and I'll tell you a Vegas story about that that's great I heard but the other big difference is when you're on an airplane you're trapped in that airplane when you're in a hotel like you can run you know what I mean you saw run down the stair you can usually now you you compared to being in an airplane yeah but I don't think it's a valid comparison honestly I mean it's like you're still in a box and you're in a confined space but I think it's easier to escape now the thing about about Vegas this guy told me who was a security guy he said the thing about the cameras is you that you see who's with who and there was one particular guy that kept seeing but he kept bringing transgender hookers tomorrow and like they knew who he was he was like a famous guy and they were like yeah we can we could destroy this guy if we wanted you know we did we got because they got cameras everywhere in Vegas right they know who's coming upstairs room they know what room they're getting like super obvious transgender games like yeah like the giant what small player yeah guys built like you what dresses on so you know so I had to give up that hobby no that's the only thing from this podcast that's gonna go out viral we knew it well here's another thing that is a giant issue that uh I haven't heard discussed at all mental health this is really what this is all about this is not I mean this is a gun issue in in the sense that he used guns but then is it a truck issue in Nice France where that guy drove into those people I mean is it I mean there's a ton of different ways to kill people yeah and I'm sure we're gonna see more of these fucked up ways in the future yep but the real issue is a mental health issue now this guy's dad was a psychopath he was a serial bank robber he spent eight years on the FBI's most wanted list here's a question right like is that genetic like does that transfer over like how does that work it could be genetic or it could be that psychological thing of I want to outdo my dad right this this guy could be I mean know this guy's a millionaire right and so on like so he's he's obviously a high achiever but he could have that whole I'm not kidding he could have that whole where he always wanted to do something bigger than his dad or he wanted some approval you know what I mean some weird the kind of approval thing yeah that's just speculation right I mean yeah I mean you could speculate you know a bunch our mental health issue just a health issue in this country that that's a show unto itself right we don't we don't take care of ourselves we don't take care of people we don't provide for the mental health the mental health problem you look downtown in any city in America mm-hmm wandering the streets homeless you got schizophrenic sand and all kind of people and you know god forbid they got weapons you know you who know like you talk about the other ways I'm sure there are attacks that we just don't hear about you know where some guy goes nuts with a knife or a broken bottle whatever else I mean that's one of the big things that happens in places that have stricter gun control and the argument would be that hey you know that's safer for the people it's easier to handle there's you know more things that you can do some guy with a machine gun gunning down all these people but again gun control is not really going to help this this guy was using illegal guns I mean the issue at this point is that there's so many guns out there like even if you made guns illegal what are we gonna sweep are we gonna go house to house and if we do sweep and go house to house man people are gonna resist that because for every one of these Psychopaths that winds up shooting people and and and gunning someone down there's gonna be genuine normal people that want a gun to protect their family maybe live in a sketchy neighborhood and then all sudden the government comes along and says well now it's illegal for you to possess that gun well then who has guns well we're already criminals see I think the solution is in-between and I think this is another one where we get you know this is a problem we have and I can't even say when it started when you have the two sides and it's either/or so it's either you know no gun regulations or far too many gun regulations and I think the solution somewhere in between in my opinion it's always been like why can't we treat them like cars like when you buy a car you register the car right so the government knows like Joe knows Joe has this car right and then when you you have to have insurance in case something goes wrong with the car and you hurt somebody and then if you sell the car to me you tell the government hey I just sold the car to Alonso I'm no longer liable for this car Alonso is liable for this car right now though I've always thought that would be the level of common-sense gun registration well here's another one that goes along with that with guns you don't really have to know how to use them this is where unfortunately if you drive a car you have to take tests you have to pass you have to understand the registration the the rules rather I mean you have to you have to go and that guy has a sit next to you we have to go through a driver's test and I don't see why we can't do that with guns usually absence where you go to a range and show you know like the safety of using a gun and and how to shoot it yeah you know I don't I don't see why we can't do that and even if your family teaches you right they say like in a lot of places you grow up with guns and it's a kid your dad teaches you well if your dad teaches you to drive you still have to go to DMV and take the test so it's like your dad your mom ever your uncle could teach you to shoot but you still there should be some some level of testing to to get an idea because we have you know just a couple of weeks ago where you have a four year old in Florida who was looking in their grandmother's purse for candy and shot themselves and it's like that grandma there's a safety issue with the gun like you don't tell the kid that go get some candy when you know you have a gun I think there's a nutty number like 21 people a year are killed in this country by armed toddlers yeah yeah I believe it I believe it find out what the numbers I think it's 21 people are shot to death by babies yeah and the other thing is and you brought it up like how okay if we didn't have guns then they'd be killing you know with knives or clubs or something like just that idea that that we have to have that discussion like well what weapon are the mass killers going to use that in itself is insane just just the fact that we're like yeah we're gonna have these mass killers we got to have them working with different weapons I don't know on a mental health I'm not even gonna pretend to have the expertise to talk about what it is but it's an issue that we don't spend money on it's an issue not covered by a lot of insurance a lot of insurance doesn't cover any kind of mental health care well here's the thing even if it does cover I mean a giant percentage of the people that commit these giant mass shootings are either on psychoactive medication or are having withdrawals from psychoactive medications so even if your insurance covers it even if you're medicated by a doctor there's like there's a disassociative quality apparently with a lot of these antidepressants and antipsychotics medications that people take that with the right combination of biology circumstances genetics whatever it is people just can snap and they don't have an issue I mean what what are the numbers of people that are on that stuff a giant number right what are the numbers of people that actually wind up and go and do shootings much much much much much smaller number but it's enough that if it happens once a year like Orlando last year and then this year in Vegas I mean what the fuck again we don't know why this guy did this we've no idea if he was on anything but what the fuck is it that we have to do is stop this stuff from happening well I mean I'm sure there were scientists who study it and all but I can't imagine people who can predict it people are getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis this year Jesus Christ there are many toddlers killed themselves 18 more injured themselves 10 injured other people too killed other people that was in 2013 toddlers have killed at least shot at least 23 people this year oh my god okay so we can't we cannot match that with an argument of toddler drivers having run over people no well responsible gun owners that is and and again that gets back to what you you're saying that education like learn to own a gun safely yeah keep it somewhere where a toddler's not gonna get to it what everything everything dangerous safely you know everything and isn't it funny how you you know we do kid-proof a house mm-hmm like like you know they throw in some plastic things that go into the electrical sockets and then the poison and this and that what about the gun yeah throw it in a candy drawer yeah I mean there's a lot of responsibility I don't mean a laugh but I mean I'm laughing at the ridiculous of it and that is true and I think the vast majority of gun owners are are um responsible you know it is another group that's painted with the broad brush right that the few gun nuts crazy what are they paint every NRA member as being one of them yeah and that isn't true you know like I said I know I know people people who like guns and they're not that right but the people who are not that have to accept the fact that there is a population that is that you know what I mean you you can't say that they don't exist because they do exist so yeah a big part of this I think like any other issue Joe we got to start telling each other the truth you know I mean look about about these issues like we everyone has their their side right or their tribe or their team and they refuse to believe any truth you know any any negative truth about their team or whatever you know what I mean like lamb like to say well like we're saying like gun owners okay so there's responsible gun owners and then there's a few gun Blob and just use the term gun nuts and a responsible gun owners have to accept the fact that there's some gun nuts right with the police the vast majority of police are good but the good police have to say yeah there are some bad cops too I know what I mean like like within any within it any try we're comics we know there are some bad comics I don't know if you know it Joe but I'm there but but until we until we do that we can never have a real discussion right because everybody just suddenly circles the wagons around their herd and like no no no not I know it's like yeah no we're not saying all of you are bad right but let's admit within your group there is bad so we can work on that yeah I've seen some tweets from some NRA supporters the last day and a half that are just fucking stunned me where it just shut the fuck up man right just realize what we're this the state of all this is right now and shut the fuck up and by the way there's a video that's going around that somebody's put up about me talking about gun control is not a recent video I don't know when it's from but people are putting it up now about me destroying the gun control argument it's it would be very insensitive for me to do that and to put that up right now and I didn't it had nothing to do with I don't know when it was a I don't think was from a year or so ago but but the idea that these people these NRA supporters would go and tweet these pro-gun messages and get crazy with it now is exactly what you're saying they're digging their heels in there supporting their team yeah and and as many people have been saying and it is a sad truth look if we didn't wake up after Sandy Hook mm-hmm then you know if when 20 what was it 21 kids were shot you know that and people denied that it happened oh that didn't even happen people are calling this a false floor rights oh so if that didn't wake us up yeah then you know 58 people at a music concert I hate to say it but it's like it's not gonna wake us up you know I have I have a thing wait a minute what does the waking sup mean you know I mean wake us up to the point of take some action what's the action a lot of president Alonzo what would you do the the well to start with we have to have the conversation we have to have the conversation about there just like we just talked about there isn't necessary we it is necessary to change our gun laws our gun laws are 2lakhs that's the first thing then what we need to do we need to come up with a system just like we have with cars or anything else dangerous where you you have to be trained to use it you have to register whatever it is with the government and you have to have liability insurance and it and that that information transfers like the big loophole is the gun shows right where you go to the gun show and you could just sell a gun to another person you can do that well the case yeah in a lot of states that's still a case you can do that with a car right I can sell you my car through Craigslist but I'm still gonna go put in that liability thing otherwise I'm liable for what you do with the car like I protect myself by reporting it even though I sold it to you party to party yeah so so it's yeah if I'm in charge we're gonna we're gonna add those things we're gonna get it we're gonna get a handle on these guns we're gonna get to start tracking how many they are where they are we're gonna collect them I think it was Australia and some other places that had those things where looked Australia if you own an illegal weapon like a fully automatic weapon or whatever makes it illegal you can turn it in maybe there's payment or maybe it's just no questions asked just turn it in and we'll we'll destroy it well what happened in Australia's they had a mass shooting and then they put their foot down and they said no more right I'll show you just banned them altogether they totally ban them you can still use a rifle to hunt but the the way we have this sort of fast and loose pilot is the very few countries in the world that have this kind of fat and lose gun policy I think yeah we still have the Wild West mentality well any of a freedom mentality which well Bill O'Reilly did a fuckin how to post today where he's talking about that this is the cost of photo freedom yeah cue fucking and praise no it's not oh it's nice the old dickhead and I'll give you an example Joe like I grew up in New York City like guns have been illegal in New York City for a long time now there are guns in New York City but not as many as people think you know because what happens is when you make it illegal then the average person they don't go out of their way to get a gun no I'm not gonna have one yeah our criminals gonna have guns yes criminals are always gonna have guns but you know the thing about the good guy shooting the bad guy it doesn't happen that often and my personal belief on this is because in that moment it takes a lot to shoot somebody it just happened the other day there was an active shooter somewhere that was taken out by a good guy gun owner it can happen you're right it doesn't happen everywhere all the time but it can happen and a lot of people get their guns stolen or taken away because in that moment they can't use it sure and the criminal he ain't got nothing to lose he's already a criminal you know I mean but it's also probably used to violence yeah a lot of people are not used to violence there's a lot of soft people out there they don't know what to do if the shit hits the fan in any way shape or form they just don't know how to handle pressure yeah and and it's you know that happens in the Nate so they buy a gun to protect themselves but they're in no way equipped to use it yeah yeah well there's a lot of that they're hoping that they can use it or scare people off or something like that but most likely yeah they're not gonna be able to do it but you know then there's people that say well that's them I want the option because I will be able to figure it out you know because I'm not a pussy or I'm not then there's a legal way to get one and you know like you do what it takes to and you register it and again most gun owners that I know and I may be wrong because it's not like I'm deep in the gun culture so I'm not speaking with that expertise I'm just talking about of the people I know who have guns who are into guns and shooting I only have one friend who's doesn't want to register his guns or anything like that most of them I know they're fine with having their gun where's the one friends argument III couldn't even tell you I honestly couldn't I loved him I loved him he says when it comes to guns he's got a little he's got some of that paranoia he's got some of that the government's out to get me the government and then you know his thing with um we were talking about and I know it's the wrong term but it's the the common term assault weapons assault type weapons right and he said like yeah well what if there's a home invasion that's what they use and I was like ain't nobody invading your broke ass home you got you got you an average American with a two-bedroom in the suburbs ain't nobody invading your shit ain't got a safe if you selling crack you might want to worry you might have some cash around a house even if you were a good marijuana distributor there'd be a bunch of cash you're not allowed to put in the bank but you ain't nobody invading your house yeah everybody wants to be John wick yeah yeah fucking take out a whole crew people breaking in your house which certain people over staircases John Wick's badass I love John around talking about John wick when you meet John wick your shit is over that's Keanu Reeves best roll oh man when that's the matrix that scene when it when the gangster calls John Leguizamo and he's like did you hit my son yeah why he stole John Wick's car and killed his dog thank you yeah that's a great movie both of them are great I enjoyed the second one silly preposterous unrealistic but awesome right I mean if you're if you like that sort of John Woo type violence ya know just off the charts ridiculous gun violence but it's cartoonish and and in comic-book write it's not real and Keanu plays it you know he's so good at it like he plays it perfectly but just like just like any other movie the bad guys can't shoot right right so there's 25 guys shooting it right one of them might wing him right-wing crazies shoulder it was getting shot my shoulder a little bit yeah I don't you know I don't know what the argument is for not registering guns that make sense because I mean unless you just want a world where everybody's just pack and like there's a few states where you have concealed and even open carry that you're just allowed just allowed to have a gun on your hip and just walk everywhere or they have the test but it's like like it used to be here with traffic school where you just pay to die and he gives you the certificate that you went or like they do these tests for carrying concealed but it's like you can do it online you know it's crazy so it's well you didn't do in Texas you do your hunting safety certificate online yes a couple places where you do most places you have to go and for hunters safety certificate you have to sit down through I think it's eight hours of class and go through all the stuff then you have to take a test and you have to understand things afternoon that's it does it transfer from one state to the other like in other words here your your license not in Texas that's it for some other states yeah if you have a hunter safety certificate in Texas it's it's good I think in almost every state but I mean that's that's a good thing it's a good thing to be to have to have some knowledge of you know what's safety and it's about it's called a hunter safety thing right it's not even about knowing how to hunt it's just about knowing how to not get shot or shoot yourself or shoot someone else and how a gun works and how all various weapons bows and arrows crossbows and stuff work you know get a gun though I mean if you just had to go through an eight-hour course to get a gun how many less people would have guns we gotta pass an eight-hour course to legally have a gun how many fewer people would have guns it would probably be like thirty percent of the people that have guns now well and also you know they're saying it's the wrong time to politicize it which yeah it is it's time for a politician to stand up to the NRA it's not politicized because every politician is afraid to say we need to register all the guns because the NRA is gonna attack you know they're they're whole Lobby machine but but it's gonna take a pause has the balls to say hey wait a minute I can get as many people following me like in other words challenge the NRA and get as many people backing you as the NRA has the best way I do it for these people is to not say shit when they don't say shit then they don't get the freight they're afraid right now the politicians who know better who absolutely know better who know that our current situation is ridiculous and our system is broken in in the gun laws none of them will stand up and say it yeah now you accept the ones that the NRA already hates right yeah yeah I mean there's again it's the team thing right yeah yeah you're supporting the left they're supporting the right everybody meets in the middle and they yell at each other yeah and this is uh you know this is not a left-right it this is just a cuts another one of those common-sense issues where we don't have common sense like I I joke sometimes on stage like I'm going to Canada next week I'm doing a tour and I had this joke like can you explain it to a Canadian like that should be the test for what sane can you explain it to a Canadian I was doing it regarding health care like try to explain to a Canadians why we've demonized health care why we want to shut down now and you do you can demonize meaning that they're they're anti Obamacare so rather than look for a compromise or fix the system just shut it down because it's called Obamacare like the just the anger at the name you lie like that famous night that Kimmel did where it was like are you against Obamacare I hate Obamacare what about the Affordable Care Act oh I like that it's the same time yeah exactly yeah and he did a man on the street and that's what you know so many people were and that's what I mean by demonize you attach this name to it so people just are anti just based on that without looking at any rather than saying okay like maybe this part it like there no pre-existing is part of the health care plan that's a good idea so we're gonna keep that but maybe that the cost of this is a bad idea so we're gonna change that you know what I mean and working to fix it the gun issue is the same way there's certain freedoms that I underst and you you know the right to bear arms and so on and again it was written in a completely different time you know so we need to update that right taking into account everything that we deal with today well one step at a time if you're gonna talk about the Affordable Care Act if you're gonna talk about health care at all you're gonna talk about what are the real issues like what what are the root causes of diseases you know and a big part of the root causes diseases or how people eat oh yeah I mean if people eat poorly and they consume a lot of refined carbohydrates and a lot of processed sugars and they you know their diet is filled with bullshit and they're drinking every day and they're smoking cigarettes like man if you want to make those choices with your life you are going to get diseases there's a just it's almost inexorable right and you and then you start battling the corporations and you know best food and stuff like that because you know why is it so much cheaper to that poorly but just thinking well that's because it's cheaper to produce but think about the the the actual physical numbers of people that die every year from heart disease oh absolutely it's funny because you know look at the amount of fast food we consume yeah and it's it's like fast food isn't evil there's times when you you know you're on the run and you want to grab a burger you want to grab fries or it's not good you're a whole guys okay but right but it can't be the only thing you eat yeah all the time you saw supersize me right yeah yeah I mean it ain't good no it's not good deal just constant bullshit right well you can't eat that much salt and grease all the time and not have you know anything you do there's a penalty you know so bad you know you know but in excess yeah it's all bullshit that's that whole thing that about salt being bad for you in salt raising high blood pressure and all that stuff that was kind of concocted by one doctor and ran with there's really very little evidence about that I don't know I'm black Jody told us not to eat so no they tell you not to use either but meanwhile it's it's refined carbohydrates that are the real issue yeah it's sugar and everything is in sugar and we are addicted we are sugar addicts sugar corn syrup I mean and then there's also like the all these studies that talk to you about red meat but when you look at the studies about red meaning you look at the criticisms and studies like liddie red-meat get more cancer well the real criticism of those studies is what are you eating with the red meat right because are you eating like lean like grass fed bison with like asparagus and broccoli I bet you're pretty fucking healthy if you're doing that the real issues are you eating burgers they don't differentiate between the two well about people that eat red meat five times a week in the correlation between cancer they're literally not even taken into consideration what they eat with that red meat are they eating with white bread are they eating sugary soda this again Joe this is what we're talking about the same thing because it's like the common sense argument right is eliminated because the common sense arguments quiet so you have the loud the yelling are course of you know that the meat lobby versus to whoever whoever's the anti-meat people and so you know what I mean and the common sense is in between like you said there's healthy ways to eat meat or maybe you don't eat it every with every meal or not every day you know something like that it's not me but but meat is something that human beings have eaten forever fine carbohydrates when I sugars say healthy ways to eat meat I mean what you're saying what do you eat around it how is it prepared right and so on that that can make it that can be the difference between healthy and unhealthy you know chicken you know is is supposed to be good for it but but you know fried chicken deep-fried chicken that's been sitting in the grease for X number of hours waiting for you to counter kick it up covered in flour right exactly is not you know that is not a healthy way to eat chicken delicious besides me to you'll never look at chicken the same way he's doing this take that down he's they'll ruin chicken nobody have an issue with him he did a show where he was he did like 30 days is that was that the name of the show and one of the things that he did was on hormone replacement surgery or hormone replacement like testosterone replacement things along those lines but I know for a fact that the producers tried to go to legitimate doctors and the doctors turned them down because they said this is not how you do it you don't do anything like that over 30 days well hold on a second well so what he did for that show is he went to a quack and his quack shot him up with testosterone him the guy on the show that he uses a study case and they shot this guy up with testosterone the guy started getting aggressive and yelling had his kids and his wife was like I like you chubby I'm chubby we're hopeful we have a chubby family I'm like this is the dumbest fucking example of the science behind manipulating your hormones like you would the way you're supposed to do it is first address your diet number one you take your diet into consideration like what are you eating I mean are you getting these gigantic insulin spikes all day like your hormone levels are completely dependent upon what kind of food you consume so what they would do in that in a healthy doctor the doctor that I was using this uh but he what what he would do is for like the first couple months the first thing you would do is change your diet the first thing you would do is don't eat late at night the first thing you would do is eat healthy food and they would literally check your your blood nutrition levels and say well you're you're low on niacin you're low on vitamin D you're low on vitamin B you're gonna add these to your diet let's see what your hormone levels are like then oh look we have this big spike now we have a healthy baseline now we've done this for four or five months now we know where you're at and what you need and this they didn't do that they just shot him up with some shit mm-hmm so that guy in his show I had problems with him ever since then I'm like why would you like that's sensationalism that's bullshit like what you've done is you put together a show where you've had a terrible representation of something that millions of people engage in hormone replacement well even in supersize me even if you ate at McDonald's you wouldn't eat as much as he did right you wouldn't supersize every meal and you know how that was the deal though he said if they offered him supersize right he was gonna say what they always do yeah they always offered up you know up sighs you yeah but then I've heard people also say they've done the same thing they've done that supersize me diet and tried it for 30 days and they didn't have nearly the negative responses and they thought that they might have sensationalized that as well they probably did I mean it's TV shows and yeah and it's also you know you talk about hormones and things like that different people react to things different ways you know their bodies some people's by and and you know it drives you crazy right that person you know that each junk food all the time but has it's crazy metabolism and they never gain weight Twinkie diet helps nutrition professor lose 27 pounds then there you go yeah what is pull this up just to prove the calories in calories out thing but yeah it there's a caveat in this too though it doesn't have any pull hormone stuff go down let me see it from the top for ten weeks mark how professor of nutrition at Kansas State University a one of these sugary cake gets every three hours instead of meals to add variety to his steady stream of hostess and Little Debbie snacks how munched on Doritos chips sugary cereal and Orioles Oreos to his premise that in weight loss pure calorie counting is what matters most not the nutritional value of the food the premise held up on his convenience store died he shed 27 pounds in two months but here's the thing what is his body fat like what's his body composition stop just grow up go back see like he shed 27 pounds in two months that doesn't mean anything like if you lost all of your muscle and gain fat and you lost I mean you got to understand like if you're not taking in any protein your body's not gonna be able to maintain muscle mass now if your body's not gonna maintain muscle mass you're gonna have less see see his body fat mass index went from twenty eight point eight considered overweight to twenty four point nine which is normal he now weighs 174 pounds hmm his bad cholesterol LDL dropped 20 percent and his good cholesterol HDL increased by 20 percent he reduced the level triglycerides which are form of fat by 39 percent that's where the head-scratching comes from hob says what does that mean does it mean I'm healthier does it mean how we define health from a biological standpoint that we're missing something despite his temporary success he does not remember the net look two birds with stolen take read that one yeah he also oh wait a minute he also took a multivitamin pill and drank a protein shake daily and he ate vegetables typically a can of Gretchen how green beans or three or four celery stalks alright well that's that's a stupid study he's replacing the throat damage and vitamins yeah yeah so he's not living on Twinkies and yeah that's bullshit and Doritos yeah if you just did that without the without the protein and what would have been a different result but people love I mean that's why we're reading it right we're reading it because he got a sensational result and and the way it was written there's the sensational part was the first part of the article of course and you had to go way down before you got to the part about eating vegetables and drinking a protein yeah don't eat little Debbie's cakes all day folks learned anything today you cannot live on Twinkies but every now and then have a fucking Twinkie you know I believe everything in moderation including moderation that's what I believe I think that's an Oscar Wilde quote yeah I think it's a great quote because I think that's good I mean even just have some bullshit every now and then have a fuck you Mac you you know that people have the cheat day yeah or whatever and yeah and you got it it's because you're human yeah you're human and you're gonna have it and some of its delicious it's funny waffles mother did a maple syrup it's fine it's fun every now and then you go to fuckin Waffle House on the road of course I've worked this out what are you great Waffle House have you ever been in a Waffle House when they're on both sides of the freeway so no matter which ramp you come off you don't have to turn the South has Waffle House's it's like the West has in-and-out the South has Waffle House you know they had they put in an in-n-out in Dallas and headlines around the block days for days people like

like wait a minute everyone's lining up for that California liberal burger yeah well if you're the unknown comic and you're playing at a club and Chris Rock is at the fucking arena next door you can't get pissed off someone's got a better product than you let me let me speak from experience to that Joe let me speak from experience I was booked and what's it called the club 29 or whatever that casino just past Palm Springs I don't know if you've ever worked out there now but anyway 20 of those big Indian casinos and and I had never worked this place before so I'm booked to work the comedy club inside guess who's working the arena behind the Kotel have Kevin Hart Chris Rock Chris Rock and I was like even I want to go to the Chris Rock Show like really your idea is to put me and Chris on it the same week you couldn't think of some other comic when was this this was a but it was about four years ago but it was just one of those things you know his pictures on you know on the tables and everything I was like I want to go to the Chris Rock Show I go people at my show like why are you here why don't we all just go out and watch Chris yeah Whataburger step your game up there burgers are

what a fry is mm-hmm and then they have cajun fries yeah yeah yeah no five yes well that's why they're in a game what about what do you think and shake it suck my dick I said it right here peanuts unless you got a peanut allergy of course which is another thing we're talking about have different people react to different things the peanut allergy is always like the best argument there's a good new thing and I've only heard this recently actually this year the first time I heard it where they're like you can't have anything peanut related on an airplane because a passenger has a severe peanut allergy yeah well some I haven't heard that until this year well I've heard it when you crack open a peanut you know that dust the kind of goes in the air that shit kills people Wow which is nuts yeah majesty you didn't like somebody he got right up to me crab in their face that would be some CSI shit like they'd have to figure out how you killed him who opened the peanut yeah you know I was thinking this is a terrible thought but I was thinking this about Tom Petty I was like a wonder if Tom Petty heard the news about Vegas and had a fucking heart attack you imagine if that guy killed Tom Petty from a distance could happen is that how did Tom met he had a heart attack did he no but I mean what time was his heart attack was it Sunday night or was it Sunday day and then how old was he 66 man that ain't all that real old yeah 66 the one was still fucking kicking ass in action movies yeah still is I think Liam Liam Neeson was taken I'm just thinking if I'm a thug I can't let a 70 year old whip my ass there's a certain age to age like no me you I don't care how long you've been fighting what training you have listen old man I'm in my thug prime who's like the oldest guy who legitimately makes sense as like a stone-cold killer in a movie it was it Bronson well Charles Bronson in death wish he was already here is early like Fat Charles Bronson yeah he got in like the chubby face and couldn't take his suit off I was like you go back to like the hard times Bronson it was like 50 right he's gonna shred it shredded I'm just I'm trying to figures anyone in their 60s legitimate to whip your ass like physically not not shoot you but George Foreman fuck you up yeah he's a puncher yeah George Foreman's probably 60 years old he'll formulate you know gonna fight Stevens re quiet did he call Steven Seagal George Foreman what yeah get the fuck out of here Oh F the sigalas craziness what is what was the Gaul talking crazy like you can do anything you want ten arounds something like that mmm that is so ridiculously stupid of Steven Seagal because all have to do his pour water on his head and that black shit would just run down to say what does it say George Foreman just challenged Steven Seagal to a no-holds-barred fight boy that would be a goddamn disaster 68 year old boxing legend use Twitter to challenge sixty five-year-old action movie star versus sixty five-year-old cigar yeah I bet on form challenge you one-on-one I use boxing you can use whatever ten rounds in Vegas no weapons hand to handling that would be a fucking disaster first of all George form is so big that he had this shale defense that he adopted later in his career yeah yeah well he was right and he was so big there was so much arm there you couldn't stomach good luck with all that you're not gonna hurt him to the body and then he's got these hands that are literally like canned hands yep and he just bump he was just jab people into a coma did you see that a guy I think he's playing for the Milwaukee Bucks his hands surround the basketball did you see that he literally his it's like a soft ball in his hands there's people that are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger I mean go back to like Jack Johnson who was a giant when he won the heavyweight championship he's like sex too right who's that why do you got a big guy you know my big hand moment earlier this year I did a show and wow look at guys hands yeah show them around the basketball if you have that picture that looks cartoonish that doesn't even look real good that guy must have a dick like a palm tree telling you Jesus Christ it's two feet from his middle finger to the base of his hand that's insane yes yes and my centimeters my hands the same size as Jerry Rice's so yeah that makes sense I got that goal buried it look at that well how old is he then high school Jesus Christ Wow they called the Greek freak yeah the Greek freak he's amazing he's he green yeah Gianna something I can't see one takubo well that's a name oh and he's a hell of a ballplayer tick that's what it ought to kupo anta tongue khumba ant attack on ant attack on poo so he's from Greece yeah yeah interesting yeah I mean like what if that guy gets ahold of like a Gabrielle Reece oh she's very married but you know someone along those lines a large woman there's a large like the woman from Game of Thrones I did shoot some super sperm in there Chinese generations gonna be a hell of a I mean the one that with animals will support what support would that kid you a nice pointy wants yeah fuckin sporty once everybody get out of the way what about Erin judge six seven 280 million baseball you see how the bat looks in his hand the bat looks like a little twig like he's swinging the kids bat well you seen that though that's one thing that's interesting like that guy in the past might have gone into football yeah but now guys are looking at football and like fuck that I don't blame them I don't know this guy's at are retiring at twenty four twenty five years old why am I gonna have a three year career with possible concussion damage and everything else when I could play baseball or basketball for ten years and and leave with a hundred million dollars and just fuck everything that moves yeah they did a study on former basketball players or former football players rather in a hundred eleven players a hundred and ten of them had CTE geez 110 out of a hundred and eleven yeah there's the guy who was the doctor behind that movie concussion he was recently talking about OJ Simpson because OJ Simpson was released and he's like there's a hundred percent chance that guy has and they've even said that OJ if the trial was today his doctor said that he would introduce CTE as a defensive defense which is crazy because then you have to say he's guilty I didn't do it you know until he wrote a book how I did it yeah if I did it that was a yeah I know but if isn't tiny I watched the the cuba gooding show last night the FX show I'd never seen no you'd never seen no it's great it was a great great yeah great show you know it's weird watch managed to revisit everything the night when the oj got out it's like just go away yeah just go somewhere quiet don't say anything play golf and keep your mouth shut he's not going to and you can't he's he's addicted to love yeah you know he's addicted to people liking them and there's gonna always if he goes to Florida there's plenty of fucking stupid people in force don't take him right now yeah easy or he's going back to jail he's gonna do something stupid and violate his parole do you think he'll do that though that's seventy years old or whatever he is well if he does anything other than shut up he's either gonna die or go back to jail you know I mean like there's no there's no positive that's gonna come out of him making public appearances you know writing a book going on a talk show circuit like no like you're 70 years old live out the last 10 15 20 years what have you got let's just lipid isn't there's money somewhere right because Florida they couldn't take his money like that right there so yeah he's got money somewhere just just quietly fade away you know let people people might recognize you when you go down to play bingo at the home I don't you just wave thanks mo bro you know but but yeah and there's no I don't think there's any way there's no positive public appearance know that oj could make know the Attorney General I think it was Florida was saying that she didn't want him hopping around her state playing you know playing golf which is by the way it's not your state honey yeah just let you know you know that she's a top cop and she can prosecute him for any made-up shit she wants yeah but you can't do that that's not America see when someone gets a fucking release right you're released you're on parole you're released from prison you can't just target someone because they're famous and they've been released like through you you're dealing with a million fucking murderers are getting out every day you're dealing I'm not a million obviously but you're dealing with a shit ton of people that were armed robbers and they've committed assault and rape they're getting out all the time but again Jill you're talking about and we were talking about this earlier theoretical vers reality right in theory this is the United States of America and you have freedoms and they can't do that to you in reality hell yeah they can do it because it's like say if they follow you around right if a cop followed you all day every day you would break the law you think so you yeah you don't know how you know it might be jaywalking my hard drive it might be speeding it might be whatever you know what I mean but you would do something that would violate some statute that you didn't know about you might would you might be well maybe you you know I got that whole driving while black thing going for me well y'all so crazy motorcycle rider that's true I got that last time on the podcast we're talking about a bike that you had it was but you had some crazy giant wide Japanese Superbike it's triumph it's called the triumph rocket three is that a triumph yes mom it's a 2.3 liter motorcycle but it's so it's it's the engine is bigger than a lot of car engines and my keys oh no my kids know the bike it felt like no no it's from a long time ago man it's from like ten years ago you had uh you had this crazy wide bike that was a Japanese bike maybe it was a Suzuki Hayabusa no no it wasn't one of those like rice rocket bikes was it my Ducati I had a custom no daddy no it was a Japanese with Japanese but it was a big-ass cruiser it was one of those oh I know what you're talking about you're talking about it's called the Valkyrie wound are you Andy yes oh yeah remember that yeah yeah that as a matter of fact that's what I had before to try and process right I couldn't remember eCall Joe yeah that bike was that bike was one of a kind nothing looked like a spaceship yeah you were in that Tron movie you know you know that's about Corey but look up are you any ruined yeah so there's a different volcano we ruined was a custom version they make Honda yeah what's a Honda I think that's it yeah you had you had that yeah I had that that bike was bad at you know how to bring it do you know you to the factory yeah yeah I saw that thing I was like part of why I got rid of that bike Joe I'll be honest polishing that thing that thing had more chrome in more places I'm telling you everything on that bike was chromed that's the engine the entire front end and I was like man I can't spend all day cleaning this thing it was a great bike though well it seems like a bike where if you accidentally laid it down it would take forever to get that thing back up beautiful you know you know who bought a group of those who Looney George Clooney Clooney bought six of them why for him and his buddies yes for him and his buddies karate bucks six up god damn is this you know like you know fat ass like that yeah look how cool that paint job is on that thing yeah he did that thing that's custom paint no make that thing no they only made it for they made it for one year it was like a limited yeah like a limited release they did it for one year he must have been stupid fast it was pretty fast it was yeah it was pretty fast for a loser it was very fast now those comfortable to ride like the idea it's comfortable so Mike was he an off right now right now I have an Indian chieftain right and this is my first like American v-twin kind of cruiser and I've never been that guy like you know I've never had a Harley or anything but I saw this bike at the dealer and it was just absolutely beautiful and I rode it and and I guess I'm getting older it was some about leaning back with my feet forward and the stereo playing and I was like oh yeah yeah I like this shit like I I remember leaning forward like being a jockey and going fast and now I'm like now this is me you like cruising now I like cruising I like touring I like going on on trips trash there right there yeah the red one up in the top middle that's it man look at that thing I got it outside when we're done I'll show it to you back to the back do you like keep stuff in these things what do you keep yeah you can carry keep that that's what I use for whatever you know what you keeping in her purse Wow that's because this guy told me that they call those baggers that's the bike and he said man chicks love baggers and he ain't cater stuff and they loved it they loved it but now that's a big cruiser right you're loud bike no no it's not loud it it'll be a little louder next year I'm gonna put pipes on it this one and raffle but I'm not going I'm not going crazy like straight pipes that you know set our alarms yeah and now I just a little little bit louder now when you have a bike like that like the idea is that they're slower right they're more comfortable yeah you know what that bike is man that bike is Sunset Strip and PCH ah just cruising you know yeah that's what good yeah that's what that is comfortable you look good you got stereo and you're just chillin now when you say yeah a stereo like you can hear it oh yeah yeah so you're blasting it so everybody hears it yeah weird it's a little weird like I don't like being that guy when I'm at like yeah you know what I mean but but when you're riding along nobody's really hearing it that much you know you're passing people but yeah when you're sitting at a light something and I know guys who go with you know a thousand watts and they their bags their saddle bag is a speaker like they're they're broadcasting you know I don't want to be that guy but it is kind of nice again this is stuff that I hadn't done until I got this bike right but now I'm realizing like this shit ain't bad if I'm cruising down you know my Holland or PCH or something like that and I'm listening to music I'm like yeah I can you hear the music over the sound of the engine the the speakers are loud enough systems loud music you Blair mostly jazz I'm chillin jazz jazz and hip hop those are my two you really do like jazz legitimately love jasmine I always assume the Jazz is one of those things that like weird dudes put on to pretend to girls that they're into fistic ated he likes Jones there's some jazz that is like that and I'll admit I had to like learn that level of jazz like there's a level of jazz that's like like this girl I dated she would be are you listening to that sketchy jazz shit and I got you that's the shit you have to listen to to learn because in the beginning only me other musicians understand it right I know some jazz musicians and they were breaking it down but there's a lot of jazz that's just I don't know I don't know how to explain it's music played by master musicians that's what that's why it's good because when you listen to a guy like Robert Glasper who's really hot now or hurry Hancock like when you listen to Herbie Hancock play a piano you're like oh that's how it's supposed to sound you know what I mean because he's just he just has mastered that instrument you know so so yeah I listened to some of that and and it can be there's times when it's out there and it's meditative and shit like that but don't get me wrong you might you know you might pass by I might be cranking jay-z you know I love hip-hop leveled school hip-hop this shit I grew up with the old 80s now you play music at all I know so a lot of people that learn into jazz actually play music yeah a lot of them are I I think I appreciate it because I have no musical talent so the so masters of it fascinate me and in last 10 years I've been doing like these jazz cruises hosting jazz festivals and this and that and I found it's really true well you know this because you know musicians to that thing about every musician wants to be a comic yeah and every comic wants to be a musician I definitely have this mutual admiration thing with with jazz artists like man I wish I could play that and they're like man I wish I was funny yeah well there's there's something about they can not jazz necessarily but people in bands they can play the same shit forever it's one thing you know I can't do I get on jazz artists about that old-time like they'll play like there's a track called so what by Miles Davis right classic jazzy like Miles wrote this in 1959 and you can play it and you're considered brilliant hmm how does that shit work how does that work at no point can I do Eddie Murphy's goody goo whoo and suddenly be that Alonzo is a brilliant comet you hear that goodie Google 59 yes yeah 59 comedy you get fuckin rocket it's not weird like coming for 59 is terrible yeah try listening just like old Lenny Bruce oh I'm a huge Lenny Bruce fan I have framed Lenny Bruce posters in my home but if you try to listen to it today it's the the culture has bypassed these ideas yeah it was revolutionary and groundbreaking at the time because the culture was so childish and infantile and it's its ideas an understanding of like weird concepts or abstract concepts or things like censorship more or racism or any of the things that Linda Bruce covered then when he was covering them back then they were groundbreaking but now like his a lot of the stuff he's saying is just duh but I think I think a lot of those comics cuz years ago we were having this debate this is before rape okay we were having this debate about Cosby you get you got to put that qualifier in you always have to and it was if he started today would he make it and I argued yes because his comedy would have been different like he's still you know what I mean like like Lenny Bruce he wouldn't have been talking about the things he was talking about in 59 or 60 he'd be talking about the same shit that we talked about today right but he still would have had that brilliant comic mind and he still would have been who knows what he'd have been talking about cuz he'd have been kicking down doors today sure so he would have been just at some you know different but I think those comics most of them that's the brilliant definitely the brilliant ones the top ones would be funny today they just talked about the topics we talk about 100% yeah I think so too I think it's just a matter of the time and the error that they existed in and but conversely if you took someone from today like if you took Dave Chappelle and yeah Dave Chappelle doing stand-up in 1960 did probably like what the fuck are you talking about yeah what are you doing you're talking about a baby selling crap oh you told us yeah might maybe he has kids d99 Chapelle in 1959 I never would have never well we're just well it's just it's not relevant right it has to be relevant to the time you know a brilliant comedian of today trying to talk about the same subjects we talk about today just you you know I mean that's the weird thing about comedy really does reflect the error in which it's projected it's absolutely it's the culture that we're in I mean it was you know it was vaudeville right when when all you had to do was juggle and hit a guy with a hammer he would do like Japanese impression and put like a cigar in his mouth mm-hm you know the buck-toothed hole why I never understood that like how does that represent Japanese people the buck-toothed thing who was it - the debt there was a guy who did that like his thing I can't remember but I know you're talking about some picture in it yeah yeah it definitely definitely what we does well just in a time I'd say even at a time we've been doing it I mean I started in 93 and it's definitely different now then you know then it was then that was Def Jam Yeah right when I was excuse me when I was started out Def Jam was it and and I caught a lot of Hell being a black comic who wasn't a Def Jam type al-hamra it was like what the hell you talking about right it was like I'm on I'm on NPR you know which now is cool but in 94 probably wouldn't have been the coolest coolest thing yeah isn't that interesting like you you get expected to fit into a certain genre right yeah and then there's like there's markets for that genre yeah like when Def Jam was big like there's a market for that kind of comedy a lot of you saw a lot of comedians like mold themselves into that market yeah and I always thought and and I was lucky and that a few of the pros like I remember like Cedric the Entertainer was one and Tommy Davidson was another and George Wallace was another who told me like just dude like do you like you cannot like don't worry about that shit because they're the only thing worse than being a deaf g2 would be not nuts it would be a fake Def Jam comic that was the only thing worse than not fitting in would be a fake def jam like for me to suddenly pretend like I grew up in Queens you know I grew up in Saint Albans Queens working-class black neighborhood you know my parents both had jobs where we had a house with a yard and a two-car garage and a whole bit right not rich not poor just working-class if I have tried to come at you like I grew up in the South Bronx and I had friends from the South Bronx you know I had friends from bed-stuy but it would have been fake and you'd have seen right through if you were from bed-stuy you'd have seen through my ass in a minute you know I might have fooled you if you were from you know I don't know Colorado or some shit Davidson what happened Tommy Davidson where's here Tommy's still out there Tommy's still in and doing his thing i unwary Cajuns once in a while but I'll always have love for Tommy Tommy helped me when I was new Tommy took me on the road with him for a summer and I learned a lot and he introduced me to clubs that I got into you know Tommy was Tommy was a brilliant talent I'm the drug thing really hurt Tommy he went through that phase that era and and I think what hurt him with that was that he developed a reputation for unreliability where he you know people like is he gonna show up and it was the worst thing to hear but talent wise he was just amazing like I would watch Tommy worked some nights when when Tommy did a story I don't know if how much you've ever seen him on stage and when I got to the store when he starts becoming each different character in this story with his voices and singing and shit brilliant yeah really I used to watch that and just be blown away that he had that kind of talent the fucking drug thing man that's the the drug to that cocaine drug you know when you talk about the drug thing it's very rarely the pot yeah it's always the drug thing it's like Rob what's he doing you know meth coke yeah it's a speed wuns right yeah do people or the booze yeah the booze do people into well a thing and you know we talked about on the last podcast I went through the coke and a crack thing and what happens when you get addicted to drugs like that they just dominate your life yeah so you can't you can't do anything else because the drug dominates and now it's heroin right now you got people on oxy and heroin and you know you literally see him in an odd I was in Cleveland early this past summer downtown Cleveland you know Ohio's got this like one of the bad opioid things and you would just literally see people on a bench just nodding like going into a nun's like holy shit this is you know this is I mean it's been there but but when people are sitting out on a park bench just going into a nod we got a problem and yeah well the the problem in Massachusetts there was a Anthony Bourdain show he was doing about it recently where the problem in Massachusetts was that they were giving out pain pills to people so easily yeah and people got hooked and then when they try to get off the pain pills because they were tightened down the read the regulations on them then people start turned to heroin right and that was the thing in the 90s with the opioids when when they came out with oxy cotton and all those related drugs they told the doctor it's not it's not addicting go ahead and write the prescription and now some of those pharmaceutical companies are paying like big lawsuits because they knew back then that it was addicting yeah I was just talking to another friend of mine the other day about pain pills got addicted he was recovering from a surgery they gave him some pain pills and then he had some complications with the recovery I think was a demon I can't remember sunnier and maybe as a knee surgery they had to do a read another surgery they had to go in and because there's some scar tissue p-ting there's like you know four weeks later they go and do another surgery they give him more pain pills so now he's on pain pills for three months and then he tries to just get awful yeah and he's sick yeah you that you have to be taken off of them medically you're not just go cold turkey some people do but anymore then no one told him no nobody tells you nobody told him anything and he's all of a sudden a heroin addict what in the fuck happened I'm an opioid addict I had a tooth extracted and they gave me like I don't know 20 vicodin just something you know for the week or something that's like it's a tooth like I'm gonna be okay it's gonna sore for a day and I'll be a butt but it's what they do it's it's how they write the script and then you get people who will sell them right who will be like oh I got these pills yeah I can just sell them I sold mine yeah well my knee operation I took it was either vicodin and percocet I can't remember which one it was but it made me so fucked up that I sold them to a friend of mine of the pool hall so I can't take this shit yeah I just like me in a coma I took back it in once in a the same way I got sick I didn't like I didn't like the feeling and I didn't understand why people did yeah exactly this is the high you want I have a friend who's a musician who is really creative on vicodin he said he writes music on vicodin I'm like what like what yeah he plays classical guitar he takes vicodin and just zones out and writes classical guitar music I'm like I don't get it man I felt so stupid when I took that yeah I didn't I didn't like that I didn't like that feeling but I don't mind being in a little pain it's like I get it I'm hurt yeah man there is a reason you have pain right your body's saying hey some shit's wrong here exactly pay attention to or don't use this don't use this body part right like if your elbow hurts assign your body saying okay don't use the elbow for a week okay don't pick that up it's just so another reason not to be in the NFL people just need to be comfortable being uncomfortable just relax just understand that this is a this is gonna make you appreciate the good times right because like right now you're in a bad place but that doesn't happen man we go a long time ago stanhope did a bit about that right about anything you feel there's a drug for it hmm like any physical or emotional feeling you have I didn't see that before it's a long time about it yeah but he's right try anything anything there's a drug to make it better when I got my nose fixed I got a deviated septum I operated on they pulled out a bunch of scar tissue and shit but I'm telling you there was no pain I mean it was uncomfortable for as much of time as they had the packet you know it was packed up with gauze or these like foam things with tubes hanging out that dripped like the blood was dripping out of it that was uncomfortable but I'm what I mean uncomfortable like doesn't feel good to shove both fingers up your nose and leave him there I wasn't in pain and my doctor was pushing the pills on me he gave me two different prescriptions for pain pills for vicodins and I think the other ones were oxy so I was like man this doesn't hurt and he's like well it might hurt later I'm like how's it gonna hurt like what's he gonna get something's gonna change it's gonna change like how's it gonna hurt later like right now it's just like my nose feels uncomfortable it's not it's not painful though I just I think people just you get told by your doctor that you're gonna be in pain and you might be uncomfortable so I have some pills for you know like Jesus I better take these pills before it gets bad before I can't take it anymore let me start freaking out I will say this I did find out the medical use for cocaine and it absolutely works numbing yeah I had a ripped cornea oh yeah playing ball this guy finger ripped across and and I'm talking the kind of pain where you just hit the ground like you're just done like your body is like don't do shit you are in man I went to the doctor and that's what they use they put liquid cocaine eyedrops Wow my eye and the pain disappeared instantly I was like doc can I any was like now we we don't prescribe these you have to come in and we have to put them in the eye but I will say you know how when you you go to the doctor and you're like make it better like that's always your dream like just make it better so I can leave he made it better the pain just went away they put lidocaine up my nose when I got the gauze sucked out and they pulled the plugs out and he sprays lidocaine out there I'm gonna had that stuff a couple of times one time from a real bad sunburn I put lidocaine all over my back and it's the same feeling it's like you never do I'll never do it again I'll just take the pain because the feeling that you get from lidocaine is just this gross weird like you feel sketchy like your heart feels sketchy like who you feel like you don't want to eat but you know you probably should it's a lidocaine gives you a very weird feeling and I I was eating that night I went to a dinner and I was eating at the steak place I was like barely hungry I'm like why do I feel like shit and then I realize like oh they pumped that fucking lidocaine in my nose oh so was in it went in your system my new junior nose but it went you swallowed it yes I could taste it could taste it in the back you know see they're pumping it up your nose cuz I should just help me yank that stuff out just pull it out because it was really no big deal right you know but they they have you convinced that you're gonna be an agony you know yeah and different people have different pain tolerance yeah you know some people are pussies yeah yeah some people gay and then others can you know can take it well that's the thing about jujitsu like jujitsu doing jujitsu for 20-plus years whatever I've done you're always in pain you just you you just get used to compartmentalizing like oh my arms fucked up yeah just accept it and deal with it because if you took a pain pill every time you were injured from jujitsu yeah you know you're a junkie yeah you're gonna be a junkie you know that's why I avoid you Jitsu good yeah when I just play basketball all the time though that's why it was it was like my knees always hurt or something you know and the the funniest one we were in this basketball league and everyone on my team was like mid-30s you know 30 to 35 40 and we were playing these kids these kids were like 19 20 and we walked into the gym and they get right on the court they're running and our whole team is sitting there you're rapping shit up with tape you're rubbing bengay or some whatever but you got like our whole team is on the bench just warming up like rubbing and rapping looking at them like well we beat them you know we were veterans we know what we're doing but it was such an obvious thing at the beginning like you fellas we gettin old and now all of those guys I used to play ball with all play golf that's the retired sport if I can't man please well playing ball on hard concrete to like those hard surfaces that shit has got to be terrible for you let's stop and start and bouncing around and well doctors will tell you the knees are made for sports you know especially not running and jumping sports but when you're when you're a kid nobody's gonna tell you not to play ball writing you know I mean that like it's funny to me when I'm watching college basketball and they're like these guys are tired I'm like no they're not they're 19 in there playing basketball if they weren't here you know where they'd be playing basketball there are a lot of things they're not tired right now they you know they may have lost concentration they made this that the other but tired you're a 19 year old athlete you don't kind of shape those guys are in yeah like they're not tired well basketball on a hardwood floor seems to be another little gift yeah it's got a little gift to it and you need the shoes are so much better now I mean you ever put on a pair of Converse Chuck Taylors how am i laughing down imagine playing like imagine running and jumping in those well there's an honor for you because you develop strength in your feet like that what you're dealing with with these basketball shoes is essentially like a big rubber cast and that these rubber casts and all the cushioning and all that jazz actually weakens your feet I don't buy it because I can't I did I have this one pair of Nikes I don't know what they are they're something but they got the full air so and they're the only shoes I can run in right you today but you weigh what 240 yeah 250 yeah yeah but so are they make no mistake these guys are big guys six seven 200 200 play that stomping and everything like that I guess like especially you got to consider basketball players are playing how many days a week for how many months a year I mean and then in the offseason some lay around and get fat right they they're working on the Aussie and also you got to look at how much you know money is is invested in that player you know what I mean right like you just were to Brussels Westbrook just signed for 200 and whatever million dollars you better believe his feet are gonna be taken care of like whatever shoes he's playing in are gonna be the best thing possible for his feet because you know that we've got 40 million dollars a year invested it guy gets a contract like that do the hose just start circling like oh no they didn't work they've been there you know you get hoses around way before 200-million once once that happens they start thinking all I need is one sperm to crack the egg and I'm good right there's a lot of gals out there like that back in ok was it 88 89 I used to play ball at Valley College all the time like pickup all but it was high level they were good you know I played with guys who had been in like d1 who had played Division one league and stuff like that the NBA rehab was in Van Nuys and on weekends they would come to the gym and they'd play ball with us right and I got to know a few players and this one guy told me and this is an 80 like I said 88 89 he said an NBA kid is worth a hundred grand a year for 18 years once he said these chicks poke holes in the condoms he was like you can't trust any of them and that was then she was that kind of mud that was back when you know five million was a huge contract right that well you know so you can only imagine now the greener seems fairly inexpensive well but they care of a child but again in 89 this was back in 89 so now that that hundred grand is probably half a million probably right and you look I think the average salary in the NBA including the you know guys on the bench is like 2.3 million isn't that funny too because like when you you think about like you say the average person makes like what 70 grand 60 grand a year is that minimum wage I mean not minimum wage middle class was no class like 6070 here in California I think across America I think it's like 40 so so but the idea that this baby would live like that it's like no no no no no yeah like I know the guy doesn't even know the kid right she's taking care of it doesn't even know her like if he has to be child support like you know you're playing child support like lavish yeah lavish yeah you can't like the average person like if the average family is existing off of fifty thousand dollars a year but this woman wants a half a million for one super baby yeah it's fascinating right it's like we have these weird rules like right well how mean minute why is that the case because it's what dad makes right now what dad makes but I mean you're not asking someone to pay for kids living expenses well they're asking someone to keep a kid in the lap of luxury and then the moms gonna buy a car and person's dead and that's the fight that dad's have right a lot of the dads are like we'll just send me the bill send me the bill for private school what is this here Antonio Marty come Marty just had number 14 his three million dollar deal from the Colts and immediately used it to settle a child-support dispute with a baby mama to avoid possible arrest in the process Cromartie was delinquent on child support payments to Rosa Mita Pierre sounds like a lovely lady the mother of Alonzo is oldest child a K number one of 13 kids 14 14 is up to 14 but he was ordered to pay her $4,000 per month that's not that bad that's actually reasonable now multiply that by 14 that's a lot still had a kid damn it some powerful sperm right scroll up he's like what the fuck which is why you know when you get to to Kaepernick and the boycott of football and some people are mad at the players for playing it's like that's why you gotta play cuz you got 14 kids tapping again boy kind of football is a sport meaning that the the idea of black people boycotting football and then people saying like why do the players play like you know screw them look everybody every black player in the NFL just refused to play and it's like no that ain't gonna happen they need their paychecks this whole national anthem thing along with football is very weird it's like football players should be playing football UFC fighters don't have to fucking stand there with their hand over their heart to show Ally tension and to show you know well you're basically asking someone to to be domesticated writing them to follow the rules the truth has come out like players didn't do it until like what was it something like that when the yeah when the government started paying the NFL to have them do it exactly it's yeah this that whole thing it's weird man it's weird because the the whole thing you're asking them to be you know they have to to give in you know that you're asking them to follow the rule my my problem with it and I called it the misdirection the protests never had to do with the flag right what's about the Pope's s had to do with cops and the treatment and it was just he just did it at that point because that's a powerful statement yeah to do it at that point you know and and now the the misdirection the changing of the topic is making it about the flag and it's like no that's not what they were they were never protesting the flag or veterans or Americans or and and again when you get into those rules of the flag you're not supposed to have the flag on t-shirts or bikinis or her hats or or a million other things we sell with the flag on it like if you want to talk about respecting the flag we wouldn't do any of that you're right yeah and you just you summed it up I mean it is it's about control right it's the same thing with these freedom of speech marches like we're yeah it's okay to have freedom of speech as long as you're saying something I agree with right right but the problem with this whole Kapernick thing is that it's not an effective form of protest too because it's getting people pissed off for the wrong reasons well it was people thinking that you're you're protesting America itself right why don't you move to Canada and people start getting crazy about it but to just say what he's trying to do or what he was trying to do was protest all these unarmed people getting shot by cops and so he takes a knee for that but the national anthem doesn't have shit to do with those cops right well it just became a thing of when one guy did it and he did it as a protest and he said he wanted to start the conversation and then the conversation got lost and now the conversation is completely lost and the argument is a completely different topic and you know that but yeah what you said control is definitely part of it same thing with the universities right with free speech on the universities and you know when you look at school like Berkeley Berkeley had a reasonable arguments like look when we bring one of these radical speakers here and it costs a million dollars for security who's gonna pay that it's like we if you're gonna pay it fine we'll let you talk but if nobody's gonna pay two million dollars for security and we can't have these radical speakers here well sort of you know the problem with that articles they've had those speakers there forever and then when they started having these nt4 protests and they also started supporting these anti-fur protests that's a big issue well they stopped having cops go after the ante for people and the berkeley the literally the chief of police was literally telling people the mayor was telling the police to stand down and let these people protest and not just protest they were being very violent and tacking things and you're setting up a reaction action event right so then have something like that where people are breaking windows and light things on fire or doing whatever they're doing you're gonna have people that say fuck those people we're gonna meet there and we're gonna protest the anti protest people and then next thing you know you've got a real issue in your well that but that's the point that's that's where we're at now where everything has to be that big an issue yeah you're right twenty years ago ten years ago at Berkeley you could have had a speaker or a right-wing speaker that the school didn't agree with there would have been some protesters outside just not even bloc years ago but then it became and this is this is a social media effect right the speaker brings his social media thing he needs to stir it up to build his social media side and then some people come and then the other side gets mad just what you said yeah and they bring their and then you bring the angry groups from both sides are gonna meet and then they're like okay that now it's but because it makes the whole thing there it's like promoting a fight right you know what I mean it's like promoting a fight it's like it's one thing if two guys get into a fight but if you promote that fight for a month three months six months ahead that fights gonna be huge and this is the same thing there promote these speakers the the the protest is part of the publicity right you know so well they're speakers and there's people that are provocateurs right like you know Milo you know right I shouldn't say speakers I should say provocateur in Shapiro is a speaker then Shapiro's intellectual and these guys got some a very solid arguments whether you agree with him or not he's got some real facts to go with his arguments and they were he's a Jew he wears a yarmulke and people calling him a Nazi like it's like this whole punch Nazi thing and getting it me just the the arguments are getting so blurry and it's just like we were talking about before when it comes to gun control it's teams you know you're on I'm on team left-wing I support and Tifa you know armor on team right-wing I support the you know conservatives and POTUS like the people that are calling Trump POTUS you know you know you're defaming POTUS like whoa whoa whoa whoa what's fuckin Trump its Donna if there's ever an argument this is ridiculous the fucking the guy who is the host of The Apprentice is now the guy you're calling Mojo Jojo you're disrespecting the White House it was disrespectful POTUS it gets to this almost like papal situation right and again these are the same people who said the exact same thing about Barack Obama yeah you know last year right right but the the president has never been disgraced or insulted like really they insulted Awards when Obama wore clothing it's a gang color that's right he's sandy and then Michelle Obama wore sleeveless dress and I think I think that was just you know Dean Alex Jones do something recently saying that out Michelle Obama was a man like proof that Michelle Obama was a man fuck he's on some shit today they do all that shit when Michelle ain't in the room yeah it was easy for Donald Trump to call pro football players sons of bitches from Huntsville Alabama yeah let's try it on the sidelines right a few of them standing next to you sons of bitches you're fired they shouldn't have them fucking stand for the national anthem first of all you want to have a national anthem for a game what are you saying I mean is this your rallying up patriotism at a sporting event sporting events are supposed to be entertaining it's supposed to remove us from all of our daily bullshit right if it's gonna be entertaining be entertaining admit they sorry I didn't mean it's okay they did a thing this past week at the Rams game like during the national anthem how many people were in the beer line how many guys were taking a piss oh yeah how many you knew you know what I mean it's not like those guys not like everybody stopped you know not like everybody stopped and turned and held their hand over their heart like yeah well I got my dick in my hand literally people's asses for pissing during the national anthem if you tell them they can it's just it's a the protest is ineffective right getting on your knees we eat just causes too much controversy and here's the other problem with it it doesn't stop anything it doesn't stop cops from doing anything it doesn't even shed light on it it just it points to you and people start talking about well what is it that you're protesting well we're we're mad at you because you're not standing up for the national anthem it creates all this noise that's the part I call the misdirection because initially when Kaepernick did it it had some meaning it had some meaning to him and it was about starting a conversation and when it became this bigger thing like you're talking about when it became this oh you're anti-american you're anti troops or blah blah blah now it's lost its effectiveness now yeah you got to do something else because that doesn't it you're right it doesn't mean anything anymore people don't even know they don't even know why you're doing it but I hate you for doing it that's too many play doing it now - why are you doing it I do it because I hate puppies yeah exactly the fuck is and now everybody's doing it because they're mad at Trump talking shit about the NFL so you're getting just giant groups of people doing it now much more so than before yeah and it's yet it's lost its effectiveness its losses importance and you know and the players a lot of players get caught in the middle right because if you do have a thing where your team says you can't do it are you gonna be fined or you're gonna whatever they say that yes I'm NBA said that it's against the rules the ba the NBA but if anybody doing that in the NBA yet they well they hadn't started playing the NBA just started this week in pre-season right before it started before it's in the past the NBA did things like they warned I can't breathe t-shirts they've done things like that NBA players NBA players are a bit more sophisticated in their protest and I think they're also more United let's head trauma you know yeah probably a big part of it they've also been encouraged I think to speak out whereas I don't know that the NFL players are also encouraged to speak out in public I don't know the topics I don't know a basketball players are necessarily encouraged to speak out or the big difference with the NBA the players are bigger than the team right right right they're huge fan huge stars yes so you had like LeBron is bigger than the Cavaliers curry is bigger than the Warriors when the words we did you bomb at the president I was like oh my goodness like where are we yeah where are we going with a we're a fucking superstar pro athlete is tweeting you bum at the president of the United States this is crazy look theoretically you know look we elected a reality show host LeBron could be the president in 2100 percent vice-president Kanye with the fucking Prozac drip he would have an IV bag drip it right into his arm I stand there like zoning out getting first lady whoa why the hell not why the hell not Melania can barely speak English that's right they're talking about immigrations closing the border like what the fuck where'd you get her she doesn't speak and she did lesbian porn and I don't I don't watch I don't watch Bill Maher all the time but apparently he did this some kind of top ten list about Melania and if one of the jokes was she has no first language yeah that's a joke that Russell Peter said about Yoshi he was saying he goes he goes yo she speaks terrible English but when you talk to people speak Japanese Japanese sucks to know real language yeah it's um the whole thing is it's this this football thing is very strange it's very strange because now they're they kicked these two high school kids right off the team because they they're following their heroes right so they say fucking I'm gonna take a knee - first of all you're taking a knee you should at least be able to write an essay yeah tell me why you're taking a knee son you know and and you got to know the different senior while you are and while you apostrophe re and you know you also got to be starting yes you know what I mean like like if the starting quarterback takes a knee hmm there's a lot more latitude then you know a second string defensive end you know and like the you know if trust me if you know Aaron Rodgers if if that Prescott was taking the knee there's be a whole different conversation well it's Colin Kaepernick wasn't a big star player he was but he fell off he fell off because of the controversy and all day hey no I don't know what it was he he had started falling off before that so that I don't know what it was yeah I don't know what I mean but one of the arguments is and it is true he's a lot better than a lot of quarterbacks who have jobs see that was a thing they said no it's not a conspiracy because of the protests but then they showed the numbers of like various backup quarterbacks who are in the league and he's better than a lot of them and then one of the owners I think it was Baltimore where the coach wanted him and the owner was like not I don't want him because of the protests so it became a thing of where they said they said he's not blackballed because of the protests but then it came out yeah he was blackballed because of the protest and again that that's one of those things where and you know this would any athlete like your complaints depend on where you are in your career sure well Tom Brady even said the president was divisive yeah and when Tom Brady said that everybody went oh Jesus right right he's not taking the knee yet but they're hooking arms yeah yeah everybody fucking arms in in unity because and Trump spoke out against the NFL now he's aiming at their money yeah you know when he's telling fans not to go to the games like those owners love him but now they like will hold the fuck up now yeah that's money out of our pocket everybody's saying hold the fuck up now because it is working Direct TV just offered this gigantic refund for their NFL package yeah because people are pissed off that people are taking a knee you're paying to see football you fucks yeah you're not paying to see people stand with their hand over their heart like what here's that here's a solution take all that shit out of the game yeah okay if you want the players to be compliant and submissive well you're asking a the wrong thing right you're talking about super athletes is what what is essentially a group combat sport that's a football yes okay and if they're not what are you doing here you're telling them to keep their job they have to put their hand over their heart and stand there a certain position that seems very fucking below Fox Fox said that they're gonna stop televising the national anthem ah and it was pointed out well you didn't used to televise the national anthem yeah like you didn't televise it until two weeks ago right when it became controvert before that you we'd be listening to those three guys in the studio right up till the kickoff you and then the only time they televised that if it was like Whitney Houston was singing it where it was yeah that was a big deal well I'm a big fan of no anthem in sports because I like sports to be sport like that one of the things I love about the UFC there's no national anthems you have to play you know if like they don't agree the Brazilian national anthem when josée all those fighting or the American national anthem when Chris Weidman is fighting you have to do that yeah just you said go right to the fight here's the main event of the evening boom entertainment blah blah blah and if someone wants to make some sort of a political statement or stand they can do that in the interview yeah and then that interview will be judged based on the content of whatever the conversation is and that's how it should be this weird sort of way where someone taking an A is supposed to protest cops shooting people but it doesn't say that while you're taking the knee you're taking the knee during the anthem the anthem is supposed to be all of us it's supposed to be America again group as a team like the United States of America not you know the Seahawks versus the Dolphins put all that aside for a second we're all in this together that's the idea I understand why he did it and I understand why he did it then because it was the way to call attention to it but now that's lost but you know what the national anthem has been historically get to your seat the games about to start mm-hmm that's all it was yeah it's like the - what's the last word in the last two words of the national anthem play ball yeah like that's literally yeah that's what we thought was part of the song cuz that's what you heard right at the end the umpire yell play ball and the game stuff you know so I understood what Kaepernick did but now it's done and now it's been compromised and changed and the arguments changed and and yeah it's you know and he's still not playing people are using the land of the free to shake their dick as they're like what is this just came out now this afternoon maybe even within the hour that twelve hundred players personal data has been exposed in the leak by hackers the NFL including Colin Kaepernick's data what kind of data personal information off of a server from the NFLPA oh no was that foul was that a hat barrow did they just have what I experience or Equifax as well so they had a Bitcoin ransom they were trying to say they would get rid of this leak but is now coming out only four hundred twenty years bucks someone's at the time how crazy is that for 28 bucks I know someone that happened to that Bitcoin hack really yeah yes I was just talking to her this weekend she has an accounting company and apparently these hackers take control of your database mm-hmm and they have an encryption key and you have to pay them in Bitcoin to get the encryption key to get back your own data yeah this is a giant group of people from other countries rather than engage in this and they they target large businesses and people that would be willing yeah it's like like an extortion thing yeah very weird well I see now you have something to lose grow me if you want to hold my 428 followers hostage go ahead I'll just start another website do you think Colin Kapernick gets confronted by the the suits do you think they'd sit him down and go hey man you got to stop doing this this is fucking up everybody and I think they did last year I think they did last year where do you think this goes because my question is like when the more Trump tweets about this ratings down elif NFL bad sad you know he tweets that and all the Trump bets go along with it and then they start boycotting people I see all these fucking tweets boycott the NFL and all this crazy thing and you know you know where it goes it goes nowhere because we have no attention span as a nation but it's gonna have to stop or continue but again this is the thing we we just had this mass shooting all right so the attention now will be on on the NRA and you know guns and and so you know what I mean any NFL will be on the back burner like we have in the past month six weeks Confederate statues right yeah hurricanes Charlottesville's yeah the NFL now it's a mass shooting you know what I mean we have no we have no attention span as a nation so it will just go away and and in another month people will be watching football there'll be something else yeah yeah because there's always there's always the latest big story and then that's there you know I haven't heard a thing about a Confederate statue in the last two weeks of them getting knocked down of them getting put back up yeah well what it you know I mean it's so it's true right wrong or indifferent America has a zero attention span did you see what that fucking lady from CBS the top executive she was like a vice president at CBS some huge position she went on Facebook saying she didn't feel bad for the people that got shot in Vegas because there were Republicans there were likely Republicans she's talking about hundreds of people that got shot for going to a country music concert like the fact that she just made this blanket statement she thought there were likely Republicans because they were at a country music concert you know the thing about that this and this is the thing about freedom of speech that people forget you have freedom of speech but there's consequences right it's not freedom of speech without consequence so she can say that and then if CBS fires her the next day it's like well you shouldn't have said that shit you know you wrapped into yourself or you should have told your friends at the cocktail party but the minute you made that public statement we don't want to be associated with you but it's what we're talking about earlier this team thing that someone could be so ideologically isolated they're so locked into this liberal bubble that they think it's okay to say something like that that it's okay for mass murder to exist and you don't feel bad for those massive because you don't agree with it share your team ideology I mean what did you is that what is her name this lady it's fucking insane yeah that means she was a very high-level executive this isn't like the Queen sentences what was yeah she's fucked now I mean she's likely fucked forever I mean this is not something that people forget what if she was a vice president of business affairs no they yeah vice president of business affairs yeah Haley gift Mangold wrote on her Facebook page she was not sympathetic to victims of shootings because she claimed most country music fans Republicans Wow she wrote that if they wouldn't do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Rapunzel I am actually not even sympathetic because country music fans are often our Republican gun toters holy SH well you got the right to say it you got the right to lose your job not even sympathetic is such a queen that could have been your sister your mom your mom your daughter someone's little kid I mean that was a country music thing right there was a lot of family time folks that are there country music events we don't know what time of night that it all went down but how old were the people elect him yeah yeah things that what I what I said was had it been a rap concert they would have blamed the artists not if a white guy did it that would have been some serious cause of a horrific racism it's just lucky that a white guy was shooting white people you know you know it's the reason I laugh because like that's how horrific we become as a society yeah that that's the statement like you know you know what I mean like yeah well as a white guy shooting white people so we couldn't twist the race into you know you know like today about worrying about white privilege right we're so we're insane we're insane that that that that is the issue with something like this you know but but it's it's true I mean what you're saying is true but we've reached that level of insanity that that statement is true come on imagine how freaked out people would be if that was a Muslim that did this oh happy day would be war what would be war war it would be war yeah and and you know actually like no Muslim would be safe in America I mean is are we gonna have war on white dudes with guns no no I mean there was white dudes with guns that got shot by white dude with guns everyone must be so so conflicted because a lot of those people that were in the audience like one of the country music guys actually came out and said that he completely switched his stance on gun rights he said I've been a second Amendment advocate my entire life he goes I have concealed carry permits there's people that would concealed carry permits that were all my staff yeah guitarists Las Vegas control changes mine and gun control what is his name Caleb keator Caleb keator sounds like the white is fucking - that's ever lived Caleb cute little boy Caleb Caleb Jeter I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say Caleb shooter drives a truck oh for sure baseball hat or a cowboy hat level 95 wizard guitarist for the what is that Josh Abbott band see I'll say something like that like who the fucker that and then you go their Twitter page they have 24 million five what is happening I don't understand country music is a whole different world different world but you know they again we're getting back to where we started which is great and the insanity of the whole thing but the problem what you said about like a white guy doing this shooting we were talking about everyone's in their team right everyone's in their group yeah but this ruins the narrative right because if our narrative is the Muslims are terrorists they rights they they are the terrorists and and the black people are criminals and the Mexicans are you know rapists and dope dealers and everything then oh shit one of ours did it to us a millionaire yeah a white rat illionaire now it's a real estate investor and a gambler right this this ruins your narrative now you have to now you have to figure out how to change your story to make him other because he has to somehow become other there are people that are taking advantage of solute Lela I saw this article on white privilege they're saying that the shooter had white privilege and using his white privilege that's how he walked through the casino with all these guns and all this equipment and shit like that I'm like what I believe white privilege exists in certain circumstances not in that one yeah that's a document you know we look at Jamie white privilege of the lone wolf shoot all that fucking guy of course that fucking fake black guy this of course it's him who writes that that guy's such a race oh you talking about the article about the guy being a lone wolf yeah yeah yeah I read that this whole thing that we're dealing with has so many different facets to it the mass shooter thing but a big part of it is the fact that it becomes the narrative for the entire country it becomes a huge part what everybody's talking about and these people that have for whatever reason they have this need to be a guy who gets paid attention to this this gets back to your point about mental health yeah and our mental health is a nation that the mass shooter is a thing yeah like you know I think it was Trevor Noah was talking about on The Daily Show where we're really not surprised anymore right you know cuz he said like he's been in the United States for two years living in New York for two years and how many mass shootings this is and and it's like but Americans are like yeah you know another one yeah and we we we got to develop some sense of outrage before we do something about this or like the onion article was talking about we just like well we'll just hope that it doesn't happen again we won't do anything do anything different but we're just gonna hope you know and that and that line the thoughts and prayers line yeah stop it stop it stop it your thoughts and prayers go out to know you need to say something right and and people do but if you're if you're in the government if you're a policymaker then you do more than just say that you have you got a you know put your balls on the line and step up and do something it's challenge to challenge the gun lobby about registration of weapons it was easier for them to challenge the hotel lobby about security in hotels hmm then to challenge the gun lobby about registration of weapons but he registration of weapons this guy had these weapons illegally I mean these are still like at the end of the day you're talking criminal possessing criminal weapons same thing Sandy Hook legally right yeah but you can still make it like you said if you made it more difficult if you had to take a class if you had to register if your shit had to be a percentage there'd be a percentage that didn't didn't have them yeah I mean your shit should be locked up I mean it's just I just don't know but what's interesting too is that Trump used to be a Democrat you're a Democrat forever Trump's of publicity guy and you know I mean and he's you know this is this goes back to Sarah Palin right like I never liked Sarah Palin or agreed with Sarah Palin but i respected sarah palin's ability to manipulate the media sarah palin knew how to keep her name in the news you know you know Kim Kardashian's another one like you may not like Kim Kardashian but guess what you know who she is right you know who she is we all know who she is I read somewhere that she is the most famous woman on earth and I can believe that and yeah I had a whole bit about it I had a whole bit about aliens come down here and to try to figure out why that's the most famous woman on earth right and we explained to her by using OJ Simpson yeah the whole idea is that OJ Simpson you know got out of you know the Robert Kardashian was OJ Simpson's one of his guarantees they all died of cancer mm-hmm you know that's what's fucked up yeah f lee Bailey is the only guy that's alive and he's broke and living in Maine somewhere yeah everybody that got OJ off was just ostracized and Johnnie Cochran died of cancer yeah Kardashian died of cancer they all just stopped fucking ate came their way a lot of brothers in jail because Johnnie Cochran died do you joke we miss Johnny's good you must have quit and everybody was like why there's a lot of ballplayers doing time saying damn Johnny you won so you watched that whole cuba gooding oh yeah anything I've only watched one episode I watched one episode last night but it brought it all back underrated actor oh yeah he won an Oscar yeah I know but then when a drop yeah you look and and that movie he did with De Niro about being the first black diver was a man of honor it was a phenomenal movie Jeff see that movie now I never even heard of it yeah it's it's I'm pretty sure it's called man of honor or something it's Cuba Gooding jr. plays the first black deep-sea diver edge true story yeah man of honor mm check that out he's sort of I mean he dropped off in a weird way look wonder what happened with him I don't know it's one of those things when he gets a chance to play a role he's phenomenal in it but so many times he gets these you know Brown movies bullshit roles and stuff like that I don't know how Hollywood works on that level so I don't know what what it is but uh the thing is some poor choices poor choices after was the fucking agent movie show me the money fuck wasn't Gary McGuire Jerry Maguire after that movie there was a big drop-off yeah it happens you know you know same thing happened with Jamie Foxx yeah but Jamie Foxx are still in the mix he does everything yeah I mean he was in he was great in Django and that baby baby driver I didn't see that one I heard it was amazing yeah it's great movie yeah it's good that Jamie Foxx is one of those weird dudes it seems like he could do anything super tally yeah super personable - that's the other thing about him ya know the Me's is such a normal guy met him last year couldn't have been nicer he's very cool yeah you did the podcast like a couple months ago normal as it comes there's a recent clip of him describing the potential Tyson movie that might be making and like the opening of it that they might have worked out it's fucking oh it's like a three-minute clip of him just describing it doing a little Tyson impression in there oh well he's really amazing impressions yeah he would be great as Tyson just have to do a lot of roids yeah he's a a completely different body type yeah and he would have to actually learn how to box I don't know if he does but if you can't have yeah a guy you might have trained someone he did Ollie he was like what alleys corner man when Willy wasn't he bundini brown yeah he was yeah well Will Smith pulled it off he looked like a boxer he looked like he had been training but there's a few guys that you don't so yeah there he is yeah there's a few guys who just don't pull it off that the when you're playing a fighter like even Russell Crowe when he played Jim Braddock it was like imagine if boxing really was like movie fights where every punch connects go watch the turtle Gotti versus Micky Ward those fucking fights literally were movie fight yeah that's what everybody was so jazzed up about right some of the most I mean blood and guts fights for sure but preposterous fighting stood right in front of each other and beat the shit out of each other was Hagler Hearns that was the only fight I saw that that was a movie fight like yeah we're just gonna stand here huh and just punch each other until it's over well hackers decided that that fight he mean he fought very strategically in most fights you know when he fought Mugabe Mugabe was a murderous puncher and he took Mugabe in the deep water and then fucked him up and stopped him but not her and she said I'm gonna jump right in your face motherfucker like they didn't like it you know they didn't and didn't didn't Hearns break his hand like that keep punching he broke my hand on Hagler's head yeah and it hurt Hagler yeah he's stunned Hagler in the first round but Hagler had a preposterous chin yeah Posterous he's only knocked down his entire career was a bullshit knockdown I forget who it was it knocked him down but uh some Argentinian dude it was a bullshit knockdown was a fake knockdown was like a slip and then he moved to Italy and started making movies just banging Italian drinks if you go to Italy man I know you realize like why am I trying so hard to bury dude yeah well Dan yeah yeah the night Marvin Hagler was not knocked down they should that's a fuckin stain on his record man they should go back and remove that it was not a knockdown do you see is it gonna play it play it let's watch Oh see if you can find that the knockdown it's a bullshit fucking knockdown they don't have a clip of Roldan knocking down Marvin Hagler mom dad I still beat his ass he had ridiculous muscles on the side of his head that was like he was built with like he was born the prior year his temples they said the the muscles that surrounded his temples were three times larger than a normal person's I know that happens right certainly for sure man sometimes a bigger dance is born yeah yeah just show it real quick let's see here pull shit knock down I mean he just like pushed down the back of his head do they gonna show it no oh they're gonna show it in between rounds yeah just let it go for a second here what'd you do yeah so just in between rounds I'll show it on the replay so he went back to his corner 48 Kos and his 62 fights and he's one of the few guys that when he lost his sugar a letter and he just went fuck this mm-hmm and I don't think he lost that fight I've watched that fight a few times I thought it was a decision for how it should have been a decision for look at this see totally slipped a total slip he's mostly missed the top of this he's the punch Magnus let's see he just kind of pushed him down with his forearm and Hagler bounced right up that is not a knockdown you motherfuckers but he took some bombs from Mugabe Mugabe was murdering people at a time well you know we were talking about football players boxers is another one where mhm they don't know when to let it go yeah like you got you got you can only take so many punches to the hit yeah well and then hey fighters as well Chuck Liddell's talking about making a comeback now and you get hooked on the fame but you got at some point you got it there and it's not even when they get old it's when they get to like 50 like late 450 not even that I mean Liddell is talking about making a comeback now at 48 and I think he's been out of the fight game for at least five or six years the UFC gave him a know like sort of a no-show job yeah for a while and they said look you don't have to work you just come in do some events every now and then you get a chunk of money every month and so he was living off that and doing really well with that but then the UFC sold and when the UFC sold they killed those jobs this whole fucking UFC sold things so crazy because they bought it for four billion dollars billion like to make that monthly nut they had to cut a hundred jobs from the UFC a hundred people got fired and now they got a they got to figure out some way to well it's not just that it's like you've got out you got to make payments every month so they sold some more of it off they sold some more of the assets off to some other corporations or some other people and I don't have to deal with that shit dude I just show up and talk yeah I don't you know I don't envy the people that I have to deal the bean counters inside yeah well I mean one is worth four billion dollars and it was like worth it yeah like I bought Star Wars for four billion dollars and I'm making money yeah that makes sense yeah Disney bought that yeah but then they put Star Wars rides and like absolute Disney you know you can use Jar Jar Binks to come to your birthday party have you done that ride at Disneyland Star Wars right yeah awesome yeah I mean again it's when Disney does something they're gonna do it right them the movies like that there's not gonna be any more of those Jar Jar Binks movies or any of that like Disney's like yeah we were gonna handle this yeah that guy didn't work out he still he's in the the Star Tours movie though yeah that thing the little thing when you sometimes you've run into him like underwater he's drunk and everybody gets excited but it's but the quality of movies went back up oh yeah for sure you know they don't play games yeah a lot of money invested they're doing a Star Wars park at Disneyland yeah some gigantic fucking he it was it was what was it used to be called Tomorrowland or something like that was something else and they're converting it and making the whole Star Wars yeah they said it's gonna be open in like two years it's gonna be insane I don't know how old you are but do you remember when the first movie came so yeah you remember my first movie came out fuck yeah like like think about that when think about George Lucas like I'm gonna make a movie that's gonna change culture it is literally the gonna bring length like change language like we're gonna have you know things we talked about right like Jedi Mind Tricks and of course and it's got to be mind-boggling to sit back and say yeah I created this whole thing gotta be mind boggling but do you think you set out to do that I mean set out to just make no he just set out to make a great movie and hit all the buttons for people everything for four generations yeah you know generations to be like you know he did all the things he had the rebel with the fucking giant gorilla that followed him around yep the gun wise Yoda old wise Yoda he had the wise Yoda he had the old man who was the master who's showing him how to do it the master dies no no greatest villains of all time oh the best guy gonna kill people his mind yeah yeah any any fucking you didn't see his eyes no emotion he just yeah that's all he did he just he would breathe he would breathe how was the shit and imagine being a stormtrooper just an average stormtrooper and you hear this coming down the hall you're like oh shit I might die like I don't know if I did my job right but maybe he just needs to make an example try watching today though so it's not it didn't but it's still it's only still great because it brings back the memory of how great it was yeah but no it's not the movie it was then but personal effects we've never seen anything like that jump in the hyperspace oh yeah it's amazing the special effects were terrible did you ever see a Darth Vader with the actor's voice the actual actor yeah no yeah you can see it on YouTube exactly not exactly cuz you know the actor had to do the lines right that's not quite the impact of James Earl Jones like voice that guy has ving rhames is the mark the modern version that thing range does a lot of voice for the UFC and telling you you're talking to a guy with the boys who can't get a job because it rains and those guys do it yet yeah because and you know I lost one to Danny Glover and I'm like if I ever meet him I'm like man you got Lethal Weapon money you didn't need this this a Guinness beer commercial I needed best competition out there bro nobody's gonna lay down for you no but none that works she's not in the voice-over yeah I gotta start punching people in the throat [Laughter] games a weird game right there's some dudes like you know who's an interesting one is uh the guy from Ray Donovan Fox's name if Schreiber yeah leave how you say it Liev the Liev Schreiber but he's really good at it there's a lot of the UFC ones for Fox and I can never remember his name but um Donald Sutherland oh yeah tons he's the voice of Delta boys he's the voice of juice is he dead now no am I saying the right is that the right actor the the guy with the white hair though Donald Sutherland is the guy who was in invasion of the body snatchers may be alive at this same guy he just did the Hunger Games Movies he was like the the president in The Hunger Games that's the guy right yeah yeah that guy he does a ton whenever I think of him I said oh yeah when you became one of the guys and you know you know who's getting paid um the guy who does the Allstate you know there's another one that I could have done yeah that guy I could Dennis Haysbert I could have done that for a lot less you only want to knows his name a friend of mine used to work with him on his series that's why I know his name but you can go to any mall on him and he was also an Allstate guy he was also in major league he was Serrano and maybe leave a job ooh John at all I barely remember major league yeah that's him major league that's a that was a fun fucking movie that that's one of those movies had if you're flicking channels and it's on my yeah yeah Charlie Sheen back for the crack yep Wesley Snipes when he was paying taxes Omar Epps played the same character in the second one yeah like two really their place Wesley Wesley on a bunch of issues there was a great Patton Oswalt bit he does about being in Blade 2 and about how they replaced Wesley Snipes halfway in the movie like it's Wesley Snipes I don't know allegedly was was fucking around with coke or something really and just was completely off his rocker you know it was a weird time for him I got a friend who grew up with him yeah I mean literally like Wesley was sleeping on his couch when he got his first American Express commercial his first acting job oh yeah and who and then he got I forgot what movie he did some movie it was a fight movie or something like that and he kind of disappeared and my buddy's wife she's always like you better never Wesley snipe us oh you better not disappear you this is his first movie yeah it was well do that commercials commercial money was always a big thing right then you got her you got a national commercial back then you got paid yeah back here to the scene where the pipe was going off huh god damn hilarious look at the computer guy look at the computer back then it's a less turn Union I'll get punch numbers into a terminal got to get that bail money fellas that's our life time in our lifetime things have changed so radically just stop and think about 30 years before that it wasn't much different it was a little different but not like it is now you think of our parents lifetimes yeah to go from radio like they have lived from radio to the internet yeah not that my mom a mess with the internet your mom doesn't fuck with you in there we tried her church started doing the bulletins online so he gave her a smartphone like a few years ago I gave her one of those what do they call it the cricket phone oh yeah it has like four numbers on yeah and that's all you do and well they made a smartphone version and it literally has one button that says email a button it says text a button that says pictures and a button that says call and it's like mom I can't like this is the simplest we could do she would she won't mess with it Wow I'm mad for a long time you know my mom was still like talk fast it's long distance you know like don't worry mom I got this I got a long-distance money I ain't rich but I got a long-distance money that's right remember when law remember when roaming well you would drive your car an hour outside of where your coverage area was fucked if you got AT&T you still got roaming man AT&T youth a used to just raped me when I travel it was ridiculous really oh and then forget when like when you went to the festival in Montreal it's like listen I'm gonna need my pay plus some AT&T money make a call yeah I know a lot of dudes who used their phone overseas and didn't know when they got a thousand dollar bill and got back home like $1,000 for phone call I know one guy he did he used his data like he kept using his phone like it was like he had a three thousand dollar bill when he came back from Montreal his data was on 24/7 for like eight days they cut it in half or something like that but it was still yeah they give you a break unreal so sweet of them yeah but it's interesting that competition is sort of erased that whole roaming thing like because more people were jockeying for a share of the market Verizon AT&T t-mobile all these different people and players of Sprint and they just had to make some concessions for competition well the next big test is gonna be a thousand dollar iPhone right because if people pay it and that's what phones are gonna cost well isn't that new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 isn't that similarly price there matter both gonna be up there yeah they're basically computers no date it's pretty fucking sweet man they're badass but that's a that's a big jump that's basically you're doubling the price for cell phone is it you know what are the new ones now I think new ones now are five to six hundred bucks I didn't just buy it but that's the point but now you're not gonna get that you know you know cuz it's always been you get the discount if I sign up for two years is that well apparently with this one it's gonna be just you gotta just buy the phone they're just kidding getting green yes so it's I think it's a test because if people don't go for it then they'll be like oh well we got to go back to the old model there's a Jew be willing to pay more money for a phone if you knew that the phone was made by people that got paid a living wage yeah I would yeah I'm all about that man I'm fine with paying more for something to take care of the employees that's the best argument for made in America you know that made in America argument is like some people look at it as patriotism or nationalism and I could see that but there's also the argument if it's made in America then people have to get paid you know I get least a minimum wage you know well you know who said it and it's been lost and I think it's one of his great quote Henry Ford Henry Ford said never forget you have to pay him enough to buy the cars that's a smart quote and they forgot Henry Ford was a wizard yeah Henry Ford also figured out that you can make fenders out of hemp and they're far superior to metal yeah there's an old video you're see those the old video of his first car no his first car that he made had fenders made out of hemp and he's banging it with a hammer and the Hammers just about hemp is forget about whatever anybody feels about marijuana fucking stoners they're always trying to push it on us just hemp itself as a textile as as a commodity hemp when they use him to make things out of hemp is a very strange fiber where if you had a piece of hemp like the size of this water ball is a large water bottle right if you had a piece of hemp that was that thick it would be hard like oak but light like balsa wood it's so again weird it's similar to bamboo it's similar to bamboo but stronger much stronger it's a very very strange it's the impact is ten times stronger than steel mm-hmm hemp plastic panels now you go see if he can find the video it's a crazy video just because in the video he's banging on this fucking fender with a hammer okay crazy video cuz he had my phone to make videos in 1910 you probably had a dude on truck one of those things they'd probably crank it back crank yeah yeah he probably did like that's his car actually pretty dope car if you had that today drive around that bitch let everybody know look at this he's whaling on it with a fucking hammer and it just bounces off mm-hmm and it's completely sustainable you can plant it in an area and regenerate it within a year whereas if you have the same issue with trees you try regenerating an area with trees it takes decades so is it well I guess who'd be more similar to bamboo than fiberglass yes more similar to bamboo than fiberglass but superior to both of those things it's fucking amazing it's a fiberglass cracks and breaks light like fiberglass but far stronger I had a head of Corvette that the fender just cracked and broke off oh I'm an older one you got a magnificent look yeah they who made a car recently out of hemp Lotus lotus made a hemp car really recently and you know people are hoping that other manufacturers are going to start using this because it's actually safer it's stronger than fiberglass safer than fiberglass and it's like the similar and in terms of its weight yes well that stripe down the middle is exposed is there's photos where you could see it more clearly Jamie Seavey like just yeah there it is so that that is what the actual fibre looks like where it's not painted and sealed or it's just sealed rather but not colored so you can see the the fibre it's it's incredible stuff man and it doesn't fuck with the environment it's actually good it's a cleaner process so why is it not being used because it's connected to marijuana it's the only reason just publicity yeah but with that publicity up until very recently hemp was illegal to grow in the United States now I know this for a fact because my company on it we had to buy all of our hemp from Canada when we sell hemp protein which is one of the best versions of protein that you can get in plant-based form because it has a full amino acid profile very easy to digest and if you get high quality hemp parts like the stuff that we sell real easy going down like it doesn't fuck with you or give you gas like some people have issues with like whey protein if they have any sort of lactose intolerance and some people just doesn't doesn't with them hemp is very easy to digest I mean I take it hemp protein shake and I'll go to the gym like an hour later and have no issues working out pretty hard whereas some stuff you just see oh I fucked up I fucked up beating but because of all the laws that have been in existence since the 1930s regarding hemp and marijuana that's one thing that a lot of people don't even realize is the laws were actually put in place to stop hemp as a commodity not really to stop marijuana they stopped marijuana to stop hemp and it was all done by William Randolph Hearst right the this fuckin asshole in the 1930s ruined things in 2017 with propaganda the even the term marijuana was never used marijuana was a wild Mexican tobacco the reason why they used to term marijuana is because they could instead of saying cannabis which everybody already knew instead of saying hemp which everybody already knew they said well there's this drug called marijuana and these Mexicans and blacks are smoking his drug and raping all the white women yeah oh yeah in the 13 that documentary they talked about it fucking amazing anything that with opium and the Chinese from the railroads yeah you know that to this day is why hemp is such a problem in this country all that bullshit from 1930 something is why we're still we're still have issues oh the hemp protein do you get high it doesn't it's no team whatsoever it's just the fiber from the stalks yeah it's not just curious but to me personally I'm it to try it yeah Oh hep protein is amazing you know but I do you have to tell you like CBDs which you know are really great for pain and pain medication and pain Tom inflammation things almost last some people like Greg Fitzsimmons says he gets high off of it no I don't understand that mm-hmm he said he tries that uh Charlotte's Web CBD oil which is his full profile hemp oil he says it gets him high its fits boy things reactive related metabolism yeah we were you know if we were reasonable and intelligent we would be making a shitload of things with hemp the fiber is so easy to regenerate so easy to grow it's totally sustainable it's healthy maybe that will uh maybe that'll change I'm hoping though maybe that'll change in time we're slowly slowly waking up and getting rid of those well like you said the propaganda they created it you know well nother things people make plastic with it you can make degradable biodegradable hemp plastic well you didn't we'd I mean it you know people they we've had legal weed right people aren't running the streets raping I am well yes but you know you might have been I just smoke pot that's like I wake up I wake up covered in blood Jodie is an argument that it wasn't the wheat yeah the idea that you know this is the one that's illegal it's so fucking crazy right would you just go to a liquor store or just you know go to a bar almost anywhere yeah look and that and that's the lobby I've read this crazy article about the weed thing in Vegas like they made a compromise with the liquor lobby that you had to have a liquor distributor license to distribute the marijuana hmm to literally take it to the dispensaries and no one got the license so they couldn't deliver it for I mean I'm sure they figured it out but initially like nobody could deliver it yeah the liquor company was like well why would we deliver it like we don't want to you know we want you to drink well they were run into a shortage it was so chaotic when the first time they couldn't couldn't distribute it anywhere it was crazy they couldn't keep up with the demand either it was just so insane no doubt no doubt and they still have the money issue right they still have the issue of the risk of put into banks especially with sessions yeah sessions wanting to be some anti weed guy that little goofy Alf what a weird fucker that guy is you know it's just I like watching Trump's shit on him you see him just sort of to swallow it and eat it you know in the beginning he was a trump was real high on them and then he wouldn't recruit work lose himself because I investigation of Russia my favorite joke was when Roy Wood jr. called sessions a Confederate Monument [Laughter] yeah he's he a guy that was it was Ted Kennedy that was calling him a disgrace like back in the 1980s oh this guy was well he was too racist to be a judge like in the Reagan era you know and and I mean literally like Congress was like no like you you're too far gone and yeah this guy has a long history of crazy yeah I know well he wants to bring back to just say no days yeah literally said that he wants to bring back the policy of just say no in the war on drugs yeah the war on drugs throwing people in jail forever just saying no look he's still living in the Nancy Reagan days yeah it's amazing and that was probably progressive for him you know what I mean that was that was a lot yeah he's moved away from these are the far right he's one of those guys that like he wants it to be 1950 yeah that's his that's his dream high school and getting all the ladies yeah things were good he wants you to be 1950 there were black people were segregated there were no Mexicans like Mexicans didn't even didn't even exist in the 1950s only Latino in America and the Jets and the Jets at West Side Story it's a crazy of Ricky Ricardo though was Cuban Cubans were completely respectable it's like a man from Spain like a man from Spain I come over to America would be a Spanish gentleman right you know it's like there's a difference like when people started looking at Mexicans became this different thing well Cuba Cuba was Vegas yeah was big as my dad was around in that era when Cuba was where you went on vacation and gambling the mom ran it off yeah has been weird times huh yeah it had to be crazy but they still have the cars from back then mm-hmm and they keep them running with anything anything you know you talk about engineers like can you imagine if today you still had to keep a 1953 Chevy running with like more engines like it's like oh you might think you're creative but here's a 1953 Chevy half of a boat engine in a lawnmower like this this is literally the professor from Gilligan's Island where you just like you you just make shit work kids they don't remember that show then remember MacGyver they don't remember the professor from Gilligan's Island was the original code a professor used to like make machines out of bananas and palm fronds how did I show today everybody would be fucking nobody fuck back then no nothing ever happened on TV ginger would just always have makeup on everybody yes yet heels in the dress alone and they're smart people look at Mary Ann go I want I want Mary Ann's the move doesn't move you want her she's like Loki's probably freaking bad but he's like Shh she's probably banging Gilligan you think so yeah in real life but good know did you figure the professor and the skipper were fighting over ginger all the time right and the Howells had each other yeah so Mary Ann she just you know slip in and out on Gilligan what about skipper that poor fuck skipper ages mm-hmm bizarre attacks in Havana hit us spy network in Cuba what is that typed in this I was looking at recent news and this is coming out like yesterday's attacks and US personnel in Havana what is this what's happening to them spies posted to the Embassy under diplomatic cover reported hearing bizarre sounds experiencing oh this was a audio attacks right oh they were hitting him with sound oh shit whatever no experiencing even stranger physical effects the United States realized something was wrong individuals familiar with the situation said yeah they were due using some sonic weapon and it started within days of President Donald Trump's surprise election in November surprise election okay the precise timeline remains unclear including whether intelligent officer intelligence officers were the first victims hit or merely the first victims to report it the US has called the situation ongoing to date the Trump administration largely has described the 21 victims Wow at the u.s. embassy personnel or members of the diplomatic community that description suggested only bona fide diplomats in the family members were struck with no logical motivation beyond disrupting us-cuban relations yeah it was some sort of us see they're not even describing a kind of attack it is I thought it was some kind of scroll down here the first disturbing reports of piercing high-pitched noises and inexplicable ailments pointed to someone deliberately targeting the US government's intelligence network on a communist run island and what seems like a bone chilling escalation of the tit-for-tat spy games the Washington vana have waged over the last half-century well there's an ad for me in New Year's M hmm interesting have you heard of the brown note what's that it's I was thought that maybe it was getting at this but it I don't even know if it's actually real but it sounds like it's real it's a sonic note that can be used supposedly weaponized to make someone shit themselves oh I did hear about them when I was an audio school member grass car teacher if like you know if that's a possibility or whatnot and I don't know if we ever got anywhere realistic let's not test it well you wouldn't know what I hear it oh because human hearing that stops at 20 Hertz which is a real like low bass and you can barely do you have to have really good hearing teeth and hear that if you do sound test someone will play that sound and it'll almost just sound like a pressure you'll feel like a pressure change in your head I have a friend whose ears are fucked up my friend John Dudley you know John Dudley his ears are fucked up from guns like he shot a lot of guns he was younger and he blew his hearing out but so he has a hard time hearing certain things but he can hear really deep sounds way better than I can my hearing is good but he he's got like it's almost like you know when someone is blind they can hear better it sounds like that like his his hearing is fucked up but certain notes penetrate that don't get me like he can hear like like a deep sounds like an animal grunting like and he's like you hear that I'm like no mm-hmm like you can hear shit that most people can't hear it's weird because most of his sound is fucked up yes so he just is that brown note real we're asking Africa Vader I have heard of it that would be that would be your best and worst podcast ever the brown note just shit themselves on the train was amazing but I hate it yeah in the background of the most amazing podcast ever like you have a really cool person in here really interesting subject I remember Mythbusters tried to do this and I've only used a really really big sound system to try to recreate this low frequency because it's almost impossible to get and I think they didn't get very far because they don't have that government shit bro amazing stuff they're using in Cuba maybe that's what's going on those people shitting themselves they just don't want to say it that's right that I was hoping it would say something like that yeah wonder what the sonic attack is like did they point it out you you can they have that I know right or the speakers that can be they can literally point it out you look across the street press a button it's the sounds going right at you and fucking with your ear yeah well sound is directional so that absolutely makes sense yeah how weird is that that they're doing who's doing that must be someone in the Cuban government doesn't want us over there was just to fuck with the just to fuck with the diplomat the Yankee spies like they said that is something that's always going on though just little games they play with each other this is they couldn't even get in Cuba they couldn't even hear him they just were and they weren't even aware of an attack this later they had symptoms Wow probably hell of a headache I would imagine yeah house trip boy mad if that gets in the wrong hands well if that becomes like you know technology gets into the hands of regular people eventually like tasers and shit you just go buy a taser how'd you get by some sound shit just point at your neighbor always mowing the lawn just art give me a know if the MP is an EMP a real threat to like America or whatever like matrix style EMP wipes out all the electronics it's a real issue with it is natural solar blasts any sort of solar flare I mean there's there's there's a massive potential for solar interrupts and interruption of our entire power grid like some massive solar flare happens and just cooks all of our satellites the entire power we have to start from scratch we're down no power for months the EMP whoa we're in Puerto Rico yeah the EMP is real but I think you have to create so much power to have one that big I think that's that's the limiting factor on it I had a guy in here Peter Schiff was here with us today this the son brought darkness back there was a blackout caused by solar flare like those in the 90s 89 it's okay the entire province of Quebec Canada suffered an electrical power blackout hundreds of blackouts occurred in some parts of North America every year that go back back out was different because this one was caused by a solar storm yeah apparently like what we're we've tracked so far in terms of like solar activity is just a tiny fraction of what the Sun is capable of the Sun is capable of some pretty wild variations and if those wild variations if it hits like a real odd end they could just fuck our entire system oh well we're at the mercy of nature always you know no matter how big our egos get over our creations what we build nature is like oh you know I'll wipe that shit out in a minute I mean like there's nothing I used to do a joke about that like oh look at my beach house I stayed at one for a while and at nighttime it reveals itself yeah in the daytime it looks beautiful look at all that beautiful blue water it's amazing so pretty the ocean so at night it is a black monster it's like a space it's a dark monster because you don't see anything and you realize like oh that is fucking kajillions of gallons of water they could just swallow up the entire city tons of weight and pressure like this you know it's like snow snow is the same way you know it's shut everything down just a major snowfall but you don't live next to snow that's the fucked up thing about living next to the ocean is you're literally on the edge but you can live in one of those places that gets hit with you know 10 feet of snow 12 feet of snow and you're screwed yeah but you could see that shit coming and get out of Dodge but we don't know which people live on the edge yeah that's the same thing with earthquakes right I told my mom a long time ago like she'd be a you okay I said mom let's hope one day I make enough money to live somewhere I have to worry about you know fire so you know you know I mean like I live in a valley I'm fine like I wish I wish I had to worry about fires but man want is no brush clearing a little bit no I don't have a full kit I have a Red Cross kit and a couple of gallons of water but um I'm gonna I'm gonna expand on that I have some food some freeze-dried food you know a guy who went through Katrina told me cash cash he said keep cash in the house he said after Katrina and milk was a hundred dollars a gallon a hundred yeah whoa yeah he said you got to keep a large sum of cash in the house as part of your disaster kit something I never would have thought of but he said yet there's a disaster the price of everything goes up and cash is the only currency like you can't use credit cards if there's no electricity was there an issue in Houston where people getting arrested for price gouging on water oh yeah yeah they were charged in I don't know was it 90 bucks a case I think for water and $100 a gallon for gas or something human nature what are you gonna do with us I wish we could wrap this up on a nice note I gotta end this all right anything good to say to people yeah yeah be nice to be nice to people you know you know about it no seriously it's this is a little thing but you know what bothers me don't if you're in the elevator don't hit the door close button yeah that's just a button it's just an assholes it's no time the door closed that's an asshole move people to see someone almost changed in the world Joe that's how I'm chief listen I can't solve gun violence I can't I can't help with the football protests or anything but if you can just not press the door close button it's a start but there are some motherfuckers with like four kids when the elevator is completely packed like hold the door where are you going no you where are you going where you going and if your kid presses every button on the elevator and he accidentally takes one to the head we can't be held responsible see see I'm not saying that elbow height we're just moving not saying that got in the way I'm just saying stay away from the door closed but don't press that door close button ladies and gentlemen that's a strong advice from Alonzo Bodden it's the wings of a butterfly they become a hurricane exactly you letting someone in that elevator might change the course of history think about it it's like when Peter Parker left that burglar pass by and it killed his uncle Ben boom and they turned him into spider-man exactly yeah all right strong words I like it lots of both ladies gentlemen thanks - thank you brother [Applause] [Music]
