straightening is nothing works properly there are no good mobile phones one boom mile has only been here for five minutes we've already discussed cocaine radical feminism radical progressives that want to take over the world prescription drugs tight shirts we've gone the full gamut we have we really have and it's it's fresh it's young and fresh I've already gone the full gamut I found out about you I guess it was somebody just I get a lot of interesting stuff tweeted at me and I read one of your Breitbart pieces and I was like check this motherfucker out and then I found out that you're gay and you're you're a part of this gamergate but you're in the game you're on this you were on the side of the people that were not the ultra progressives like and then you were in these debates against these radical feminism chicks and shutting them down and I was like bring around about me you play some video look at this motherfucker you're a unicorn they don't like people like you I'm not supposed to exist rules of the universe I should not be yeah you should not supposed to be like fairly buttoned down and conservative and and fair well but also factually correct like all the stuff that you thing that I had seen and you gotten in this argument about why certain women and gravitate towards certain jobs and men gravitate towards jobs and this idea that that a lot of this is just cultural a lot of this is something that we're pushing upon young men and young women and you were like well this isn't the case at all hilarious to watch someone confronted by like they expect that to come from a me they expect it to come from someone like I ought to be supporting legs and on paper paper I should you know I'm a metropolitan other circumstances I would be a liberal I'm a homosexual yeah I listen I'd like pop culture you know all of those things I shouldn't really exist but I do unfortunately for them one tenth of your tweets are about how fabulous your hair is yes or black dick subjects you know it's hair or you know the men that I'm into it very very difficult for them to beat me for one simple reason which is they've never been questioned they've never been called in any of their stuff by anybody serious or anybody who doesn't conform to the progressive rules of identity politics so when they come for me their usual the usual response from a feminist to anybody bringing facts or a countess a serious counter-argument is simply to dismiss them as a sexist or a bigot or misogynist it's really tough to make the allegation against me I love women all my friends are women I don't have any I don't have a dog in the fight sexually speaking I don't care if you know I don't want to bang them whatever size they are however they behave so they really don't they don't have that over me it's very very difficult to come up against the guy that you cannot make a convincing argument of bigotry again so you have to argue on the facts and of course the facts are on my side well that's what the deal is they can't dismiss you instantaneously because of what you represent because what you represented I think well look we got the dirt on him he's fabulous shit hit the radar you note that you get calls from friends who say so this person might you told me trying to check you out this happened to me about a year ago so I I sort of hit I've been a journalist for 10 years having some good stuff broken some big stories but I never really never really kind of crossed over into entertainment into the mainstream and it started to happen about a year ago and I start to get emails from friends and they were saying him so what's going on here like people keep you know me asking me about you like trying to ask like in back in 2011 did he really do this and what I realized is when they when they've recognized you as a threat when they identify you as somebody could do them damage they start going on maneuvers trying to find out everything about you trying to find out what the worst stuff they have on you is so that it can dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a neo-nazi or whatever they can come up with anything they can grasp at because their strategy is to dismiss is to dismiss the speaker by attacking the speaker's credibility because that way they never have to even consider the merits of the argument yes they haven't been able to do that with me which is why feminists now refuse to bait me debate me on TV because they know they'll lose they can't bring out all they can't bring out look at this battery of dismissing they've just dismissal tactic so they've imagined in the last 30 years and they've got so complacent because they've never had you know a sassy gay person come up and say it you're talking bullshit and you're hurting men and here are the facts they've never had it before so they've never built up an arsenal to fight it you know so this is this is why I win and why I'll cook I'll keep winning because they they don't really know how to deal with an argument on its own merits and in any case of course the facts are on our side well it's also this conversation that we're having right now is about war you're saying winning and losing and they're taking tactics and strategies to look up dirt on the opposition you're going they're treating this is it's this is an ideological war it's not a debate about the facts of the issue and I think that's part of it because the left has always seen this as a war and the gender warriors you know have always been warriors they've always seen this in strategic terms I'm not sure people aren't conservatives are naturally more self-effacing conservatives tend to be a little bit cool a little bit more chill about things they kind of don't want to get I think they get very angry about things I mean Ted Cruz well I'm not saying all conservatives how do you explained what's-her-name the Palin chick Sarah Palin these are the these are the outline is that even most conservatives find these people a bit much Mike Huckabee I think that guys in is in the end who knows no TV yes so fat because so rock and rollin I want Marco Rubio just because he's hot if we can't have Trump that I want I don't think I think people are silly so whether or not it's a conservative thing or a liberal thing I think there's a vast majority of people that aren't not very good at looking at themselves and they're not very good at looking at the momentum of their actions they just think that they're right because this is what they've they've been saying for so long and I think that's one of the most horrific things about these conversations as these women get in with you about because like when they're talking about what they think are social constructs things like gender identities the way people be and when you shatter that with the facts they're looking for some other weapons and there's nothing there you see in their eyes you know because it's not really a debate about the idea itself it's just not what it's not what it's about is gender warfare that's why people like christina hoff sommers called them gender warriors because these aren't people who want any kind of social justice as they say these are people who just hate men well they hate men they want to hurt men they don't want equality for women they want to be they want superiority for women whether it's architected into the education system or you know affirmative action or whatever it is they don't want equality they want superiority and fundamentally a lot of this but you know these these crazy extremists you know progressive third wave feminists today's version of feminism it basically boils down to misandry and it takes a gay guy because it's so dangerous for men to even broach the subject anymore and any man with a mainstream job puts that at risk by even talking on the subject no matter what its opinion is it takes a gay guy to go on you know Sky News in the UK and say I'm sorry the facts are not on your side what you're doing is damaging to women it's to me really an indictment on Iran debate in our public square that it is so dangerous for a man to even express an opinion on this subject that it takes a fag to go and stick up for petrol sexuals if other men could say this they would be but they can't because they would risk their careers - always talking about silencing people I see songster men well that it that is true there's a lot of daxing and going after people and a lot of a lot of anger when it comes to all this stuff but I think what you have in many cases when you see this kind of like disjointed illogical sort of way of thinking I think you have people that are assholes that find a cause that gives them the green light to be an asshole well everything about this you know I agree with you I think no disrespect to any particular church but I think it's reasonable to say 50 years ago if you were a bully if you're a sociopath you wanted to take out other people you wanted to wreak harm on the world that you thought would hurt you reasonably good way of doing that would be to join the clergy and many people did and I think you know most of us who are religious who have religious families know stories like that these days you're better off getting a job at Gawker you know if you want to bully somebody if you really want to hurt them if you have some sort of internal chaos or damage and you want to impose order on the world outside because you feel so confused and broken and messy the best way to do today is become a social justice warrior because not only do you get the same kind of status in society the clergy would have done 50 years ago but you also get media platforms you get money you get approval you get applause and if you layer on these new tactics of you know fake abuse and fake Harris and you know this terrible man you know these terrible men coming for me on the internet with stuff you can make quite a lot of money - yeah you can form a patreon page what is that it's like what is a crowd fund me for my idea so in the old days you'd have patrons of the Arts and they would be you know like a prince or some rich guy or maybe there may be a little later in history it would be a mercantile patron and in the way in the way that many industrialists and bankers still give a lot of money to their local Opera House or something like that so patch on is a way of turning that open into crowdfunding so you're your patron becomes a load of people all of them give you a little bit of money right so it's it's in theory quite a respectable and interesting way of funding the Arts in principle there's nothing wrong with it but it seems to become colonized by people who are raising money on the basis of sympathy rather than anything they actually create so it's what I've what I've noticed in my reporting on this is the vast majority of people begging for money on patreon as far as I can tell I'm sure patreon will tell me you know most of the money on their platform goes to creative projects but as far as I can tell it's you know people bleating for sympathy you know fishing for empathy it'll there's a lot of women on there claiming to be you know claiming that their lives are being ruined by men you actually look into I can't find the tweets they're talking about you know and it's and it's a way for hey this is great tweet by what's an airport who is like a gamergate supporter and icon I'm going to remember it wrongly but it's something along the lines of you know every day on the internet some goony beard man you know promises to be nice to a social justice warrior in the hope of a wank or the hope of a blowjob or something like that you know and it's these guys who were just sort of throw a fiver or throw a 10 or a month's you know $20 a month to this video games developer who's never produced anything in her life but claims she's getting harassed and claims she's getting threats it's a very very weird psychological dynamic and I think it's I think it's quite it's it's it's into woven with the way that feminism has turned women and professional victims handed them this victimhood script and most of these women are not really to blame they're not kind of these aren't these aren't horrible sociopathic you know war mongers these aren't people who really hate men they're just a bit miserable they've reached for you know the nearest victimhood available to them because we live in a culture where you know victimhood is the is the most valuable currency that you can that you can amass and and so they go out they advertise what a terrible life they have and how all four people ask them on the internet and they ask men mainly it's women asking for money from men you know effectively for sympathy dollars it's incredibly demeaning it's incredibly you know to the human spirit you know aside from anything else you know you're basically telling these women that that they have more value as whingers and Liars and gender warriors than they do as creators or mothers and I find a hugely destructive I think that what we're talking about as far as like people that are assholes that just latch on latch on to a cause and then that if you go to their page like there's there's so many of them that write blogs and you go to their blog and their blog is just an attack blog it's just consistent attacks on people that don't share their ideas or don't or have differing ideas of quite a term for this what is it I've coin sense quantum superstate feminism and it is and it is feminism that exists at once as aggressor and victim it is simultaneously and at all times aggressor and victim and it describes these women who go out like lobbing shit at people and then instantly turn into damsels in distress when they when they see their own language returned in kind you know quite often returned at greater volume because what they're saying is ridiculous and offensive and people get annoyed about it perfectly reasonably and also if you create environment in which it's fine to say anything you want about man it's fine to say kill all white men it's fine to publish articles in you know in mainstream new media publications about how to hurt men and all the rest of it jets the woman's recently the Google ideas woman that had that tweet about she eats men for breakfast I think that Randy Hoffer if you imagine if a guy wrote that down I eat women for breakfast you know some men do speak to women like that like them some of the men's rights activists under well yes but you know why men's rights activists are so rude to women because they're assholes well know what they're doing women have for 30 years said treat us like men we just like men were just the same treat us like men know we can do everything that men can do yeah you do everything that men can do men's rights activists just take them at their word and the weight and taunting is how men bonds you know no that's not what they're doing there's no they're doing then I try to bond with these women they're trying to hurt them well I think what they're doing is taking and taking at face value this demand for us to treat women I say us for them to treat women you know just just like they were their buddies down the pub well if you ever actually been to a pop when you're hearing men like out playing paint snooker or whatever they're fucking awful yeah but I don't I think they're doing exactly the same thing they don't want these women doing everyone's just being a cunt it just like take away the gender it's a the men are being consummate are being cunts people are reaching through these internet lines trying to hurt each other that's what they're doing I think it's true and I'm not I'm not totally on board with a whole men meninist men's room for a second I think anybody who spends so much time working on their like approval of their own gender like we're supporting our own gender like there's a lot of dudes that are pieces of shit there's a lot of women that are assholes that's just I think part of the problem is that they sort of become feminists in Reverse and they use the same tactics they like to show police they also I mean it's amazing you've got on some of the communities in Reddit and you read some of these blogs and they're sort of you know they're like fainting couch men's rights activists you know okay so I have a friend Julie bindle who's very very funny she's a lesbian she's basically this Dyke feminist she hates men she made this joke and it's kind of like the sort of joke I would make she said you know we should put all men in internment camps you know they could take another visitation once a month you know we'll have guards and they could just stay in camps until they learn how to behave if I did that about women the whole manosphere as it were would be like applauding they think it was hilarious but because she said it in a similar level of jest you know suddenly it was just disgusting outrageous thing you know feminists as men should be put in concentration camps and I was like bitches really are you fucking kidding me feminists do you are taking a joke like they're taking a joke you're pretending to take it seriously and then you're starting an outrage circus about it and I was like for fuck's sake I am out it's recreational outrage isn't that what this is supposed to be like fighting against you know I'm in this because I'm like a cultural libertarian as my colleague Alan Bukhari puts it you know I believe in classical some freedom of speech freedom of thought freedom of expression you know I don't care what you believe I just want you to have I want I want to be able to interrogate your ideas in the public square um but you know this outrage circus that so many men seem to be getting involved in and the way they treat you know they call pickle circumcision male genital mutilation like wait a minute isn't it I'm just saying I mean it is look I'm going to write it's cutting skin well I don't favor it purely on aesthetic grounds you can understand these things in my mouth okay baby no no I have you I know lots of men don't like on this issue and it's simply that you know we it's just good grooming frankly we women women women go on women have boob jobs procedure that comes close to the numbers of babies that get circumcised that's done a female just weird but I think I'm in the minority here I'm sorry I'm sorry to offend you but I think I'm in the minority here but I just don't imagine what any man wouldn't want lots and lots of really good blowjobs because well apparently it feels better when the skin is on it's so much how do you know unless you've done both well because I've got feedback from anecdotal evidence where I've got a large sample size you just like the way they look better when it's all trimmed up nice based a lot on what we're used to it's nice good they should suffer if you're fucking dumb enough to get your dicks getting cut off when you're 30 I hope I hope it hurts we can't agree on this you don't have to suck one of these things okay I like to believe that about the same approach that I do to vaginas like of a girl at a big vagina lips I wouldn't say you know he shouldn't get that shit cut off now it's horrifying no leave it there that's what it is it is what it is okay big nipples like do you need them shrunk down that's fuckin barbaric it's all in the mind you know well no I mean either you know there are people on scrupulous ly cutting babies dicks is stupid babies dick you don't have to cut his dick I'm you know how many kids lose their dicks every year because of infections and because of the surgery goes wrong a lot I can't win if you're gonna take this view if you're gonna take this line like cutting babies dicks I thought win against that a surgical procedure I'm happy to be the minority aesthetically pleasing surgical procedure you know what all you may be cutting all you motherfuckers out there you want to get your foreskin right I'm gonna I'm gonna get I'm gonna give these world-class blowjobs to the Jews and step congratulations on a world-class blowjob my favorite story was my least favorite story but my favorite story to bring up was a moil in New York who had herpes and when they when they cut the baby's dick in the traditional way they actually suck on the baby's penis to stop the bleeding have you ever seen this and the kid died because the kid got herpes from the rabbi the moil whatever that fuck his name is what a great idea cotton baby dicks kid could have grown up to solve cancer or you had I'm one of those things one of them could be awesome meanwhile nope dead baby well I don't think anyone's gonna disagree with you on that particular yeah don't cut baby dicks all right but how the fuck did we get on you know you know look there's absolutely a bunch of horrible shit that happens to women on a daily basis I mean every time you see these fucking Cosby stories these women that are coming out of nowhere about Bill Cosby when when when women talk about worrying about being drugged and if you had don't know anybody that's actually happened to or someone close to you that's actually happened to you that danger doesn't seem real so any but you see this Bill Cosby thing and you're like not only is it real it's like here's the guy that was America's his the voice of morality for a generation there's become such a mania a moral panic like a moral panics in history about this stuff that the genuine victims are starting to be disbelieved and this is driven by I'm sorry to say kind of a sort of progressive narrative over fat kind of journalism Sabrina Odell in Rolling Stone you know all these rapes we hear about they all seemed to unravel within a couple of months that was a rolling stone as uva years didn't happen there's a girl at Columbia didn't happen Duke Lacrosse didn't happen yeah well yes but we should be you know we should be working on how to so often prevent these crimes better in the waist you that is not to erect it is not to stage a moral panic in the media pointing fingers at innocent people and when you when you as was clearly the case with Rolling Stone sort of a sweep under the carpet facts or permissions that that throw doubt on your story because you think this is just something we should be talking about anyway whether this specific case where we have the details of this specific case what happens is when all of that when these rape stories or whatever it is get repeat gets successes successive rape stories get repudiated and debunked it undermines confidence and trust in anyone who makes that complaint anyone who says this happened to me right I'm in the back of their head I think perfectly reasonably people are thinking oh another one you know it's not a nice thing but this is what this is this can be the effect of a moral panic in the media it damages the real victims the most and that's you know that's why I've written about this stuff in the past I think it's also why it's really important to tell the truth about statistics now feminists will always have a they have a complicated relationship with the truth a big one is the one in four women exactly I mean this goes all the way up to Obama every time you hear it seems to get worse you know but I think we extrapolate out it's gonna be like 50 women in five gets raped within a second of stepping on campus by 2025 you know it gets worse every time it's based on ridiculous studies I mean the way this thing I started I think Christina Hoff Sommers at the American Enterprise Institute who always cite because she's so fantastic and so she's another unicorn so on and she you know she just have some problems with with contemporary feminism and gender Wars you know she she does a great series of factual feminist I'm sure a lot of you but you know she sort of tracked down the original study for this which was you know samples has about 70 people and an adult education college which is so eight so completely alien in character I mean these people like 20 years older you know and of course there's you know adult education colleges you know there is a different set of social issues that go along with adult education cause then them 20 year olds undergrads you know what he call them freshmen you know doing a regular degree in college sample size was ridiculous the university was atypical and this has been extrapolated out to this to this feminist myth that just won't die like that like the gender pay gap is also how they define like there's people that one definition sexual stories and sexual abuse has been broadened so widely what's getting crazy in regret in some universities it is part of the university's Conduct code that unwanted sexual advances that means me saying you're really pretty can I buy you a drink constitutes a sexual harassment now this is just you know you have to close down every nightclub in the country it's just extraordinary bonkers you know crazy stuff and this is you know 30 years unchallenged feminism which is why I do what I do because I think it matters I think it's important I talk to guys 20 years old you know our age right 48 ok fine so I mean like you know you may be my dad's almost at my dad's generation but anyone your age even right down to my age I'm thirty it would have been a bit ridiculous for us to say that you know society's architected against men you know when we were growing up it just wasn't the case and there's no point trying to pretend that it was but I speak to boys all the time and I'm into you know so many of them now of about 20 who do go through life experiencing this extraordinary sort of architecture you know against them whether it's being you know whacked on a drawl at school or more women you know getting into university for no good reason or women as in a Cornell 2015 study showed that women have to two-to-one advantage going for a stem job in academia and so being discriminated against because they don't have a vagina and 20 year old boys do have some serious problems now anyway you know risk not just one but many lost generations of boys that I call this this exodus are a big to potter about this that i think i think a lot of people were very nice about and it seemed to go down very well yeah there's some really serious stuff to address here which is why do one the reasons i I do because I you know I think that's what journalism supposed to be for you know speaking up for people who don't have a platform themselves and for um you know that the establishment has lost lost sight of and doesn't care about anymore this is why I think it's important to tell the truth about statistics you can't help victims if you lie but in your first sentence about what the problem is and there is not a you know a systemic problematic gender pay gap in the United States or in Europe there is not a an epidemic of rape culture on campus there is not you know a problem in universities or with not enough women going into stems into science technology or or mathematic subjects all of these things are so have subtle and sophisticated explanations that you know when you would take into account human nature and the different choices people make and what women want to do you realize that this stuff is bunk but many of these myths simply won't die well you also have to take into consideration there's a bunch of other variables right like women leaving because they have children and you have to factor that into the amount of income this stuff is based on a misunderstanding between earnings and pay you can't take all the men in society and all the women in society and do like a two to stage calculation and say right well there's 77 percent as much money on this side right right that's not what people mean when they say there's a page where you say that see where you to say something there's a wage gap what what they think you mean is women get paid 77 cents on the dollar do you know that's the phrase they use - a man's right implying that women get paid less for the same work that's the implication that they're making through all of this because they're confusing earnings with wages right earnings would pay what actually happens is men work longer hours men take even when you control for children men take fewer fewer holidays they take shorter holidays they work longer hours they make more money for their firms all the rest of their men just work harder they have longer careers etc etc women prefer whether or not they have children to have a more balanced life they prefer not to work full time they're like to work part-time that you know you've seen these rationalizations of course is the left dog is that not all women speaking generalizations is problematic though to do that because know there are is it means I think the term is statistically there are more men that are working longer hours that are working harder that generate more money and say like men do that we all know lazy fucks it just happened with the reason I do it is that the reason I phrase it exactly like that is that I don't want to you know let's not open up the you know this hold not all men stuff that the left the right because that's that that's that's the pot that's the that is the root into this sort of social conditioning argument yeah just objective what I'm trying to what the point I'm trying to make is that men general meant men generally have the following traits right and this this roof is reflected employers have those trees fine but lazy man yes lazy man but they're also men dropping out of society because you know because they feel that there's just no place for them anymore you know they've had that what they consider to be their role in the family snatched away from the my generation sounds ridiculous but I speak to 20 year old boys all the time who are saying I can't be bothered with women you know this is movement McTell men going their own way there yeah but there are chief fuckers involved well you say that well there's a lot of guys you say that ten years ten years ago five guys later ten years ten years ago sure but today the numbers are balloon they're blossoming then blossoming it was so fast and you know the thing is men deal reasonably well without women they don't like to do it look people who look people like us are not gonna want to for sex right because we're outgoing and ballsy and brash and self-confident all the rest of it right we're not gonna have it too much of a problem but there are plenty of men who don't have us off confidence and who are being bullied and deride and ridiculed every day in the media this stuff gets you people male suicide epidemic you know this is suicide epidemic across war know that well the number the number of female suicides I means different statistics different countries it's differ slightly but you know the female numbers aren't really changing we're getting more unhappy decade after decade but they don't actually commit suicide they never go through with it when they try they fail you know they can't even commit suicide properly how in cover they can even kill themselves properly when they get upset they're forcing the mended kill themself well they often well with women often Road we would often write the suicide notes and then they try to kill themselves and they fail or they correlate or they bottle it at the last minute they never they never end up dead but men just you know go quiet for a few days and then just they just hang themselves those those numbers are going up the number of men who are just giving up on relationships that number is going up I can't believe that see because then you're factoring in you this kind of like you know swole media star where he hangs out with you know good-looking fashionable people or girlfriends you know banging banging out girls it's not it's not it's not you're married kids I don't need to know what you get up to this is I know you're saying this is not the game's gonna be seen it's not some unhappy people this is not a scary there's no aliens of men out there by themselves just alone just get really down to me is it gonna be this fucking British queer who's gonna stick up for these guys when this fucking man why the fucking media beating down my door because even you guys won't stick up for men anymore cuz you can't just coddle them like that if they really want to dress well grow it's too hard with girls dude you know I'm a total sociopath but I still preach a little sympathy on this issue you know but we the feminists will call you that all right well I've got some terrible things specially with the male feminists they're trying to get for social rowdy points I love Twitter profile I usually don't write mail phone go oh just feminists just feminists and I'm like oh god how long's it been how long's it I just want to I want to ask them how long's it mean and they're like two years what they don't understand is the kind of women they're sucking up to don't even want them no women don't want men to speak about feminism they don't want allies because no man's ever gonna be good enough to speak about women's issues is the crux of identity politics modern feminists don't want men they hate men stop sucking up to them only way you're gonna get them is to neg them the only way you're gonna get them is to say you are a ridiculous fucking whore and I'm paying you no attention whatsoever and that's how you get them well you're ridiculous woman I'm paying you no attention whatsoever and that key second part of the phrase if someone's really focusing on that second part of that phrase that's what makes them come running to make the hem so I'm able to analyze these things dispassionately well there's some truth to that certainly there's definitely some truth for wise gay uncle you know from a distance can tell you what's tell you what's going what's happening it's just pathetic to watch those poor men grovel just grovel for social brownie points yes it is and they're never going to get the handjob it's not gonna happen but it's even that like that they can't see that it's not about feminism it's not about masculinism either if that's a word it's about just people not being full of shit you know just not crying victim when you're not really a victim not pulling the fucking fire alarm on a product guy who's that Toronto thing were the the guy was they totally misrepresented the position of his book misrepresented what his position was on women period and on men and he was just essentially trying to hide some men have and they were calling I'm just sorry I mean I I quite like getting insults because I like to I like to rape them I give them mocks out of ten and then I go back to the troll and I explain how they could have made it better how they could improve you know so I like to take I take them to troll school and you know sometimes people tell you good things I go take a bath with a toaster which is quite funny like I like that that's good any more circuits yeah I likes to joke anyway and then sometimes it's just you know you deserve to die you know the insult and ridicule and demean and try to discredit the speaker if they can't do that they will do some other kind of silencing or no platforming or whatever so those opinions can never be Alana's opinions ever aired in public because those opinions and the facts that underpin them the reasoning that underpins them which is what people go to these talks to hear is so dangerous the feminist narrative which is basically you know based on feeling and not fact based on you know bigotry and and class and gender hatred not any kind of sensible analysis where the world works I've got so many invitations to universities for the next six months and you know this isn't an advertisement or any feminist listening but I know this is going to happen and you know the talks go on anyway it just takes takes up a whole day of your life instead of an afternoon but you know I know it's gonna happen I've got to you know I'm going I'm speaking universe some swings at USC Republicans next week I'm speaking you know to a bunch of UK and US universities over the next six months and I just know what's coming you know and it's it's extraordinary like a homeless gay dude you know I cracked dick jokes on Twitter and I do Sky News now and again and if you know if I'm if I'm like a scariest opponent you know that they have they got real problems well you are because of what we highlighted earlier Semmy joking shit I know send me joking but I'm not kind of a game and make your argument for God's sake and why is it for the last thirty years they have been incapable or unwilling of actually making an argument and instead they do everything they can to simply get the speaker out of the public eye well because they just an echo chamber I mean I think that some of the forums that they go to the Twitter groups that they I've gone to people's pages because I find out they're ridiculous I read an RN an article about this patient went to his Twitter page and I was already blocked I mean I've never even interacted with lock lists you're gonna block list because you follow me I see I see he likes to Volda more for these guys I've said a few controversial things myself and my other thing doing wasn't a controversial thing there was that Tommy fucking I would take a long time we'd have to review the internet if you call you if you're a man you call yourself a feminist I hope you choke to death on vegan pizza why crying to a lady Gaga song yes is it talking about death okay I prefer they get raped with that Wow male rape is are as bad as female rapes all right you could say that like male rape to the piece doesn't seem is awful it's funny some of us go out in search of male rape that's a comical thing to say though a man being raped by a pizza whereas if you nuts I tell you what you know what I like that you I like that I like that you find it horrible because it shows to me that chivalry is not dead and you haven't not a decent respect for you know for women and for speaking about women properly and I like that you're offended by what offended but I like that you find it distasteful to speak of women that way this speaks well of you I think what feminism is done I think what feminism has done has made it very difficult to be nice about women because they create this environment where there's so much hate and bile and ridicule hold at men men feel like they got a responding kind or just check out entirely and it's it's the traces that's what I don't buy I nice I think you have a very small minority of going they're not very attractive who get really upset at men and having a lot of sociological shit when it comes to these really radical anti male feminists a lot of it is a constant state of rejection to the proportionate effect on these these ugly women who by the way they're all sorts of studies which I love which show that ugly women are much more likely to be liberals and of course they are yeah makes sense for the reasons you would imagine they find feminism or perhaps they start losing their looks in their 30 so they did they they you know slide back into feminism or these ya know women had gone at 30 I like twenty-year-olds start requesting things in their 40s a lot of times they'll even go to yoga what the statistics show is that women in their 30s if they're still single static a bit nuts they report themselves as being generally more unhappy with life more likely to have contemplated suicide more like rest men consider retreat into porn in video games but women get women women go nuts if they're single in their 30s thanks feminism you've conceded so much ground already by allowing yourself to be taken over by this leftist clap now I'm just being objective we speak it's a soft quantifier when you say like you know women are X you mean most people X is easy it is understood yes it's annoying to women and aren't like that what does shit get over it's impossible to communicate this is a British thing no it's not a British thing it's just a not being a nitpicky dick it's just a simple addition to policing you've given that you've given it over already you language policing you know you're halfway to feminism a long time and he was ugly and because he and he used to get rejected all the time and he started getting really fucking angry and as he got older we had to stop hanging out with him because he would you know he would meet girls who try to hit on him they would they would say no like fucking lesbians he's fucking cunt anyone can learn to be funny during that process during that process you still have sexual needs so he had not accomplished any of those goals so he was not were not attractive to these women and because he wasn't attracted to these women I witnessed over the course of knowing him for several years I witnessed this misogyny grow inside of him and it was based on the interactions that he had with women who were all negative yes the interactions he with women he came away feeling bad about himself feeling rejected and so he started to project that they were the root cause of this issue I think you're dealing with a lot of the same these feminists I think the problem is that society has been architectures in such a way that those those outcomes those rejections are now not just the norm but almost enforced by a woman's need to reject a man and to say you know look at this stuff you know unwanted advances of sexual harassment basically what it means but those are the monsters the monster women who were trying to push that this is so small it's such a small percentage you grossly underestimate the influence these people have on not just debate in the media but on policy in universities and even the government look at California yes means yes affirmative consent laws this stuff becomes law it does and when it when it starts in California it spreads elsewhere every you know every every big American University has a ridiculous code of conduct that's got this stuff embedded in it and it comes from the you know that yes it comes from the crazies I admit I willingly admit that most women are wonderful and I don't buy into this shit and indeed of course in just what is it in just two years from 28% of women down to eighteen percent women identifies feminists fewer than one in five mmm corn sauce feminists because they see what we see which is that these feminists are all MS Andrus lesbionic crazy people fine but those MS Andrus lesbionic crazy people are affecting laws in this country and in my country they're affecting conduct codes of conduct to university that dictate a man's entire future and a woman's entire future for that matter and a happiness and good sexual health and and the destination of the species the way that men and women interact with each other is becoming poisoned by these people you grotesquely underestimate their influence if you write them off as a few mad crazies in student unions but they have gigantic purchase on on the media and therefore on politicians well they certainly do when it comes to schools for women getting getting a sexually assaulted on campus listen though your president is parroting these myths from these yes Obama has repeated the sexual harassment myth Obama has also repeated the wage gap myth you're dismissing these people are sort of powerless fringe crazies the President of the United States is repeat they're talking points don't tell me these people are influential it's nuts well that's a different thing isn't it I mean when the president the president is really just a guy who's supposed to parrot what everybody else sort of already believes anyway and if that's what the progressive Democratic person a Republican president would be any different there would be a lot more Jesus talk what else would be there from what would tell the truth Trump would tell the truth is a troll no accusing me of trolling what a horrible allegation to make no I really I do really like him do I really want him in the White House you can fill in the gaps you're a ghost yeah but I love when I wonder stay in the race for as long as possible look he taps into you know you and I both and you know obviously I don't have a fraction of your you know reach and extraordinary audience and fans but we're both in our own ways kind of countercultural figures and very popular countercultural figures and I think that you may not like this but I think Trump taps into a similar vein of frustration and suspicion and hatred of the establishment of the political media classes I think some of the same instincts that make people quite like Trump they don't like Trump because they believe what he has to say on about taxation because they know he's inconsistent on that they might like what he says about immigration but they don't necessarily like the fact that he you know was a funder to Hillary and all he got out of it was her showing up to the wedding they know in many cases particularly the way he speaks about women and I think Carly funeral was Fiorina was magnificent in that debate um but what they do like is the fact that he you know doesn't give a shit doesn't apologize and gives such a gigantic brilliant bloody nose to the establishment that has drifted so far from ordinary people you and I both but both net beneficiaries of that same frustration mmm and that's why I like Trump because I think broader look II don't him in the White House I'll be honest okay don't tell anyone this but you know I don't want him in the White House but I do understand why people like him and the the instinct that people have to like him that sort of sense of mischief and gadfly ashiness the reason people want to vote for him because it makes the establishment Republicans so angry and they don't understand and they can't I totally and I have a lot of sympathy for those people I agree with those people on a lot of points I agree with them entirely about the failings and and corruption of the the general media and political establishment generally I totally agree with them all all that stuff so I wouldn't call myself a Trump fan but I am a fellow traveler when it comes to American politics and American education I think there's some parallels to be drawn and I think one of the parallels is that any of these ancient systems that were established back when the world was completely different and didn't have the Internet they are no longer valid today they're just not and you're we're clinging to these old ways of operating that if you try to propose them today no one would buy into it no one would buy into American universities if you tried to propose the way you if you tried to propose the whole educational system as it is today where you put people out of college when you release them there are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with no fucking jobs to be seen and the reason it's wrong isn't that it's anachronistic because there are things that are not strictly justifiable with logic which nonetheless work best for the monarchy you know there's no you can't make a plausible argument as to why we should have and if you don't if you don't once you get them out if you don't somehow or another establish a new Empire is a necessary condition I just think you know for example the monarch in England so you can't make a pay you can't make a plausible rational argument to establish a ruling monarchy in the United Kingdom today right but it works best it's the best is the best system works great for you means we don't get you know a european-style president with his retinue of Jaguars and you know and all of the kind of pomp and circumstance and nonsense that goes with that yeah that's better well the British people understand you know and Americans understand this too actually the importance of significance they're binding power and the value of tradition and institution and history as something that progressives progressives hate all of the assumptions on which these things are based they hate all of the effects of them to which generally - anyway we and I think British people instinctively understand the value of having a national icon a figurehead and people come from all over the world because they reckon stinks if you understand this - you know the monarchy just is works best for so you think that should be an earned position though I mean isn't that what we're all trying to this is why I believe in grade internships because I think they introduce a dangerous element of egalitarianism into the system well I think people bred to rule and they should be allowed to get on with it born and bred to rule you're hilarious not your fuckin trolling now you're trolling you son of a bitch how dare you trying to introduce a real dangerous level of Harrisons to colleges and the system that was in place and then obviously I did my point my point which which is the serious point is that just because it's anachronistic doesn't make it wrong there are problems with the with the university system in America but I don't think just because you wouldn't construct it like it's constructed today that means you shouldn't do it at all no he's a good example of that no one's saying that oh I don't know if the monarch is a good example that cuz I think it's ridiculous Americans have the same thing for this team Americans have the same reverence for disaster for the office of the United States that you know the offerors office of the president same Reverend know every for the office not everybody in this country likes any you know any given president but you're but you will hear Republicans say don't say that about Obama he's the president he's not my president I didn't vote for him but he is the president so show him some respect there American who say no come on Americans that Americans do have an understanding lesson with him then I think any president because he's so fucking terrible obviously but is he know he's reduced your standing in the world so badly your house oh no idea please tell me as a foreigner on my soil I love America I'm one of those tell me one of those one of those Brits who repeated by people what I'm not exciting to sure if they have a real stance I'd like why is Obama so terrible in comparison to other present because in Europe we've seen the future Obama wants and we know it doesn't work we've seen socialized healthcare we've seen you know engorgement of the state we've seen these crazy feminist ideas about you know the wage gap and and and rapes on campus we have all this in Europe this is why America is great because it's not Europe and everything that I see in here from Obama suggests to me that he wants to take America you know it always used to be the case that Europe followed America's leading so many wonderful things with its pop culture and I personally all those all those have been largely positive imports but but it now seems like America's following Europe's leading in censorship in you know cracking down on free expression and creativity and all in you know socialized healthcare these things are disasters you know you will hear from Brits because it's the correct thing to say the NHS is the envy of the world I mean I would just encourage well maybe you don't want to go there certainly don't take any sick relatives but go to an NHS hospital in England it is horrific rendus conditions dreadful we will die in them all the time there's a scandal a few years ago thousands of people dying and you know some hospital and the Labour government has didn't give a shit or didn't do anything about it if not new this is not you know this is not a glittering utopia fine there are some problems with the American model and health care but trust me you do not want the NHS you know the way that Obama is pushing America to be more like Europe I think is some you know it's gonna hasten its decline as a world power we have seen your future as my colleague at bright block James Stirling Paul wrote a book I think he called a bomb I think he called it a bomb over mania maybe we've seen your future and it doesn't work and it was a sort of a love letter to the United States explaining that you know we've seen where Obama wants to go because we're living it and it's trust me it's not what you want but is that really what Obama wants to do and where he wants to go if that was the case like if you compare what Obama stood for before he got into office and what he's doing now can anybody look what about what that was well how about the hope and change website where they talked about the actions against whistleblowers he is hoping to change website with a big party platform really awarding whistleblowers pledges he's made evaporated as soon as he entered the Oval Office Guantanamo whistle blows all the really important stuff the morals the moral statements that you know you know what it was it's the kind of things that tell you what sort of man he is the whistleblower staff the Guantanamo the things that give you a sense of where his moral center is those were the things that he jettisoned the minute he entered the Oval Office that's why I why I say I mean I know you have a manifesto and you try and see as much of your manifesto through as you can and people hold you to account for joining any one person really truly has in that position what the hell's a bullshit jar the whole point the way the United States is structured is to limit the power of the president you know that you have all of that you know built into the system and as good as so it's all good but he does have a huge influence on what people talk about how they talk about it um you know he makes decisions about foreign policy and war you know is one the most important things that a nation can decide about itself is who it's going to fight you know he does make those kinds of decisions and those kind of decisions matter and he also has the power to me you say he does but he does based on what based on you seeing him talking on television we have no idea what exactly is going on behind the scene never the president has the executive authority in radical terms right this guy can send planes to places right but everything we've seen from Obama suggests that you know he want he wants to take a you know a sort of a sort of weird progressive socialized pseudo European approach to domestic policy health care taxation and this scares us in Europe because we always we looked up to you guys you were like you know you know it was America for me and as a European and you know your viewers are gonna pick holes in this I'm sure but for me Britain is probably the greatest country in the world because it didn't invent democracy or property rights or you know any of those great values that now the world basically revolves on but it was it was the best at spreading them you know England in particular spread democracy property rights freedom around the world and everywhere that Britain has been is a nice place to live and anyway that Britain hasn't been you wouldn't want to go to and America is sort of the distillation of the highest and best values of Britishness you know freedom and democracy and free speech and all this kind of stuff America was America's you know this petri dish what will happen if we take the very best of British values the stuff that we've spent centuries propagating around the world making the world a nice prosperous you know fair place to live what will happen if we take them and we cut over cut all the crap out and we make a country like that and we did it was America but that Marineris he said we did America was established by people fleeing Britain yes of course because we've been in decline for centuries but but importing to America the values that Britain spread around the world over hundreds of years but what's the whole deal that we wanted to get the fuck away from everything no I mean America is founded on British values America is founded on values that the British spread throughout the world I mean these values and those values in these institutions I'm talking I'm talking about democracy specifically kind of a parliamentary version of democracy rather than you know the particular model of democracy you know the Britain spread to India spread you know the Middle East the Britain went to nice places to live now where women women can dress how they like Kuwait for example not a terrible place to be where Britain didn't go Saudi not a place you'd want to be yeah any any way that Britain has touched has become better for it look at Japan they wear our suits you know they they talk our language they wear our suits Britain the influence and this is Britain's influence on the world no other country nothing else can touch it not Portugal not you know Holland nobody else can touch Britain for just sheer global influence Australia you know Canada all the places Britons of Britain has touched are dramatically better as a result but for me the sort of highest distillation of those those values that that Britain was spreading around the world it was always America and Obama is tearing America away from those values that's what I don't like that's why I said he was a terrible president that's why I struggle with with him in that office because he seems to me to be profoundly and I know that I know this is something instead of crazy right wings on the internet always say but he just seems to me to be profoundly unamerican on America doesn't share the values on which America was founded and in what sense tone what weight doesn't believe in free speech because he thinks free speech should be curtailed to save the feelings of certain interest groups in minorities believe you know he doesn't believe in you know why are you saying that where have you heard him say that because they the the effectively the the stuff he says about harassment of you know he's bought into this harassment nonsense the stuff he said about net neutrality the stuff he said about the rape count for stuff all of this all of these things are satellites of the free speech argument right net neutrality being a satellite of the free speech is all about free speech net neutrality what's about government regulating the Internet yes but it's about regulating known as by the government regulating the internet the frit neutrality is about the government regulating the internet having control over what private companies can but the relationship that a private company has with its own customer right you have a service from your provider called Comcast you know your relationship with Comcast is a private business arrangement between you and that company right net neutrality is about the government trying to intrude on that relationship and dictating what kind of business arrangement you can come to with concur Comcast and it's gonna say Comcast you cannot offer this package of services you cannot suggest to the customer there might be a higher tier service for people who pay more just like you know you can get a better car if you pay more or you can you know get anything else in life if you've got more money you get a better version of it right you can't do any of that we're going to insist because we've got we've got this crazy idea of internet or some kind of utility you know like water or something we're going to come in here and we're going to regulate and control the relationship that you a private company have with you a private individual that is you know that is that is at its essence of free speech argument because of what happens when you start regulating that traffic now the internet traffic that is split down you know that some of us for Netflix some of us for email some of it's whatever the the way in which certain things get you know what he wants to do is say that all traffic is neutral it is all equal yeah right but do you not see the benefit of that do not see there's no basis in do you not see that people would be concerned with the government being able to throttle internet away and puts operations have them have the ability to decide how much worrying about the power of corporations but it's not just worrying about it it's knowing the fact that this has been done illegally already without regulation you think for a second that if the government is and the power to regulate how an Internet service provider delivers its packets of data to consumers they're not going to then start to wonder what's in those packets and then start to say well actually you know what the net neutrality thing was fine like it was a really good idea and we loved it and we really haven't bring that to you but actually we've decided that this kind of data is more important so we're going to let you do that or indeed we're going to insist that you prioritize this kind of data and that has consequences for the free market that's consequences for businesses for example you know enforcing well well that's why an open Internet where everyone has access to the same sort of service is what everybody wants no that mean that's what we want I mean that there is an argument in America there's an argument that in insisting that all packets of data on the Internet which we should equally favors new startups into the market because they don't have to compete with incumbents who have privileged access to high-speed sure sure it's not just startups it's people like me that are able to broadcast things people that want to set up their own servers and put together their own website that does whatever the fuck they wanted to do the idea regulated in somehow or another it's not about regulations the I'm speaking for the absence of regulation I'm saying we should not regulate that we should allow private companies private want you know if the market works in these in these situations look what happens when ISPs try to manipulate Netflix traffic customers complain and they have to stop and they have to put it back again yeah the market works so well for this internet stuff because everybody internet so vocal their online already they complain about it takes two clicks the market works brilliantly for this stuff why allow the government to come in and dictate to private individuals and private corporations what their business relationship should look like and the nature of the services that they provide all the money they provide one another that's like--that's profoundly on American well there's a large argument against net neutrality there's a large argument online that we could spend hours going over the pros and cons of each side of it but I think ultimately people have a distrust in large corporations and a distrust in the government and either one of them having control of what has been like the one thing that's in power people in this country is the ability to put out a message and to get information and the files you do it just because but it could just because you Ronald it could be it could be limited you could we could be blocked there's a theory is a UN thing have you been paying attention to you you Empress the one a reporter at first would tell people then okay so the UN broadband Commission which is not one of the upper echelons of the UN you were the one who reporter and first how'd you get the information well somebody else broke the story but I was the one that reports that at length so my story's the one that went round the world so did I tweet your story yeah I think so explain the ridiculousness to this idea that the UN thinks that they're going to somehow this is my argument you see this is the government getting involved in what is the UN is saying that and this is wacky crazy stuff right this report for the UN broadband Commission the UN broadband Commission is what we haven't you I don't want you to Europe please don't become Europe we haven't in you're gonna become yours UN Commission is specifically set up to find ways it is paid for by European taxpayers and its purpose is to find ways of regulating the internet right that is what it's for right it is to you know it has it has a brief to find ways of kind of cutting down on internet freedoms mm-hmm one of the ways it's found to do that is to get a load of batshit crazy feminists in to say that people who ridicule or criticize them on the Internet are in fact guilty of harassment and abuse and as a result Internet services should be almost pre-screened you know woods should almost be pre-screened before the eff up here on the inter just the most crazy bullshit you know only European come up with this and this report came out and it was full of holes and we examined it I think I was the first report on his detail about this I would about I want to twice and and then I wrote about it a second time and I think the headline was am I the only responsible tech journalists left on the planet which is the only perhaps example self-congratulatory of you well I'm actually really modest but I'm actually really humble I'm like a very humble naturally but my sub-editors just pulling me into the sky understand how they got a kid those clicks I know I know it's it's not me at all if it were up to me I'd just be at home anyway so what they want to do is sort of like pre pre brief all of this stuff a pre pre check it and if they don't they want to clamp down my history what you're doing right now is you're saying it's okay for the government to get involved in this kind of regulation of what is a via private relationship I spiesse have with their customers but it's not okay for the government's get involved in this kind of keep the plates open so open to all different you think you're not until it's already in place I mean the the UN thing is essentially a Trojan horse right I mean that's really what it is that's what was so disturbing about it is the idea that the UN could get in and get involved and somehow or another punish social media websites that and make them responsible for what the users post live you post some inflammatory ridiculous shit and they let it burn any never but if you did if you went on a fucking late-night cocaine-fueled Twitter rampage and you typed a bunch of ridiculous shit about women with no with no like some women are there are so it all just women if you know I mean look there's actually interesting discussion around around this and it's that it's about comments sections and commenting what people are allowed to say on the internet right there's this huge trend at the moment and almost every progressive publication has either closed their comments section or indicated that they might hmm in the early days of the internet you had these tech-savvy progressives disproportionately based on the coastal city in coastal cities who said because the only people they knew who used the Internet were like them were hipsters and coastal types who said that the internet was going to this extraordinary an amazing new world where everyone could express their opinions and was going to trim or tie his knowledge and democratize power and the presumption they made was that everyone the internet was going to be nice well most people are very nice and most people are particularly aren't nice well I mean that is a compliment by the way because I hate nice people but you hate nice people God is boring I like people who are vicious and bitchy and mischievous are you so gay no I every time I do a show this it just comes back that it Gavin McInnes did not even wait Gavin McInnes did not even wait I was on his show for three minutes he's like give any idea how gay you are well that's Gavin style yeah I'm a kinder gentler you waited an hour and five minutes but what you just said was so gay okay people that officious and bitchin no interesting well there's plenty of assholes out there you're gonna have them tend to be nice so I'm sure you get on it they tend to be very I like people are a bit more dangerous okay I'm always attracted to people online people I like people who are more interest I like people to step outside the Overton Window I like people who push the boundaries I like people who are dissidents I like people who are disreputable and mischievous and interesting I met interesting people as I am right but you know I love people like that they fascinate me I think they're the people who pushed Society for they're the people who come up with great interesting systems that just can't sometimes there just can't be any - I for example I'm not gonna add to the sum total of human knowledge I'm just gonna wind a lot of people up for 30 years and hopefully you make interesting points let's get back to the point please the the the comment section stuff right they think that this was based on a presumption that everybody on the internet was going to be you know like a Twitter employee well bloggers yeah so they come up this ID knows great internet social media social is gonna be the new thing where the Guardians gonna throw its newsrooms open to the public from the assumption that you know in it you know that Guardian readers and people who live in North London which is something like Portland or Brooklyn Brooklyn or whatever ish sort of so North London it's like the hipster on no it's more actually sort of like posh rich liberals but it's not quite it's not directly comparable but you know sort of like roughly like that you know they're gonna be homogeneous nice polite lefties with the crimeans about things actually what's happened is it took longer it took longer than I anticipated but what's happened is that ordinary people now can open Twitter accounts to and I'm sufficiently technologically educated to do so and what all of these progressive media companies are discovering the mics the boxes the buzz feeds the caucus of this world are discovering that most people don't agree with them they are just they've never I know it's shocking but most people don't believe you should kill all men most people don't believe that white people that you know black people can't be racist don't believe everything on salon.com look so it's impossible to believe those things in good faith because you have to lie to make that you have to lie so much to yourself into others in order to make those arguments that I just it is one long practical joke it is just a gigantic I'm convinced it's funded by the Koch brothers to discredit liberalism I'm convinced real I'm absolutely convinced if you trace if you trace the cell on money back far enough you will discover you will discover the surname Koch because it is the only explanation for how badly sell on discredits progressivism is the only expansion just today they published another editorial from this fucking pedophile you know who I wrote about and he wouldn't even dare bring my name I was too scared to get into it with me because he knows he to lose I probably you know he published this thing about how you know I'm a pedophile I don't act on it right after I'd exposed a pedophile sarah nyberg in gamergate right and it went all over the world and it was this huge story i exposed this file i exposed this pedophile you know she was backed up and they doubled all the social justice warriors DoubleDown protected her she was you know on message basically shut about politics so they stubborn kitty fiddler this is the state of the modern left directly after that with coincidental timing salon publishes this thing by a pedophile saying oh I'm a pedophile but I don't act on it which is precisely the defense that yes used so I respond and I you know and Isis and I did a I did a very good piece in I urge all of your listeners to seek it out because it really is excellent journalism yeah it was called something like this is why the left this is why liberal this is why progressives stick up for pedophiles explains why Peter files can get away with this stuff and why why progressives and liberals back then you think people back pedophile today today they gave a space to this guy who is a pedophile about whom there is horrific stuff online which hasn't come out yet which you know you should watch this space for that cuz i know steven crowder knows about some of it and so do i excuse me you should this guy who wrote this did he give a second but yeah under his own name this is a Brazendale wrote a second piece for sale on today playing the victim saying that he came out as a pedophile and he's been subjected to right-wing hate so I think so I'm a pedophile and I don't act on it and I did this like piece and everyone like came out and said it was really supportive and it was really great and they'd help people to get through their own experiences and if one was really sympathetic except the right-wing hate machine meaning me where they didn't dare mention me by name who are the work right-wing hate machine well apparently according to him you know the right-wing hate machine had the temerity to say we think pedophilia is wrong and why is that I'm giving a platform with it to this guy when there's so much dirt on the internet suggesting that he is physically touched young girls for example you know I'm gonna Perez yeah there is that's a completely different argument well it's a long gay the platform design sound ought to have known about its allegation if you're going to if you're going to make space on your platform for a self-confessed pedophile mmm-hmm and you will you know you will only find this on the left is what I mean by the left sticking appeal if I was they make excuses and they try to legitimize them they try to give it they try to habilitated an unfortunate sexual orientation rather than you know these people being dangerous predators that we need to be protected from but instead of sin there but you say just discussing us but no son all bullshit aside yes psychologists and sociologists and neuroscientists have tried to figure out what it is that causes someone to have these designs but we know from the transgender debate the left doesn't care about that what it cares about is who it can you know who where it can place people in the oppression Olympics in the victim hierarchy and pitiful I'm telling a warning you know that is the worry what are you now I'm warning you now pedophiles are going to be the next transgenders been won now they want they've won that battle it's over do you think so yes absolutely Stalin dusted we lost by we I mean people who actually wanted to find out what the science said to continue to invest in things that are now unfunded or you know certain bits of research that don't agree the progressive consensus which you now can't get funding for that consensus is diet is what kind of research well so transgender the transgender question is complex and difficult and for example Johns Hopkins doesn't do the surgeries anymore the guy who's to run it there is very outspoken critic of transition surgeries is not the best treatment pathway they will end up killing themselves anyway there's by most most metrics no improvement in suicide rates my view on this is you know we're probably gonna look back in 30 years and wonder how we could ever have been so cruel as to allow somebody with a psychiatric delusion to start hacking it themselves to make reality conform to their own delusions but I'm not but by it but by we earlier what I meant was people who want to be science led on this and instead what the left very great was their well on the cover of Time magazine trans you know that the trans thing is the next civil rights frontier they very clearly articulated they gave us all the clues we needed to work out how they were going to fight this one right we just didn't pay any attention at the time or some people didn't they set it up as the next gay or the next bisexual or the next lesbian it's just the next frontier and the civil rights struggle I'm telling you pedophilia is that is the one after that but don't you think that if you are a person and you are of sound mind and body and you have a desire to be a woman and you've had this desire your whole life but you were born a man shouldn't you be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do there are people who wake up one day and think their arm doesn't belong to them we don't cut their arm off because they think it doesn't belong have someone draw on you permanently I think thank you very much I like it too leaves just leaves but you see my point like know why tattoos would be no choice it's a personal permanent review that you should be able to do whatever you want to your body arguably yeah fine but don't make the state pay for it I don't wanna pay for you want your cock off yeah because you're mentally ill I will try to dissuade you from doing it and I should have a right to say in a national newspaper which now you don't please don't do this well I think the argument you'll get published in Russian you say with this argument you cannot get published by saying please don't a piece of transition surgery it's the wrong treatment pathway you cannot get published because of public opinion because of people worried about the blowback from the LAV right and it's the dream laughs I mean if ever you needed evidence that the trannys are mentally ill its tranny campaigners I mean the transgender Lobby are nuts the reason journalists don't wanna write about this stuff or don't want to enter the dangerous territory is that what they are on the receiving end of afterwards is just I mean I've had it well I've had it to confrontation and you know you're right about that it's so unfair you know these women who are gonna make the crap beaten out of them by somebody who's not relevant it's only unfair if you don't say that you used to be a man the option to opt out and they shouldn't I mean what are we gonna do so any man who wants any man who wants to be a women's MMA fighter we're just going to basically give him a Gold Line pathway to the championship because nobody's no woman's gonna wanna get in a ring with him and have her jaw broken that's not okay I think the you know it's perfectly reasonable to say if you weren't put on a woman you don't get to fight in a women's competition I think that's perfectly reasonable yeah perfectly reasonable and objective this is the ideal scientifically valid to this but there's a science behind you and I both from the wrong side of popular opinion as well yeah but we're not yeah but the media the media and political establishment have made up their minds on this and it's it's gone it's god how did them right yeah this is interesting right gets this wrong sir it gets this wrong every day the reason I win I think there's no repercussions in supporting it that's why there's no repercussions in supporting well they're all transgender if we aught I mean look I'm saying to me why you say hey it's a woman get over it she should be able to fight men there's no repercussions but if you say you're out of your fucking mind yes yes no that's true and but that is entirely a construction of the left you know yeah this entire construction to latvia ground progress the aggressive progressive and yeah and these people who you just missed earlier is fringe nut cases they have entirely dictated what you were allowed to say on this subject [Music] after progressives have won a a society women shit after they won gay marriage they absolutely do you don't you don't think you don't think game reg is good cuz you don't want to get married you want to have an excuse well okay around town yeah I don't want gays to become so bourgeois we started be judging but a judge by other people standards but being born gay is not fun and if you have to be gay if you have to be anal look I'm having a wonderful time you know I love me I am a no stretch of the imagination self-loathing I'm very happy with who I am so how very well because it hasn't been an easy road okay this now would you rather be gay or be that fat lady from Kentucky that won't marry gay people Kim Davis yes fucked over way worse New York Kim Davis no she got the shittiest goddamn genetic roll the dice pop difficult difficult I wouldn't be Kim Davis that'd be Kim Kardashian mmm I doubt it none of you were born in her life and lived her life hey guys listen I wish I was stupid I could have been such a great like bimbo I'm gonna been so good you think so I would've been so good at it I don't think so intelligence has been a curse I don't think you're ruthless enough you think too much and it's also you like contemplating things and even though you make rash generalization changing thank you you know I think we see a lot of these things I think we have a lot of ideas in common a lot I think that I'm trying to stick up for men even though you agree with that's why some people rise to the top and most don't cuz not easy get your fucking shit order I am the biggest meritocratic you will ever meet let anybody fucking tell you you can't goddamn it we don't you don't need to have your hand held and changed and we need to make it safer for men we need a for men space we man in this country being ignored by women and we have to put a stop to that they're not attractive why they not attractive because women are smart they know these guys are pussies they don't want this pussy shooting a fucking diseased load inside of them and making some dumb fucking kid that they have to raise they don't want it so they reject these fools these fools are there because you can get the meat on a little Styrofoam plate and a fucking supermarket it's too easy to buy milk it's too easy to get your vegetables you don't have to do a goddamn thing it's easy that's why that's why these guys are pussies because the world is soft they're like lottery winners you ever met a lottery winner they never keep their money because it's too fucking easy they don't appreciate it and these guys that have gotten through this shitty dull gray life like me of course I don't like you you don't even like you become someone somebody would like you fuck the solution it's not change the laws or get on the top of a mountain with a torch we have to stop these women from ruining these men look at the men they're running away they're running away to be by themselves because the women won't have them anymore who will they don't even like themselves you gotta understand - I'm with you I'm with you on a lot of this okay don't stick up for pussies it's not good for them it's not good for anybody I want to have self-confidence I want to work out the way to do it hold their hand fucking let them cry in your expensive suit I think is that great line is it the lost world the second Jurassic Park movie it's like careful the suit cost more than your education I'm not a big fan of the military I'm not a big fan of like people I care about love joining the army going over and killing people overseas unless it's absolutely necessary of course but I'm a big fan of I think a lot of people would benefit from fucking boot camp I think with you and I might not be such a fucking pansy if I might had it the uncomfortable no I mean like you know if I'd been through boot camp am I not chosen to be gay what for that's probably been the number one spot I think more people are gay and boot camp than anywhere no I should go now fucking 30 guys together you don't think I was working my way through the cricket team especially when they're on a boat we like black guys that was the joke but cricket you get some Indian dudes right they're pretty good at cricket yeah no in the end is sorry huh too much curry no smells the look you're not allowed to say that knows you're not allowed to say that but you know it's not it's not a race thing it's not but there's a certain diet like in aa Bengali Bangladeshis they have a certain diet and it gives it's a very very particular oh and I can say this is somebody who's banged a lot of Asian guys yeah there's a very particular odor - like Bengalis de Bangladeshis it's very heavily spiced - fish that kinda stuff you think people as Asia that's interesting because yeah we call amazing we call the nation's decision but you know it's the same with I don't know whether it's a race thing my cleaner is ghanaian my maid is like a Ghanaian Muslim and I'm such a good Carlene Ian Ghanaian like ghanian Oh God from Ghana Ghana yeah I'm a really good person so I let her keep her Quran in my house and stuff even though it's a bit like kind of terrifying and she's praying and I'm like I'm totally paying for this no but why quite often do during Ramadan is like is i reheat last night's KFC just to torture her but no I you know shit but she you know she has a very pungent aroma yeah I'm sure I don't know are you even allowed to say that well you're not supposed to you really like saying men are different from women you're not really sposed to say anymore but no there is there is a certain I mean I quite like it and I like those guys I'm always asking if she's got hot sons and she will never tell me wonder what I could like here but there it is definitely I mean if she's if she's been in and she's been mopping and whatever you give she's loud and like two hours later and I come home I know she's been there wow that's bizarre a wolf I do really good I did really good sense of smell oh shit yeah that's weird for a gay guy why because I would think dudes smell like shit no stinky I would think that would be like they put foot perfume women quite like how men smell so you imagine men into men they quite like it oh okay that does yeah so some guys like Bo yes I'm going small bad I perspire quite a lot but I don't smell like I if I get I get sort of grotesque but there's I know women that like the way dudes stink when they get back from the gym no fucking stink they like dirty bitches dirty I'm only pregnant at 12 I would have had so many abortions by now Wow there was a University of Rome I believe did a study on homosexuality and they had a theory that the reason why people became gay was a variation on the X chromosome and so there was a disproportionate amount of homosexual men that were birth from women that were promiscuous so I was thinking how terrible women are I think some men just see see it really early and think that is so much crazy just to like just to come in something I have to deal with that no thank you I'm gonna go with boys that's so ridiculous coming you as a straight man you're talking nonsense when I'm the most part of great I went gay to get it my mother that's how it's revenge yeah I'm kind of a revenge from sexual like a war I'm a werewolf yeah you be like the former and your mother turned you right yeah no III went and because it wasn't sufficiently scandalous that I lost my virginity and interracial five some of the drag queen that's not oh no I know so I started worldly I started bringing thirteen drag queens into Richard Dreyfuss grass the first one yeah fucked for life I have until you get gone no bring home black eyes instead and that she was upset about she just was it a racial thing was just that she was just coming down and there was just these black guys like cocaine and pills out on the breakfast table its own area 14 yeah I think people would have a problem with that yeah how old were the black guys a couple years older not hugely older they went to that they went to the bad schools I mean though bad school that's baddies we didn't have a black people in my school do them blow and fucking their son I just got stuck in a rut and now it's kind of a bad habit but you know I wrote a column about this like I'm so bored of being gay and everybody took it as a joke but actually one of most serious things I've ever ever written I'm only really attracted to things that are transgressive that are naughty and I just spoke about it so like I like difficult people I'm only really sexually excited by things that are forbidden and now gay people are endlessly mollycoddled and flattered and sucked up to in society is kind of the sex has lost its luster for me I'm thinking that I might go heterosexual I think I might do something gonna take I think I might do something forbidden I might do something that you know is going to invite ridicule and criticism and is going to make given me a more difficult life I might become a straight white male with all due respect I think you'll find it very difficult to find suitors that are are worthy of your appearance with as if you're a woman you a dance back and forth through those worlds with little to no worries well women look backwards and forwards all the time watch a few cocks take some deck and get fucked by five guys one of them's a drag queen yeah they're just guys all the time in a friendly way no that's what you are understand some of them no be nice your friends I'm just waitin to let you fuck them I'm right trust make sure the hot ones being that friend they're gonna fuck a guy who never never had a doubt it's all rounder it's true so I'm gonna get really bad a bad quality of woman if I go straight stick with the black dude when we don't get animals or something no really flip the switch well I could be a tranny I think such a pretty girl yeah just in case you know I would and you know she and I would throw my toys out the public IOC or my pronouns are like mobile here you know anyone here here here my pronouns are fuck you motherfucker it's not amazing the new pronouns Harvard University is trying to get people to use these new pronouns I mean you're winning on this never transition just to antagonize people because I'd be like yes still got a dick we still vertical mushy that's the move right saying I'm a woman I'm gonna wait until I'm in trouble I'm gonna pull I'm gonna pull a Bradley Manning I'm gonna wait until I get in trouble and then to elicit sympathy from idiots I'm gonna go trans are you trying to say that that's what Bradley Manning did how dare you have never met that implication Chelsea Manning by the way I still call Bruce well of course you do he was 60 years has he had it I don't know no fuck - dude it's amazing some medium ends is that what they're saying now correct way to describe his his or her accomplishments as an athlete the technically correct way to do it is to use the new name and the the new pronoun but obviously she won the men's whatever I don't even know what's kind of sports music you know he's one of the guys he competed in the Olympics with believes that this whole transition to him becoming a woman had to do with taking steroids for the Olympics I think oh for sure that if you live in that family if you live in a car - Ian's family you know it is a war of attention-seeking and this is attention-seeking something I understand yeah you know and if they're constantly trying to one-up one-up each other and everyone thinks Kim's got the lead and everyone you know and everyone thinks oh good Kim and then Bruce comes out and says with a nuclear I got one for you drops the fucking atomic but the neutron bomb whatever your weapon of mass destruction analogy of choices and drops this bomb is like oh yeah Kim when I get Vanity Fair yeah nobody cared about him at all for the decade it was on the show it was like I really really need some tension I live in the car this is a Kardashian family I've gotta do something but I also think that he probably ideas with Khloe's fat how do you say Kim's a slut she's married with children sir I wasn't a judgment trust me I mean I identify with her I told you bury you you know Kim's a slut Chloe's flat okay Chloe's fat and Bruce is a woman you know it's like men they all have something right well he certainly does now I mean he may not have it anymore we're in with his face at the very least he turns his face into a woman's face I wanna make a serious point about this what I love about transgender debate is how damaging it is to feminism that's actually was my original point right this is where you were gonna go isn't it yeah there's there's something that feminists always say about transgender that particularly the the male to female transgender is why do they always choose such classically feminine you know looks why don't I become what we want which is the sort of genderless fat blue-haired armpit hell brigade like if you're gonna go trans what they want is for you to cut become genderqueer they want you to lose a sexual disaster of human being people who men who become women become women like very stereotypical women and this is interesting because this is this is a sort of physical manifestation of a psychological problem for feminism and it is this if you accept that people can be born with the wrong brain that a man could be born with a woman's brain or a woman could be born with a man's brain that goes a long way to destroying 40 years of gender politics and gender theory which says that all sexuality and all gender is socially constructed then that's why men behave like men do and women behave like women do if you accept and you put on the cover of Time magazine in your Vanity Fair a person who has had the wrong brain in the wrong body and when they transition they take on new characteristics new forms of behavior all the rest of it you are admitting that some of these qualities are innate our biological that there is such a thing as a male brain and a female brain this is something that feminists have been denying for decades yeah and it is incredibly damaging to the to the feminist project to the idea that everything is continued because when they want to break down the gaps between men and women they want to make girls play with action man and boys there are boys up as princesses what they're suggesting is that all gender is taught that it's a social construct that we teach boys how to be boys so we should teach boys to you know be nice instead of violent you know this toxic masks you know do you think well what transgenderism demonstrates quite clearly if we accept it as face value as progressives have asked us to is that there is indeed such a thing as a male brain and there is indeed such a thing as a female brain that being the case ordinary people have them too and that explains why for example there aren't as many women in STEM subjects it explains why men have certain behavioral characteristics you know and all of this stuff the feminists have been telling us is just society and patriarchy and conditioning mmm hang on a minute you can't hold these two beliefs simultaneously you cannot believe both of these things in tandem you have to pick one and this is you know the reason that some people on the quiet are quite enthusiastic they're on the political right enthusiastic about the transgender thing is they know it unravels the feminist project and travels to generations of crazy progressive feminism in one fell swoop because it demonstrates by their own admission what total bollocks the idea of constructed gender is well it certainly is fascinating when you watch people being celebrated for traditional feminine appearances absolutely traditional accepted feminine appearances dresses if they were to be that's the most adorable they don't have to be ugly like they are trans America the cover of the Vanity Fair they want her to be and they are ugly which is why they became feminists in the first place there are gauges why their left-wing it's my favorite feminists are the ones that will never accept trans and transgenders because yes this woman I told you about the concentration camp she's a tough I think she's accused of being a tough these people who say that transgender women are not women because they haven't had a woman's lived experience in fact all they're doing is acquiring the victimhood mantle by which they sort of admit the whole jig you know in the norms of this in order to be a turf you have to sort of admit that there's such a thing as female privilege what they're basically saying is the transgender person you can never acquire the full degree of female privilege because you can't claim you're oppressed victimhood status and get special dispensation you can't do any of those things because you're not a real women you no matter woman's experience we don't want you I love them I love them because they're just the most brilliant example of those dysfunctional fucked up left on left violence it's wonderful this house of cards of ludicrous theory that's totally internally inconsistent this is one of these one of those times in which it just implodes that's accelerating you're eating themselves at a staggering rate when I wrote about this I wrote about this in another great piece that you're what's it called its called minority Wars and my point in this was that in the lost if the last ten years have been about setting men against women and fine you think men should just man the fuck up and I know and you're entitled that for you I have I take him to a slightly more compassionate view of this stuff if you if you believe that last 10 years I think most people do the progressive project is to set women against men the next 10 years is going to be even worse the next 10 years is going to set sexuality against sexuality race against race gender against gender so you're gonna get Hispanics vs. blacks in America as Hispanic you know Hispanics for example that's interesting because Hispanics don't have the guilt about slavery that white people do so when Hispanics are running cities like Baltimore the policing is going to be brutal it is get you will never have seen anything like it well they don't have the same guilt they don't have the white guilt that allows black lives matter to flourish right the only reason black lives matter is a thing is because of white guilt Wow you really think that you don't think it's because of black people getting fed up that they see people getting shot for no reason but you can strapping tasers on their body you can something like people as indeed I do with my body and in many cases and nonetheless not think that black lives matter is the best thing for black people that's a culture of victimhood one dude that's not really black what's his name Shaun King yeah he still you know what Shaun King story is amazing it's amazing this guy and you know what he came back with with this blog post you know it's another wonderful story Brooke um he came out of this did you break that story - of course I heard that story how dare you Lashley you told me about that on Twitter that's how I found out yeah so anyway he comes back after all this reporting and says oh well the man that they're right about everything except the man on my birth certificate is not my real dad my mum had enough like throws his mom under the bus never asked about who my dad is I don't know anything about him I've never asked in 30 years who my dad is okay carry on the only thing I know about him for absolute sure I don't know his name I don't know who he is I don't know where he is but the only thing I definitely know about him is a blues back so she really didn't a black political well someone get a cup you know like they do in the movies where you should put something put him on Twitter three me yeah but there was a black political come action committee that said they give $25,000 to black lives matter if you submitted to a DNA test did a black political action committee said put this to rest will $5,000 blacklivesmatter and he wouldn't do it oh so we were the situation now I know well these things tell me all I need to know now we're in a situation which Shaun King has pronounced Shaun King innocent but you know I have to ask any more questions and you just got to take his word for it well sorry I don't he's the guy's wife he's still a big part of black lives matter I mean the thing I couldn't you be white and also think that black lives matter like the end of identity politics they don't want you right they don't want you you have no village speak on those issues just know right speak about feminism you know this is this is why it's so damaging to black lives matter the fact that you know all of their figureheads seem to end up either being lunatics or being white what is what's wrong with this movement that no authentically black people seem to be able to lead it like yes there's something wrong what about what's wrong dude I was prancing homosexual like he's just so odious and unbearable and I loved also I loved he's probably most unlikable person in America that I don't think he is I see give these interviews I think he's intelligent and well-spoken so nice about for everyone except the men they need you but DeRay McKesson is great god what's wrong with you you seem like a great guy I mean when I've heard him interviewed probably together with the Bombers with the only black person I'm not sexually attracted to Wow he you say this what I mean like I would but no I find him so what's wrong preening comedy homo you know prancing around in his ones is that wolf in a onesie it's just dreadful but he's a product of this terrible political stuff you gotta be black and gay and a rights protestor and another the black lives matter leaders is white and the NAACP chapter head and bought in Washington in Spokane in Washington is white and I think it's myself she resigned though what's wrong with this movement no she stood in place or she resigned from some things than all I think he's myself what's wrong with this movement that no black people seem able to lead it and the reason is that this framerate is fueled this is Soros thing you know it's fueled by white guilt and a progressive liberal establishment which is incredibly not exist without he's really black gonna be ridiculous now I don't even know what I mean by that I guess I just don't like the idea that black people can be homosexual I like I'm sort of talking them out of the heterosexuality I think it's all about my sort of my dark rape fetish I don't like the idea of black people as homosexuals it just feels wrong to me you got some fucking issues no I just have preferences I just you know I don't know shoes that's what is if you're involved in potential relationships these be sexualized personas and which ones not to this is a man you don't even know he's an activist and you like I just prefer him to not be gay I have a real problem with him being gay I have preferences problem with him being gay I just do not like gay people no fucking tutus and Madonna like okay look two moves I have my moments with you know my moments my carry but but no the way they behave the music they listen to how they dress how they speak and worst of all which really fucking annoys me drives me absolutely crazy the way in which gay people have now become such bullies they're using all the tools against other people at Christians the bakeries all that kind of shit that used to be used against them gay people have become the worst kind of sanctimonious bullies and it makes me ashamed to be homosexual when I see the way that they bully my other minorities the way they bully religious minorities and I think 50 years ago this was gays when I see the way the gay people aid when I see that couple that gay couple who went to minimums peace of memories piece of you'll remember was that was the Christian Baker who said you know all probably wouldn't would rather not k2 if that's okay because some some idiot you know troublemaker on the left had gone gone basically gone outraged shopping called up everybody in Indiana and said will you cater will you Katie will you cater finally found somebody who said I prefer not to anyway is that these these go an outrageous gays yes in question admitted they well I think the router of going to nobody went there and got turned down and humiliated by evil Christians a liberal reporter went around shopping for someone who said no they wouldn't and it took them days to anyway just like sweet hurdling rolling stays she went ring shopping RIT Sabrina only admitted that she went round looking for the most sensational rape story possible and of course it turned out to be bullshit but I did not know but hold on don't mean to interrupt you but I did not know that that was not an actual story I thought it was a real gay couple you know real gay couples are doing today well this is just it just makes oh no no they're not becoming bored rather getting a car and a kid and a pet and then no they're not having my neighbors no they're not I hate those kind of gays the most of all you should be toppling out of a nightclub or you driver get the kid to school by 800 no I've got to get back I got bridge club at 10 just died well he teaches spin class CrossFit SoulCycle what kind of a self-respecting gay person does soul/psyche is that bad for you Oh sex and drugs listen like any other gay person crystal meth and twelve-hour fuck sessions huh how they stayed fit in the 80s it is fantastic you know I'd love if it I kind of do want it because it yeah because it's not a death sentence anymore you can't no you all the great drugs but if you do they taking the drugs you get thin you lose all your body fat he has so much attention you fire all the presents from title way more stuff you know I was you talking so fast I don't buy the fact that you're tired all the time you it's hard to get a word in edgewise you're on fire I don't buy a time anyway exhausted some sores all over your face you don't want that it's not maybe just the early stages but you know like the first the first six months in the bowl or the first six months of a fantastic lose all your body fade just shit all the way out have balls sores all your body first first stage first away anyway gay couple this week I mean I promise I'm going to but gay couple this week decide to renew their map renew their wedding vows right and they go to memories pizza and they pick up pizza and they stop parading around on stage how they got memories pizza they were doing those nasty Christians who don't know cater gays and I thought to myself and then they the native sent these pictures to the press and I thought so what a nasty vindictive bitter soulless way to treat your own wedding or your vow renewal or whatever turn it into this triumphalist bitter public political stunt and I thought it was so cheap and so classless and it represented everything that's wrong with the gay establishment today and it was just I just saw that I thought god I hope people don't think that about me when they know I'm gay you know there's these preening bitter spiteful nasty queers and I thought to myself in my head you fucking idiots like you were doing so much damage to the public view of homosexuality you know making people think that you this spiteful bitter behavior is how we all behave when we get a taste of power because of course how we judge people you know we judged one of the ways we judge people is how they behave when they're in power and now gays are the establishment you know quite right gays away power yes look at the disproportionate important you know disproportionate numbers of homosexuals in here in employment in the media or whatever they're constantly fated and mollycoddled and and celebrated and all of that's good like equality is great and you know all that's all that's important but it's really telling how they behave when they get to that position scene average in this one couple that you're talking about the same thing happened to that they know that was it like three or four bakeries and pizzerias in the u.s. now the same things happening in Ireland in in England in you know all over the place gays are becoming bullies and I don't like seeing it I think what's happening it's you you get a bunch of people who are unhappy that know that they can have an impact by doing a something and they know they have a green light obviously I'm doing something I wouldn't behave like this but what I don't do a something then a something is we can throw tests in this fashion and we will get a pop but they've been given carte blanche to go off to religious minorities because the the media establishment and politicians all the rest of it continually give the signals are you on Kim Davis's size that we've had she can't do the job right she can't do the job so she probably shouldn't be in her post because she can't perform the functions of her job beliefs if she refuses to issue those licenses and that is the law right she can't be in her job but you know what's interesting she's these days example of a conscientious objector she's an example of somebody sticking up for their beliefs or their political opinions or their life or their life choices or their faith or whatever in the face of the law in the face of public opinion and the face of you know received wisdom the consensus all the rest of it she is doing what gay rights campaigners we're doing 50 years ago and I think it's very telling well now gay people are mollycoddled and protected and you know if I've been a beneficiary of that I've seen in action the way that now they can turn around and bully religious minorities solely to feel better about themselves in this horrible bitter way that they do and lesbians are the worst by the way the way they can now do that to people who have faith to religious people makes me slightly feel slightly ill and I'm really I really object to it let's slow down you're saying that she is doing what what gay activists were 50 years ago which is make brief stands that get them in prison to go against the law go against you know gay activists were never in a position to alter other people's lives or deny them of a public service that's on the books see the problem is but you can't compare her to any form of an activist you can how could you possibly do that she's affecting other people's life I'd have nothing do we that she shouldn't be in her job because she can't do her job why all the entire time being guilty of several sins one of them the fact that she's being a Democrat anymore the primary sin switched I was surprised after she saw what happened is to have a Democrats treat their own wells he came and approached her of course the new car could be flew in a Primus chair of course the New York Times accidentally published that she was a Republican of course what a terrible mr. Democrat you mean no no they published that she was a Republican national she was a premature times just assumed without checking so they printed in the newspaper that she was a Republican because of course the New York Times did and then oh sorry we made a mistake about that and of course no one ever sees the correction so now everyone's now what fuck it always does when someone does something creepy they put D next to their name I think the comparison is pretty ridiculous to say that she's doing what gay activists were doing in the 1950s that ridiculous but from my point of view as somebody who is both religious and homosexual your religious yeah well I mean I so my matrilineal e speaking I'm Jewish but I was raised Catholic and it does that mean any practicing in the middle of ketamine older men in dresses what's not to love father Michael I wouldn't have made nearly as much money in my 20s see to get such good head you know I give such good blowjobs after after three years in choir no I mean um so you're not religious no no I believe I don't necessarily go to Mass all the time but you believe I'm not a good Catholic but but when you say you believe like you believe in what the Bible I believe in Catholicism I'm a Catholic I think so you believe that it's a good idea to have confession and you have a dude never has sex ever listen the fuck story's whispered through a hole in the wall don't cut baby dicks you know for this for a confession epic eternal rest like a wizard sitting there golden throne father no monsters you know Wolowitz Catherine why the way this well do you know what this world could do with a bit more pomp and circumstance a little bit more drama and a man who supports the fucking matriarchy you know walk this walk it could do with a little bit more of that I mean just look at that look at the dreary hell of you know the Atheist art scene look at you know look at this is Sumpter a deist arts like contribution to human searching the Atheist arts but I mean like you know I meet what I mean is you know you look at the atheists are seen almost all the good movies ever made look at almost all the great albums ever made look at almost all the civilization and knowledge in the way that art Maya Angelou did meters okay yesterday awful boring religion to be a good person thank you especially need rich especially any religion to be good answers well you need to pick and choose what you do that you decide is religious in isn't same as Kim Davis lady deciding that the sins of these men were more important than their own sins or the or you whether you wanna do ketamine and [Laughter] you know you're not you're looking at King James on you you know if you lie with with interracial cross-dressing orgies you know it's right there it's yeah but that's the thing though isn't it like if you if you say you're Christian and you want to be honest you've got to kind of say it you can respond to be better than you all aspire to be better than yard doesn't mean you believe in Jewish zombies well of course you know this one's ridiculous this was ridiculous you're talking about shit written on animal skins by people who thought the world was flat and the Sun was 17 miles away oh yeah that's gonna make you a better person it's totally yeah they found it in clay pots in Qumran yeah they unscrew they do DNA tests to find out which piece of fucking yeah Cass done I feel sorry for people who have a sort of bleak empty existence nonsense a lack of belief in nonsense is not bleak you believe plenty of nonsense like what name one thing silly you got a silly view on circumcision as we've discovered baby cutting my god free agree for a hell of a fucking drama queen baby dick can you tell me what it is I'm gonna give you just look you win come on you want to brought up the baby dick cutting if aliens just come from another planet and saw us cut all the baby dicks they'd be like what the fuck are you guys doing it's just it's just good grooming hmm obviously we disagree what other ridiculous shit do I believe that's akin to Jewish zombies towards say Winans or fair I don't think you know what there's nothing more depressing than seeing somebody who you admire who's obviously smart and clever who all fairy tales just speak so disparagingly about such a complex and fascinating part of who we are you're right look even if you even if you take the view let's say live in my back right even if you take the boy back in view you know and say I don't believe in what any of these religions say okay but if we look at what they have in common and what that says about the human spirit what we aspire to what we consider most important so for example Christianity we might consider self sacrifice and love the most important things because though you know self sacrifice and love are the two central instincts that run the red threads that run through the Christian canon literature run through Christian history that was the say is this okay I don't believe in this stuff but this is a essential human human artifacts of human cultural history because it teaches us more about ourselves than anything else right it teaches us over the century of centuries as evolved to teachers what we find most important and different religions in different places are fascinating because they illustrate the different emphases on those core values of love and charity in sub-sahara that different societies place on things now I'm not asking you to believe that that when you take Holy Communion you were ingesting the you know the body and blood of Christ it's not going to God but what I am suggesting is you shouldn't be such a dismissive asshole about you know such an integral rich beautiful and crucial part of human history that teaches us so much about who we are okay coming back from the dead healing people turning wine know what I'm saying is even if you only believe their stories these are the most important stories that was the Western tradition stories that have ever been told folklore even if you believe that they say something deep and profound about who we are and about what we care about most about our anxieties about our beliefs and about our you know our sympathies the way we relate to one another the way I'm presenting one reason why you should be less flippant and dismissive about religion because you are too smart to be that much of a far too smart you are far too intelligent adorable to treat religion with the amount of contempt you do this is more assholes - this is not a mediocre intelligence juice feminists of doing you're distorting the argument the reality is we're talking about myths and we're talking about penalize those myths so much that they won't let people get married because it goes against their myth I'm saying right I can disagree with them that would happen you can disagree with you can just with bullet right then where's the love and compassion from Emma Davis you can disagree with everything that they teach you can say that it's nonsense you can agree that it you can if you want to agree that it has bad consequences in society you shouldn't do is ridicule and dismiss you know sort of the the you know Jewish zombie shit right you're just doing it to be outrageous you're just you know that's what rageous nursin provocation right and I'm not trying to put you on trial here what I'm saying is you're too smart to fall into this habit and it's a leftist thing this militant atheism crap where you dismiss the central importance of religion to our culture what is the central importance barbaric days with rules when we were worried about the basis of God's punishing most of our laws are based on religious prescription when you get down to it based on what's ultimately religious prescription my point is simply and only that if you're going to be a flippant asshole at least acknowledge that first of all half the population you know does take this stuff seriously and second of all this is important to staff that tells us about who we are and I think it's beneath you to be is not is the horton star elephant and cruel and vindictive and spiteful and horrible about crazy feminists because they're crazy and because what they do is ridiculous I don't think whether or not you're an atheist that religion is ridiculous and I think it deserves a bit more respect well that's fine you're allowed to think it but just because you think it doesn't mean it's right and the idea that it makes you a flip an asshole because you're unwilling to accept myths you're unwilling to accept things that make no sense whatsoever you on you're unwilling to accept things that are scientifically all notice you're not acknowledging the extent to which religion has made you who you are I mean you know from the speedy rejection codes that you grow up with your oh you know you know yes if you know what got us to here you'll see for your stead for your cell is your sense of right and wrong engine which was created by people since of our own homes shit comes from days come not judeo-christian and shit and it's interesting right boys not come from that it's not very angry it's not your sense of right and wrong comes from Judas you gotta stop saying because it's not true it's quite true it's cultural so you know right and wrong in other cultures that's completely different from what we consider right and wrong in America look at New Guinea do you know what about the sperm warriors in New Guinea these men that take these young boys when they're young and inseminate them put calming their mouths and their asses to make them grow they do that from the time they have like no great it's there it's what's right and what's wrong for them things that would be absolutely illegal would lock you up in jail for in America and in Europe in New Guinea this is like a great long tradition of this judeo-christians okay it's cultural you just you grew up in two places Christianity you're a good person this place where there's no Christianity they come in boys mouths there's one place that has a fucked up way of looking at things it's a cultural thing everywhere that doesn't have a strong Christian heritage as a fucked up place with bad vibe with bad morals that's a ridiculous statement that's a ridiculous statement everywhere that doesn't have Geo judeo-christian there's a fucked up place I think that yes I think I think issue should be perfectly reasonable respectful thing to say our culture is better I believe our culture is European and American culture which is based on judeo-christian values is better than other cultures I think it's uncontroversial to say so but what's what based on judeo-christian values about being a good person from the Bible what it does what comes from the Bible ultimately our sense of right and wrong comes to the Bible our sense of writing and I think I think you'll see there's the only way that a person could have ethics and morals and treat each other nobody can say the only what you think I understand what listen we're gonna have a commerce we can't keep talking over each other like this when someone is trying to make a point about something if you're if you think that the only way for a person to have ethics or an understanding of each other or compassion for each other is to rely on ancient myths that are easily scientifically disproven well that's what Christianity is no I didn't say that I said specifically said this is the specific set of values that you have is influenced more than you would like to admit by your judeo-christian whatsit it's influenced by there are certain things that I think all of us have I mean I think that some some of what we would call morality obviously comes from natural revulsion which is more like biological right then this is this is some of the prescriptions against perhaps against murder perhaps against child abuse that kind of stuff right comes from instead of natural revulsion and it may be an evolutionary biological imperative there are certain things that we just know we shouldn't do right and that's our body saying no like you know like rotten the smell of rotten food you know or stuff like that yeah but there are other things that that definitely come from from the judeo-christian tradition as defined most of what we consider to be right and wrong in the West and I think our society is the better for it and I think that our society is better than elsewhere in the world yourself and your lifestyle is proof positive that that's the evolution of what this used to be is nearly speaking I'm an outlier because I mean as you all know gay people generally test higher for IQ and rest of the population and lots of evolutionary biologists and will suggests that gay people with high IQs tend to engage in dissident or unusual habits and practices in general because that's where where mother nature does her experimentation is where she you know tests the limits of of the species so people with very high IQ are more likely to be homosexual goes the evolutionary biology argument because it's in those very smart people that the sort of the the transgression and transgressive dissident stuff is tried out by mother nature so I would say I'm probably outlier there is a very small homosexual you know I'm not typical of sort of means of the kind of bulk of the species right but what you are I mean I take it you are but but who you are being against I do we that is this is prohibited in the Bible yes but I agree that it would be better if I didn't behave like this and if I could you need to read a wonderful essay paper no I don't need to read shit I don't know what the fuck you're saying okay so what you're saying is who you are is in the my law because I didn't think my sexuality is important it's a part of you you talk about it all the time it's a massive part of what we've talked about on this show I think it comes up any time you want to make a funny point it comes up any time your sexuality or your urges or decadence because I think it's you well I think people leap to the most the most different thing about themselves the most unusual thing about themselves any time they want to be funny or be you know it's black why black comedians talk about being black a lot Chris Rock always talks about you know blacks and the n-word it's why you know Muslim comedians only ever talk about Islam it's you know gay comedians talk about being gay I think that's you go to that because it's the funny thing about you it's and it's a sort of sort of a form of laziness I suppose so I don't know that's particularly relevant but oh wait listen it's absolutely relevant Muslim cultures yes no in ours it's anything we certainly Muslim Walter does that now it was eleven well they're the last ones that continue the grand old tradition of killing gay people but that shit's been around forever I mean what does it say in the Bible about my man lying with another man I think if I could I mean if I could if I if I could choose I wouldn't be homosexual really that does make me self-loathing so if someone came out it makes you self-loathing to hate a part of what you are hate apart for I'm I love all of me but if I could choose to be even better than I would be so you'd be better if you were straight yes Wow any would be an anti gay pill yeah you would take it well it would be career suicide but I probably would you would it be career suicide you don't think that you could transition into the straight world you would be the poster boy for Christian Right they would love you you know if I were to pray the gay away I'd be so popular you would be super popular what's holding you back is the gay you're right maybe that's you're intelligent you're good-looking well-dressed it's true it's true you're right okay I'm gonna roll in one of these camps again I'm gonna I'm gonna get a manager don't work there just excuse for duty to get together help each other like Michele Bachmann's husband that guy's the greatest how about that guy you say that Bohol though we'll bring that back but how about the guy that got arrested Hillary those fucking people at that that Community Center oh the case no he's a KKK guy that got arrested with black prostitutes oh yeah of course yes of course my favorite whore see I love it love whenever for the grace of God going to my favorite guys people who get caught with black prostitutes I mean literally could could be me on any first day well the racist murderers they get caught with black well those are adorable long as you don't have to have direct contact with anybody the affected it's an adorable story no obviously I don't here's a guy look at him and you just know that he had like these big black girls whipping him and like raping him with a you know with a dildo or sub men we're doing male prostitutes a black male prostitute Oh mandingo thing Denis mm-hmm there's a lot going on there I just can't believe that you would you would I don't know side to not be gay if you could and is that because of Christian values no no no so what is it I I don't think it's self-loathing to acknowledge that being homosexual was obviously a sort of aberrant sexuality it's something that mother nature does on the fringes so nobody really knows why and it could be you know elegant variation in the evolutionary process it could be all sorts of things something like that from a Christian perspective it could be a test from the evolutionary perspective actually some christians believe that you get these things in life as tests and they don't judge the sinner they judge the sin what they mean by that is you can be gay but if you act on it that's when you become soon oh so they don't stay don't blame you for you are they blame me for they they every bullshit you're gay as fuck okay dude you are as a fuck okay there's not a goddamn choice in the world for you other than being gay well you're the perfect example of this shit the shipping nonsense that it's a choice that somehow another you're presented because I'm actually born this way is an invention the gay lobby there is a broad spectrum there is I'm gonna be very specific because I know you like specificity thank time there is no basis in science for the born this way argument there's no basis in science that you are simply born gay and that's all there is to it what the science suggests is that it is very much nature and nurture and it can it's as much as 50/50 nature and nurture right the gay lobby in the 1980's the gay lobby in the 1980s was worried because religious people were saying it gay that the gay lifestyle lifestyle was a sinful choice right so they came up with this thing in the gay gene and it is an invention of the gay lobby designed to get around religious bigots it's designed to to wrong-foot to the religious right and suggest that people's sexuality has no there's no element of choice in people's sexuality born this way here in Lady Gaga's song and we take it as get as granted as you obviously had no idea that songs until you just said that Lady Gaga's Born This Way never her one of her biggest hits indeed one of her biggest hits is based on an invention the gay lobby with no basis in science well the science says is it's a mixture so it simply isn't true to say that you know you're just born gay and that's all there is to it for most people it is a mixture of early environmental factors and natural predisposition that's the most we can say that's the move that with any confidence and with any surety that's the most that we can say from the available science born this way is a marketing gimmick it doesn't mean anything okay but when you say that you you're talking about again a broad spectrum of human sexuality so some people are going to be more much more nurture yes some people it's going to be much or nature some people born gay there's a fucking kid that lives down my street he's five years old in these gays fuck okay might like Action Man but he doesn't necessarily it's not necessary gonna be gay and I have a problem with you ascribing sexuality to a five-year-old boy because that's exactly what the transgender parents do that's exactly the transgender parents say my five-year-old was really supposed to be a girl you're doing exactly the same thing you're saying he's five years old he hasn't even hit puberty yet he has no idea who he is good no idea what he's gonna believe no idea who he's gonna want to fuck when he's older he's nowhere near puberty and you're saying this kid is gay you're doing exactly the same thing as these Canadian parents who say that my five-year-old girl should be a boy please give them hormones you do exactly the same certainly not I'm certainly not anybody hormones and I don't want to influence this guy's life in any way I will come back to ten years I'll come back on this show by the way you get him why you know why cuz mom calls him gay well his mom is wrong and his mom is not correct she's random every day she wipes his ass she's put up there yeah black dicks she doesn't say in a bad way like she just said she's just pretty sure he's gay you know what actually think he's seven now I don't particularly like that line of argument describing sexuality people who have anybody puberty yet seems a bit much but don't you think that with a lot of people they are gay I mean that is just what they're so with you some people with no no I'm definitely made a choice I'm well aware of the fact that there is an element of deliberation in my sexuality and that's one of the things that annoys me about the establishment gay left when they insist born this way is on placards and banners the tax base some but a minority a minority of people have no choice over their sexuality out of the tote out of the total number of gay people in minority have no choice whatsoever see yeah everybody else there is a varying amount of choice I am aware that there's a degree of deliberation of my sexual orientation yet I am forced through my taxes to pay for Gay Pride banners that say born this way it's just something that I in women you are yeah I mean the way that gay pride stuff is is financed by the taxpayer in England rights given given money by the government my taxes go to gay pride people who tell lies in the street stuff that I know isn't true they do it basically to get people and they do it in the same bitter nasty way they paid for a sign of just said it's okay to be gay would you be cool though they do that too and I'm fine with that yeah and if it said born this way in an asterisk some small paternity or dreary some people are gay , and then you'd have like a paragraph of text you know you wouldn't you got to see it from very far away but you're your version of this give this born this way sign would be like this you see the problem now you see the problem now but do is simply telling people lies boys way is a lie and because there's you know a true story with some of them nobody that's holding the signs because most of the ones holding the signs the militant homosexual the ones that chose to be gay to get it people no J's do you have like debates with gay people most guys won't debate me because they know they'll lose well I've got woman brains they don't forget logic woman brains you accuse me trolling earlier so I certainly do and you're also very aware that you your right-wing views and the right-wing kind of kind of a little bit of a right-wing band to you you talk about conservatives and they wear a suit and tie this this right like a good way to align yourself in the club is you have to espouse Christian values or talk about being Christian I don't give us stuff about what the conservative establishment thinks of me if I did my career would have turned out very differently I've you know I I would have chosen a very different path through my professional life you know I was at the Telegraph you know that the most respectable establishment newspaper in England eight years ago if I'd want it to be you know a scion of the of the conservative Republican establishment I could have done that I did the exact opposite I've stuck my nose up and my middle finger up that they can act conservatives every available opportunity i bright poor poor Breitbart who put up with so much from me you know they published black dick jokes every week from me and that is a direct assault on the kind of stomach churn that the conservative right is always said to have about gay things right I don't just tell them I'm gay I tell them I'm sucking black dick also puts them in a very interesting place where they can say look we have a gay guy working for us I don't think right but gives us stuff about whether people think that homophobic or not they certainly wouldn't hire mothers do does trust me trust me okay right but doesn't care doesn't care they're not but they don't care if you do right they all date what they care about is the facts of what they published in with a publisher strange is someone who believes but doesn't practice you believe in religion but you don't practice any of the things that religious especially the do you practice except for the gay stuff when that's true that's in the book though God is gonna god it's gonna look after me you know I got a first-class ticket to heaven mmm well you know the Moses of Jerusalem scholars now believe that Moses was high on drugs you know that right I'm sure you've read that we catch another thing we have in common that Moses and he was on different drugs right he was or something back then it was acacia I didn't I just the idea that the burning bush was a bush that was a high and concentrated very very powerful psychedelic well is this as Steve Jobs says these visions of divine inspiration on LSD which is enabled to him LSD is very different than dimethyltryptamine no dimethyltryptamine is a visionary hallucinogen extremely powerful one that's the blit ayahuasca that's the active in but ayahuasca yeah yeah idea is that that's what Moses was doing that that's why the burning bush the literal translation of what that it was thought it was just empty he's getting a DMT trip and that's why God is giving him these ideas about how people should behave and be you know and the what is divine you know just to be kind to each other I suppose it does sound like the product of somebody on a nice trip these are mainstream scholars they're really nice to everyone just like steel I carved it out I mean high on drugs to go down any idea that they didn't really have any other options result of a drug that is what some mainstream scholars believe this day I have I think I think I'm right in saying that I sort of have semi read that somewhere I'm sure you have well you know John Marco Allegro the guy who was one of the head scholars that was deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls after 14 years of study he was a ordained minister but he was also agnostic because he starts studying religion and realized it was all bullshit but he wrote a book called the the sacred mushroom and the cross that he believes that the entire origins of Christianity was based around fertility rituals and the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms fast is a fascinating book obviously bollocks but it does have some bollocks at all I mean he's he was a well renowned religious scholar it does it doesn't know a guy who understood language he actually traced back the word Christ to an ancient Sumerian word that meant a mushroom covered in God's semen I mean these psychedelic mushrooms that grew out of nowhere they thought that when it rained it was God coming on the earth and that these mushrooms that would come up and then they would eat them and have these great trips they thought they were experiencing God I mean you can you can you can generate quite a few extraordinary theories with etymology because so many words sound like so many other words so it sounds like an interesting thought experiment and a nice social studies paper but I'm not sure quite bias well you never looked into it but if you do look into it you got it you gotta assumed that will look into I'll write about it fascinating spectacular psychedelic experiences would be interpreted by the people who had no science no books no no knowledge of what's going on with these material chemistry as being something that was divine absolutely yeah I mean I think things about life in general that would be considered miraculous I mean the Sun rising child birth sure lots of things all those things attributed to the gods and when these people were on these incredibly powerful psychedelic drugs they would try to hide this knowledge from the Romans and so they hid these stories in parables it's really fascinating and by the way very controversial thing because religious scholars you don't say well it's this is why one of the reasons was he was the only one who was an agnostic who was on the Dead Sea Scrolls deciphering committee I said all the other ones were really he was an ordained minister but he wasn't practicing all the rest of them were very religious and so the interpretations that they were willing to accept were not well he was willing to accept so you would have to get someone of that level of understanding of the language to debate him on this and he's dead but the Catholic Church bought out the book you could buy it now but it's like well now it got republished a few years ago by this guy named jaan Irvin and you so you can get a hold of it now but for the longest time you have to buy it as a used book yeah there's one also the Dead Sea Scrolls the Christian myth he wrote a second one after the Catholic Church bought out the first one stopped a production of it and bought out all the books yes your people Catholics trying to hide that information regret appeal the last thing they want I went to Catholic school man for a whole year cured me fix me up good that's where you get your fine sense of right and wrong from no wait let's not do that well with right and wrong as far as what what is wrong you know I got lucky they beat me over father Michael I would have given far less good head I mean I'm right there was a real father Michael he's gonna get killed now but who is father Michael there's a real dude I should make you suck his dick for him um make me enthusiastic about it I thought my English teacher - how old is he at the time it's quite young quite hot really yeah and so that's where it all started father Michael no no is that post the tranny yes post so it wasn't like I was dragging means a child so it was quite a you already had the five some and you're like this is all wrong I need to talk to father Michael he's like suck my dick I really I really had no hosted I I was I was never gonna end well well it seems like you kept stumbling in at decks through life I don't know what would have happened if a heterosexual man like me thirty years I've just been falling on dicks was in the same circumstance I'm not sure go down well I mean or a drink to be transgressive tear myself away come on maybe as you get older maybe dries up I think I would have made a good priest you think I make a good priest I think well you make a good priest if you think the guy that made you suck his dick was a good priest that kind of great priest honestly like he was a good on that I've never had a better singing tutor he was great singing - you've got notes out of me I didn't even know I could produce haha well he worked your plumbing shattering the chandeliers kind of but was he good outside of what he did like was he a good religious scholar was he a good here's a parish priest I mean I just fucking creep getting his dick sucked then it's gonna how's he gonna get lynched does people do people know who he is I didn't think so what's his name how won't be at the time you're a little kid he was 22 30s yet another yet another feminist strategy that you have adopted in addition to your language buddy scenes oh is it my teen 14 I was in my teens something like that I don't know how the rocket and very old England I was in my teen so I'm here in my country have you seen never seen a 15 year old girl at any point in your life however old you were you've never seen a 15 you thought yeah when I was 15 no you did but I didn't want a fucker bullshit you can't tell me what I was born into I think if you're 14 like this you're born this way you know you're trying to make it a fucking creeper like you know it's a 14 year old a great guy he was in a 14 year old stick yeah it's a terrible person no sure I was a very mature 14 year old yeah well in your case he got it right you got the right guy to molestation is perfectly consensual I don't think it is when they're 14 when I was 14 trust me I was the predator I was the predator I was aggressively seeking out sexual company of adults because I knew it would horrify people because I wanted sort of power over them it was my way of rebelling my way of rebelling I was I was the predator of 14 let me tell you do you think that's what's going on with that guy who directed x-men bunch of Ryan singer yeah a bunch of fourteen-year-old predators yeah after that poor man I I'm not sure the case with him that's a guy lived in Hollywood a while ago briefly and he's at one of his parties I went to other people who I won't name of a similar stature in Hollywood I went to their boat parties into their house parties and things and some of the things I have seen a beggars belief yeah can you give us like well just I can't I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people right around the facts yeah dangerous but I can tell you the truth without dropping anyone in it okay and some of the boys they were very young very young don't remember no I don't know her I don't remember whether I ever met Bryan Singer or even knew who he was then but I knew other people of similar stature as I say and there were some very young boys around at that time there was a lot of drugs and a lot of twinks a lot of twinks taking drugs and having unsafe sex with older men and some of these boys were very young Dubrow for a job you know when Andy Cohen the guy who runs Bravo how to apologize for the use of the word twink I thought that was for twink I thought that was one of the most adorable things gay yes games fuck and he approaches things because walk because it was demeaning like somebody's he starts someone was like a perfect twink and you made like a social media comment nothing nothing's wrong with that now this is the thing you see the progressives are starting to police homosexuals language you know I thought theory right I'm able Eve that pedophilia is the next progressive rehabilitation drive but I also think that straight sorry that homosexual white guys are going to be put back into the establishment bucket very soon if you look at some of the whining editorials coming out like The Daily Beast this female female columnist and The Daily Beast who will who will publish things about so you and your Grindr profile this app that you use to pick up guys nearby which is best just to see if torsos and you just pick who you want to get the fuck by Jesus what a plan that my phone and I don't use it for that reason I don't need to but on them on that app some people say whites only some people say only Hispanics people just express their sexual preference everybody has sexual propriety reasonable but of course you know this the some progressive columnist is finally like five years later has cottoned on to this and decided to make a thing about it automatic that gay people express racial preferences in dating of course it isn't the OkCupid data actually shows us which racism which genders you know come out on top and come out the bottoms like Asian women do very well black when rather badly you know in the sort of league tables of hotness anyway so the song to police the language now and this police the sexuality of homosexuals I mean there was me thinking we were sliding dangerously close to tolerance and understanding and now progressives are starting to police the sexuality of homosexuals again very don't you think there's a game of gotcha though it's a key mascot so this they don't really they're not really upset that it's looking for something to complain about yes but the problem with the the problem the outraged culture I mean I've always said that any pop rage culture is what it is right and the problem without right the only way to approach outraged culture which is what I do is to be outrageous rights a ridiculous and outrageous things simply to draw attention to the people get upset about it yeah I think it's a very important project and it's what I do in a lot of my columns it's what I do on Twitter I've done a little bit today and I think it's very important to wait a minute you've done a little bit of it today well I've been about rageous having said I'm gonna believe but I've been outrageous outrageous have been outrageous something a little bit outrageous just a little bit I've toned myself down for you because I know what thank you for sexual appreciated so much Retin me know my idea I've toned myself down for you today okay but no I buy a very very firm believer that the only appropriate response to outraged culture is to be outrageous but the problem with outraged culture is that because these people are all basically quite thick they tend to move in herds and so outraged culture can have trends you know mm-hm and so people can sort of cotton onto a particular idea and certainly everybody is outraged about the same thing and I see ahead of us sort of policing of the culture of heterosexual gay men Oh sexually sorry sorry sorry sort of white gay men on the basis that they have almost like the ultimate male privilege you know they're not they are smarter and richer and better looking and sassier and all the things that feminists hate because famous to none of those things was feminists are disproportionately poor and ugly and unlovable and oh man they disproportionately poor yes yes because well because liberals put their poor ugly miserable broken people are much more like to become liberal well separate centers that don't have their natural hair color oh close to hundreds you know I've got I went to the salon today and I said I'm going on on this show I think it'd be really funny if he gave me like blue hair because we can make a joke out of it and he just looked at me and went no you're too handsome no I thought it was nice that give me a little spring in my step no I'm not doing that to you you're too good-looking adorable I know I know I know I tipped huge which I guess was good for you I guess it was a point yes he was he was gunning for he also gave me my first you'll appreciate this it was a real man he gave him my first ever cutthroat shave with one of those straight razors yeah I felt like I became a man today yeah real men don't do that because you don't trust a man with a fucking razor blade was a guy I believe it was in San Diego that just slit someone's throat for no reason just well yeah crazy just went crazy yeah and they arrested him they person lived though but they're fucked up oh yeah I'd have surgery and like this guy just sliced open their throat I was petrified that he would slip or that someone would make him jump or just come in the birds like blown around ok the earthquakes here cut my throat open yeah you know they just get a razor i watch san andreas fuck earthquakes i watch 10 andreas when a plane over what happens to san francisco's just awful really inside reyes yeah just rain when you watch that movies even worse i like him what's his name like rock yeah he's great he's awesome I don't actually I've seen pretty much everything he's been in and you know what that movie he's actually kind of sir in that like he's quite no but like with the stuff with his daughter at the beginning when the moms sitting into the house with the new guy the bastard who runs away motherfucker Nietzsche runs away leave course he does no see that's what happens it's probably fair was a British accent pretty British actor they're always the part of my male feminist Aussie probably male feminist Jim and no and I thought his acting was subtle I thought it was really on port I thought it was a great performance know everything but that movie sucked I just like seeing San Francisco like pummeled with waves too many games natural disaster the song self-hate knows you could be there you could be you'd you'd like to be there in an orgy when the big one tsunami I've never been propelled forward by it ya know some Street fad you'd get propels and I think it repels just just the the viral load inside of that person's body he's at t on tap in the hipster bars in San Francisco da CT really worked that was like the big conspiracy that AZT was a cancer medication that they were using on AIDS when they thought it was the gay cancer they stopped a ZT a long long so much so that there was a kind my gauges are sort of like eighties bigotry up to date on my gay hate there was a guy named Peter Duesberg that I had him on the podcast and man it's very few people I've ever had on the podcast that brought so much hate with them but he is a biologist at the University of California Berkeley tenured fuckin professor up there who believed that HIV did not cause AIDS and that what HIV was was a weak virus that only existed in the bodies of people that already had compromised immune systems and he said the correlation between partying and party drugs crystal methedrine and all this is what drives you into the AIDS it's academics believe we have this extraordinary reverence for science hmm and of course we do rightly so because it's what tells us most about how the world works but obviously from you know the transcendental bits that actually matter but it tells us it tells us so much about how the world functions you know like what's gonna happen if I do that you know science tells us all these things right and so we have this I suppose appropriate reverence for scientists but what we you know what I think always forget is just how mental and fallible and in many cases unintelligent so many of them are there they're very so why change stuff you know I've dark secret that I never tell anyone which I'm going to reveal to you you don't believe in climate change no I don't believe in man-made climate change at all but you don't know you don't believe in it no I don't think it's I don't think I didn't know we were affecting the climate significantly no no no no although scientists they don't know the Fox cryptographer well this is my daughter secret so for two years nobody knows this I'm gonna lose I'm gonna this is gonna be the lot my last shred of conservative credibility okay going off to this show I worked for a climate change NGO and I saw at the U I went to the UN I was in the front row for Al Gore's speech I was in Bali I went to all the UN stuff went all their events and I saw firsthand just what I've loaded a crock of shit so much of it is really hot I mean look we now know the IPCC reports in the UN are you know total horseshit lead authors are asking for the names to be removed from them now because they've turned into just into ideological political documents then no basis in climate science whatsoever anymore but even in the early days when they were supposedly better I saw papering over of data was asked to do it and I didn't I saw people emitting datasets that didn't fit with their with their hypotheses I saw people getting and reports on scientists and rewording them to make them more extreme and more alarmist I saw all this happen and I saw all this happen in multiple organizations whose sole purpose was to was to the extremists about climate change and I I came to believe that the whole thing was was a crock of shit and I left so I quit do you think that what happened I mean I know very very very little of this so I'm just gonna just take this at face value and just debate you and not in debate you just ask you questions yeah do you think that what is happening is that an industry has been created and that's certainly a part that certainly is true that there is an industry I'm not going to suggest that the whole climate change establishment as a result of some people rent-seeking although there is some of that going on but there is definitely a climate change industry there's no doubt about that right and it also is one it's something that if you it's like saying that you don't believe in vaccines no I don't think it's the same you look but I'm buddy is to public opinion no I don't think it's true I think you don't think opinion well you never hear about it cuz the media will never dare tell you that is much more skeptical about many of the same people who don't believe in climate change also anti-vaxxers right but i don't think these two things have anything in common and one of them is right while it was wrong you know which one's wrong anti-vaxxers right or wrong should vaccinate their children right and climate change is bunk believe in climate change a lot of times I don't care what they but love me whether I care about facts not being you know not whether somebody lumps mean with the wrong group of people I've never cared about that I don't care what people think about me I care with whether my argument is sound or whether I'm right and was also whether I'm funny and entertaining people like me but I don't care if somebody you know but people right people right guys like us off all the time right they said me where I me I was a misogynist self-loathing homosexuals you did you did today on you know wrongly you know people do this all the time and it's just another way that the left has of D legitimizing the speaker because they don't like the arguments rather than take the argument you call the speaker self-loathing rather than attack the argument you call the speaker you know a bigot of some other kind you know what you know or you pathologize you say that if you're a gay person with these opinions you must either have like some psychological problem and get the you need therapy or you hate yourself and yourself loathing because if your religious upbringing all the rest of it you don't allow that person that dignity of having opinions that don't correspond with their sexuality that I think is cheap and it ignores the messy and complicated reality of human sexuality and who people are I don't care if somebody thinks that I'm a self-loathing homosexual what I care about is telling the truth that other people seem to be reluctant to do gay people you know the gay establishment and you know certainly doesn't tell the truth about a lot of things they don't tell the truth about born this way they don't tell the truth about HIV they get very upset when you dare to tell you know I wrote this column like you know gay people if you want to start donating blood because most gay people gay people are banned from donating blood you know or at least it's very difficult in the UK and I think the u.s. too and I wrote this column so if you want to gay people are complaining that they're not allowed to donate blood and they say that it's you know evidence of homophobia whatever I say if you if you don't if you want to be able to donate blood stop being sluts the reason that the the reason the NHS doesn't let you donate blood is because gay blood is so disproportionately more likely to have diseases in it if you want if you want to be allowed to donate blood stop sleeping around and this kind of stuff at the point my point mister you know my point is I don't care if somebody says you know you're a self-loathing homosexual I know it isn't true it's a cheap debate tactic and it hasn't really has no meaning outside of the facts of the argument so I don't care about being lumped in with with crazy people if my arguments are sound about a particular issue I'd rather I wasn't but you know and and you say to me will you come and you say I don't believe in climate change and in my head I think oh god you're like a crazy Infowars conspiracy theorist you're an Alex Jones type right who probably thinks vaccines are a conspiracy by the government I find that absurd and in any case I don't really mind too much because I think I think ordinary people I think many of your fans and certainly mine are a bit tired of having labels applied to them by other people I think people are a bit tired of being told what they are they've told their bigoted told them a sergeant istic told their you know that there is something else wrong with them injury you know or that they have the wrong opinions about things I think people have is sick of that actually and toes are born gay indeed you know I think people are a bit bored of that so I'm very relaxed about people calling me names because I've had it all career and normally as a consequence of telling the truth got it um you know there's a lot of articles this is really interesting because I googled it while you were talking about you know there's a quote that gets bandied around a lot 97% of climate scientists agree and there's a lot of fuckin articles it says that's horseshit yeah I don't think that's true I do think that's ever been true I think the 97 I think not that 97% of climate scientists agreeing on climate change is in the same category of of immortal myth that the campus rape culture statistic is one of those sort of unquestioned it's like it's become a it's become a fact I mean you know it's one of those things as uncritically reported and it's been repeated so many times that people don't even feel the need to ask for a citation anymore and so for example when you hear the stuff about the rape rape statistics or the pay gap people take it it's such an established part of accepted statistic now people have stopped bothering to ask for evidence to justify it I don't think it was ever true then Isis impotent well you would know probably better than a lot because you were actually there on the front lawns and you watched people actually fuck with evidence and I should omit things and add things and well what what was the when when you were there and this was all going on like what was the philosophy behind politics it's all politics climate change has never been about science it's always been about politics you know and this is this is this is when right-wingers sometimes sound a bit conspiratorial a bit crazy right unless it was all a construction of liberals like 97% a scientist is a construction of liberals I'll just get out right I understand how that conversational moment comes to happen but my more I can tell you is that it was climate change for me as an observer look for the scientists concerned it was primarily a political project it was a lot to do with their be sort of UN global guilt about poverty and the third world climate change was this issue that was gonna fix everything right was gonna fix poverty in the third world you know it finally addressed these sort of white guilt they all feel and gave them all a real reason to feel bad about being who they are you know it gave them that that sort of terrible you know it gave them the justification to beat up on capitalism which they all hate gave them the justification to beat up on you know Western Way of life and my James didn't pull my Breitbart colleague wrote a book about watermelons you know green on the outside red on the red on the inside and his point was that his thesis is that you know rest up in the language of environmentalism and climate change concern is actually just socialism you know anti capitalism instead of this this weird anarchic desire to see see this the developed world burn on the part of very politicized scientists and they have to say based on what I saw he's right well it still seems like it's a very high number when they're breaking down there's a skeptical science article about it they break down the actual number of scientists that do believe that we have something to do with global warming I mean ultimately this is a large ultimate ultimately the debate pointless anyway you know most of you there there a million well top pointers but that is there are millions of articles about climate change minute and with one Google search you can't hope to get anywhere even close to the truth but in any case it's a good idea to get off fossil fuels simply because going to run out it's a question of energy security not conservation for me I think for many conservatives who agree that we have to find other solutions whether it's wind or nuclear or something else right just drilling and using up all the oil is gonna I mean it's gonna run out eventually right it's gonna run out so we need a better so we need something else in the wings that can take over that's that's not a question of ecology and that's not a political question either it's just basic energy security making sure that we all have what we need to survive and that we can all keep our lights on right so for me it's not you know that there is a heavily politicized and I think primarily political and not scientific issue but we should in any case be pursuing renewable energy because one day we're going to have to even with shale gas which is gonna fix this for another 100 years or something it's gonna run out eventually and we are going to be around when it does I don't believe that I always find it very disturbing when people bring up this whole frakking thing and they're very dismissive about that that one freaks me out because there's absolute evidence that they've poisoned a lot of wells and there's areas that people can't live in anymore that it's leaked into River supplies there's absolute evidence of that and then people like well the but look how cheap the gas is now I'm like it doesn't matter if you fuck something up to the point where it's useless a hundred thousand years from now he stays he a poisoned a river doesn't I mean you may suppose the EBA EPA would say that doesn't mean there shouldn't be an EPA just because they fucked up and the river right just because one fracking well fucked up or even 3 4 10 10 fracking ones or 10 out of thousand maybe they maybe do you think maybe need to do it differently take yes the fracking I have no idea actually more than a million I've been totally out of that climate and yes right now I'm gonna say you're kidding right in America no a million fragments America that's insane yeah in America they can't possibly I think it's more than that actually 1.1 million active I'm stunned but don't understand how my country rolls so in that case you could I mean you could present hundreds of examples of poisoned rivers there's 1.1 million of these wells and your own you could in there are a hundred scare stories in the media every year that hundred is a relatively small number if you're looking at statistics but if you're the actual human beings that live anywhere nuclear power you could say people die nuclear accidents in Japan a new Texas you know in in in Russia well there's two right which is which is probably comparable at comparable in comparable in numbers of people effect it to your frakking thing we don't live in a perfect world we have to make a risk assessment and a judgment and also price comes into it you know the cost and the amount or the benefit to society of getting all of this natural gas right if a couple of rivers are poisoned we may say that that is the best of a bad set of solutions right yeah none of this stuff is perfect because we don't live in mud huts we want nice shit you know you want your cameras you want the internet you want computers you want to reach a producer with you know seven buzzing devices next to him that comes at a price right there's an energy cost to that and if you want that you're going to have to get it from so you're going to get to get the power from somewhere and none of those solutions are going to be things we're going to like it's either drilling for oil it's a Middle East oil well sure I think we should invade that as kill their leaders convert them to Christianity which he also said but she also said who's he and called and Coulter said we did you say he also said no I didn't called I said she also said we should invade their countries kill the leaders incomes would you became a man what if she became a tranny actually see the ankle to whatever become a man she's a beautiful one how dare you lie to the America the world know what you do you are a right-wing shill you son fracking my you love circumcision my love I think she's tremendous I don't know I do and you know what I do she falls into the same bucket you do and I do and Trump does she is raw no she's not role she certainly is you could characterize you characterize much of what both of we of us do is just trolling I don't try I don't tell me what I do the troll guy hewers will make up their own judgments on that one fine okay promise fight I may say inflammatory things would I believe them ridiculous shit about Mexicans I don't think she believes that I am I wanted to persuade you Kip which is closest thing we have to equipment the Tea Party I want to persuade you keep in the UK who were banned from the pride march because of course the leftists homosexual establishment are nothing if not ruthlessly intolerant of conservatives it was much more fun for me to come out as a Tory that was it the gay person a Tory being a conservative yes much more difficult come out of conservatives is being gay right-wing like I said right wings very difficult I wanted you Kip whose I could become the tea party to to go all dressed in in drag as Margaret Thatcher and have signed have signs things like I've lost my suppose gay people okay I've lost it's gone it doesn't matter Oh trolling but now I've got I've got got troll that's gone yeah you were accusing me a trolling beat rollers rollers Coulter Ken as Donald Trump is where I think we can all be troll ish and it's a being provocative and outrageous saying things you believe in the the definition of trolling is expanded to cover that now it's become essentially meaningless word like racist well it's also a dismissal word it's like you know when someone calls you a sexist if someone calls you or bigoted they'll call roll I think what we all do all four of us is we say thing we gin up our jokes and our rhetoric and our provocation to get attention mmm and to draw attention perhaps to people who are unnecessarily offended by things they shouldn't be offended by yeah idiots but in the course of doing so we do tell the truth what we really believe in now you may be the sort of least on that spectrum that probably starts with you and ends with Trump you'll probably you know the least troll ish but you still do it mmm interesting well and I think it's partly a countercultural spectrum you know people if people you know you're not part of a right-wing establishment media you're your own thing you are you know you fall I think very squarely into that cash we were talking earlier you know that sort of I think many of the people who like each of us are the same you know the big overlap I think yes I think we do too yeah I think I'm trolla in some all right here's one like what I said earlier about tweeting about male feminists choking to death on vegan pizza that's clearly true even strikes me as good government policy we just did three hours mom shit that was that flew by I think we got more heated about Christianity than a yes we did because you're a militant atheist refused to extend that even HD except the obvious truth that you're here's the thing the moral kind this is where people can't get wrong get me wrong I'm not I'm not I'm not I don't even I wouldn't even classify myself as anti religious I'm just I don't believe people I think people are full of shit and when I read a story that's full of shit like first of all I know too much about the construction of the Bible I know too much about the New Testament I know Constantine and a bunch of bishops constructed it and decided what to leave out I know Constantine didn't even become a Christian until right before he fucking died okay I know that the original was written in ancient Hebrew and to this day there's a fucking shit ton of words in ancient Hebrew that they have no idea what the hell they mean not only that that in ancient Hebrew letters double as numbers there were no numbers so the letter A was also the number one there's a numerical value to words and sentences that was completely lost in the translation to Latin and Greek and eventually English I know that you're well-read and passionate on the subject so let's move on I'm not even my god I've had so much flat agrees have been great thank you for having me forever in town again let's do it again we could probably please well you can be sure I'll be back we could do I really liked it guess we I've had a lovely time and when you come to London make sure you let me know yeah absolutely I'm usually in London like once a year I'm how often you in Los Angeles well I think I'm gonna be around a lot more now I have a little announcement coming in the next seven days which will draw me to the u.s. much more often but listen you're a lot of fun your articles are fantastic I really enjoy it your Twitter feeds great check it out it's Nero the one who killed all the Christians that's evil congratulations on getting that as a Twitter handle that's and I friends friends in low places excellent catch all right that's it ladies and gentlemen we'll be back tomorrow until then go fuck yourselves arrived [Music] you
