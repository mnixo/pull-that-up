hello freak bitches have you eaten polar bear oh absolutely what does polar bear taste like you know what I've eaten it it's up in the Arctic with the Inuit in it and so they they boil everything it's it boiled and and it's funny you put salt like the brisket you normally wear we need the back straps you know that would be the first choice or tenderloins the Inuit not it's the brisket because when you boil it that's where you've got this great textures you know that they're crunchy I mean I don't even know what you'd call cartilage and and connective tissue that's not just meat and fat so that's you know it was it was a delicacy I would rate it right out there with the best of the meat I've ever had now Healy oh absolutely but boiled with salt and being very hungry out on the ice here you spend 20 days out in the ice with the Inuit on a dogsled you're you're hungry you you know they kill a bear you eat it you're it's like the best finest Kobe beef in downtown New York City is it relative to where you're at and a struggle that your enemy if you had it here in LA if I took you to a restaurant down the street hard to say because because there is no restaurant serves it so you it's hard to hard to take it out of that context and say is it the best meat now here I don't know every night wild sheep same thing you're on a mountain and you've been backpacking for 10 days carrying 50 to 70 pounds on your back and you finally get your realm and run down to below alpine and find some little sticks and make a fire and roast the ribs on it I defy anybody to tell me there's a better piece of meat in this world that tastes better than that wild sheep on a mountain after a sheep hunt but would it be that good if I was downtown New York City or here in LA I you know I don't know because you you just can't do it it doesn't exist one of the best meals I've ever had in my life we shot a mule deer that that deer right there in Montana and we we ate the liver and the heart that night it was insane it was it was so delicious yeah that's my campfire and just cooked it over oil with a little salt and pepper and then there just moaning with delight like an orgy yeah but anyone that doesn't hunt that isn't out there can never know what what you're describing I know it I know it right I've had the same thing and I've had your moose liver and name it name it you know antelope you all around the world we've had the same thing it's the best of the best it's the perfect I think it's because that's who we are that's who we are we're not the fancy restaurant you know thousand-dollar bottles of wine and hohoho you know what cuisine it's not what we are we're just we're just that we eat well game cooked on a fire that's the truest we can ever be that's the truest most natural flavor and and eating that we could ever do I don't know man I don't know it's interesting I don't know if it gets stuck in your head but I don't know either good but it seems like a very likely scenario I mean the the brains functional and it's the most traumatic experience ever and you don't have any context you don't have any language you don't have any knowledge of why you're there no one's explained what's gonna happen all of a sudden you're born that's got to be unbelievably traumatic you've been hearing this then on top of that adds circumcision they slice your fucking dick with a razor yeah welcome home what you cut his dick what welcome to earth we're just gonna can't be clean what about soap anybody ever everybody we're talking about soap cut is fucking dead kids screaming's dicks on fire screaming just came out of pussy dicks actually how long do they wait for they circumcise they probably don't do it right away yeah they definitely stick you with needles right away they vaccinate you like instantly we're worried about disease yeah fucking shove needles right into that baby's body start pumping chemicals would you ever do a home birth fuck no what am i living in a cave what am i on a fucking farm somewhere in a Clint Eastwood movie about the 1800s mr. fuck out here Sally I don't think she's gonna make it you try your hardest get a water bucket that's all in every movie every Western birth movie it's like they act if you get the water bucket there in time the baby will survive in the water bucket fix me a bucket of water yeah kiddo but a good luck in the water watch some cloths from clean cloth since water like a baby's turned around I'm gonna go in there he goes anyway it's farmer hands and ruins your wife's pussy just shoves his gigantic gorilla like farmer hands into that pussy and spins it around he's the only guy knows how to do it because he's done it with calves we got a breach crab alright he rolls his sleeve up to his elbow and just fucking lubes the whole thing just launches it in there and spins around your kid fingernails country monkey blood just fucking gopher shit monkey bullshit just took a giant farmer doctor crap in here he's reaching into your wife's pussy holy got a half strangled emaciated malnourished baby and there's a smack it to make it cry yeah and the poor thing is just like what happened why what happened why and that's what what pushed us to go out and look at this like so we we went to the West Bank and hung out with this comedy satire troupe whoa who has a television show that it's it's once a week but during Ramadan it's every single night for 30 nights and so yeah and so like we hung out with these folks like so these are people who are they're living in the West Bank and they're criticizing everyone so they're criticizing the Palestinians the Israel the Israelis the the Americans Barack Wow you know they owe Osama and Obama in the same sketch right like that you know these guys are doing really cutting-edge stuff in this place that there there aren't comedy clubs like your the way that you get professional comedy there's like two shows on Palestinian national television or you need to find it broadcast from Egypt or if Jordan I'm not sure where Jordan because evidently the Jordans aren't terribly funny Jordanians are very funny but the Egyptians are a little area's Jordanians aren't funny so that's right now listening it's fucking pissed there is a no we talked to these guys and they're like oh yeah there's a there's like a hierarchy of comedy in the Middle East and according to them the Palestinians are about the middle the Egyptians are hilarious real and the Jordanians evidently are like the most serious the Egyptians are hilarious very funny yes what do you attribute that to I can't remember I don't know I wish Joel was here he remembers everything here because he writes it all down but yeah there's like a long history of Egyptian comedy huh very funny people what about the Israelis they factor in there yeah so so what was really fascinating was that so we had you know you have kind of the stereotype of the of the funny Jewish person very self-deprecating but you don't find that style of comedy in Israel as much there's railey comedies a lot more aggressive like it's the it's the comedy of the victor not of the of the victim oh okay so we found this weird reversal where the Palestinians were much more sort of self-deprecating and their comedy was much more Jewish in in the American sense than you would have necessarily expected it was real I was really fascinated
