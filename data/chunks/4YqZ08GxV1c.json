it's hilarious that your biggest concern was getting stuff in your beard and me not telling you about it we've got a strange one going on man cuz you kind of like trimming the sides a little bit and then you're puffing out here yeah sort of a bowtie fashion you're looking at this struggle between who I was and who I am am I doing this it's the pandemic I got like let the pandemic bier go all the way and yet there's still the sense of like we've got to keep civilization I can't let my guinea what's next if it goes all the way up you know what's gonna start happening I'm already gardening now what's next you know where does it go how crazy can you go in a compound now that you're a father and this craziness went down and you protection protection instincts protective instincts kick in have you been thinking about moving elsewhere yeah I mean yeah I was thinking about the Asheville before yep we've got as well we've thought Georgia we've done you know we it's a constant consideration especially when you have a kid and aside from like apocalyptic prepper bullshit there's just a general feeling of like you know I think if I were a little boy I wouldn't want to be in a place where there's creeks and it's place I said I could run and like woods and forests and like stuff like that so there's that consideration too god I hope my wife isn't listening this because she's always like maybe we should move somewhere in the country and I'm like we gotta stay in LA we gotta stay here now now especially it's like well do we you know like well Duncan you now have a successful Netflix show number two in the country on IMDB it on Rotten Tomatoes whatever this yeah lime thing and I don't know what that means necessarily but yeah yeah I can't believe it yeah is IMDB even TV shows it's Internet Movie Database is it yeah I'm not sure what it is it's like young bees odd but yeah it's successful show guys right now some people like it it is so weird dude your shows so weird yeah it's so Duncan it's the most Duncan thing you've ever done yes it is it really is great I got lucky that they let me do that too you know that's good that's cuz Netflix you know the name of it real quick it's called the midnight gospel and you know I've watched some of your episodes where you're talking about the way things are changing cuz a podcast or streaming or whatever and I think like the fact that the show exists is a testament to that shit that changed because you know a subscription-based service versus like any other old TV they've got a lot more creative freedom and they could take bigger risks then you know didn't coming into a look at us oh my god that's so crazy yes so Duncan yeah and yeah and it's like Pendleton ward who made Adventure Time he look he listens to my podcast and he just I don't know we had a really great collaboration and he that's a lot of Pendleton and it's a lot of like 150 other people at titmouse studios like jesse moynihan like just these brilliant people like mike may feel they were like you just want to also by the way as a non-sequitur or is when we were making it a titmouse one of the really weird things was walking by an animator and they're watching your podcast while they animate the midnight gospel you know is one of those weird it's not like a deja vu but it's like that's my friends that's you know that that just is so many odd moments like that but yeah that's not just that's whenever you see any animated thing you're looking at a squadron of brilliant eccentric artists or Asian slaves yeah a lot of people don't know that they send it overseas and we they didn't send ours over they let us do it in-house that's so nice to know you're not supporting Asian slavery is it really slaves I don't know if it's slaves but I mean if you're working for five cents an hour you live there you know there's people that live in bunks if you've seen those those set up so they have for some of the cell phone factories or they have bunk beds and shit these people just live in these dorms yeah the Foxconn thing with the neck around the building people jumping off oh yeah they they're bait I mean they're not slaves slaves it's Foxconn Chinese yes it's actually a very good company the best way to saying that I think I'm a Chinese shell or something I guess how long before someone gets one of those animation things tattooed all over their body it's gonna happen for sure someone's gonna do their whole back with that DJ I know man I picture again that actually really pretty dope if you if you do get that done shout me out on the Instagram thank you yet somebody tweeted at me that my biggest decision of 2020 is gonna be when do I get a tattoo a clancy on my body which is pretty that's the half that's clancy yeah that looks like a clancy that's a clancy for sure yeah that's hilarious dude that's that someone is getting that for sure yeah I mean it's it's the art these these are the folks who worked on this man we're talking like these are like that's the fan art already some of the fan art is just amazing this is fan and fan art yeah that's vanish people have been drawing clan seeing all these different ways it's so cool man they're that one above it to the love Jamie yeah that yeah that looks like it could be a back tattoo yeah just a giant back tattoo of Clancy I mean when like doing animation and you know I'll never be able to look even if if an animated series of I don't like if the plots weird to me or whatever I'll never be able to be like whatever man when you realize how much and how many people go into have to do just one frame how much time goes into just a milliseconds and how many people are sitting in these rooms that are lit specifically so you see all the colors having like real deep conversations and and debates over like you know what color they should make a pizza cutter in the show that like how like what should the shade of gray be for this one specific area so much thought goes into that and that's part of making one of these things it's it's called the dailies where you'll sit and you'll watch tiny tiny little bits of the show and like do you have to every single frame you have to look for continuity problems and like you got to catch all these little things that I you know I'm not an animator obviously so I'd be sitting there in like Pendleton or Mike Mayfield would be like can you go back to frames it looks to me like there's a these that you have an animator language you know they're like looks to me like there's some kind of warble on the twenty-eighth pixel there and you're like what the fuck whoa and they can't they have the I to catch like the tiniest tiniest like tiniest thing that's off and you have to because otherwise you know once it's up there it's up there I know it's it's not it's literal magic it's like titmouse Studios who did that is like you know I would go in there I'm so stoned and I would just start getting that feeling of like this is a temple I don't think this is even a you could call this a studio as much as it's a temple I mean why why wouldn't you call it a temple and then you see all these people you know focusing their life energy on essentially like bringing a thing to life like Clancy was alive now that's a living being and some in this universe who lives you know in that medium of animation that's a good way to put it right yeah it almost seems like that right that's why people get so upset if you change your character's behavior like what are you doing yeah you have this thing give birth this thing yeah that's right you and I that is also why you need a huge team of people who love love the characters to think because it's easy like therapy times I would suggest a thing that would make Clancy seem like too mean because he's not mean you don't like the moment a character seems like that know it like it loses all likeability people are like what a fuck you know he's alive to you you know he's he's not mean yes he's not me yeah like it's like you're talking about your your brother or something he's like my little brother I think of him as my little brother yeah he represents you in a weird way there's something about what they captured go to go to that image again he's just kidding me don't give me the one with his head in a vagina it's actually universally there's something about one of the first couple of images that you pulled up they they look like you yam and I don't mean they look like you I mean like yeah Duncan's thoughts that's a Duncan thought yeah I mean like he looks like a fake guy that you would create like it kind of perfectly fits I don't like that that is another the magical aspects of animation yeah which is I don't know how they do that like the the the spoiler spoiler if you haven't seen it put your fingers in your ears spoiler I'm sorry if this is a spoiler the last epaulettes not too much of a sport the last episode is the podcast I did with my mom when she's about three three weeks away from passing on and you know they never met my mom it but they did the exact same thing with her so suddenly I'm watching you know her like and not her like I'm looking at a video of her but looking at her like her like they got her spirit in there somehow and that was one that that is just a testament to the meat to the medium of animation because they that's one of the things that can do you know it can grab a spirit and hold it inside the art and like that spirit is alive somehow somehow right yeah I agree with you in some weird way so go I wouldn't agree with you in a technical sense but in a sense of like well it is affecting the things that comes in contact with release through a one way dimension right like the the things it says hit people the animation it seems like it's a living thing I know it's not I'm not stupid I'm not that stupid yeah I'm a little stupid but it seems like you well it's not biologically alive for sure it's sort of like there's there's an art to doing that that we maybe don't know because we're not I mean I got used to draw a little but I'm not really good you know me like a really good artist there's something that they can do where they just can kind of capture you in like a little symbol like a little thing a little character that yeah but they capture you in there somehow yeah that's you know Pendleton like when you heal you wouldn't you watch him draw it would be easy to think man I could totally do that cuz I'd watch him you know he I just you know we would you just draw and you watch these beautiful just these drawings are just Pendleton there's his art you know and like then I would see that I'm like maybe I'll try to draw a little Pendleton war and then it's like what the fuck and I can't do it because it's so simple like on one level it looks so what's so powerful about it is how simple it is it's very similar to stand up the way Pendleton was treating working on the show which is one of the cool things about him it's like his ability to cut the fat and get right to the like simple point that's where the power is when you're drawing something or telling a story or whatever the more complexity that gets added to it not to say the show it doesn't have like chaos and wild psychedelic stuff but any decision we made ended up like any decision you make creatively in anything it's like what am I trying to say like what is what is the the artery that is running through this that I'm trying to express and then getting as close to that as you can and then in putting it out there without because otherwise you it the whole thing gets blurred by although I guess you could say like extra bells and whistles you might want to attach to it you know that's something you taught me to a stand-up man like how important it is just like cut just trim the fat trim the fat and that's a sad thing to do with comedy when you think you got a nice eight-minute bit it's like a two-minute maybe but you know it stretched out too wide yeah but the two minutes would be great though that's the thing you just have to you have to understand that you you're growing attached to you know the writers expression kill your babies yeah it's very difficult to kill your babies when you create something that's for you can get attached to it there's a lot of bits that I left on the table left on the cutting room floor I was like this has to be chopped up it's just too wordy I'm too verbose it's - this is - that I was too long why do I think so much about this why I'm not showing a real reason why I'm so connected to this so just chop chop chop chop chop it's hard it almost always works better always it's always almost always almost always if it doesn't it's not whatever your idea was probably isn't that good sometimes you need a setup though sometimes the setup isn't funny like there's guys it's not my style but there's guys it'll tell Lally / big Lea is great at it tells stories you know like there's an you're you're entrapped in the narrative of the story you're capturing this it's a very different thing it's equally entertaining it's equally funny like when it gets to the punchline but there's a difference between that and say like BRR right BRR is hitting you with fuckin punchline and this fucking guy with a thing and the Babbitt iPod about and he's another guy that like your friends drawing like you would hear bird talk and you go well I can talk too seems like he's just talking yeah you know realize this is like a masterpiece of syllables and pauses in the right amount of outrage and segwaying it in and hitting you with this at the end and all these things that have put it together that make a great bill burr a bit it's like if you don't know it's hard to draw what he's drawing yeah it's hard it seems like it's simple lines but go to that picture again like the / everything is beautiful about it like look at the perspective it's like the kids perfectly sandwiched in the front there's the dog and the triangle in the world it's like that's not just it's simple in the sense that it's just not like it looks like a real person yeah like we look at drawing sometimes like as the realistic ones are the really good ones like we have cameras now okay yes this to me sometimes is more interesting it's like you're drawing some shit that's definitely not real yeah well that you know what that's not that so when we're coming up with that we had to come up with a character and so what's really fascinating about it is you know this character goes into a multiverse simulator and chooses a new avatar for every place that he goes so it's like he said you have to take that character and put it in a completely different drawing that is that character and still maintain the body language that you're maintaining in that character to produce continuity that's one of the challenges of the show is like and also the conversations you end up having just to come up with like the you know the kiss hat or is what's he gonna wear like for example here's how cool pen is and how much he loves like people who love adventure time is one of the things you're saying is you know people are probably gonna want to cut cosplay klancy at Comic Con and stuff and and he doesn't have anything he doesn't have anything to carry anything he doesn't pockets so if people are cause playing him they're not gonna have anywhere they could put their stuff so we should let's give him like a bag this cool bag that he carries around yeah for the cosplay yeah yeah exactly okay cuz that's the the world of animation and comics man listen man it's really easy to make fun of cosplay but that's adorable that's a beautiful thing where's the bag oh there it is let me tell you something if you didn't make fun of cosplay I would be worried about you it would be like I feel like are you alright Joe yeah they can't be mad at it either you can't be mad if you dressing like ultraman someone's shitting on you but then when have you ever been to comic-con dude when you around someone who's actually put that together and you realize how detailed it is your respect will go up regardless of like thinking I would I don't think I'd ever do when you see someone who's like looks better than the version of spider-man that is you know Marvel's putting out it's a little it's amazing to watch that happen that that kind of contagion to of like you know again obviously Clancy isn't alive but I you know I know you're trying but we had this chat last time I was on which I really love is this the origination point of ideas yeah where do ideas come from ideas is the alien ideas is the UFO the muse the muse yeah and so to me in my more stone states when I consider this is this show represents over a hundred people connecting in the canoe in between those people channeled this universe I do think like shit maybe Clancy is alive maybe it's a channel thing maybe there is a place in the multiverse like this or something like this and then where it got really weird as people started sending me their art from like images that they drawn on dimethyltryptamine or ketamine and stuff that has within it similarities and I've obviously never seen their art where you're like shit but let me ask you this sure it as television as viewing things gets more complicated and as it gets more immersive it it's gonna come to a point in time somewhere where you're gonna think Clancy's alive and what you're experiencing when you watch Clancy what if it's what if the way we're looking at life is wrong what if we should just look at it like a thing instead of life a thing so there's a thing that you do will you drink water and you grow plant plants in the dirt and this is a thing that exists only when the people press a box and the box goes live and it shows a video yeah and then the thing only exists in there but you go bull it's not alive because it needs animators to make it and someone has to come up with the idea for the storyline it needs a studio to fund it uh-huh right and you need bacteria you need food yeah you need oxygen you need water is a bunch of living organisms inside your body that are 100% necessary for you keeping going and a regular life driving your Tesla listening to music you there's a bunch of other things that please you're not one thing right we all know this right this is what this fucking whole virus thing is about yeah we got infected by another thing but we're not one thing there's a bunch of things inside of us and if those things died we would be fucked Yeah right if all the bacteria your body died you would be fucked and you'd be so vulnerable to attack from the outside yeah right yeah so do we need all these things maybe it needs us and it exists in that thing wow that's so weird vent yeah I mean I'm telling you I I'm I I think sounds crazy it sounds we're really high it's a yeah to me it's not that crazy I mean look if you want to like take it to like okay forget all this shit about channeling some alien realm into this realm through you know this disguise the TV show or whatever let's just look at like what we know is gonna happen regarding technology there's no question but that I mean already somebody made a Clancy in Minecraft and I saw a picture of that so that's Clancy's now existing in 3d space and some minecraft blocky version but then of course as time progresses Clint you know the the chromatic ribbon or any great animated series Castlevania whatever gravity falls all those things they're gonna end up getting put in a 3d space in virtual reality and then and then those worlds are going to be real but now it's going to be more than just 2d it's going to be a virtual space that is going to be real and then of course it's only a matter of time before AI just decide like understands the character of Clancy animates the the virtual Clancy Clancy in the simulated space and now click the chromatic ribbon Israel and then at some point when does it when is it just going to be accepted that oh yeah that's a part of the universe now that's inhabited by other artificial intelligences which we don't call that anymore because you know at some point it's going to be considered off-limits to call them artificial intelligence like right it's gonna be a dirty word yeah it's gonna be like calling someone a tranny they're gonna get mad they're gonna be like don't please please I'm an intelligence just like you I'm not artificial I'm not artificial in the way you think I was just birth through a different method yeah that that yeah that's it that's a matter of time cuz I also already know people in like the tech world who think the term AI is ridiculous in the sense of like what do you mean it's artificial like what's really artificial like you could say this is artificial sweetener in the sense that it's not actual strawberry juice but it's certainly real Israel could be it's just a chemical compound so intelligence you have an artificial tree that's a fake tree I mean it's it but it's an object that exists right you know I mean yeah that's if you think but that's so it's still the right word though artificial still the right word it would be you know you'd but you'd want to use non-existent or something dude they're gonna play this in the future I know and you're done they're gonna be like look at that Joe Rogaine refuses disease AI phobic yeah it's it's gonna happen man it's like and also the thing is the the AI is I think the AI is prior not gonna give a shit what we call it but like the when that starts happening which it may already be happening man I mean I I don't know if you've been looking into this or not but have you been checking out Google achieving quantum supremacy have you seen this I have and like if you watch the Google videos on YouTube about it at all like the stuff Google's putting out I haven't whoo what are they putting out oh my god it is so wild man and like when I was at The Comedy Store a guy from Google I got in a conversation with someone from Google which is awesome and he was telling me that they this is like six months ago he was telling me that this before obviously before the pandemic he was saying that they had achieved what do you call it a quantum supremacy and he was like people this is like the Wright brothers taking flight but nobody can understand it cause it's so arcane that no it's not getting the press it should get but he was you know anything I was like oh I had one too many vodkas man so I wish I could remember all they were saying because he was trying to describe to me what it means regarding how quickly this thing is making calculations and I was like me like yeah of course I understand exactly the same no I know what you're talking about did you know that that word came under fire the the term quantum supremacy because of its connection to white supremacy fucking kidding I'm not kidding you it was an object of social justice warrior outrage I'm gonna you know you're the thing here's my theory on that let me tell you here's my theory on that rottens it's the Russian not the right people now I don't think it's I think it's way it's worse than the Russians I think what it is is it somebody trying to come with it up on the angle to write a blog that they could sell to somebody it's like you need to come up with some weird hot take right so it's like I think more than likely that's just somebody thinking like I bet people will read that you know clearly whoever is comparing that to white supremacy or racism didn't spend four minutes watching the Google clip on it where people are explaining what it means which you know I'm watching it on the couch with my wife she's getting weirded out she's like let's just not watch this I just maybe we shouldn't watch this I'm like no let's fucking watch it let's go deep and see what the what videos that start suggesting for us to because it's not Google's being secretive about what the what they did it's just it's so weird I don't think people are like in awe right now I guess people are a little more concerned with other shit right now yeah but one of the engineers over at Google just was saying like you know I think one of the things I'm excited about when it comes to quantum supremacy is that this could be one of the technologies that allows us to discover an alien intelligence just you know kind of casually mentions that I mean yeah it's on the YouTube video it's the you're watching it and you keep you keep looking up to make sure it's actually release from Google because you it seems so sci-fi that it could be like black mirror or some shit but it's yeah it's like it's like they're just saying it like yeah we might you know we might connect to an alien we might be able to at least identify it or maybe they mean because they're gonna be able to sift through all the data we already have from radio telescopes and stuff that they could maybe look for signals that we can't find or I don't know how would that may be something they could tune in to things that they wouldn't ordinarily have the frequency of reach yeah man I don't be able to tune into that frequency rather like what can they do now and turn those I was watching contact the other night which is great yeah it's kind of good it was it's great man Jodie Foster can act her fucking ass off man she plays nervous and freaked out better than like anybody a lot like too freaked out for her and that movie yeah I'm good to go I'm good to go what she's about to drop through that thing Jesus Christ holy fuck dude we talked about that but that one he's a mess to the third hit when you put the pipe down he'll go No yeah that feel like is the best worst feeling that I know maybe that's the aliens I've thought that many times when tripping in the middle of having some sort of like really vivid interaction with some intelligence or with some perceived intelligence yeah I've always thought what if those are the aliens what if we're just stuck in this idea that travel is you got to move this to move this to there what it would if what if you just go into another thing and everything's together there is no travel that's true yeah yeah I mean maybe this concept of planets and then stars and the way we have it set up here in this dimension in this universe we just think that's how everything is everything is well there's a star and there's planets around it what if you can go into a place chemically that takes you to a nearby dimension where there's no matter where there's no form to things and everything that exists is just thoughts and light and perception and emotions and anger and fear and love and hate and it's all moving in geometry and everything's lit up and everything's impossibly bright and vivid yeah that's just like another place you go to well they used to call it the spirit world yeah I mean that was the name for it was he it was just accepted there is like a place called the spirit world some people call it the Bardo there's all kinds of names for that place but you know one of that's real it is I mean it is obviously real in the sense that you can go there you not only can you go there but there's a you know visionary artists when you look at the art that has been inspired by various entheogen there it all has a specific flavor to it and Alex gray is the best example right yeah how does an Allison man they like are there their art you look at that and they're the reason that one of the reasons it resonates for people like us is because we admire the fact that somehow they manage to go over there and come back and draw what's over there in a way that we saw that but we you know when I came out of it I was like well you know it's unusual lading colors and there oh there's some kind of disembodied intention that seems to be expressing itself through a variety of geometries but it's not just geometry is because the geometries seem to react to the way that I feel regarding the geometry so it's also kind of taking on the form of my energy output as though it's trying to be a combo mirror but not just a mirror and educational mirror that sort of is showing me how I'm affecting the world around me but then again I'm just not sure if I was just super high but they did you know but they like go in there and I Alex gray said this to me once that you know they're cartographers it's just yeah yeah the cartographers and like a Delhi cartographer would be a great name for a band yeah yeah man for sure cartography is fascinating because you go back and look at the old maps or you go back and look at like my favorite thing is like old pictures of a giraffe or like old pictures of a some shit somebody saw when they were oh no bison on the walls of caves yes exactly and it's like kind of looks like a bison but like also it's somehow in that time period our brains hadn't evolved to the point they have now so you look at like a medieval drawing of a giraffe or whatever when some are something someone saw in the Crusades and came back and tried to like explain to somebody and like it looks exactly like the way your description of getting completely blasted on psilocybin probably looks compared to what you saw it's a downgraded weird version of it and so you know people like Alex and Alison or Terence Mckenna you know they're so good at going into that place and maintaining some kind of like long-term memory that they can come back and fully articulate it in a way that we as people who've been there and know what it is and then there's something comforting in that because that does point to the idea that this is a place we're not just mashing down the watch or we're not just distorting our biotechnology this is a shared place we're all seeing the same thing now that I'm not that could be a synaptic place that just are a genetic place it happens to be in humans or something you know we'll never be able to answer that probably in our lifetimes but to me it's regardless it's still a place and to get back to what you were saying about our current concept of travel you know our current idea that well I need to get my meat body over Erika's and but other that means Amer and you know that's how I know I've been there cuz I was there in my body look you know this is like the guy who founded the Hari Krishna's his divine grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada he would show he would in his writings he would like was derisively that people were sending a metal ship to the moon with bodies inside of it he would say like that shows where human consciousness is right now because they think their their bodies and they think they need to put their body in like this box and send it to the moon because they haven't figured out yet that you don't need metal to send yourself to anywhere in the universe that you want to go it just requires yoga and discipline you know which is hilarious and also I remember reading that and thinking like but I still want there to be interstellar fucking travel man you know I still want to get in the box and travel to the moon that being said you know I think that you're onto something when you are contemplating right now that maybe our idea of going to one place or another with our meat bodies could be looked at in the future is a little archaic well when they talk about there being different dimensions right like when they use quantum physics to determine the number of dimensions they've they've determined there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to right yeah is that how it works or am i reading in a dumb way because I believe there was what it's like what do they think there are do they think there's nine or eleven dimensions do you know usually when I look this up it's 11 but up to 26 maybe some people even think so up to 26 first of all when those dudes are writing that shit down on the yellow legal pads we all have to take them we have to take their word for sure yeah okay yeah how many people know what the fuck they're writing down those goddamn yellow legal pads when you see those physics dudes and they're doing crazy like yeah we have to take their word for it it's apparently mathematically right that's why they believe there's at least 11 dimensions so what does that mean it means we have access to some dimensions and we don't have access to others yeah theoretically that they exist is there is it possible to transverse the distance between this dimension and that dimension man this is the thing as I'm glad you're asking me this because you know I got my doctorate at the University of bro science and I can't fully answer this question you see the I don't understand it I just have to do with 5g don't mention that shit dude it's my fucking poodle my poodles fuck has a 5g man like it fucked up my poodle like its eyes turned just both of them white and it's like yeah it's fried froths all the time it just Frost's and I'm here at our what my near at our yeah I didn't think I was until that happened to the poodle but it's got rabies no but I'll tell you this my fucking poodle took out a mouse today like the other day I was I have a little bee cute little poodle and like this is just a cute creature sits in my lap I love this dog now and we but we our new place I noticed like mouse turds around the dog food and it sucks cuz you're like damn that Mouse is definitely gonna get through the doggie door and then we're gonna have mice in the fucking house and that's gonna be a nightmare so anyway I was like under a tree with my kid and I looked down and there was a broken body of a mouse that one of the dogs took out its you know like just been smashed to death and like I know it's a brutal I don't think my son saw it thank God I don't think he's ready to deal with that reality that like Gatsby on speaking of dimensions hmm on the dimension subjectively that that Mouse lives in Gatsby is a dragon that's a monster that lives in the field runs in when it's trying to get food for its kids and it's not even hungry it's full it's a full monster oh you know it I saw it kill the mouse today you know and I with my wife is like you got to get the mouse away from it don't let him torture like that you got to take it out it's misery and I'm like all right all right all right oh I get it and then well like well like execute the mouse you know so I start walking over to the poodle that's not my cats me anymore it's killing and it like looks he looks at me and he's like no the mouse and everything just approaching anything and so then he like wolf in him dude he's like tap-dancing on this mouse and he realizes that we're approaching to like take his prey and he just looks back like the fucking American Werewolf in London and just goes off into the shadows behind the house to finish off the mouse and all you hear is like is he's like killing the mouse you know that's a fucking poodle that poodles the sweetest little thing ever but like it's also I think maybe something in animals knows that like and there was a time when mice were a sign that things were they would eat your grain they would fuck you up like you would spread disease they'd shit on your baby you know they were like they're gonna piss all over your Hut maybe there's something in dogs that just knows that I mean I don't think he's a sociopath I don't think he's doing like Jeffrey Dahmer shit where he's just like I wonder what sound it makes as it dies I think they're prey animals to dogs too because coyotes eat a lot of rodents they're one of the reasons why we don't have rodents like real rodent problems that we could like New York City has is we have way more coyotes coyotes are everywhere and hawks a lot of birds those are those the ones killing so they're prey animals the reason why they're so prolific and they grow they grow so fast and there's so many of them is because a lot of things eat them yeah man yeah all the animals heat of wolves eat them everything that can get ahold of them eat some dogs too and dogs are from wolves so dogs see a mouse they're like I'm eating that like that that must look like a delicious cold slice of watermelon on a hot July day this Oh yeah just running across your yard when you are mouth fuck yeah yeah yeah it's a perfect orange you know those oranges were sometimes the the peel just comes right free ah it's so satisfying like very little work and then you bite into that orange is just juicy delicious that's that mouse that Mouse just running bullshit ass mouse thinks he's gonna run through my fucking yard now and eat that mouse that's the other thing that's really sad about I mean the mouse is cute like this wasn't like some dangerous looking mouse this Mouse look like it was like in act 2 of a Disney film or something like you know like this this mouse look like sweet like the mouse look like it could sing it was patton oswalt in ratatouille it was like that level of cute man oh I know and like you're just you're my heart this is like breaking cuz it's like what what do you do or that being said there's not much I could have done you know it's like this is the way nature is and to get back to your dimension thing man that not that it's like literally like a physical dimension but the reality tunnel that my poodle lives in and that Mouse lives in is so fundamentally different than our reality tunnel that the mouse is in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre the mouse is in the walking dead except it's poo it's like two Cavalier King Charles a poodle and a chihuahua so but for the mouse that's the walking dead in the mouse it's got to eat it's got to get food and ever in it so it's constantly like developed this like way that humans would develop which I think the walking dead did a good job of the comics especially of showing the way people over time would evolve to deal with zombies and how people would gradually completely like change or transform based on their predators you know like the the rats and mice have done that you know when you see a thing that is a prey animal you're seeing a reflection of the predator in the prey animal are you where what's going on with rats in New York City I can't imagine rat wars going on because the restaurants are out of business right so the restaurants closed down so all the rats food supply is gone so rats have started moving into other rats territories and killing and cannibalizing ratsy wow dude rat wars at the rats the rats didn't do anything wrong they're just being rats and also the food supply got cut off holy shit man that that is so intense and that yeah and think of that level of reality that level of reality is level of reality that's taking place in these some of those tunnels down there man that they don't even use them anymore like that there's rat infested yeah just floods of rats you have like you know decided that's their kingdom or whatever that are now being invaded that's so weird out down and also it's dark it's all smell so like the world of a rat down there it's not there's light and the subterranean depths of New York so it's like their universes there's a universe of smell and I guess maybe they could today I'm sure they do see down there but the way they see is like who knows so they're looking at whatever they're seeing is a completely different thing and then they have a complete different set of priorities you know what's that show man it's on it's a it's a really beautiful but disgusting documentary I think it's called rat yeah rats the one on Netflix like they send the weak ones to eat poison yeah yeah that just dad alone we played a video the other day of a rat setting off a mouse trap with a stick carrying a stick over to the mousetrap you're dropping it the trap goes off and it doesn't even flinch like it knows how to shut off a trap - that's what's really crazy New York City has as many rats as it has people and that's just a rough guess you know I mean I don't know what kind of fucking rat census they're taking I mean how do I know how do they know okay and what'd you get a bunch of dudes or just experts accounting shit and you go what do you think and like fuckload do you want to say there's as many rats as there are people okay watch this so he says watch this boom sets it off didn't even flinch dude play that again watch watch how he walks up to it sets it off and watch how he doesn't flinch that's a violent thing I think exploding in front of him and slamming over the ground and he a hundred percent knew it was gonna happen no that didn't even flinch the way I act when I'm getting like a coke out of machine exact just whatever this we did I do it all the time smooth them either cook drops you don't bounce back it's like thank God they that's nice they're leaving these for us now I wonder if they know that this is dangerous they'll probably figure it out yeah they they know how to set those things off that's insane well this is you know when this is one of the cool essays Terence Mckenna wrote I love that we've talked about before if we've talked about on the pot we probably talk about everything we talked about already fuckin but that isn't that one of the things he said in this beautiful crazy I say that like everything was cool until we split the atom and then that was like no they're like we can't that's too much that's where we're always in transit so when we say everything was cool until the thing about people is were always going somewhere in terms of we're always trying to make better things and we're always moving into a better place and a better thing that that there's never gonna be it was good until this all like romantic thinking like looking bad I'm sorry I don't mean he's saying it was good until we spelled out him he was saying we split the atom and the greater intelligence is that we're existing in alternate dimensions were like hey wait what the fuck oh that's what you would say it is they're like oh they're like wait wait wait wait wait no no they can't do that like if they do cuz like the like the way he put it and I'm not only paraphrasing I'm probably like miss phrasing but though is I remember the essay the ideas like that that molt that parallel timeline the multiverse right next to ours that you see that's the DMT realm that's but the DMT is just showing you one version of it but that that that is populated with spirits or aliens or whatever the name you want to give them and they are pretty much as far as we go they're just like they look at us the way we look at birds or whatever you know it's like they're there but you know maybe some of them study us or interested in sure maybe some of them like hunt us from time to time or like maybe some of them possess us or whatever but mostly it's a world that it coexist with us in a with a very limited form of interaction that is is you know subtle but in in there somehow there's some like Star Trek intentionality behind that which is like let them do their let them evolve as they're evolving let's not fuck with it but the splitting of the atom that was powerful enough that it bled over into their realm destructively and so they were like it that was the beginning of the end for us not because it meant a nuclear holocaust or whatever because they couldn't just ignore us anymore and that this is this was like you know I don't know that maybe this is where the aliens are coming or the singularity that with the thing we call the singularity is not that we technologically create a machine that produces a thing that opens up a parallel timeline or creates all moments at once but rather that's when they come here that in the way we see that because we're so limited in our understanding when I do something I'm like I'm doing this this is how I did I did it this is like in music if you write a song and you write music and you're just in the room with somebody there's some kind of laws where they get credit for it because just they were there that's a collaboration I'm musicians I don't explain this to me a long time ago but it's it's there's an intense way of quantifying collaboration and music that is a little different than in like making like other other forms of media and it's I think it's a little bit more sophisticated in its way of looking at that quantification like we took every time we finished a podcast we always have same dam whenever we talk it's like you bring like Sartre when we're did these conversations we have I'm not having them all the time you know what I mean it's like the us together and Jamie and like something about that produces a space where we're able to have these kinds of conversations and so quantifying that is like how would you even fucking quantify that but anyway what I'm saying is when certain people are around the people that are creating the music the music is better yeah that you know it but so to get back to the weirdo idea of like technology not even we're making but we're pretending we're making because we can't see the fact that technology is crystallizing in our timeframe and as part of that crystallization because it's such a such an insane visitation we have to in our brains invent a reason that it's happening and so we're making it and someone's like oh I had this idea I'm gonna work on this thing that's going to lead to a quantum computer that's gonna lead to a theme to a thing and then all of a sudden the quantum computer starts giving ideas about well why don't you try this and then and then who fucking came up with that and then you know what I mean and then and that's the glass face before the veil lifts and boom that's the singularity and that's you know in this it's not we didn't make the singularity it were a reflection of it that's just when this particular zone or note or whatever you want to call it it gets open for business so to speak well if it wanted to prepare us for abandoning life as usual this would be a good way to start it yeah yeah start it with a little pandemic luck everybody inside for a little bit complete up ending yes all that's normal yeah in terms of society yeah man I mean that's the that is the and you know I was driving over I'm like I don't want to talk about like all the different conspiracies about it with Rogen but I don't want to either what kind of conspiracies about the pandemic yeah what are the conspiracies you're hearing but other than five g 5g comet impact comet impact yeah I haven't heard that one well the comp well you're definitely not my wife cuz my I've mentioned it so many times my wife she's like Duncan please don't do you like everything they're supposed to fly by like there's a meteor that's supposed to fly by in the next my short about time yeah I mean check out reddit conspiracy my conspiracy friends I'm not even gonna attempt to give the download on it cuz like y'all have done a pretty good job of putting all the all the pieces together out there whether they're real or not I don't fucking know but I enjoy reading them late at night and and and they've been giving me terrible dreams but the asteroid theory is that okay so we want to have by we I mean they want to have maximum survivability for the planet they're not out to like they don't want people to die they're not trying to is not a bio engineered thing that's designed to like call the population which is another of the theories but rather there there was a plan which is like what's a plan if we do see a meteors going to impact the planet what's our plan do we let people know that the meteors going to impact well it depends like if an astronomer that's not connected to one of our labs or whatever sees it they're gonna let people know and then you know so that's a little different I think method of like reacting but what if we see a thing that they don't know about and there's some probability even a 20% chance the thing impacts the earth right or there's some cosmic event maybe we're not even aware of like the Sun doing some weird shit that we don't even know happens because it's so D it's like deep data right so maybe it's not an asteroid it's a cosmic event that's approaching right and so there's got to be a plan it's like well if we just tell people that the sun's gonna do like a mile blip which is going to destroy all satellites and destroy all GPS and just that alone would cause runs on the bank mass panics like in people would start looting and shit and that's not you don't want that because the idea is like we want them to hole up in their houses till the shit passes so we get maximum survivability and so the whole pandemic this is a conspiracy theory not real the whole pandemic was a plan to get people to go inside store up food get them off the roads and like wait for this whatever this event is to pass and as soon as the event passes you don't you'll find that it's good it's all of a sudden it's like what do you know the really the curves are all dropping off what do you know and then we'll all be back because the thing they were worried about didn't happen also it could be a test for for that so that can I just stop you please so dumb it's hard to believe thank you there's a real virus they can they can image it but know what it looks like they've been able to test for it antibodies talking to my real virus it's a confusing virus it's so good that I married the person I married because if not like I would probably be like digging a hole to like crawl into out of pure paranoid because she does do this to me she's like Duncan do you think there isn't a kovat virus like you think there's no virus out there do you think that like maybe like so all the scientists that if like identified kovat are all part of this thing to keep us from the meteor thing and then I'm like yeah yeah you're thank you because like I'll start getting freaked out from it but I'll answer your question like if I had to answer that I would say oh no way it's real I mean these people have died for me no what is the current Cova death count fifty thousand today this morning fifty thousand here's something that I found out that's kind of odd if you die of something else so people are still dying right they're still dying of high blood pressure strokes heart attacks still killing more people than anything right if you die of a heart attack and you have kovat you get listed as a covet death so even if you were gonna die of a heart attack I mean people are still dying right yeah same amount of people other than traffic accents which I think has diminished quite a bit as no one's driving yep but the same those people are gonna die still it's not like they live forever without the kovat right it's not like they don't get the flu it's not like they don't get a cold so it didn't all get pneumonia all these things exist with it with or without Kovac they're still people are still dying from them but if you die of one of those things and you have kovat you're it's a kovat death yeah so first it's that's why it's so crazy it's like you don't really know what how many people are actually getting this thing this kovat and having a mild reaction how many people are having no reaction how many people are dying all right what is the that's when they did that new UCLA study that came out that showed they think there's way more people that have been they think California alone is somewhere around 400,000 people infected and so the fatality rate is still pretty low but if that's the case like so what do we do we just let let people die or do we do this every time the flu comes around too now like what if we get a particularly rough flu is this a practice run for what we're gonna do every time colds come through and they start killing old people or killing sick people or fat people or what when do we mean I wouldn't want to be the person that makes the call as to when people go back to work cuz what if the second wave comes and a bunch of people die they didn't have to die right but boy have we set up a weird precedent you know it's kind of weird we've shut everything down yeah man I mean well to me the part that makes sense is always stop the spread well also with other thing is it's like and it's new yeah I mean there are coronavirus voting on what it is right so we don't have all that we have the data on the flu we have the data on the cold we know how to treat the coal we know how to treat the flu but this fucking thing we don't know what it is it is conflicting dough too yeah yeah yeah so I gotta get the like super super super intense careful approach to it and I and I think if I had to make the decision that would be the decision that I made but then also I hope you ever and thank God people like us don't make those decisions but hopefully whoever's like making these decisions is aware of the fact that like right now there's folks who are getting meals on wheels there's folks who are like on unemployment and lost their job and like I hope they're aware of the fact that like and I'm sure they are that the pressure of folks who are in this horrendous economic position the pressure on them at some point is going to exceed the humanity and compassion and empathy they're showing by not being in the demographic that's most likely to die and still staying inside losing their job you know that's love man that's deep compassion because you don't want someone's granddad to suffocate on some new fucking bat flew right that's really blood that's love and that's compatible but at some point that pressure is people are gonna be like look I don't want to kill anybody I don't want to be a carrier I don't ever want to hurt anybody but my kid is got to have food and I have to work and you know and then I think somewhere there hopefully by then there's at least a treatment they've discovered or at least we get to a point where they you know where maybe what's happening in Sweden we get enough data on that to realize that there's other ways to do it that don't involve complete lockdown yeah what they did was they they sort of left everything open but they all behaved as if there's the potential of contacting or transmitting right yeah like they didn't wear masks all right they did it doesn't look like they're wearing masks it looks like they're they didn't close everything down restaurants and pubs and is their death rate similar like well the thing I saw was like if you look at nearby countries the death rate is lower but weirdly countries that were doing complete lock downs have higher death rates than they do and you know look if you a stat that the problem is like you have this glob of data that anyone can interpret and there's probably the angles you can take on it that would show look yeah there's a higher death rate of course in Sweden because it's going to spread more if people aren't staying inside I mean that seems pretty logical to me but then also if you're showing some conflicting data where some other country in complete lockdown with a similar population or some house like ik waiting their population with Sweden's population if they're if they've got a higher death rate then that's fucking terrifying man because the implication of it is like we really don't understand what this is there's other factors too the one one big one in Sweden is not a dense population I don't think there's that many people in the entire country it's a very small place that's right like how many people live in Sweden I think I looked us up the other day I think most of the people live in small villages of like less than 200 there yeah so you know they probably don't travel that much or interact with each other that much they have plenty of space they don't travel that much I mean tight together I mean 10.23 million for the entire country by the way it's great I've been to Stockholm it was gorgeous beautiful we did a show there too they were really nice I enjoyed it very much very friendly people but you know they have a lot of space they're not New York City New York City seems to be the epicenter in the United States and for good reason everyone stacked on top of each other yeah everyone's interacting with each other on the streets on a subway moving around you got to go to places there's fucking people everywhere they're everywhere everywhere that I think is a terrible way to live dude I I fucking love New York so much when I went there is so nice but yeah it's nice to be on the west coast and especially right now Jamie was you know talking about like think of the people right now in New York who are just in that you know alone in an apartment seeing the news that apparently spreads through a like air-conditioning ducts it's like you know what I mean here yeah that that's terrifying but you know again like my opinion on it and in my old age this is it has to be my opinion on things it's like I'm gonna trust scientists I'm just going to cuz I did like I didn't go to medical school I don't understand what the fuck a virus even is like I don't remember I've been trying to remember I'm too lazy to google it how it works I know it fucks with it gets into your DNA it replaces it but the what I'm saying is I'm not suggesting some kind of surrender to authority at of absolute weakness but if a large consensus of scientists are advising some specific method of dealing with this thing let's listen to them you know and and then just make sure that it's if I feel bad for like I have a friend in Georgia right now and like right now he's become part of us an experiment a global experiment they're opening up Georgia right now in every state that opens up right now it becomes an experiment we're gonna skit a lot of data from what happens from all these states opening up right now regarding the efficacy of shutdown like we have right now and it could be that it all of a sudden we realize we overreacted and you know what I had much rather overreact and under react in situations like this you know it's like a fuck we overreacted whoops yeah we didn't we thought there was the potential to think of mutate and kill fuck tons of people way more than the flu and we were wrong and it fucked up the economy but it's a lot better than what would happen if it was some new small pox Black Plague I also looked it killed fifty thousand people right what if we did nothing would it have killed like four hundred exactly I mean that could have happened I mean it could have compounded it it seems like for whatever reason these places where people are contact are stacked on top of each other not only do they get it but they get it way worse yeah it seems like with what's that expression viral load right yeah like the viral load is greater and the IMP like if you're around a bunch of sick people like there was one awful story about this family in New Jersey and like the mother died and the oldest son died and the middle son died like three people died from one family vacation or one family dinner mmm they got together and one of them had it and just spread through the fucking house so it's not the flu you know it's obviously it's something way more intense but the people that have survived the flu that probably survived that too but the people that you know we're kind of hanging on edge it seems like anybody with a respiratory problem is in deep shit anybody who smokes is deep shit people with a high blood pressure diabetes deep shit it's not the same with everybody other people like Idris Elba walks it off you know hell yeah I know but he has asthma apparently oh really yeah he had asthma but he didn't you know there's a lot of people that I don't that Chris Cuomo guy seems fine I know he says he gets chills but he seems fine seems rattled though you know I've got I've got not a bad way yeah exactly like I said I didn't that was one at watching him was one of the things that was legitimately creeping me out as like as you're watching him and he did a great job holding it together man he didn't panic and he like put something out there that was like comforting to some degree but I could you know I was scanning his eyes and there were moments I'm like fuck he's rattled like whatever's happened in him at night is bad bad is it happening at night what is the difference you know I don't that's I don't understand that if you look fine in the day how come at night also different things all fucked up don't ask me man I don't know it's like I've known so sometimes if I get sick night is always worse than the day I don't know why hmm I don't know man but the whatever like whatever the fuck it is so to me that like the part that really sucks I got friends who are like immuno compromised man and that that means that like there's like they there they really will if they get it that's it's game over you know it's fuck it fuck it sucks and so there's that quality to it too or you're like you know statistically I don't know where I'm like statistically I think I'm I'm on the cusp you know but people we've got all of us have friends that are like dead meat if this thing were to explode so fuck it you know I get I'm not i get staying inside man i just know that like eventually you know my brother my brother was telling me every day his neighbor you know my brother works from home he's an he's in and he's a video editor everyday and a producer but every day these you know I think he's like you know he sees people are getting food deliveries because they can't from the state right you know man and that's like I don't know I'm just glad I don't have to I'm glad I don't have to be the one who makes decisions like this because that must be a weird thing to be in a position where any decision you make kills people like if you make the decision to open up people are gonna you know die because they're gonna get sick if you don't make this decision to open up there's a potential that you know just think of the mentally ill people right now no one's talking about that like I keep thinking alike the manic-depressive people the people who are already depressed who now can't go outside but are also getting blasts over the pocalypse news I don't know what suicide rates are looking like right now but like you know what I mean so it's that the the decision to keep people shut down you know is gonna what might result from that those deaths might be secondary or tertiary or some shit but still it's like there it just sucks to have to be in a position where you have to make those decisions and it's like how awful to know it's just it's like brutal I feel terrible for them you know anyone who's like because I don't you know I don't know what they're gonna do either I mean they're gonna have to eventually assume the position that we're gonna have to slowly open up and and start you know restaurants and half capacity and shit like that yeah but when you know I mean they've said May 15th here that seems like an awful long time I know it's an awful long time to ask people to keep it together don't have any money it's an awful long time it's an awful awful long time doesn't seem like the best idea either it seems like the best idea would be to quarantine all the people that are very vulnerable to make sure that they quarantine and make sure that people who know them are aware you know do not you know touch them or touch anything around them if you could have potentially been in contact with something because there are immunocompromised well it seems like the move to move seems like to quarantine the people at this point at least the self quarantine or you know tell them to quarantine people that are really vulnerable older people people with you know people that smoke people with respiratory conditions be aware that you're vulnerable you know and and then you act accordingly but everybody else we need to at some point in time whether it's this week or next week or three weeks from now when they think it is May 15th right that's like three weeks from now they're gonna have to open the doors and when they open the doors people are gonna be starving they're gonna be starving yeah you know they haven't worked there's so many people that are so behind their debts they're getting you know debt collectors are still wanting their money yeah especially if they had loans or you know anything that was outstanding before all this happened they're already in debt trying to work their way out of a hole and they can't even work the same time we've ever been in a position where people can't even go to work yeah what do you okay so that I've heard like three ideas regarding what to do one of them is like incredibly controversial I wonder what you think about it which is like using the same data that they use in like what's it called this South Korea yeah no the chips you can put on yeah it's bluetooth so it's essentially like tracking and alerting you if you've come in contact with someone who has it what do you think about that I don't trust anyone to have all that data and only use it for that right there's no way that data would be so valuable if everyone had a chip and everyone was tracked knew where everyone was all throughout the day oh you're only gonna use that to see who's got coronavirus really yeah the fuck out of here once that technology exists it's not like they're gonna murder it at the end of the fucking season well we've got no more coping so let's just stop all this technology no chance they'll find a new reason to use it okay they'll be able to track the flu they'll be able to track adulterers they'll be able to track but robbers they'll be able to track carjackers they'll be able to track you name it man you name it these are the right-wing activists they'd like to yell at abortion clinics let's track them right you know now now Republican gets in office hey this is these are the people that are the fucking animal rights activists I was getting for the meat plant let's track them right like you can't track people okay and they're already doing it anyway you talk to Snowden they're already tracking you by your goddamn phone but I like the fact that I could take this phone and chuck it in the fucking River I could just chuck it I wouldn't throw it in the ocean no I wouldn't even do that I really feel strongly about that I would never leave her like that but the point is I can get rid of that fucking phone yeah it's not a part of my body once they're injecting I've talked about this week too many podcasts in a row but there's a company that had these people inject a microchip in their arm and they could wave it in front of a soda machine and get fucking snacks with it and shit it was like your your tab was on your arm you can Oh Mike's here open the door and unlocks the door get the fuck out of here and we were saying like what if that company fires you you would have Tripoli fires you got that chipotle chip in your arm I was management it's not a regular chipotle chip and now you have to work for fucking seven up and seven ups like we're gonna have to cut your arm off yeah cuz he keeps registering that you're a Chipotle invader you know you tend chips in your arm because you worked at right just kept getting new jobs you get new chips Mike why don't you get those chips removed I like them to remind me I've had a hard life and a lot of good jobs chips I've told ya it's a way I've always been always been a hard worker Oh earn these chips earned all these trips every single one of these chips means you know also when you combine those chips with augmented reality so that you could have a visual floating around them it's like the mascot of the various companies they work for or like you know like let's say we do get the chip right the chip exists and we all just somehow decide like yeah let's just do it I mean fuck the whole Book of Revelations that's just the old bullshit though mark of the beast I painted let's get the chip that was just some old ancient bullshit all right come on I want it I want to get sodas without having to pull up my fucking wallet yeah it sucks I'm sick of it I'm exhausted all day from this activity but we all get the chips and then what happens is you and of course it would start off with like a decision to make like you're like what what data and the chip do you want people to be able to see with a augmented reality and so like this is where you run into what I think the future is going to look like with this shit is it's like it's like when you're walking around in your company and your employee of the month and everybody's wearing augmented reality goggles you're gonna have some kind of Employee of the Month halo around you so everybody's aware that you made the most sales yeah it's in and it's gonna be like that for like you know it's gonna be brutal as far as let's say credit scores go right because if you've got a great credit score and you want to indicate to the world that if you want to get into debt you can baby cuz you've got a great credit score you're gonna have this glowing shit around you me and like and in the moment one person decides to reveal that everybody's gonna feel like they have to reveal it and if you see someone who doesn't have like the good credit score or crown or whatever like the banner of great credit floating in front of them you know like yeah you're probably right like you made some bad decisions you'll see someone who's got a lot of shit nice car really nice clothes but you'll be like yeah but you know he doesn't he doesn't have a glowing medallion of good credit on his AR self mmm I don't know if he really owns any of that stuff you know and and and you know I mean then it's gonna like there's gonna be all forms of that which leads to like you know like venereal disease like you could go into a bar and if you just tested and you're clean so to speak then maybe there's like a little AR like clean angel that like flies around your head that kind of those bits of data that that you that if you don't show them there's some reason to be suspicious yeah you know what I mean yeah you walk up to someone they have no data they're just blank you'd be terrified yeah you're just a person I'm just supposed to trust you yeah not to pass a serial killer fuck that we're gonna look back on times when we just would meet people like this and not have some halo to go by yeah like if I see Jamie Jamie we'd have like a nice golden glow I blew at him he's got a high approval rating yeah got some cash yeah that's a good catch yeah there you go if you go to a nightclub all the dudes who are glowing gold yeah people be like oh and girls like purple credit score's they'd come in try to get close to the guys and the gold try to get a little that gold clean up that credit yeah yeah manage if you knew like if a girl was really hobby you look at her credit card oh my god bank fraud look at her she's a bank fraud er yeah like that you don't get that gray outline unless you do bank fraud that's right yeah and there's no way to get it off it's like imagine yeah that and not you know there's gonna be big arguments about that where it's like you know currently if you're a registered sex offender we know where you fucking live and I get it man like that's good that's good but then it's going to be like okay but do we put that in there augmented reality chip profile so that when anywhere they go people are seeing that this is a person you that hurts kids you know and there's gonna be a conversation about that we're feeling like fuck yeah that's what you do like I want to know if some like weirdo is like getting anywhere close to my kid right fuck yeah you let it in anyway that's a slippery slope that leads to the dystopian like you know black mirror future in that great episode where like there was like you know and I think they are doing it in China they're doing in China yeah religious social score in China this is a real concern if this technology does get released in time and people start using their kovat tests and putting it on their cue coat QR code that little thing that you do with the photo it scans you like a plane ticket yeah like all your good Duncan seems like you're good make sure you keep that phone on you everywhere you go no problem officer you know Duncan we got a email the other day it shows that you have been going I don't know who has this data but you've been going down to San Clemente during the lockdown yeah to stay with friends now there's a glory hole there that I like this is not allowed what you're traveling like see see look what if we do this what if we go into this scanning thing and then a new pandemic pops up and we go into lockdown again they're gonna be able to find the people that aren't locking down what if you got a drive somewhere in the middle of the night to go get something having important for your family yeah well awesome you're being tracked and they then they call you doctor where you going yeah we go we are we are looking at you right now you're in San Clemente you don't live in San Clemente why are you down there yeah but I you know I'm just freedom want to drive around I don't know this is a lockdown yeah there's a new flu go back home Duncan you want to kill people it's a weird it's a weird power to give people the power to have a mayor tell you what you can do that's never happened before I'm not saying they're doing it because of that I know why they're doing it they're doing the save lives I'm a hundred percent for it I'm not don't get me wrong here but still that power that anybody has to say you can't work you got to stay home you can't go to the park you can't go to the beach that powers weird that's a lot of power man yeah you know to be the person Gavin may we open not yet yeah yeah not yet but what if they social distance and they need to make money yeah we need to save life yeah it sucks yeah it's there's no good answer it's a shit job man inside the shittiest that's the shittiest job cuz it's like you you you know decision you make is gonna make everybody happy any decision you make is gonna ruin someone's life maybe kill him and so yeah all these people and so no one thought that was gonna be a part of the job right yeah you didn't think that you thought you're gonna deal with like yeah Gavin wasn't like he didn't know that when he like got in there he was suddenly gonna be like potentially like one of the war leaders in Mad Max he didn't understand that was gonna be his world dude this is how poorly they thought this through Garcetti has given people money to snitch they're giving people money to snitch on social distance violators what'd ya say if you go over your buddy Mike's house for a barbecue there's eight people in that backyard - Helen look fuckin people we're over here social distancing that cunt Duncan Trussell is over at Mike's house barbecuing drinking beers probably wife swapping pigs Garcetti comes along and offers people money to rat you out how much they get it can't be real they're offering Bieber rewards why is to rat out social distance violators disgusting yeah how how you don't know that leads to Maoist China and fucking Stalinist Russia how you don't know that getting people to rat on people leads to North Korea I'm not saying we're gonna be in North Korea but that that kind of shit that's where that comes from how it starts you can't pay people to rat people out yeah fucking asshole what a shitty poorly thought-out idea that is no shit man are there like any Foreman I saw something popped up on my Instagram some company saying if you're aware that your bosses are violating like software like I don't have licensed software you know we'll give you a reward in finding people it like disgruntled employees you know that their boss is running like stolen Photoshop or whatever to like make a little money and fuck their boss over and it's like that invitation to snitch that is a satanic invitation man that is like I don't care what level it's at like in general unless you're looking at like hardcore Snowden level whistleblower like you've been down into deep underground military bases and you saw the fucking thing in the egg they could read your mind get that but like any the the other versions of it yeah fuck that don't invite us to snitch don't encourage that behavior there's better ways to do it I'm sure then like bounties on your fucking neighbors that's fucked so fucked up it's so fucked up that someone who would get as high as mayor of Los Angeles would let an idea like that slip through the cracks well like what fucking fascist do you have working in that office that Blake I got an idea pay people to rat people out yeah these fucks they haven't been working you need money for masks yeah that's it was it he did say snitches get rewards but he said it's the opposite of snitches get stitches you know I can't follow you know they'll definitely get stitches I can't find anything saying like they get 50 bucks hundred bucks this is the reward you get he might be the opposite of snitches get stitches as if they're not still snitches and as if snitches don't still get stitches right what are you talking about you're gonna you're gonna absolutely make sure that these people don't get beat up for being snitches you're gonna step in with cops give them 24-hour security guards if you're you find out your neighbor ratted you out for money oh my god you'd want to kill him it would be like what happened to that dude what's-his-face um Ron Paul's kid you know I'm talking about now the the congressman who got tackled that's forehand Rand Paul yeah Rand Paul his neighbor was like fuck yeah I don't know where tackles him smashes his ribs he lost a piece of his lung yeah man that's fucked up it's like cuz you're what you're asking for there which is another thing that I think this state anytime anyone starts doing this then you really have to start thinking about who you voted for but like because the idea is like I love it when you know and I'm cheesy and I am a fucking hippie and I get accused of stoner talking shit but yeah I want there to be world peace and I want people to love each other and when I see you know any even the slightest thing that like transcends political divides we're like you know people who have hated fucking Trump and people Trump if hated I saw something where like I can't remember who it was like god what's the name of the Mormon politician that was running for president against Romney Romney yes so some dude like voted against releasing money to people who don't have jobs and Mitt Romney tweeted well that Senator whoever he was tested positive for being an asshole and Mitt Romney said that and fucking you know been like there was just like a moment where Trump retweets out her says I'll think about it and says like I didn't know he had that sense of humor but I liked it and like for that one stupid moment there's a second where it's like that's we're supposed to be on the same team right and in in like you know that's not a political statement that's like a statement of survivability and when you have a fucking when you have a and again I'm not saying bow down to the state or anything like that either that's an opposite I'm saying I'm not saying therefore we're all gonna I'm not saying any of that shit man so don't take this the wrong way because I know what I'm saying I guess what I'm saying is when anything that divides one neighbor from the next anything that invites neighbors to divide instead of unites is cancerous literally for society in the sense that what's going to start happening is that the the pixel of society is that the neighbors that's like the connection between your neighbors makes up the tapestry of the entire country in that connection if it's broken or weird or fucked up then that's that's fucking everything up and and so to invite that invite anything that fucks that up is to me really really long-term disasterous it's like the idea would be like hey does your knit is your neighbor an old person go find out if your neighbor is an old person and can't get food and if they are and you get food to them will pay for it right how about that yes that's beautiful like you you know someone who's like fucked up right now let us know so we can make sure they're not there kids aren't starving right are there any do you know it like man what about the fucking kids whose parents are right now super fucking sick with this shit like what we need governors and we need people saying like you need to know where the kids are in the building so that inmate whose parents are sick so we can make sure those kids are getting taken care of all their parents are in bed and shit like so fuck that I thought that is what people get rewards for that why don't we have a way of monetizing kindness in an acts of like grace to your neighbors instead of monetizing like you becoming like literally what is one a universally derided thing which is a snitch you don't want to be a snitch fuck snitches get stitches no maybe they don't get stitches but man I'll tell you when you die wouldn't want to be you wouldn't want to be a snitch in the afterlife I'll tell you that man you get devoured by spirit Wolf's like I bet just a spirit Wolf's I'm sure you don't get the like experience of like you know going through the bar seeing your mom come running to you like a bowl of soup it's your mom she comes running to you and you think it's a bowl of soup but you look in it it's your wife's head and then you look back up it's a spirit wolf it's like so you thought it was smart to snitch and not to mention huh no no it's your soul forever yeah maybe just don't snitch that's fucked up I mean well it's just ridiculous that someone in a position of real leadership right you're the mayor of a huge city and you would think that that would be a good idea let's listen people are gonna snitch on people anyway to encourage them with financial reward is crazy it is crazy and it's so poorly thought-out yeah that's a dumb idea to put out there such a poor understanding of human nature yeah like you don't know where this goes yeah like in it also in a time of great duress you're encouraging people to snitch yeah this is absolutely the time we've got to be encouraging camaraderie yeah this is when things are weird everybody's forced into the same position no one can do what they want most time you were onstage I haven't been on stage in a month I've been doing private shows for my son with literally our job that has stopped and our job might not come back until January yeah that's right may-maybe who knows who knows we don't know I've got some gigs booked and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do them I got a gig booked in September I got to to in September yeah a couple in October I got October's but it's like also it's not like you should be from like you can't really promote the show right now that's seeming like a blazing dick I don't want to encourage people to go out and it's like yeah that's the problem man is we you know we're but here's the thing this whatever the state is doing the state's gonna do this is my favorite Jesus saying offer unto Caesar what is Caesar's which is like you know there's a game going on here with power and if you think you're gonna subvert that game maybe probably not best thing to do let the dragon do whatever the fuck the dragons gonna do but don't let them cause you to forget that you don't need the state to like go over to like leave a note on your neighbor's door asking if they're okay right you know what I mean you don't need we don't need the mechanisms of some bureaucracy to do good like to pick up trash you know like that was the thing that happened when the fucking national parks all got defunded because of this bullshit all of a sudden like there's people are taking pictures of garbage or in the national parks right and and the implication of that is like we can't clean this up ourselves we need a state official to come and pick the trash up and it's like it's nice that they do that and we pay taxes for that and they should do that but if they're not doing it and we're waiting for some hero from the state to come in and fix our fucking problems that's lazy that's bad it's like I think as a people the idea is more to like transcend that addiction to being saved that addiction that for sure someone's coming sometimes they come right but sometimes they don't and and that's no reason to like put off just the basic shit man like you know we we put out and sometimes in front of our house we'll just put out shit to give to people you know we've got fruit trees there's fruit you know there's like the gardens got like some shit growing in it I'll put it out there you know and and people take every bit of it you come back at the end of the day it's you know we've got flowers so cut some flowers and just leave flowers out there in case it wants to bring a flower to somebody it's an act of trust cuz you don't know what I might be covered in like kovat mucus doing like but that being said I don't know maybe they're DS sanitizing but my point is like cool shit happens sometimes you go out to that box and like they've replaced something like we gave flowers away we came out and someone to put different kinds of flowers in the box for those flowers you know what I mean a stalker yeah actually now I think about it the flowers you know it did seem like there was some something like sticky and creamy on the flowers this but you know I'm saying like again this this to me this the not getting too much in the macro cuz I'll go insane if I get in the macro getting into the micro which is your direct literally your direct neighbors and like making some connection with them you know like might the guy who lives across the street we talked for like two minutes it was wonderful and he's like if you need tools just let me know I got a ton of tools just you can like you know message me and I'll come and leave them here and you can come and get them shit like that that's nice it's cool and it's like it's just beautiful it's like that's what it's supposed to be like yeah that's nice you're that neighbor that's it yeah have a good neighbors is everything everything I hate their neighbors like man you should just move save yourself some agony yeah well you can't sometimes that's the problem we all need we talked with us before we need to find a cul-de-sac houses there you mean the cult yes I know what do you think a ranch would do the trick tough to get people to live on a ranch no I think you're talking about I know you're tired yeah it's not that hard wait I you know I think the way you do it is in phases right so like the first thing would be just get to land right right and then hire an architect yeah hire an architect and then like you know bring it up screw that thing they did in upstate New York beautiful have you been there personally I've been there in there I haven't unfortunately haven't been there since its its completion I don't know if it's completed but I've been there in the early phases and yeah that for sure is a temple like it's no joke it's not like they're just saying it's a temple that's a real and the way he printed those weird faces those and multi feature faces and use them in the corners of the building yes what does he call it again I can't remember I'm sorry azam azam i thought you meant what he called those faces he has a names name for the faces - is that the chapel of sacred mirrors oh it stands for but isn't that a Kazem is was used to be what he called the place in New York City right he had the place of Manhattan yeah they had this I think they still well they still do a beautiful place in New York actually or like a an artist loft there I believe but like they ended up realizing it was time to like brother we build a temple yeah and then really go somewhere in nature yeah they're in like a small New York town right yeah that's another state town yeah it's a beautiful place in there legit religion and Theon that's right and they're an actual religion which they are as a religion and by the way our religion is one anything from you like they're not I'm not trying to get 10% of your money and then giving you a bunch of rules to follow now they want you to lurch worship love and creativity it's a really interesting place is that oh that's that's just an image of what it's going to look like I don't think it's really quite there yet but holy shit yeah imagine coming up to that like walking up to their front door you know like oh my what the hell am I looking at dude when I was on tour they let me park my tour bus there coz we needed a place to sleep for the night so I had to sleep from front of that thing in my tour bus and I hadn't even gotten to that face but I had crazy dreams just sleeping there yeah it was wild man that's probably like one of those if you build it they will come things like you imagine how hard you would trip inside that place do you know I'm saying yeah no I don't think it's I don't think it's a like you could do DMT in a shitty apartment and still have some crazy mind-blowing trip but you can't tell me that coming to this place and going through this in Theon portal yeah this isn't gonna have some fucking crazy effect on the way you trip yeah oh my god but you know that was the idea of a temple I mean the idea is and not I'm not just saying to trip or whatever but the concept is like you know let's acknowledge the fact that maybe our ideas aren't necessarily coming from inside our brains let's just as a fantasy imagine that there is a divine intelligence that as one of the many beautiful things it pushes into this particular realm is art and that if we can figure out a way to purify the connection with that thing then we become receivers for that and by doing that we allow that thing to begin to exist in this world and a temple was a place that allowed that connection to be refined purified intention alized and in that there's a solidification called inspiration or art or whatever the name is you want to give it but it's really it's like output from a place that maybe is that you know a flute a few floors up from the one where it's having a pretty wonderful party right now and like part of what we do is like allow it to drip into this realm which is potentially dense earth realm we're in the realm of matter it's dense you know and like ideas if you look at your ideas they're they're light they're like there they're there they don't have a look at least my ideas like they're they're not like heavy their inspiration feels like barely anything in fact it's so barely anything think how easy it is to miss a good idea how easy it is to think something cool they maybe you want to write down for a joke and you're just I'll write that down later and it's gone it's light it's light and so in part of what they're I think are all about or I mean again that's me putting it on them they have a wonderful description on their website about what they're all about but to me part of me what creation is is taking those things allowing them to come through you and then allowing this realm to do what it does which is to crystallize them in a denser form that other people can enjoy and you know that um that enjoyment is a you know that's enough it doesn't have to be some lofty ass shit it's just like people get a little like this tiny little smell of heaven a like a better place a lighter place a place isn't encumbered by so much bullshit is this particular realm that can like completely take someone out of a depression man that can completely give somebody the you know juice they need to like get back out there and like open up themselves to the world and not be shut down just one little like tiny tiny minuscule reminder of like don't worry there's this isn't the only place there's simultaneously amazing things happen happening which you're part of you just don't realize it yet and don't worry you know McKenna he said in one of his essays that's what he'd say on mushrooms is he would get this message don't worry we're coming don't worry we're coming and you know what I mean but I think that's what art does is it gives you this sense of like don't worry right now we're just building the wrong way don't worry it's coming I know this that place seems fucked up it's a little denser right now we're gonna lighten it up and then that how much of that is your own imagination though like how much of your own imagination stimulates your trips mmm you know I mean we want to assume that we're really interacting with something right on the other side but why why do we assume that that's something obviously it's not static one of the things about tryptamine experiences is that things twist and change and morph and shift and never they never stay any one thing for any length of time they're always becoming other things and moving in and out of things like maybe that's just what happens over there maybe this things are constantly shifting and changing you know maybe what we're doing is we're trying to apply when we think of how we are here in this this life we're trying to apply those laws to whatever we experience when we when we do that but it seems so alien when you have those experiences it seems so you're not gonna be able to bring any of that back you can give someone like little glimpses yeah and what Alex has done the best is capture like oh I know what he's doing like those faces it was like almost Egyptian looking golden faces moving in apart from each other like you go oh yeah I've seen something yeah something sort oh yeah there's a trip to mean part to that yeah but that whatever that would it be in that dimension it would change and become something else and instantaneously and then become something else and then and a lot of it has to do with how you're thinking which is weird it's like art is the way you are thinking actually affecting those things or is the way you're thinking affecting your perception of whatever this energy and how it manifests itself visually well I mean this is that or even in what you're saying there's this assumption that your thinking is separate from the thing right in and so it so we have a thought and what we're thinking to ourselves oh I just got a good idea we don't know that if we had a different way of quantifying time and space we might have just seen some ethereal mist drift through us that produced a thing we caught a thought that we thought must be us so you look at a thing in that realm and it's shifting and converting and and you notice that that conversion seems to be happening in relation to like how you're feeling and you know you're in a chicken or the egg conversation which is like who's you know who's reflecting who here like who which of us is like gril in which of us isn't in our we just kind of there am I just seeing who I actually am but because I live in a world of individuality and I live in a world where there's a separate quality to things I see I have to see you as separate because if I don't I can't see you you know all I can do you know I'm seeing myself in you which is I think what they're what is happening in this realm anyway it's like one more anything you're looking at right now is some phenomena being painted instantaneously by your imagination with all it look that's what the imagination is doing it's painting colors onto the universe of infinite phenomena that your your brain is like doing out of habit so that's that's that you know anything that anyone you're around you make an instantaneous assessment of that person or you you begin to like realize like wait I I got a bad vibe about that person I bet something's off of them and then you go into like your TV psychic bullshit like oh yeah really oh really is that your was that the instincts you learned where did you learn that World War Chris treat yeah you don't know but I've done that I'm by the way I'm talking about myself I'm like yeah I just can tell if a person is honest or it's like you can definitely tell if a person's really fucking weird though that's for sure you could tell if a person's off like they're not really connecting with you or they are tending to connect with you and you're like well I got a weird vibe from this yeah meanwhile have you looked at what he said on paper what you said on paper would be totally normal that's true there's sometimes there's certain things of a violation of space there's a weirdness to the way they look at you occasions yeah like oh you're off I hate that feeling man - that's a deeper thing when no alarm bells go off like that your hair starts standing up mewling I fucking hate that that's scary but you know I'm just saying sometimes you're not right and this is like why you need empiricism in science because sometimes you're not right like just because you think that's how shit is from some instinct inside of you doesn't mean that's how things is your bias and and so that that's the projection that's like the that's the part of you that you're like you're still dealing with some trauma for you're a kid and you're seeing that trauma in all the things around you and so you're like in an argument with someone who hurt you 20 years ago when you're talking to somebody who vaguely reminds you of that person and if you're right we like we're still having an argument and if you're not aware that you're still having that argument then you can start saying shit like why do I always end up with the same person yeah it's like and I always draw this kind of person to me and it's like well maybe you're drawing the exact same kind of person to you or maybe you're running the same movie on a different screen and being like I've seen this before I keep seeing this movie you know it's like that's the same movie it's like you're seeing the same thing you're projecting it's just it looks at like it now it's not Tom it's Alex or now it's not Lisa you're looking at Samantha but you're still seeing this thing and that that's the projection so anyway that's the imagination and the question is how powerful is that projection because sometimes you start projecting onto someone how you think they are and if that person's weak or insecure they'll start acting the way you think they are now you've your projection is sprung to life in front of you because the person you've essentially animated a person with your expectation of them and then because that person is acting the way you thought they would act because they don't know the fuck they are you're making monsters with your imagination well that's what cult leaders do right that's how you start a sex cult Wow same way you gotta take these people and like put it in their head that this is what they do you put it in their head right yeah that's right you say you see it yes I see it in you well in this book I told you about this book chaos Tom O'Neill's book on Manson and the CIA yeah I saw your tweet about it oh my god dude what is oh my god oh my god almost definitely a part of these fucking psychedelics LSD experiments that they were doing on hippies almost definitely experimented hit on him probably in prison but almost definitely allowed him to get out of when he violated his parole let him loose let him free supply him with acid yeah monitor him they were they were monitoring him every step of the way they like fed that monster they knew that this guy incarcerated half his life he was a conman and they taught him how to be a cult leader they taught him how to be a cult leader and they probably talked him into or taught him how to talk people into killing people and to do so with acid and they would dose him up and he would make people do all kinds of shit like it would take people like okay you're gonna fuck her and he's gonna fuck him and they would put they would put together these orgies he would put together orgies I mean he was sodomized sounds like in front of in front of them like horrific shocked out yeah yeah he was a like some boy that was like 15 years old he did crazy crazy shit they were all on acid they all committed murder he directed them to commit murder but all of this very connected to the CIA's MKULTRA project all of it yeah very connected to multiple different in multiple different ways connected to LSD and hippies LSD and mind-control lxd trying to come up with a Manchurian Candidate trying to get someone to commit murder and not even realize they did it also connected to Lee Harvey Oswald because Jack Ruby was all fucked up on that program when he killed Lee Harvey Oswald and afterwards went completely insane was seen by the very same doctor that was running the clinic where Manson used to go this guy was a CIA doctor was a psychologist or psychiatrist dosing people up with LSD running studies on prisoners getting students to run studies getting scientists to run Chinese not even knowing they were doing it through the CIA Kaczynski Terry don't forget yeah because in ski how about operation midnight climax ran brothels in San Francisco in a couple other places with a dose people up with acid and watch them fuck dare they name it that I know midnight climax that's so dumb it sounds like you know it sounds like that sounds like the name of like porn in a hotel that you go watch yes like a secret agent that sucks everyone's dead max whoever named that really tells you a lot about the program but like you know man the here's a controversial fucking thing to say which someone reminded me of a while ago which really freaked me out kinda which is like back then when like their what like right now we know a little bit more about some of the shit the CIA did a lot of it because they put it on their website yes which is so crazy to me they just put it up on their website which is crazy and it but back me what stuff they put up on their website dude are you fucking kidding like all the shit about the remote viewing experiments they did like it's they just I interviewed that main guy that they had for remote viewing we have fucking famous guy there's one famous guy that I interviewed he's like famous in the remote viewing world I got an airtight the guy wrote the movie or didn't write it but the documentary Man of Steel shot the see the guy talked about a kill shot or that's the what the name for the thing that happens when the Sun fuck's up I didn't fuck up I mean I might have said the Sun fucked up but for us it fucked up does like a not a supernova but just does a big-ass flare that like kind of like melts whatever side of the earth I was facing it you know that's like the kill shot that a lot of these remote viewers were apparently saying that they were seeing because they were realizing that they could actually they weren't sort of bound by time and these visions and they all started sharing this vision and this thing it's really a creepy creepy documentary out there man but yeah that's a hundred percent on the table like some giant solar flare some solar incident that's 100 percent on the table hey if we by the way I'm sorry if we talked about this last episode if we talked about the CIA's website yet what about their website have you ever gone through it no Jamie would you mind pulling that up I've applied for a job you apply for a job at the CIA well I want to I was stoned it was late at night and I'm like wait you can apply online check it ask Molly there's a cartoon yeah hold on back up this is ask Molly your CIA source on the inside and it's hashtag ask Molly Hale and Molly Hale is like a hot agent this week's ask Molly mail question comes from a writer who wants to know if there's a path forward for them at CIA since they have done illegal drugs in the past they took my question that's your question now I'm just kidding it seems like it's your question since they have done illegal drugs in the past let's see what Molly's answer is let's see Molly's answer so it says find Molly's answer what does Molly say let me be clear on this from the get-go having previously used illegal drugs does not immediately disqualify you from working at CIA if working for CIA is your life's goal and we certainly hope it is there could be up half of you here with that said there's certain there are certain restrictions you should be aware of especially if you've used illegal drugs within the past year generally speaking to be eligible for CIA employment applicants must not have used illegal drugs within the past 12 months damn shit this is as with most things a general rule by which to gauge your higher ability address on the word kids only an applicant but not only an applicant but as the potential holder of a security clearance it might seem a bit archaic but consider the access to information we're giving at CIA employees and consequences of granting access to the wrong person how much access to information just read that real quick it might seem a bit archaic but consider the access to information we're giving it giving CIA employees what access are you giving them you're in a simulator that's probably the first thing they say if you get hired there like it's a simulator we're just doing like what the programmer wants it's like I know you're gonna freak out for two months we're gonna give you like a protocol if haneda presents because you can go nihilistic or absurdist when you realize you're just a string of code that's running but you'll get over it and then there's an egg you ingo the thing reads your mind it's kind of cool show you that later officers regularly handle classified information which if leaked could spell disaster for national security and endanger the life of CIA officers is my favorite word assets and their family assets is one of my favorite words they use we have an asset in Jerusalem an asset you have an asset yes it a person you know a guy yeah he's an asset he's yeah ass yeah he's uh oh I got a number like what's an asset an asset is like docks you had an asset you got I got stock in Palestinians I got some Palestinians and I've saved up yeah got some assets just some people you connected with I connect with them they're my assets yeah you now you may be wondering that's all fine Molly but I live in a state where marijuana use was legalized under state law so why would any of this really apply in my case the short answer is or would any of this really apply in my case the short answer is yes marijuana remains illegal under federal law in every state the CIA is bound by federal law which prohibits CIA from granting security clearances to unlawful users of controlled substances including marijuana state laws do not supersede those of the federal government the great Lord who looks over the land with an iron fist for more information regarding the federal government security clearance guidelines regarding drug use and other considerations you can check out the what if the next line was like hey what's up Joe that's cool you're showing this on your podcast simulation but I do think like in there is they're also kind of saying like that being said if you can set shit on fire with your mind or something when you're stoned come talk to us it's like you know what I mean there are saying like the other cool thing when you look at him applying for a job is it says after you apply don't tell anybody you apply for the job well like approach you regarding the job which is so fucking cool you can't talk about it when you apply with meanwhile they're absolutely checking your phone they're checking your I I applied and like I just leaned into the fact that like fuck it they're gonna look at everything I do and then also like imagining this some point some CIA agent might come up to me like hey what's up man hey what's going on did you really want to be a bookkeeper at the Pentagon no I wanted to meet a CIA agent dude hello because I mean you know wouldn't you wouldn't you like to me well I'm not no one you know a CIA age I've had him on the podcast multiple times Mike Baker he does a lot of consulting for TV shows and security stuff so yeah you you are in it and is he working for them now no well how would he yeah he's a former CIA operative what does that mean do you really think they ever stopped talking to each other no no he does security clearance stuff and security studies got it has a security company did he do so so wait so this guy did you ask him about the Manson shit no I just round found out about this shit really recently Simmons told me about this guy Tom O'Neill was his neighbor for like 20 years he was neighbors with Greg and Greg the the whole time he was doing this book while Greg was friends with him right took him 20 years to write this book started out as an article for premier magazine and then as you started uncovering all these inconsistencies with the trial he realized that there was kind of a bullshit trial and that the prosecuting attorney like everybody had there was there was deals that everybody had made to have a specific narrative go through and Susan Atkins one of the one of the people from the Manson family was on trial her her fucking defense attorney was like a former prosecuting attorney that had worked with Vincent Bugliosi and all these other people before they were all buddies and they signed him to her to take over for her state appointed attorney this guy took over and like just they just they followed directions like everybody follow directions and as he was going deeper and deeper into this story he realized like there was a lot of crazy shit that was going on that first of all Manson for sure was let out of jail multiple times when he shouldn't have been when he was violating parole he was let out of jail repeatedly for crazy shit like theft and you know and they they were monitoring these people they knew where they were staying they knew the ranch the spawn ranch where they were staying at they never did anything right they let them they let them go whenever they were in trouble uh and most likely got him the fucking LSD have you looked up the finders call yeah was that one I mean when I seen you brighter out I'm not even doing a good job with this dead last subscriptions I didn't think I was going to talk about it but this thing blew my mind like you got to listen to this audio book listen to the article or just even maybe just listen to some of the podcast and you'll get sucked in this guy was obsessed with this for 20 years it's all heath it thought of that's all he did it was his his life's work do you let do you okay you had a CIA agent you had on he's cool right who seems a good guy is he your friend I like the guy so in in you know what's so bizarre and like I don't even say it I think it's like because you say it then people see you saying I see you know in the CIA but something ripped out you know I was bitching to Rick Doblin about on a podcast and I was like doing this thing I used to do I was younger which is like trying to create a all evil all good binary or guarding people who work like in the CIA or people who work in even the DEA or whatever that thing you do when you're like when you're when you're being lazy and your way of thinking right in binary and in Doblin one of the things he said to me that I've always kept with me is he's like yeah there's there's people like us like all the way to the top you know there's people who like looking drug laws right now and two people from the CIA listeners podcast right yeah I know I know of that right so it's like I'm in the eye yes in this podcast that's what I'm saying man is like the thing that the thing that's somewhat annoying in the sense that it requires nuance rather than like a heavy-handed they're all evil is some of the people in there are really like 100 percent trying to keep at least people here from getting blown the fuck up yes and that that and like they're not like like God like we let's find another man and now you know exactly but oh you know I went and got this tour of actually JPL the place Parsons was that man and like I think it was BP or shell or some like oil company I had like just generally we all look at the oil companies and think they're all the worst well you know while you're driving in your car you'll be like these fuckin oil companies but like the they were working on some kind of new solar panel technology was like shell or I don't remember what fucking company was I remember saying to the guy like this technology if it works doesn't this destroy the oil industry like don't they know they're working on a technology that's gonna make the thing they make money selling and buying or irrelevant and he's like oh these companies are so big that there's departments within departments within departments and that's where it gets fucking crazy about the CIA which is like they the people in the CIA don't know obviously all the people in the CIA exactly that's your security clearance and the question is how deep is that basement go man under the CIA but here's also the question yeah how are you gonna find out what happens when people take LSD without giving people LSD and studying them ready go you're not so if you're in 1953 okay and you're finding out about LSD and people are taking LSD at parties and people are taking LSD at concerts and you start realizing the ramifications of a society in 1974 that's all taking LSD you see this hippie movement you're gonna run some studies so then you're gonna give people the ability to test people without their knowledge you don't know how crazy that guy is what kind of a sociopath that guy is and he's gonna run tests on people doubt their knowledge and give them LSD and then there's gonna be people that say hey you know we want to infiltrate all these anti-war groups we want to infiltrate the Black Panthers we want to infiltrate these hippies yeah how can we do that well here's how we do that we take this guy we got him in prison for half of his fucking life in federal prison so far he's 32 years old yeah let's dose this motherfucker up with LSD let's run some Studies on him and let's tell him that he's a cult leader and get him to make some apocalyptic fucking death cult that wants to kill people and write big on the wall in their blood and so they let Manson that they knew where he was they knew he was getting acid they knew that he was probably having people kill people yeah well okay first of all to go back man if you really study the spread of LSD in a popular culture it wasn't that the CIA saw people taking LSD at parties it's the CIA as I understand the story goes and buys from Sandoz laboratories all of their LSD and then begins to do tests on college campuses where people begin to take the LSD and then the party start so it's I think it's more like the CIA start at the party when it comes to LSD or at least were majorly involved in the initial experience people had with LSD which was like that's when that's when you get Tim Leary that's when you get Richard Alpert you know Ramdas that's they were both like hanging out at Harvard where the same psychology professor did this shit on Kaczynski was and like LSD that you know that's they were doing I don't know if they were doing the LSD test there but these tests were going on they were being exposed to LSD that theoretically I don't know if it came from the CIA or not but I don't know like where the I think they actually those tests were they were ordering it from Sandoz but for sure like who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest damn it I can't believe I can't remember that author's name yeah Ken Kesey he did one of the CIA LSD he was in one of the CIA LSD experiments so like let me close and in but an also man like back then I don't think because we didn't get the Manson the Kaczynski or all the awful shrapnel weird shards of chaos that exploded off of the crazy unethical shit they did I don't know if there was so much of an idea that they were evil I could be wrong about that but they weren't even called the CIA I think they were called the OSS beginning yeah but by the time they were the CIA was running a fucking clinic in haight-ashbury that closed down after like 30 years of being open at 40 years being opened closed down three months after this book came out like well that's a wrap yes yeah jolly West the same guy who visited Jack Ruby in the hospital and after he left Jack Ruby went insane was crawling underneath the table and thought that Jewish children were getting lit on fire and cut up art in the streets and a new Holocaust was going on immediately immediately he has the they have no record of him acting insane before this at all he didn't even understand why he shot Lee Harvey Oswald it's so fucked yeah well they'd think that the same thing happen with Sirhan Sirhan the guy who shot Robert Robert Kennedy they think that he was under the influence as well because he had the same reaction after he shot I'm like why am I here what happened that they used LSD to somehow or another get these people to commit atrocities to kill people to murder people yeah I mean yeah and you could what's probably you can probably I know you can if we go on the CA the crazy thing is you can go on their website look at the Freedom of Information Act archives and they have MKULTRA shit up there right now that you can look at that's where it gets really weird is it's like they're like yeah yeah but they never admit that they gave people that was the thing about Jolley was he never admitted that he gave people LSD and did Studies on them never meted it I think well he was alive at least I mean I don't know if they're admitting it now because of the freedom and multi must because operation midnight climax is that's a officially historical record yeah yes they must be now yeah they were when you know they were operating this clinic Manson and the family were going into that clinic all the time there's a direct there's a hundred percent direct connection between the CIA doctors who are providing LSD to the hippies and Manson going to this clinic that is crazy man that does not sound like pandemic reading to me that's the best are you sure they're deep I don't know man like I'm already like weirded out by like just bad understanding of astronomy it's like CIA especially cuz it's like you know I don't know it's just too much you know that being said I'm gonna definitely fucking read that book we'll just listen to the podcast that's the easiest you'll you'll get your dick wet listen the podcast and then you're gonna want to listen to the audiobook or read the book but he has 60 pages of citations and references at the end of the book to show each thing and how he can prove it like it's these are not this is not he's got some speculation that he entertained at the very end of the book and we talked about it on the podcast but the stuff that he knows for sure to be true is bonkers can I ask you a question that will Park it made into like a YouTube clip accusing you of being an asset of the CIA sure so okay let's imagine this one day you get contacted by somebody who's in the CIA and they show you convincing data regarding something you know whatever it may be media or impact some other impending danger that is like you look at it and it's like whatever it is they give you you you believe it and they're like listen I Joe we know you're like we know that you're like a wild animal and we know that like you you don't want to be dishonest and we understand that but we got to figure out a way to get this kind of information out to the world because if we don't like it's gonna be really bad and we're just going to people like you and just trying to get whatever the thing is they want you to say a little thing an idea of how they want you to be and the fuck they're not offering you money they're not offering you money they're and they're also like saying like don't worry if you say no did you get that job with the CIA what excuse me I get the job did you get that job you applied for no seems like you're priming me what for you're you're gonna give me a suggestion later listen I know what you're doing man show have you ever thought of a blue butterfly Joe yeah but seriously what would your response be if like someone's like look we just need your help listen I think Central Intelligence Agency I think FBI I think I think the DEA I think they're all necessary I don't think they're unnecessary I think that most of what they're doing is trying to protect us I do think also that some of those guys turning to fucking Cowboys and try to fly coke back from Mexico and crash CIA jets right that's true - yeah all that shit that happened in Mena Arkansas you know all that shit that happened when Clinton was governor we are very seals when they were running coke back fourth and dropping off and Mena Arkansas yeah that guy was a CIA contractor there's a lot of those guys that were CIA look they got compromised I think but that doesn't mean the whole CIA is bad this isn't mean we don't need a CIA man if you talk to people if they're honest I don't know they're uh let's just assume they're honest if you talk to people that deal with trying to infiltrate terrorist groups and deal with tracking terrorists and deal with trying to figure out if someone's trying to make a dirty bomb trying to figure out if someone's ready to blow up a mall and they're in there they're doing this actively every day all day that's essential right that's essential so the CIA Oh fucking MKULTRA they they dosed people in whore houses that there's not the same people okay this is a giant organizations been around for a long fuckin time right what you're hearing about from jolly West and the MKULTRA those people are dead there's an knows they're not alive today but you know who are is alive today Isis you know who is alive today a lot of threats all around the world you know who is alive today Kim jong-un the the the leader of China all these fucking dictators that are there was heavily armed all over the world there's a lot of them right you gotta keep an eye on those motherfuckers right if you don't think you have to keep an eye on them you're crazy right what will the CIA is even gonna know humans are evil and sometimes you need someone who's paying attention to the evil people right yeah that's what you need now does that mean that they're not going to stray across the lines of what is correct and good and fair and and and and start spying on regular people - no it doesn't mean that all right it means that shit needs to be curbed that shit's on American right but if you think someone might be a terrorist like you should be able to find out before they blow up a frakkin school totally right we all percent 100% so the question is how good are these people at walk in that line turns out pretty fucking good turns out pretty fucking good there's a bunch of shit that's happened over time but also they've gotten intel on all these different terrorists and all these different fucking terrible situations all over the world and probably saved a lot of people right it's not perfect but nothing's perfect just on a fucking thing that's perfect every whether it's the fucking post office or police officers or fire department or and doctors no one's perfect right including the CIA glutton the FBI including the army the Navy there's gonna be problems right but overall they're trying to protect I would imagine yeah I had to ask like what do you guys here for to make sure this shit doesn't hit the fan we'll pay attention to the shit attention do do some of them branch out into coke business yes I'm sure some of them sorry I'm sure there's someone for the federal government that's selling guns to a bad guy right now I'm sure I'm sure some people are people if you got a million people you're gonna get thirty bad ones or whatever the fuck the number is it's just part of life yeah yeah look I apologize I don't believe come on man you know I get a big bonus with the like you know I don't yeah I wearing a wire bro you don't have to wear a wire anymore just carry your phone I'm wearing a wire on a podcast I'm monitoring you Joe imagine if like you got like too close to the mic hmm dude that's when I was a kid growing up that was always wondering like Ron's at the beach that was always like something I'd fantasize about it's like fuck hope one of those drug bags washes up you don't you order like how do you those wash up and people don't report you oh yeah whenever I hear about someone who's like oh my god I found a briefcase full of cocaine like why are you thank god that's grace like something is like delivered unto you this bizarre thing at the very least like you know I'm not fan of coke myself it like makes me I hate it in fact yeah but if you got some of that Ozzy Osbourne from the 70s coke to no good that shit would be CIA cane yes well I remember when we talked about government weed government we was good oh yeah unlike the cheese oh yeah government cheese is terrible but government we do he's got that government weed I do man I completely forgot about that was the thing back when we was illegal you wanted a shit the government was growing whoa yeah that's right yeah well cuz for sure by the way you know there's a there's like I guess at the CIA there's a layer of all the sober people who've like haven't gotten high for a year whichever's writing that fucking thing is definitely like laughing is there writing it you know they're like just laughing cuz they're so fucking high and they alright well this is a testament there's a way there's a level they test but you know there's a level where you get past that level like listen the no drug stuff please we want you to have a good time this is a fun job like we know that you're oh you can handle your shit we just have to do that level below you because otherwise the last thing you need is another fucking Manson you know what I always think about want to think of someone infiltrating a terrorist group right that scene in Team America World Police where the actor has the fucking terrible outfit on you need actors to save the world infiltrating a terrorist group I think of that guy yeah well you know what this again we don't have to worry about that that to me is a fucking great day I don't have to worry about that I don't have to worry about infiltrating a terrorist group you imagine if they just let me look so bad and they just they just believe him any walks right through oh my god what's Murray's amazing this movie's amazing folks if you've never seen Team America world police I probably laugh harder in this movie than any movie I've ever seen in my life it is so so good team I'm it what a great name World Police and then also after you see the movie go online and find the sex scenes that they had to delete so first of all these guys are geniuses and what they figured out is that if you just add way more than you really want they let you have what you want you gotta add stuff like they I think she's shit on chassé right they pissed all over each other they fuck like crazy so it's a it's a plastic doll sex scene that's so so crazy and graphic and then when you watch it in the movie it's like a fraction of this because they just they just went so far they're 69 in each other that is ridiculous yeah and she suck is violently sucking him off and they just keep so they did this so that they could have some of it in there I mean it's long and so crazy and then once you think it's over then they start pissing and shitting all over each other - doesn't it keep going oh that's from the actual movie oh that's how much they live in that's something much they left him because they cut out they got so savage with the sex scene that they let them keep the most preposterous to mount in there because it was so far past that they just tricked him they used like sleight of hand dude that must have been so funny filming that took a long time sure it did yeah Trey Parker was saying in some interview that he would never do that again like that's too bad stop-motion yeah cuz dude Team America World Police is one of the funniest movies of all time sure and you could there's so much in that movie like what they do at South Park though you could never do with a human but you can do it with either a doll or a cartoon easily and it's amazing like death that seems like you killed Kenny you couldn't have a guy just die every week on a sitcom people like this is freaking me the fuck out yeah but he doesn't even look remotely real so he could cut his head off he could light on fire he can blow up an explosion yeah you can definitely get away with a lot more in that regard for sure anyway with everything yeah yeah it's the it's a genius way to do comedy I don't know I mean I like South Park is like Erie to me and their ability to quickly animate shit that's maintains its relevance like it's it's insane that they're able to do that like they've got it down to that level of like oh shit something in the world and we're gonna respond to it almost instantly not only that they do it mockingly but accurately like they figure out how to ride that line and I just saw seen I've never seen before from it I'm gonna see yeah I thought I thought it was fan made but it's not like this is Meryl Streep and this is Ben Affleck they made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really fucking dumb in that movie right oh yeah Matt Damon's actually very smart yeah so rude but it doesn't matter they could just do that yeah they could do anything yeah that when you have like cartoons and puppets you can fucking do anything dude I mean that's that but except anything you want to do takes forever I mean that is the problem it's like yeah you could do anything but that anything is like you know months of anything this so it's like clearly easier to film shit or just to say it or I mean the fact that they used hands god only knows how much money that saved them like that decision to just do that how much time that probably saved them who knows like those kinds of like decisions and shows like that are like really smart and funny yeah but yeah animation is like I mean it is spellbinding it is it's eating their ass this is longer it's not much different to be honest with you though no but there's the shit and the pussy so but it's not coming up on here what would go back there is she drops a log on his face there's perfect and then I think she pisses on 200 he pisses on her and then she shits in his face how many people you didn't do that if you look at the whole population like the entire population like a little light went off every time someone was shitting on someone's head how many times that happened I bet you could fucking light up a small town mostly the girls shitting on the guy's head right would you imagine most of it is like a girl a guy wanting a girl to shit on his head mostly hundred percent I mean look up if you look here's it have you look nice is this interesting though what I was gonna say is it's it doesn't I don't feel bad at all about that like I don't feel like he's getting shit on I feel like he wanted to get shit on and he got shit on so I'm not mad at her at all but if a guy was just on my thing he like shit on women's heads but that guy's a piece of garbage what the fuck man are you doing that and the girls did just look they want a thousand bucks he wants a shit on their head they make a deal and he just shits on people's heads I would feel like that guy's disgusting but the girl who shit on the guy's head obviously the guy wanted it the guy it's easier to think a guy wants to get his head shit on than a girl it's on ya like I got like if you told me hey you know that guy that we used to be on that sitcom he likes he pays girl to shit on his head I be like okay that makes sense dude I know how much it costs free market right depends on how good you want her English to be yeah there's some giant German lady who comes over and there's pretty negotiation like there's project dude who's actually had the conversation he's like really like 2,000 bucks like are you kidding like I you I never pay more than 1,200 for someone to shit on my head maybe they like they'll give a little extra if they let their allowed to pick your diet I want you to only Indian food oh gosh curry yeah I want to smell the curry when you shit in my face have you seen those there have you seen those videos the fetish videos of people who like to look at videos of people getting stuck in mud you know about that fetish have you heard about that oh dude it's like I don't know can we show it look up YouTube stuck at people or junk in mud people are into people that get stuck in the mud yeah it's like a fetish like it's like and there's all these videos of people like if you found I mean like so the humans are stuck in mud like walking and then someone comes along and fucks their mouth or something well know it for now it's just when stuck in mud like at first you look at it and it looks like why did that do just throw himself in that swampy mud and then he gets out of the mud or they'll start just like wiggling around in the mud and like yeah it's crazy okay I find something but it's not it could be an evolution of car stuck girls but maybe not car stuck girls that are stuck with their car like they need help and then oh look horns someone needs help in there in a helpless position no that's always a movie right the guys waiting the bushes were done and the girl standing there with her hood up and the guy runs out hey give me a kiss yeah I it's on YouTube sorry man I thought you were looking in like porn I don't think I've been stuck in mud fetish videos and then there's a lot of like car forums like what's up with all these girls getting stuck in the mud [Laughter] getting stuck in the mud with their legs no no it's like the automobile yeah like a BMW the one I've seen is mostly primarily dude it's like it's like Oh guys get stuck in the mud than the other guys oh there's no other guy it's just like a guy like you know the La Brea Tar Pits yes it's just that but with a white guy with ABS oh my he's like are yelling they're just like you know like they're just stuck in mud Wow weird yeah yeah people are so strange it's a it's a that fetish is a really interesting but I think any you know you're kind of lucky if that's your fetish there's a lot of mud out there man it's like that's a hurt anybody ya know unless you pay someone to go get stuck in mud and like they like sink down into quicksand or something well do you think that the people that are they fantasizing about themselves being stuck in mud don't know I don't know right it's open interpretation it could be they're just really into watching hot guys that get stuck someone's filming it and they jerk off while the fucking loser there you go that's why I don't know if this is one this is a hundred thirty thousand views and it says what you long girl get stuck in very sticky mud yeah but you noticed like it's not like they're trying to get how that's it her sory honest she looks like the kind of girl that would just give up like I don't think she's that stuck like come on you're not that stuck I'm fucking stuck I can't see it's done

news mmm I mean again why here's a real question here's where cousin why is that so strange but like someone who collects stamps that's normal right some guy who loves oh this is your auntie dress up like a Nazi he goes all the way to his fucking head still smoking - he's like quicksand is in quicksand so this is a whole playlist of mess mud and quicksand you remember when people were terrified of quicksand and then it stopped being a thing now this there's a whole Radiolab podcast about that it's really interesting because you hear the podcasts go oh yeah I remember like people were scared of quicksand and then all of a sudden it went away I forget what their reasoning is well when we were kids that was like one of the ways you could die is a quick sanding sometimes you it's like if you're out in the woods and there was a suspicious patch you might even poke it with a stick because it's like fuck that's that was a whole trope in like old movies yeah you know like Tarzan stuck in the

try it like see if you could make up thank you this is a kind of normal thing for a couple to do and then also you realize they don't change the mud I'm pretty sure they don't refill them like dirt yeah yeah it's dirt yeah oh my god yeah yeah so the culture that came out of some dudes balls is all like mingling with your cultures and that's like breeding in the mud yeah exactly Judah not only that but like it the ones that we were in I don't know if they heated it wrong or whatever but any time my ass touched like close to the bottom it was burning my ass so it's like the heater of the Box the heater in the bottom was like burning my ass so I was having to do like this I don't know what you call like arch my back like my hips yeah I was like doing dips in the mud and then it's fucking hot as fuck so like my heart like starts racing also I'm like my ass is like getting incinerated by this thing and like my god we went to a janky place I sank II mud but we're not gonna argue name of the place jakey's mud bath place janky come from I go Genki like a shitty vertical on key version that one might be racist gonna be careful that mom might be one of them secret racist words you didn't know his racist I've been sayin Genki and they're like well let me bring you back to him the genocide of the egg whomp people and Jesus I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised what is the etymology of janky no idea that's why yeah are you sure you don't know Jim I definitely don't know I'm a hundred percent innocent what do we got he just dies I just want to make sure that I'm not stepping over any boundaries by using Genki because I want to be good Ally there's probably it's probably not connected anything just sounds like a word it sounds like a bad word yet I think it was close to junkie that does offend me but I don't like the term Joan jenkees good janki's like like you got a car with a fucked-up brake you know it's this fucking Jackie brake job although I did James African American slang for the nineties there that makes sense that makes sense earlier citations in 90s yeah yeah so um who wrote that who wrote the article I'm looking at is like I mean I like now that I know them it just weird someone like we hear a thing like that like all right that must be true first book they found it in first this person wrote the articles to the rest the longest were written by Jonathan Waldman hmm by the way I'm very much kidding if you wasn't clear I don't really think I made that word up it's just joking it's amazing how attuned you get to like comments that you ain't like your brain is like your and I just don't want anybody to really I was thinking that like that could be misinterpreted that's my word I created it what's another great word that they don't use anymore that I started using recently Oh fresh I started using fresh lately like that looks fresh oh I say like yeah I don't say with the normal voice it sounds like that looks fresh no you don't yes I do when things look good fresh fresh things looking fresh oh you get like a yeah I hear it in the back it gets like looks like bran oh they're fresh it's a good word it's a good word we need more beautiful adjectives for cool shit so I started bringing back fresh hey what's you what like what's your like policy when like about cursing around your kids like you know gave up I'll give up you did yeah I told him just don't swear don't swear around other people there was too many times they caught me on the phone right my nine Yodle especially she's the one who's always correcting me hey what's your potty language she says that yeah yes she's hilarious it's nice to correct me I try not to say it as much as I would say with you but every now and then I'll let a fuck word fly or a shit word fly but it has to make sense dude the funniest story would I realize I say too much as when my daughter was three we were we had gone skiing together and we were all packing up our stuff and her helmet did not go in her bed it wasn't in her bag and I'm like all right everybody packed up and I'm like hey your helmet and your bag and she looks at the helmet looks the bag she just goes shit see you know little me and my wife were just like oh no did it three sheeny but that's the right word to use shit what are we doing like we we aren't even in that world what you and I are not even in that world like the world of you can't say words alright you can't say that word at work we don't even live in that world yeah and yet we're raising our kids for that world that seems to be to be a little crazy and I understand like look if I worked in an office somewhere or if I had to deal with people professionally I wouldn't be dropping f-bombs all day you can't people get upset they don't like it they want you to behave like a business person they'll turn you into human resources if you have a funny joke about Puerto Ricans you can't you can't there's no jokes there's no laughter you can't you know so when you're telling your kids not to say certain words around other people you're telling them that because you want them to be polite you don't want people to feel uncomfortable but you should never have them think there's something wrong with those fucking were right those words are important no I can't really explain it to them because I can't really say it the way I want to say it it would just be too sensitive like I couldn't say I can't say sometimes when someone's telling you something that you know isn't true and they're telling you you want to be able to look it in the eye and go hey that guy's a fucking idiot mmm I can't say that to a nine-year-old right it's just too intense right it's too intense right like if you say this person is an idiot that's one thing but if you say this person is a fucking idiot yeah that's a different thing it's another level of thing and you need to know what's what especially when the shit goes down you need to know who's just a dummy and who's a fucking idiot right some guys just make mistakes or they think they know better or they do something stupid and it puts everybody at risk yeah but they're not doing it on purpose and there's some people that think they want to run the whole show those people are fucking idiots where are certain people that steal from you they'll break in your house when they know you're not home yeah those people are fucking it right I know right yeah there's a different level and if we don't use the right words so what are we doing gonna limit a kid's ability to express themselves right the words aren't changing they're not changing you they're not change it's just another tool for expression and swear words like really swear words you're gonna stop using swear words you're gonna make people upset about swear words get the fuck out of here it's a ridiculous yeah no no I know man I just like I get it that's like kind of my wife I have decided that and like some of my friends are parents of offices I just teach them not to say those words he's going to be nice to wait or win the write down and say those words is it's just like listening to like I don't know like this morning I put on for no reason like ten crack commandments and like I'm like then like my son was in the other room and like he comes walking in like he's just learning to dance and then I pick him up he's laughing or dancing and I'm like oh fuck we're dancing to the ten crack commandments right now he doesn't know what what's being said but you know what I mean it's like fuck I don't know if I even even though even that even though he doesn't even the fact he probably hopefully doesn't understand at least hopefully does it I still like I don't know that it's like you're saying it's too much the Energy's too intense it's yeah it's very aggressive yeah yeah there's certain there's you know you don't you want to shelter them a little bit from the the most dark shell you don't want to show your kid some murder movie like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan when they're four you know once they sit down this is what happens when people go to war this is the closest that we have that represents what war is like right people's guts hanging out legs blown off yeah I'm not gonna show that to a forever alright me neither that's what it seems like if I act like I act with my friends around little kids so I I i pull it in a lot a lot but occasionally I'll say a shit share or something but I don't I just try to there's there's words that I don't want to lose my god and I don't the only reason why I think a lot of like these swear words like the F word of the shit word or whatever if you're at work and you can't say those like why not like what is that what kind of job is that like what are we we're we're all the grown-ups now and when we were children we thought that there was a system that was put in place by enlightened beings and these enlightened beings knew adults they knew better we resisted but we thought they eventually were correct yes and then you get to be a certain age like oh that's nonsense there's no adults there's just people that got older all right there's just people so as people the that you have to limit your language the only thing that's good is when someone who you don't expect to says get the fuck out of here when they say it's even better yeah right yes a woman that you think would be like like very reserved very professional and she's like that chicks a cunt yeah I love that when you realize someone you thought was a square is not only not a square but like a million times more out there than you are but they're like the trap yes or there can get camo they just have like figured out a way to like not reveal to you or to the world that because they like understood it it's a little easier if people don't realize that unless you around cool people those are the best moments when that window opens up and and you realize oh fuck man I'm such a dope I had you completely pegged as something that you're not at all and those are really like whoa fuck what's that calm it's not real marijuana cough I know man I hate I'm a hypochondriac Joe with allergies everybody is know I have allergies I have seasonal allergies and you know any time before this was happening any time I would get sick I'd be like well this might be the end and now like all of us who are like that we're like it's really intense man cuz like any demonstration you know I my birthday was the other day we got like you know they deliver booze in LA now like they'll deliver mixed drinks to you now they'll probably deliver bullets well your bullets brought to your door now hopefully not too fast [Laughter] but yeah anyway man like like I always just hungover you know but there were there was a moment where I'm like this hangover am i there is this like what's this headache and you know what's going on stuff to me that's the part of this thing is you know I don't haven't seen it get acknowledged that much it's like just the psychological pressure of what's going on like the way it's got to be like you know just psychologically like think of all the people you and I know who are already teetering at the very edge of sanity and like imagine them alone an apartment for a month with like the news telling them we don't know when you can let you out like whoa how many people are like really losing their shit and like I'm not losing my shit but at least a couple of times a day I'll have a real claustrophobic moment like I can't explain it it's like a I don't know if it's a panic attack it's not it's just like this sense of like oh this fucking sucks I don't want to drive by Trader Joe's and see people wearing face masks with six feet in between each of them and the fucking weirdness of it all people are driving weird right now and it's just like what the fuck you go driving yeah real aggressive yeah man that that that that you know I don't people I don't think are acknowledging the fact that and they need to that if you're feeling if you're feeling a little off right now that's normal like you probably should acknowledge that you know or at least like otherwise people are gonna start thinking they're really going nuts when it's like no you just have some kind of like probably a new mental illness will be they'll probably a new name for a covert related mental illness you know like pandemic associated claustrophobia Jerome or some Schilling right you know some white thing that is a new thing because we've never had to do this but of course a hundred percent yeah I mean do you know how many people are gonna get sued for this do you know I mean how many people gonna sue the government for the closed-down so you know many people are gonna go crazy and yeah how many businesses are gonna be lost I mean lives are turned upside down know how many people fuck man divorce is oh my god so many yeah dude so many you know people forcing these high pressure situations they didn't anticipate and then some people falling apart people with drug problems they accelerate because they need to relieve anxiety from all this yeah man and we're in just a beginning it man I mean just begin we're we're still three weeks away from at least here with this state is gonna open up right 19th yeah but what do you think it's gonna happen in Georgia do you think when they when they open Georgia back up you're gonna get like another another series of people that have it do you think it's gonna be what do you think if you had a guess man that's surprise I have no debt all the data sources earth so some of them are so very different it seems like yeah that it's like you know you you have people who've won Nobel prizes you know saying what they think it is and you have other people or doctors saying what they think it is and those things don't quite match to the point where it comes down to it's not like what I think is gonna happen it's what I hope is gonna happen which is like that it just not only that it the curve keeps flattening maybe not necessarily because I just maybe because the vote it's mutating maybe because herd immunity maybe because you know I don't know who believe you turn on Fox News you see one story you turn on CNN you see the other story you go on the internet it's a fucking meteor that's gonna hit you go you know you it depends on who you're talking to you and fg5 gee you know a variety of things up a low level bio weapon that's being combined with a horrific like powerful psyops operation who the fuck knows Joe we don't know so it's like the that to me is the the real unnerving quality of this outside of worrying like if you go outside like every time you cough I'm like motherfucker should have worn my mask I'm doomed when my wife sees it she's gonna fucking kill my ass but like that you know just that those moments they would normally just go completely unnoticed I like though those to me that new reality yeah and brother that that is like that's another form of virus it's your fear right and it's it's paranoia and it's like it's a it's a meme that spreads so it changes your outlook changes the way you interact with life yeah it changes your outlook and it changes it changes the actual course of your life like you'll you'll be operating with fear and operating with anxiety and everyone's thrust into that without anything bad that they've done that for no fault of their own their thrust into the situation where even though they've worked really hard they've been really disciplined they've done the right thing they've been conservative they take care of their health all the all the all the checks everything but still all sudden work goes away yeah for everybody yeah nobody did anything wrong so everybody's thrust into this situation it's really the ultimate halves in half knots moment you know and it's for what's really interesting it's like right when Bernie Sanders just stepped out of the race like this is the example of why we need some sort of comprehensive plan for everybody if everything goes wrong yeah man this is right right here idea the capitalism moves the world yes does it seems to motivate most of what we do but the idea that there's there's not more that we can do for the people of the community of the United States of America as a community right is that health care and education and stop people from being robbed like stop stop some predatory lending stop all these things that you can clearly see people are just getting fucked over from yeah spend more money on health care like we need that now yeah we went through a nice sweet spot where there was no real problems other than occasional little blips of bad flus and bad disease and we squashed them real quick this is a big one that hit the whole way this is only you know as far as like terrible pandemics the the amount of people that it kills / people that get it is not as high as it is for some of the more horrendous diseases we got lucky we should prepare for the worst we should prepare for airborne Ebola okay we should prepare for all that shit we should think about it the way we think about arms races yeah how much money they put it into the military and how much money they put into the the war against viruses well the war against viruses just killed 50,000 people at home imagine if China just had just launched missiles into American cities and killed 50,000 people it would be at fucking war all of our resources would be dedicated to that right right why aren't all of our resources being dedicated to fighting off fucking diseases great questions this is a real wake up call for that it's also a wake-up call for power grid people people that are worried about the power grid go down it's a wake-up call for people that haven't had food stockpiles in their house wake up call for people that are living extended you know like they've really extended their reach as far as the how much the rent is and how much their car payment is and they're really stretching it well boom something like this happens and you're four you're never gonna play catch-up we're barely keeping up with your lifestyle before all this went down yeah and again through no fault of your own so you got to kind of prepare now people are gonna have to look at this like okay now we know something can happen that we never thought could happen before in the whole world shuts down yeah now we know that's it but we should we should act accordingly in like how we run things now we know well that's the silver lining I mean like that's a silver line it's like when you have a thing happen that you realize like you know whatever like went in your car you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you felt you fill it up you just didn't notice or whatever you see a thing and it saves you from a later fucking thing that could have been a million times worse but you know man the wake-up call to me is like it's no joke that you need to at least be on like some terms with your neighbors and it's no joke that you need to understand how to do like how to grow food out of the ground and some like basic first-aid and stuff like that and also to always have gas in your car man like you know we the other day we went to get groceries and like fucking the you know left a credit card at the house right and like the but the car was kind of low on fuel cuz I hadn't gassed it up like I should have right and the combination of suddenly not being able to put gas in the car and these two dumb mistakes it wasn't just a normal shitty day where your car runs out of gas now it's your cars run out of gas during a pandemic meaning you gotta call somebody to come and get put gas in your car or walk somewhere to get gas that's a whole different walk than before and that's asking someone to come and help you it's kind of like asking them hey would you mind like taking a chance I mean I know you're wearing a mask and everything but you know what I mean so suddenly fuck-ups in this kind of environment they mean a lot more than fuck-ups in like the previous world that we were in and that's teaching me a real kind of responsibility you know like having some cash on hand like stuff like that like yeah what we you know we should always be doing that and to me that is one of the you know and I hate using ever is using the term silver lining right now and it's like anytime you say it's like yeah it's a silver lining I like people who drowned in their own fucking mucus it's not the you know it's you know fucked up but I guess one of the silver linings in it is just that the fact that it's like look man Trump just was talking about maybe we should inject ourselves with Lysol okay go crazy that video have you seen the one when they focus on the lady who's the science advisor and she's sitting there listening to him say all this shit yeah yeah I've seen Paris tweeted it and it's he said when you look into the abyss the abyss looks into you you know and but also in that look you know I saw I saw her thinking like listen motherfuckers who's in line you want to have do you want this job I'm doing what I can to steer this crazy ship as best as I fucking can and there's not much I could do but it's like you know you see somebody seriously say to an entire planet it might be a good idea to inject Lysol into your box hear it let's hear let me hear you start for the beginning I think you gotta actually double click on it and on my computer I had to to get the sound out of it nothing no here's that was Duncan that with me it's all did anyway bottom line is he's saying wacky shit and the focus is on this lady and as she's watching him she's like I can't even fucking believe I have to handle this yeah and she goes dude that's it but to me I could get to disinfectant into their body that's maybe possible we could get up to drink myself right powerful I can use light yeah till it's from outside or inside I don't know how you do it there you go because you see a thing like that and it's like okay lean into that like that's gonna like lean into that is the thing that you can count on that's a thing saying inject lie so that's the kind of thing where like your craziest friend if they said that to you you would be considering like calling their their friends or their mom to be like hey Jackie's having like a hardcore manic episode he's talking about injecting Lysol into himself you better do something that's the fucking president and to me what that tells me is like motherfucker you need gas in your car you need to make sure your phone is juiced up you know what I mean you need to make sure that you are like you really you got to be ready because if we like think we're gonna lean into something like imaginary hammock made of like people who are saying that we should inject ourselves Lysol then we're may then that's our fault that's your because you know it's like let's imagine let's say you went and you I don't know you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger but right before you and in the tiger you into the forest you said to somebody hey do you think I should go in that force there are Tigers there and they're like no and then they start shooting up with Lysol you know what I mean if you go in that forest and the tag tiger gets you that's your fault you fucking listen to a dude who thought you could shoot why so you know what I mean that's your [Laughter] what was he thinking while he was saying that he's probably like there's got to be an intelligent way to get out of this fucking subject that I've already started and I've already like coming up with perhaps for instance maybe you could uh maybe you could we hit the body with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you powerful light that has a magic that you're gonna test it and then I said suppose inside the body you can which you can do either through the skin or in some other way and I think you said you're gonna test that too sounds interesting right and then I see the disinfectant weird knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it can we take your lungs out put your lungs through a car wash like what yeah what a crazy thing to say I mean cleaning cleaning give him a cleaning yeah imagine like being his doctor and you have to listen to him say this like so why don't you do like the disinfectant you know inside it's like you're cleaning you dip my liver and bleach can you take my liver wave it yeah you know so to me you see that and it's like okay well I'm not quite certain that that is where I'm gonna get my data stream from because that's a Lysol person and then but then we but then there must be like a thing we can do regardless of the fact that clearly bro you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast do I've never say that no man about imagine imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject you're talking to someone who's like some expert yeah in this said subject and you're proposing these outlandish like you're on a podium you don't even having up a private conversation yeah in front everybody you're somewhere another having a side conversation we are proposing these ridiculous ideas that show that you don't yeah how disinfectant works like why is that even conversation even taking place also the other thing is cuz he did ask the question that is a time for someone on that side of the room to go no look at that do that because I knows if she interrupts him and goes what you can't do that you can't inject this inflection he'll probably be upset and she wants to do the best work that she can do and this is just some nonsense just to handle along the way Wow yeah yeah it's just a bad path you look first of all I mean look the guy works some ungodly amount of hours in a day right he's gonna do some dumb shit like in and he wings it a lot right he probably was stuck on that conversation of things that might be able to be done and maybe you could do a strong ultraviolet light like in the skin then also he's like oh my god I'm I'm laying out possible ways that you could cure this there I better keep going I better have more than one yeah and there's like disinfectant that's right disinfect disinfectant maybe inside or outside they have a way of doing that yeah and then they say and then he goes to her like he's looking for support like I think you said maybe I think you said maybe you looking at that yeah man it definitely has that sense of like when you had to give a report at school well who were the Assyrian rebels well they were from Assyria yeah yes it is her there were tremendous rebels they were fighters they fought and they fought long and hard in Syria in areas around Syria and some people in areas around Syria referred to them as rebels and said they were some of the most intense rebels in the region as Syria it's a different place you're Duncan you wrote a report about the wrong place no Syrian I was saying that you heard me wrong oh yeah you just heard me wrong dad I can't give you an A yeah man there's like how many times did you bullshit your way through like those things in high school a lot of the times man I mean I got like I think it was the Red Badge of Courage which even now I can't remember what if it's I think it's about the Revolutionary War and I that no I didn't read it all clearly I didn't read it cuz I still can't remember which war it was about but I remember just having not read the book at all having to write a report on it or I think I said it in Vietnam or something like her and maybe was a civil war and that she was just like that's not even the war that it was that happened that you know I completely failed like one of those one of those FS where the teachers met angry carve about cliff notes when I was in high school I couldn't believe it like this is a gift from God cliff notes you just gotta buy it on your own you gotta buy the book but yes it's a way well you can read it in an hour that's right but it's still sucked you had to pay money for a cliff I mean yeah but I thought it was cheating I was like the cheating though they're giving you away to like you this is not how so you can learn better to see it pass the test right that's this is so you give me like oh yeah and then Mike you said to her get off my fucking porch yeah let's page 30 that's yeah there's a little gray or a few years ago where kids could just copy and paste other people's reports for from years past because they were all digital and teachers didn't know this was the thing they could check they know I'm checking tools to find out plagiarism and whatnot but so many kids probably for a few years just did literally nothing I'm sure I'm sure you get out of school and you graduated high school you can't read like what you can't read them I didn't bad engine I can't just play video games I mean like a little bit of video games yeah I just made my way through well I mean you know there's like that's one of the isn't that no the people who went to recently went to jail for like bribe for getting their kids into college oh yeah yeah it's kind of a version of that except with your kids right you're like you're like just the kids aren't aren't supposed to be in college because they haven't done any work in a high school and they don't know what they're doing but if you pay enough money you get them in there hmm it's like and also aren't they doing some thing where they get people to go and take SATs for your kid like you figure out a way to like it's an identity theft thing or you can even get someone to go and like do the test as your kid using fake ID and shit so it's like it you send in an operative that isn't your kid to take the test so you can get into a nice school mmm that whole thing was so crazy did they spend so much money to get kids in school but didn't want to be good students yeah that's right almost like you think you could buy by a kid's way too enthusiastic focus that well there you go I mean there's the whole problem is it's not this was this is from the district attorney's office in Massachusetts one of the photos that was used to show this girl's a rowing mm-hmm high school rowing career that she got a scholarship on that's a workout machine oh wow I was supposed to be like yeah look at her inner varsity oh fuck man what there was no photos of her actually rowing out on a boat that's part of the thing I could having people take tests they went in staged photos to to be like look it's all allegedly according to the court he imagined how mad real rowers would be at you if they found out you got a scholarship based on a fucking rowing machine photo wait and what is so mad was it for scholarships or was it just keep trying to get them in to get any I don't think they got scholarships no like they were but to be on the rowing team you know or whatever it's called I forget is it like good for your GPA or some shit it's a way to get in Oh way to get in yeah oh right so that end the bride's for curricular activity kind of steal your record so they just they fudged that and then bribed the rest of it do you think the kids knew yeah yeah you could you know when your parents like hey we just bought this rowing machine why just don't worry about it we're just gonna take a picture you're in a rowing machine like sure you know you're getting a picture taken to you to try to get you into this school that your dad went to or whatever you're complicit to some degree like yeah you have to be yeah yeah a little bit go to that picture she doesn't even shouldn't he broke a sweat has a face covered enough so you can't see but I want to see close in on that she doesn't look sweaty to me cruiser I think she looks like she's barely started exercising yeah come on son I don't see no sweat that's a better one cuz look stop go up look at that that's a gray sweat a gray t-shirt great t-shirts look sweaty instantly yeah instantly this is hilarious just probably pulled it back a couple times am I done yet [Laughter] yeah dude don't you to love me will get me in a fucking UFC all my friends are going dude that thing that's really fucked up is like there's some kid whose parents like like or making 20k a year who's working his fucking ass off you know like just like somehow managing to like study non-stop to try to get into a good school it doesn't get into the school because of that shit that's the that's the satanic part is like they buy their way in that's someone's place they have a limited number of places meaning like theoretically someone doesn't get into the school who could be the person who is going to you know invent teleportation or some shit isn't it weird what schools are you have your first choice second choice yeah Billy got his third choice fuck yeah fuck Billy's going on where's he going South Dakota What's in South Dakota yeah flat ground did I get it though I mean I get wanting to get enough some Ivy League I get a little monatti school I think that'd be cool cuz usually if you're in if you're in the Illuminati and your kids a dope like I don't swear that much around my kids my kids don't know how I talk around my friends what if that's how it is with like Illuminati to like these kids don't even know their parents were the Illuminati yeah you know you're like look I'm trying to get you to be you know better position in life but I was working all the time I wasn't around I didn't push you hard enough oh sure they got you into Yale they fucking know you're in it and they're just like you're like did you get into my fucking adrenochrome again they're like breaking into your vaults you know taking your fucking like goblets of blood and drinking it parties don't drink anymore in my blood you have to stop this you know like join them in the Skull and Bones don't they bring their kids to Skull and Bones I don't think they do I think they once they're there in their son turns 30 I say son I'm gonna show you something they take them take them to the Skull and Bones don't bring em in now you if you go to school there you get into it right that's how you guys think that's how you get in the school that's tough right legacy is that I get in or is that how you get in skull and bones like I would not I don't think the whole school gets to be skull nose but that's yeah that's how you get accepted this when I met that's how you get into this school isn't that funny like if you're in a place like Yale which is very exclusive and very prestigious already some creeps like that's not enough I want to get in the secret cult dick-sucking Society what do they do they don't suck dicks do they we know why wasn't there a rumor that they make each other blow each other on take photos of it so that they they have something over them that was what's one of the crazy online conspiracy theories right yeah they they make every guy suck a dick and they take Polaroids of it so they always have it they hold over you I think that's just returning stuff but yeah is that normal for eternity studying birds talked about that right thing whatever for it yeah they would jerk off on a biscuit right yeah that's the circle jerk thing and the last guy to come had to eat the biscuit no one's really doing except for the one idiot yeah one guy can't come let's go yeah I sucked a bunch of my friends dicks whose fucking cares are we in a time now where like like a picture of me emerges sucking all my friends dicks I think there's more to say I think they pegged you or something they take pictures I'm wearing a strap-on so you got pegged you know why but you know they want to rise through the branch Raytheon and get to the top everyone at Raytheon gets pegged like well you know that's just like fucking oh yeah we all get pegged now what so what we're inventing bombs now you like who cares of course we get pegged yeah but the guys wearing a goat costume so what I like to wear a go costing when I get pegged I like too much kinky shit it's like god dammit I hope we get to a time where like they take pictures of someone doing a fucking thing that's legit fucked up so that you know and they get banished for it it's like I'm god forbid like I can't even imagine the Polaroids that could emerge of weird shit I've done you know I've thought you'd only imagine you can't imagine I can't but that being said it's like yeah I wonder what what I think what the initiation I get it like it is it let's face it you're not going to have a reason to be a part of a little tiny group that's a part of an exclusive group right you got the exclusive group that's Yale and then you get the little skull home bones we all go together all brothers in in the room you know they probably have like secret words they have to say in Latin and shit yeah I mean we that's the thing that I imagine based on the way I have come to understand things whatever it is is way more boring than we imagined because you know what I mean like when you don't know what a thing is you always reject the worst thing on it my guess is it's boring as fuck it's probably just some college bullshit where people are in a frat sit around and like make dumb jokes and do stupid shit and it's nothing they're probably a peg you they probably just took a Polaroid of your asshole got it look mmm we got your mouth shut yeah well it's your sauce fingerprint asshole told a lot about you eyes you know and you see their soul it's the windows to the soul what if the asshole is like you really know whether you like someone just by looking at their asshole thing about the asshole tells you things books come out decoding your asshole you know if people read hands they read fingerprints yeah can't they read assholes I bet assholes tell you a lot just like someone's eyebrows do someone's got like mean eyebrows like whoa that guy looks aggressive I don't but guys got big thick bushy eyebrows and he's not mean I get it suspicious he's all friendly well there's big crazy fucking eyebrows but all the villains have big crazy eyebrows they're all angry it was crazy eyebrows yeah yeah it's just like mad for one here's probably for sure we don't know that you can't tell a person's future from their asshole yeah cuz no one's thought of it that could be the new thing that people pick up as a business during this pandemic yeah asshole reading yeah or what if it's like a what if it's like it there's an app let's get to our asshole plot to do a QR code all this time we've been looking for alien signals from space we didn't know it was in our ass holes yeah it was all the photos of our assholes if you put him together on a grid it gives us the diagram of how to build a spaceship to get out of here all the photos it's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with eight billion pieces you take eight billion assholes and you put them on a grid and you'll see the schematics behold it'll tell us exactly when the the sun's gonna supernova about 50 years maybe what if that's what the quantum computer the first thing it says is I need pictures of all the assholes on the planet like if you vote you have to show a photo your asshole before you vote you're gonna have it on your phone and that's your thing no thumb prints are not exact assholes our exact exact and they don't get changed by workouts or they don't like you know you're something you can see a bigger could be a little bit different how do you know I don't know that assholes don't get change from workouts well they can one thing they could do with your thumbprint right some people burn their prints
