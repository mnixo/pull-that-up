hello freak bitches let me use another example because I think this will help show what's happening here so there was a Chinese site you know most drug trials they they take place at different sites so they have multiple you know locations that are testing so that they can get data on different populations and you know not just in white you know Americans also Chinese people and you know so they do it different centers and so there was a it was a trial for an anticoagulant drug and they found that this Chinese Center had falsified a whole bunch of patient data and changed the results and if they took that Chinese center's data out of the equation the drug would have failed it wouldn't have been more effective than placebo but even though the FDA busted this group in China the study that was published on that drug still included that data from the study in China and even studies that were being published eighteen months later still included that data in the original data set so the FDA busted them it was clear that they had falsified the data and yet that data is still being included in the studies that doctors are relying on all over the world to make decisions about whether to prescribe these drugs so there's there's fraud happening and whether it's you know from financial interests or just human error that's not actually being reported and translating into clinical decisions that that doctors are making so there are a lot of and then the whole peer review process you mentioned peer review too there was a pretty big study where they the a paper was submitted to BMJ British Medical Journal another big medical journal with eight major errors and not a single one of the 221 scientists that were asked to review the paper caught all of the errors and only thirty percent recommended rejecting the paper and this was even more problematic because half of those scientists were warned in advance we're going to give you a paper that has a lot of errors and and the ones who were warned didn't get any more of the errors than the scientists that weren't warned in advance they broke them up into two groups is that just a lack of time to do the research and I mean people being overwhelmed by a workload I think that's probably part of it but it's not really an excuse I don't know I mean it's it's just it's a problem with peer review because I artists you know it is big part of the scientific method to have the results validated by somebody else or to review the work and make sure that it's sound but what this paper indicated is a lot of findings that we take to be true and valid might not actually be true and valid and you may have heard about this it actually made the news there was a recent the open science collaboration did a review of a hundred psychology studies and that had never been replicated replicating and findings is really important in the scientific method too like if you design a study and you do it and you have you find a certain result in science it's not really considered to be valid unless I do it and and confirm your results you know or someone else does it's independent of you and in a shocking number of studies this never happens and so they this group went back and looked at a hundred psychology studies and tried to replicate them using the you know almost identical conditions from the original studies and and they were only able to do that in thirty five percent of cases well there another group looked at at pre cancer clinical studies and found they could only replicate 11% of those it's a well-known saying in the pharmaceutical world that that like more than half of the drug trials can't be replicated and a group of researchers from Bayer from a pharmaceutical company tried to do that in 2011 they took a bunch of trials and tried to replicate them less than one-quarter of them they were able to replicate the results so what this means is you know a study can be done it's never validated and then a whole bunch of other studies are done that refer to that study and whole fields of scientific research are spawned on a study that was never confirmed or validated so it's like a house of cards built on a foundation of falsehood well so you know science is great we need to keep improving science but there's a lot of problems with the way the studies are performed right now and it comes it's it's both you know conflicts of interests that are based on money and it's just also human human error these black mold spores just being poisoned all the time did they have home tests for that I bet you anything I have yeah so much black black no matter you have people gotta keep an eye on ya help the jokes they come they just come I had a bunch of mold the other day it's late at night we bought the strawberries and you know like underneath the strawberry was like green and stuff I had no idea cuz it was dark I was like eating strawberries in the next day I go in to get some more and I'm like they're all moldy I'm like was i eating yeah reading moldy strawberries yeah in the dark yeah man it's probably not even that bad for you it's probably just all in your head I mean otherwise people would be dying left and right right right is everybody eats strawberries and doesn't pay attention I didn't realize people actually could pass out behind a dumpster like I've never been that drunk to where that's where I would lay down I fucked by a dumpster but I never slept there you fucked by a dumpster like all that dumpster grease on the ground yeah i slippery heats of boxes down but oh my god what a classy girl that guy came out and he caught us having sex and he's like oh he got nervous he's like you guys want some pizza cuz he thought we were homeless wait yeah bang two homeless people bang on pizza boxes next to dumpsters that's pretty much you you heard this media narrative the AIDS it sells papers it's so it didn't sell cliques at the time because they were doing it's about the internet but it sells papers which is the idea that the Internet is a haven of crooks and fraudsters and terrorists and pedophiles and pornographers great yes criminal use advanced technology criminal use the most advanced technology they can get their hands on because they're in a very highly competitive high margin high risk business and of course they're going to take the criminals wear shoes to run away from bank criminals drive cars to get away from bank robberies they use cell phones to coordinate with each other they drink water so as not to die of dehydration we're not gonna ban all of those things right and so you have that anger and they tried that for a while every time they try that you just turn around and say oh well you know actually the biggest money launderers of drugs in the world are HSBC the Hong Kong Hong Kong Shanghai banking consortium inconvenient fact yes laundries in the world yes they were caught money laundering 700 billion dollars for the Sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years during which 19,000 people died in Mexico as a direct result of that and they got a fine and no one went to jail so there are inconvenient facts like that every time they say Bitcoin funds terrorism you say ah I see them driving Toyota's and Humvees right that isn't that's a bit incongruent like they're they're driving around and the vehicles we left behind and there they got a lot of their funding from pallets of money that we left behind and they're getting paid $4 in dollars for oil that they're selling to our closest allies we shouldn't really mention Saudi Arabia so these are the inconvenient truths right so you don't talk about these in polite company or at least you do like that's what I said when I was invited to the to speak in front of the Senate in Canada and they started asking me about terrorism and I said actually mostly funded by our allies and what did they say that that was the end of that train of thought they stopped you know it was live look TV but what would like what went down no we moved on to talk about more realistic and interesting things and a much more positive view of what this thing is so they tried to discredit Bitcoin by attaching it to terrorism and you informed them of the facts of where terrorists are actually funded from yes in a very public forum on live TV which is very difficult to continue that line of conversation so that's anger is there resistance in Canada like there is in the United States right no actually they've been very very positive very positive to towards towards cryptocurrencies in general interesting and there's a lot of [Music]
