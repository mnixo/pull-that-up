other and he's so good at it sometimes I was like I'm gonna sit out man let's go ahead man I got nothing I've ran out of material do go ahead so the things he says are so Theo like he Theo is like there's a few guys Theo's one of them Sebastian's another one that have the like a style economy that you will never be able to explain to someone they got to go see him like you got to listen to him because it's so strange where most bikinis thing podcast is mostly me saying something pretty average and then feel just saying them up most outlandish thinking me laughing my ass off the funnest show ever because you guys go back and forth at each other it's very funny so funny man yeah he's a unique dude very unique dude as unique as they get yeah he's not stray right now I guess yeah he's in Australia right now he goes yeah this is this morning is yeah man got a koala come what come to the hotel and I went oh shit man those things have chlamydia so make sure you wash your hands and he goes shit I have some things - he better wash his roadie was that way - Brody had that unique style - he's so special man yeah you're so special is very just know it yeah yeah yeah you just know it man I be were asking what it's like to work with Theo all you guys I said with Theo it's like he's the LeBron James economy so creative I'm just that shitty coach on the side trying to manage man it's just ball game fuck get out man he's but he's just I mean there's other guys that are funny but they're funny in like a regular way like oh he's really good as jokes are great he's got a great presence he's great on stage but Theo's like try to explain that you can't explain that you gotta do this a magical cluster of dark magic from New Orleans where Jose something I'm like there's certain guys I can watch and I'll go oh he's definitely his IQ might be higher than me mine but I see how he got there with this premise of a joke with fee oh my god that I have no idea how he got that I've it's not happening you know who gives me stress when I look at his schedule Russell Peters yeah he's mean like she's all over the fucking pack Tragos - forgot for like six weeks like he's all here Michael Bisping almost got fucking robbed in Africa mmm did he really yeah he's doing a movie the fuck was he to in Africa doing a movie Expendables 19 I don't know what it was he's doing a movie he got a little liquored up his cab dropped him off and said your your hotels over there he get out of the cab he's like where the fuck's my hotel the cab driver drives off he's like looking around for the hotel is he said like ten dudes just started rolling up on him saying I want your wallet you know if you want to live you'll give me your wallet yeah this is south after this office it's like Rihanna Lisa Pretoria fuck yeah so he ran and he got away off so yeah you got away yeah he's a big fella you know got a fight and they probably could sense that a little bit but if there's ten of them they usually don't probably hammer to them whether is ten Francis in Ghana oh gee then you're giving your wallet just the homies around if there's one Francis ago nothing yeah Eddie Izzard was telling me that when he was running he rammed like 27 marathons in South Africa and when he went through certain sections of South Africa they go stop you are not running through this area we're gonna put you in a car we're gonna drive you to where it's safe and then you're gonna continue your run do this but you will get robbed like it's like there's areas where you just will get robbed I have no interest in going to Africa like oh it's beautiful vehicle I want to go look you really yeah I want to go I want to see what those animals look like in the wild I would love to see you know before we fuck Africa up we got 12 years they say before everything's gonna Ford the way humans are fuckin up the world there's no going back if we don't make a change now that's from its from the ending of little Dickies new video of saving the world but it does say it's like earth dot-org it's like that's a quote from them I don't think they know see the reality is they know there's a real problem with carbon in the environment they know that human beings that put carbon in the environment in unprecedented levels and they know that the earth is heating up a rapidly but they don't know like what exactly is gonna happen there models they predict none of them look good they don't really know but no one really knows right like some people are like global warming's not real up see our president doesn't think it is so it's real but if you go back to like the 1990s they were predicting shit was gonna happen that never happened same thing with the 2000s but here we are 2019 we you know we should listen to them because we're definitely fucking out definitely fucking up the more the whales and stuff with like trash there's also too many people mm-hmm yeah but what are you gonna do well there's two schools of thought on that even the schools of thought on people is what happens is as the world gets more and more westernized as people start developing careers people have less and less kids and that if you look at Japan and you look at some westernized nations they actually have a shortage of kids and you know they they think that and this is purely speculative right it's just theoretical they think that as the world becomes more and more industrialized and westernized and more technology and more advanced that people will start to have less kids that's a fair point but also even Americans they're having kids later and I think less as well yeah that's America but also isn't there parts of Australia and Africa where no one's really there so if we had to we could colonize that and like make it more livable brother they don't the parts of Australia where no one lives no one wants to live you don't want to live in the fucking middle kid where all the crocodiles are and shit but we could figure it out yeah you can figure it out couple Crocs feel the loss snakes everywhere that'll kill you I mean there's a lot of parts of Austria Australia it's huge it's as big as the United States so big in the giant parts Africa - mm-hmm giant parts where we could live if we had this but Australia has less people than LA I know the whole goddamn country you've been there right yeah bunch I love it there love it you think I'm sure you've done comedy yeah yeah punch Tom's the best yeah Sydney Melbourne Melbourne is crazy too though have a great time they've been in New Zealand yeah no never been straight off of Jurassic Park would you do their comedy no shit why here in New Zealand when did you do this I think like a year and a half two years ago I did this tour of Australia and that's what he was just starting no crazier this out no openers came out pulled oh my god why'd you do that I don't crazy no one hey man I wasn't sure that's what Australian just go by yourself man you didn't even ask no I'd swear dude Here I am Showtime special it's fun though good experiences oh they're good people I like the people everybody I met from New Zealand it's like very similar to Australian people very down-to-earth super nice yeah it's a beautiful place man means they did The Hobbit there for a fucking reason yeah good good food good people yeah I could not that I could ever leave LA but I could see I could live somewhere like I could live in Australia me too it's very American but clean like yeah but that's the driving on the wrong side of the road shit like get it together folks we invented cars the fuck are you doing over there on the left lane that is strange do you know where that came from yeah now correct me OK this is bro science but when they were developing it was that like the the wagons with the horses is four sword fighting right yeah four horses in sword fight yes you got it yeah that's why you swing a sword with your right arm you want your right arm to be facing your opponent so you wanna be yeah you don't want the dude to be over here on this side doesn't make sense here's a little loophole like if you want a dope-ass like a rare car you can get one with driving on the right and it's gonna be cheaper so if you want like a Ferrari f12 TDF like a limited one you can save money if you get one that's set up on the right because on the right like a English copy yeah cuz they're harder to resell because there's less less people throw them away come on because on the right who gives you stillness right out can they switch it out be expensive legislate on the other side franchise what are they gonna do switch it out they'd have to change everything that's a nightmare I saw they did that to this ravallo G car this 1965 Mustang they built one that was on the right-hand drive and looking out on what this is also screwy like why would they do why would people not come to an agreement on which side of the road to drive on it's very strange they just stick with it yeah and it's difference differs from like in Europe it differs from country to country yeah it's almost an ego thing now right where they're like nah fuck it refused to change ah most of the world's on the left though man don't care yeah well Germany makes the best cars or some of the best cars or sure they're on the Left Europe makes the best cars and they're on the left right yeah America makes some pretty good cars but really the reality is they can't go toe to toe with Europe they just can't dude I was uh I was at this private car dealer and there's those Pagani's mm-hmm have you ever seen those that's like a million dollar car right you know some of them are you know you're looking six seven million dollar ghani's there's Bugattis that that the rear brand-new Bugatti and then there's all these limited edition Ferraris and Lamborghinis and he goes oh Floyd bought that one you can sit in tow he won't kill us in it and there's all like carbon-fiber now how much is it and whatever the new Bugatti is but there's a markup on them cuz we're like 20 of them where the fuck it is and it was so expensive I got nervous on it I'm good man he's you know it no I don't feel comfortable I'm good I just didn't feel comfortable open this thing I don't know I felt zero million dollars so yeah is it you could buy a car that's worth more than most people's houses ninety-nine percent of the world's houses yeah 99.9 percent of world time yeah just working that thing around yeah and you just driving around this thing that you can't sleep in and then a toilet you can't do shit and shower try fastest shit drive faster shit 25 G's just change the tires though is it really yeah every year that's what you're driving it is it right here sorry to see how it's hurting fun scratching go back to the beginning of that video look at the underside of the things jack and that's all carbon fiber so he scratched the fuck out of it man yeah well those cars they scratch every time you hit a bump every time you go over curbs and that's just Jamie that's I mean that's when I have my little red car the little red Porsche every time I leave the comic store it's scrape it's embarrassing it's annoying and it's so sad sad I did mine another desk taking my dad to get ice cream I hit the front of my car ruin my night because we want to give a fuck damn I'm so disappointed so sad I know it's just a car though right it is just a car it's the problem nice things that become a little velvet prisons but you got to drive them like the dealer I was talking to where all these freaking dudes buy these million dollar cars he's like you know what bothers me is they don't drive them don't drive them it's for them it's investment and then they flip in years from now because we want people that drive the cars and now what Ferraris doing like if you want to Enzo you want a certain like limited run TDF or the pizza if you want some of those real limited edition ones they look at your history because you have to own like the past ten Ferraris nice yeah they have a weird cricket I want to get a special limited edition but they now they check if you've driven it if you're just a collector they don't sell them to you anymore oh my god certain ones they go back and look at your history on all the old Ferraris to qualify to buy a Ferrari certain Ferrari certain to get on that acylation like on the list less so if you want to if you want like the new whatever the superfast the limited PDF they're gonna do yeah you have to own all the v12 and certain ones before that that is hilarious because that just shows you how goofy people are like they they know that people are goofy and they know that all you have to do is like sneak in on them some sort of exclusive thing that nobody else can have so when you roll up on it you look like a champ and no one else does yeah even if it sucks even if it's a sucky car no I like it though because some let's say some billionaire rich billionaire who his daddy gave him all his money he can't roll in the front like I'll take that that's kind of cool yeah now it's a little extreme with the 10 and gotta own all the b12 yeah but what do you mean that they can suck it you don't like it now it's because you can't what you probably use though that's the thing you just bite you yeah all right cool dude yeah fucks gonna buy it now just get it from him you're not gonna stop it it's like illegal streaming you guys are just dumb business people how about you make more cars stupid well no you don't know you don't become tesslar Prius how could they so how much can they sell how many are they leaving on the table think about that what I think they care right how many people how many people are buying Ferraris let's just take a guess let's just say worldwide a hundred thousand people are buying Ferraris maybe would be two hundred thousand maybe if they just stopped being quantities to be two hundred thousand Ferraris out there instead of a hundred thousand I don't think they want that dough a favor we can have it you don't want it right that's just weird man but girls are that way with purses you ever talk to girls about certain verses sure so you get weird about purses it's so hard to get that purse like that with shoes though shoes that purse is just kind of like that when you're knocking it but you're kind of like that am I like with your custom cars like one of the reasons that make it really cool is you're not gonna see that custom car anywhere else that is specifically designed by you that's true but that's not why I like it well I like it is because you could get something that you can't get anywhere else I mean as far as performance like like when I get the like a shark Works car like the white car that car you can't you can't just get that car it's a six-speed manual they don't make six-speed manual gt3 RS s anymore it has a 518 horsepower engine you can get that they board it out they put fat or tires in it they beefed up the suspension they changed everything for sure like you're lost right yeah okay it's pretty custom can't buy those can't buy them right but honestly I'm for Joe that car is like that's a cool-looking car yeah yeah it is but if you got to drive that every day you probably your fucking brains out unless you're one of those renegade dudes let's just like Lorenzo Lamas back in the day wore cowboy boots dust in his hair I feel like that every day at the end of 2017 the total of Ferrari built and sold cars in the whole company history is a hundred nine nine thousand so two hundred thousand ever you said two hundred thousand the year but your clothes wow I was way off that's Joe that's why it's so hard to get one yes yeah it's kind of cool yeah look it is definitely cool that's it's a cool car I mean this is a reason why people want them they don't want shitty cars no they're good car I wouldn't mind they do theirs I think it's a four or maybe thumb I don't know if it's a four eight but they did make that in manual what is so expensive what I like about like custom cars is that they're mechanical like when I talk about like muscle cars or Porsches or stuff like that what I like is that they're mechanical yeah like they're all stick shifts the manual transmissions feel the gears and you feel the burn I like that I love that yeah that's I'm into that for whatever reason but I'm also into that fucking Tesla that Tesla's got me hooked yeah for sure thing puts a smile on my face I know you does it really oh my god more so than when your Porsches nope yeah not more shits gonna walk a different smile different smiles yeah it's like wow the future is weird yeah because it's just it doesn't make you so much more capable no no no no it's not ferocious and no in Ferraris ferocious Wow that noise the engine explosions behind your ear mid-engine car that's a different thing a muscle car that Rumble the fucking big-ass v8 and fat tailpipes that's a different feel you know completely different yeah what you get from a Tesla is like wow every other car just seems stupid it's like you're just making a lot of noise but it just this thing just goes quicker it goes places it's like what the Tesla does it violates what you think the laws of driving are in terms of like how quicker car can get from there to there and it does it with no sound but there's no torque or anything right thousand foot-pounds of toys in just like it's a video game throws you back like the craziest roller coaster you've ever been in yeah it goes 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds you have the little Chris one yeah that's all I always leave it on ludicrous yeah I never why would I yeah I don't drive it you have to drive it like an ass all but when you want to it's right there it's is it using up more of the oh yeah if you want to drive what do they say kids 317 miles my wife likes like Grandma drive ya know like daddy drives it gets like 170 like make it 170 the way I Drive they were saying that out people applying for driver license especially kids like our kids I don't know if they'd even be into cars they just talked to my dad I went how cool is it like tigers it has all he's been all these cool cars hopefully he's into cars when he gets older and my dad's like yeah maybe if he even wants a driver license is now it's solo of kids passing their driving license test because they just uber everywhere morons like it why what why do I pay for a car I'm sure it was a great thing that you don't have to think about like that that does helped a lot like you don't think about drunk being drunk driving drunk you know going to someone's house after the bar it's cool to an option but it's not cool that kids there's something there's some freedom about driving like it there's a good feeling there is it there's also the problem with things like uber is you're gonna get into a car with a person that you don't know and I'm sure most of them are great I'm sure but every now and then you're gonna get into a car with someone who's fucking nuts and they're gonna have some crazy political podcast on want to talk to you about Hillary Clinton's emails there's an option now you know that you can click to they don't talk to you do you want to talk no that's a new option they're doing I don't have to abide by it I don't think it's like a preference the writer like hey by the way as I get in your car I really would prefer you don't talk to me but the driver is like you're in my car fuck yeah but most drivers you might click don't talk if he's like hey I'd like did you did you see that don't talk er yeah move is hey you got you have music up they can turn it up then they usually don't talk mmm but there has been a thing to your point where there's been people you know faking like do bird drives putting the sign on and murdering women there's that yeah there has been that I heard about that recently do like I've been in this and I've been having terrible dreams I didn't get off of it or just figure out how to deal manage it better but I was doing a show on Sirius with Jim Norton and he brought in this the guy who basically created mine hunter he was this like he's interviewed all the serial killers and speaks to him and they brought him in I think his name's John Douglas they brought him in he's just talking it was fascinating let's go shit so I got his book almost finished his book I'm like this is great man and then start listening to a podcast he's on it's just about like murder and death and I started looking up all this Charles Manson stuff that I've been having awful nightmares and been a little depressed and you know me I'm it's very rare I'm down it's just a dark fucking world man yeah you'd watch those true crime shows oh fuck your head aha dude it makes you scared everything but it's also going on it's going on in very small numbers very very small numbers but it is going on what it is is people that have been abused people have been fucked up Psychopaths and people that have been through the correction system through the penal system yeah that's a lot of it's so dark men he's not that many of them and this this guy has three daughters that's like how can I keep staring about this seven-year old terrible story and I was like how can you go home man and sleep he's like eventually you know it's just a job like it does affect me a little bit I'm like do you just lock up your kids like I'd be like just from here knew I I don't my son going to school I don't leave it you think now you learn to manage it and he did say that he's like that this is the exception like there's some dark stuff out there but these gentlemen I interview Charles Manson you've seen how he's five too and he always has to speak over you no matter what's going on so they're in this room there's three people and Charles Manson he got on a chair and stood over and shouted down to him what is he saying find a parent convert him into me man he people made me eat your garbage Man Man Man I'm product of your society man he's fucking crazy he was crazy he has a quote that's reading again I'm too into it man I'm quoting Charles mance and what's going on in my life um he was saying that uh it used to be like you were the exception when you're crazy now everybody's crazy that's what man smoke yeah hmm he's like used to be kind of cool then thing to be crazy now inside everybody's crazy well he made it popular to fuck do you know how popular that fucking crazy serial killer is and all his followers oh my god even to this day like I was reading this article in Rolling Stones how many books and even merch and to Dubai locks of his hair is 50 grams going for 50 grand by locks of his hair and how he sells merch that's 15 grams locks of his hair yeah how much is a lock like what does that mean what does that get you I don't know well you could but I lost out on the bid cut a lock in half I'm saying to say how much oh let's split it put it in here say how many hairs piece though what if he shaves his balls and you give like a saran wrap baggy of his pubes how much does out 100 G's piece of his probably dick piece under jeez dude Charles Manson dick piece he was married when he died some the crazy bitches fine serial killers in jail and marry them happen with Richard Ramirez The Night Stalker there's just a factual thing too and night yeah they some women want to be around killers and even in particular guys have killed women how crazy is that it's very crazy can you imagine when your daughters when their let's say 22 marries a serial core in prison at least you know she's not gonna die but safe look there's people out there I'll have to tell you I do a fucking terrible job of raising their kids you know it's one of the reasons why people like you people like many people to get into being a parent that really enjoy it when you see something like that it's even more disturbing because you know that when you see a serial killer or someone's fucked up that person was a baby that had a terrible life as always they just got a shitty roll the dice they got bad parents usually the moms it's a relationship with the moms that fuck them up not so much the father's usually them it's a mother-son relationship really yeah usually always mother-son and that's what usually causes the holes white Norman Bates from psycho so so dead on right yep he's dealing with his mom his mom yeah and he's the one who literally he's Jeffrey Dahmer Charles Manson it when there's something got like he was talking about Jon Benet which you know I'm from Denver when school and Boulder that was the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case was such a big deal yeah and he still can't sell that they can't they can't sell it no I had a buddy my strength coach doc crease rented it I was like a fucking ghost and moved in there like right after the murders anyway so I handle it freak out now he's cool he's from Louisiana like real tough dude didn't give a fuck you know they must in a chromosome down there yeah you'd be pretty crazy to move in there even it was a great deal and it's a great spot it was for sale four years four years I think you might have knocked it down they should I drop to the OJ Simpson should knock it down they should take out all the dirt and replace it with new dirt yeah the shysters doing everything just knock it down and dig a hole all the way to hell whatever the fuck dirt was there so dirty man but that dude he was just talking talking and it was fascinating I didn't say a word and then went up to Jon Benet I'm like who I'm gonna chime in here cuz I know this case and I know it well and she asked him a question there was like my time to jump in I go yeah but yeah I was probably the parents right or maybe the son and he has to acknowledge me this entire interview I don't know if Jim remember noted this and he goes what did you say I was and I could tell I fucked up I guess it's probably the parents are the son right he is absolutely not absolutely not Brendon and then goes on how ridiculously of an assumption that is and I go well who does he think did it uh he was it's not them he goes the promise is the the narrative that got painted outside of that when everything the media was going crazy and even the putt the boulder police he goes they were so far off and he listed like ten reasons why it wasn't them and I kind of felt like an ad I went very cool I'll buy the book on there shut the fuck up now the only problem was that a handwriting expert had connected the mother's handwriting to the ransom note you get him on this podcast be fucking fascinating doing promotion right now me I have no idea who killed John Johnny Douglas this guy you remember I don't think he knows no no he knows it he can tell you from his seventy years of experience dealing with murders it's not the parents but he had like evidence why it was it I said the same things right I'm balls deep and JonBenet I grew up around it it was like such a culture phenomena did he say who he thinks of it yeah he did I forget but it's not the someone who's alive I don't know you gotta have a marker it was so fast I'm telling you I've listened a shitload of Scioscia's and I was so into this man I didn't promote my special I was their problem i special I didn't say a word yeah I made one stupid calm about JonBenet's family and then he was like shut the fuck up those fucking shows are very compelling then why I'm sure what do you think why are we well like why am i drawn to em i fucked up then why am i drawn to the serial killers you are fucked up you're just like everybody else because I Charles Manson's pubes on eBay how much you pay 70 G's 70 G put his pubes they plucked him out so it has some DNA in them do you could recreate Charles Manson what is it Charles Manson's hair $2,400 bag of hair off the head of Charles Manson was obtained July 2016 from an associate of Charles Manson oh no that's Leo May we'll be a certificate of authenticity will be included upon purchase by the way do you know there are no certificates of authenticity when you come to Charles Manson's hair it's not like there's an accrediting body who's like it's like okay we go over every aspect purchase that's its weak demand you want that 1970s hair straight you don't want the two dated you want to be there when he cuts it off really yeah you want to film him cutting it off and then you want to vacuum seal it and sign it and film the whole thing you put it in one of them fucking vacuum bags and sell and then seal it yeah that way no one's touched it chops right off his hair you got video footage of it you got video footage of him authorized or autographing the bag the fuck is wrong with us why are we talking about this it's fascinating to me did you watch the game of Thrones finale did you get bummed out yeah you know what not somebody else wrote I think they did yeah it's very strange I thought they did I love I did like season eight not as good the other seasons haleyss whose fucking get everybody know right now spoiler alert hold up what is today Thursday yeah yeah but some people it's Sunday some people jobs sunday people work all day for days some people were called read the New York Times like put it on the front page of the paper I'm unclear bro yeah but they did that because they can do that not because they should do this the next days it'll well I think I think I think movies is you got a week movies you got a week on TV show two days damn especially for that what are we not supposed to talk about it cuz you're busy that's insane did you like actor witness no I didn't other satisfied I'd left unsatisfied when they made spoil or homeboy the King I was like what in the fuck are you talking about he didn't want it the whole fucking scene a sudden everybody's fighting to the death over who's the king they're ready ready to stab their brother kill their mom they'll kill anybody they'll betray lovers but now this guy's like alright I'll take it you should be the king they're like okay like that was great and how about that one guy that just stood up and is like maybe I could be the king they like sit down I said citizens just Sopranos like what do you what are you doing which means this guy Bobby Lee has that guy Bobby Lee had the greatest I thought good ending so he says when everyone goes you know when the decided to be the king and then homeboy who's crippled is like I'll do it and then when they were wheeling my way he just looks over and he has the fucking white Walker I that would were and then it closes you know what should happen that's Bobby Lee's idea Jon Snow should have fought to the death with that dude who has no dick yeah I want to see that she's good to the death they hated each other they hate each other how about that dude psych yeah just like yeah she killed my girl CEO big deal just you get on the boat yeah there's no way they should have fought to the death did you like episode 3 I tell you what I like though like when the one that the Hound knocked the mountain off of the fire that was dope that was no it just I was a fire they died I was a dope scene my shit was dope the best scene in the whole fucking series though was when you know the bed's best scene in the whole fucking series when when she was telling that dude that he betrayed her and then from the darkness the Dragons face appears and you're like oh Jesus this is where I was a powerful scene those dragons are so fuck so scary I'm so happy there's people out there that do special effects like that that shit was dope cuz he used to be kind of like samurai corny like super corny you remember was that movie there was a good dragon movie with Matthew McConaughey back when Matthew McConaughey was jacked up in the show homeboy from Australia was in a to Batman fucks his name ah fuck what's his name Christian berenstain bears two barrels in a chicken fire what does it call rain of fire yeah the dragons in there were corny compared to the kings of Thrones be believe me see let me see a video that public obviously we can't show it on the podcast or we'll get arrested and castrate joe carnahan was just talking about this bro this fucking movie was not a bad movie it was a little corny but for a dummy like me who really likes dragons it was great stuff it was an interesting movie but the Dragons it's just crazy how much because I want to say this was probably 2004 I might correct for that too - then - I was pretty close yeah pretty close you've been on but the difference between what the Dragons looked like seventeen years later in terms flex payments even dinosaurs from dress park one to dress park world yeah like look at them they look not showing you much that's that's a dragon's vision though it's kind of gay oh why is it dragon's vision homosexual I'd wish to see when I said why did I say that because you're a man why is it and we've been doing our whole lives I know why relearn it I know we got to reprogram our brains dude how about with Charlemagne ah I said bitch I went now that bitch is hot and he goes he goes in 2019 you're still calling women bitches I went no but you weren't but yes yeah but what if he said that might get a good point um sometimes I do it on accent like when we're watching fight wanna do a fight campaign right right and that bitch is top but you know it's all here's the thing man context yes don't make more words toxic it's all about intent like what are you trying to say like if if a girl is a beast and she's just a badass woman and she walks out and she's got I'm good and she's got like this crazy tight skirt on his bangin body that she's worked hard out in the gym and she's got a beautiful dress and she looks great like damn that bitch is hot that is not negative it's not negative is it derogatory though but does it no but it's not negative if you go you fucking silly bitch to me I'll laugh on the floor I'll start laughing like you can call me a bitch and I think it's funny yeah but if you like hey man you know you know fuction made fun of me on the podcast bro that was a bitch move I'm like hey whoa whoa whoa but it's the same thing is like when I car drives by black guy motherfuckers bad yeah but if the guy roll down as well as a que motherfucker right different yeah it's intense the problem is when you have a word you can't say the word has too much goddamn power it's not that you should say the word like don't get me wrong like there's certain words you probably shouldn't say because we've all agreed that those words have a negative impact the f-word probably right AG that's probably one we stay away free fall agreed yeah we've all agreed it has a negative impact on people but the real problem is intent the real problem is homophobic behavior and that in the or homophobic thinkin homophobic ideology thought process is thinking the gay people are bad thinking there's anything wrong with being gay that's the real problem if there was no problem with that at all I just feel like I feel like it's not the right move to make words the problem the problem is the way people think and behave and I think ultimately this is a real problem with language itself because I think language is too limited I think we're when you have magic words you can't say and they have all this extra power connected to gives them power Lenny Bruce talked about that in the 60s he had a great bit about that about saying all these words because you could take away the meaning of him and it won't hurt anybody's feelings anymore but don't you think if let's say you are a homosexual and gay is like that's what yeah I referred you as gay is such a negative connotation cuz growing up gay meant like not good mm-hmm so I'm like God you look gay dude yeah that cars gay right right right yeah that's a problem showing great and the problem is it's such a good sound for that thought fun word the same thing is like calling someone a faggot you faggot like that word like when you say it like that even if it's your friend like your best friend it's got that sighs what make us laugh cuz it sounds good it's got a pop to it with that it starts with a fuck you it starts with an F it's yeah has zero to do with being gay but you can't say it anymore no it's a people's feelings like when Mike Tyson goes I'm gonna fuck you till you love me faggot right right right they make sense yeah you're a fucker guy and call him a faggot that was but you're fucking hit you're trying to fuck him who was the fucking reporter he was young because that guy is that guy did he vanish off the face of the earth after that and I'd like to know was that kind of us I was ringside when da wall door knocked out Brazil I was all that with my brother bro dude bro dude that guy it's a and I've been a lot of been in fights I've been knocked out I've been at UFC fights where dudes get knocked out I have never in my life heard someone getting knocked out like that my brother goes oh my god braw do this oh my god and where they satisfy his family mmm and it ruined it for me because you can't cheer I saw the wife I just I just went oh my god I didn't cheer I wouldn't cheer anyway but I was just like oh my god and this is the funniest part is my boy rabbit to Brian Brian daily at Showtime just so in between rounds probably two and three Jim Gray is gonna come an interview about your Showtime special you I'll be cool they tell me the day before so you get this nice outfit my brother's work did you really think he was gonna get to go under for I didn't think one round but I thought there was a chance they sent me there Jim gay he's gonna come then do so Irish pride get out of here huh thank you John dude I'm telling you man he sounds so special man yeah he's such a good dude you've never had a hurry on he was amazing he's great he had a great time how passion is he's a sweetheart he was like a really nice guy that was my problem with him going oh I want to murder this guy I want to kill this guy I don't want exercise my right oh my god I expect that from these for like a better term these animals these guys want at your level but he's such a good person I'm like God dude don't do that because they can paint you into that box I believe that's gonna just go away but it's gone that's gone it's gone his performance is so spectacular I think it goes away but I think it's also that was his legitimate mindset at that time you know I mean that guy if you listen to my podcast when I interviewed him talked about how he got into boxing because of his daughter you stood on yours as well talk about that yeah that's a special person man I mean he became a bronze medalist in the Olympics after a year and a half of boxing that's insane especially that's insane man you got to imagine he was bog if he was in a year and a half of boxing and he's entering Olympics he's gonna be having matches against guys who have 10 years experience easing hundreds of fights 101 fights yeah hundreds and he's got like virtually no experience and he's not like the slickest guy in the world either so he has to be able to take a shot but he's got two giant advantages huge reach and ridiculous power and I felt lettuce isn't because yeah and I think because of the fact that he's not a big heavyweight I don't think it's as tired as they do I agree thank you see I mean this might have the heaviest he's ever been he came in at 223 and what did he know I went that's interesting cuz usually - 14 - 13 - he punches so hard man he's the scariest heavyweight knockout artist since Mike Tyson 100% when he was walking are you great when he's walking I looked at my brother I went I went you know how you feel right now you goosebumps I went imagine being on Mike Tyson fighting in his prime how that fucking crowd must have felt yeah because when he was walking out I felt so bad for Brazil cuz I'm like we're Nexus family I'm like he's such an underdog he's gonna get knocked out we're ceiling I think we're gonna see that with Deontay Wilder I think Deontay Wilder Zanu Mike Tyson 100% I think he's the new Mike it's not hard you know what's instrument everyone gives me shit like you're such a Hummer so you work for Showtime no no here's the thing about that Joe what people don't realize is Deonte while his fights are on Showtime he's an independent contractor he doesn't have a promoter he's his team you know the soda zone offered him hundreds of millions of dollars same as they offered Joshua and Cannell he turned it down damn you know why because he wants he wants to fight Joshua's fight fury goes well if I'm with them that's gonna limit me fight inferior Joshua if I'm independent I can fight Joshua I can fight Wilder if I was a Wilder I'd be terrified right now why do you think they I mean not Wilder rather a fury Joshua or fewer I'd be terrified of that my that mindset easier fights yeah but he's the scariest fight of all time in the fucking 12th round when he cracks Tyson Furion drops him like that like in the 12th round he still has this ridiculous power and he's only getting better but I think what happens is him it's more likely especially looking at the way promoters work you didn't get Joshua verse Wilder before you get fury oh I think so oh yeah I'm fine I want all three of them I do thank these fucks oh it these fucks its context remember these fucks oh it to boxing yes to the like see a box and a fight each other well it's one of those rare moments in the heavyweight division where you have three unbelievably compelling guys and then one of them was a former champion who by the way the last fight was a draw and I thought he shouldn't want a decision so if you look at it I thought he shouldn't want a decision but I agree with the results until this is what's real squirrely creech because the way Wilder heard him dropped him and then knocked him down and almost had him flatlined in the 12th and if you go over the actual count the actual 10 count from 1 to 10 from the time he dropped which is not what Tyson series jobs is Tyson fairies jobs get up in the referee says 9 and he did that he did that but if you go by an actual client having a 12 in it yeah you go buy an actual clock about 11 times yeah it's high sin fury lost that 10 count but fear of beauty one of the rounds yes sir he one more round hands down yep oxen yeah right that count was longer than 10 yeah he not he should have if you were just going by 10 seconds Deontay Wilder has a real argument that she should have won by knockout here's the thing that's why I like the draw yes that's why the draws are fantastic her cool run it back let's get a clear winner yeah and then Joshua who's this animal out there who's just this fucking he's so damn good he's like honestly though what the fuck is a 10 count for if it's not 10 seconds why is the referee human Eric count human error there should be in every fucking corner every corner wherever the fight is there should be a clock and then when someone goes down someone else not the referee hits that button the second one oh you can really do three four five six could you go one two three four yeah five yeah but he goes wow god he's jacked up with adrenaline there's a huge knock out the crowd I want a guy to get up you might want to gotta get up you might want to help but he may take extra time to rub the gloves on his chest rat ask him a couple questions okay walk towards me walk towards me what's today's date you could do all that shit you could give him a little bit of a break do you like the hoot human air part like same with baseball like the amps they fuck up no all the time to the greatest of the greats like Herb Dean and John McCarthy have they made mistakes you it is impossible fuck up Herb Dean is the goddamn gold standard he's the best of the best of people workers day and he will occasionally say that he made an error yeah hazing amazing fucking people make mistakes they're human beings and I think is that John no bro their job is so I fuck up all the time when I do commentary and their job is so much harder than mine so much harder all I'm doing is talking while the fights going on but they're they're deciding if the fight ends I disagree but you're the voice sounds like a mattis's bro it's not that hard to watch another organization go watch another or when you're not working since it not be different I'm not being humble I'm just telling you something that Hardy brother I'm telling you it's a tough fucking gig don't watch another fight go go watch go watch two zone when Canelo fought it was so bad it was comical who was doing the commentary not sure does it matter good it was so bad it ruined the fight that kind of is so bad it was entertained well they were so Pro Canelo and they just weren't it wasn't professionally done you know who I'd like that is in a world of shit right now you get you talking MMA or boxing who Paulie Malignaggi was asked why does he spit on people what's he doing dude he's a great commentator man I mean the best play he's the best well I think my number one favorite why here's here's my three top that I get excited when they're doing same as mine Roy Jones jr. Andre Ward and Paulie Malignaggi I think it's Andre and Paulie they're both you can switch other reasons why I like Roy Mike was Roy niced yeah that's okay though this is why when he was at his best he was the motherfucker of all motherfuckers he was like Floyd Mayweather but he was knocking people dead he was putting his hands behind his back and not just people out he was doing shit that no one could do he was fucking people up Roy Jones jr. went on a streak for a long time where he was he had this freak athleticism in this he didn't even throw jabs half the time you finish oh my god so sorry about him well you know when Glen Johnson K Odom when magic man kod him with that but that was but he had this run of greatness that we should appreciate like like when I think of Anderson Silva I don't think of him bitching out cuz got kicked against Conair no I think a vanished Silva in front he can beat doorbell for front kick and fucking you know all these guys like of course I think of that yeah so it's weird with Roy well because he's current like he just got knocked down Russia like six days ago or whatever did he really no but you recently got knocked down Russia but I thought he won his last fight I think one is laughs I know it's going to be his last well hopefully see I don't know yeah paulie's amazing though but Paulie when he when he was gonna fight that bare-knuckle I went a little bit of rent on my me and Paulie are close man I went on a rant how saying I don't think he should do it and it I feel like he's punching down he's one of the best commentators here's a job so many people want then of course me and probably work together so we're breaking down the wilder Brazil fight in New York and there was this weird apology in the air of this there I felt like there's this weird kind of well of course I mean you're telling him not to do something that he's definitely gonna do yeah I know so you're resisting his idea look but if I was doing something you don't want me to do if you're doing something right and we have an open conversation there's no weirdness like I can't we talked about if Paulie went up to him is like dude I'm doing it so not this fuck out didn't hopefully I get McGregor out and also I'm just kind of bored with my life man this could be fun for me I went oh cool man I support you there's no I'm not shaming him I agree with you I'm glad I feel where you're coming from and I agree that I would want you to tell me if you thought it was fucking out but it was a bad idea but I think that with a guy like him you know this is you know I don't know what kind of options he has nobody's beating down his door to fight him you know that I know that Connor didn't want to fight him he wasn't interested in that and I don't know other what other options he's got for boxing but also so but then that's why he's not the greatest analyst in the game but he if he's gonna fight a bare-knuckle boxing fight like this got it he there's got to be a financial motive for that that's I would hope now the only thing that makes sense is that that's a financial motive but listen Showtime pays him you know Showtime pays him well do they what yeah man yeah so it's like to do that you know you look at the payday like our tomato I think fifty thousand for the last fight so let's so say they pay him triple let's say payment quadruple let's say he's made what is that fucking two hundred fifty thousand dollars it's not enough to do a bare-knuckle fight when you're making six figures um you know you could get your face fucked up too that's the reality those knuckles man I'm changing my tune a little bit but not all the one you got a little pin Joe a little bit but here's the thing like you you do get caught up more in bare-knuckle boxing but you're also not kicking or using takedowns or anything else in bare-knuckle boxing I think it'd be way more brutal if there's takedown and kicks because with maybe I don't think the best guy wins also in bare-knuckle because you know Paulie has way more fighting experience than Artem right so he's got more scar tissue so if there's a guy with a ton of scar tissue your face opens up like a it looks like a murder scene thinking Charles Manson murder scene because of the knuckles yeah that's cut so he may you might land seven shots to his - but your face is fucked up instantly nothing cuts you about more than elbows and elbows are 100% legal in the UFC and the the scariest unless his ground and pound mmm yeah like state where like I can't like John can well she does that how about Johnny Walker Johnny walkers got nasty really good fuck yes he really heard heard from at all right I think he recovered like whatever was wrong with his shoulder recovered but the reality is if you're if you hurt yourself so bad that you can't move your arm afterwards just coming from someone who's had some shoulder injuries that to me is like you got some damage in there you know why else it's alarming because when he did it his adrenaline was so high usually you can go through some shit if you got hurt bad enough where your Adrenaline's yeah I mean you're you just want a huge fight you're doing the worm yeah after a victory and you can feel the pain that's when I I'll fuck there's there's probably damage there yeah cuz you're selling so high it numbs every just imagine if that one's up defining his career I hope to develop shoulder problems I hope not all right over clovers had some serious shoulder problems ever since the John fight it's not so 70 years old how dare you he's been fighting in Brazil since he was three but when John grabbed his arm and yanked it back when Glover was the top contender remember yeah got him in that over hook and ripped his fucking arm up my bro that was I never saw anybody do that before I was like that's genius that's a really smart thing because that you're fucking super vulnerable in that position no one really thinks of Americans graphing us yup just yanked it shoulder ons the goat has to go he's eager lows well he it's him and the best expression in terms of like what I've seen in the Octagon is Mighty Mouse but he just didn't fight the flow of competition except for pseudo we're finding out so who knows the fucking man so it and my team s you know I love fucking my mouth a hymn or giant can do one or two the problem with him being number one is that that weight class the the margin of error is way higher so if I go if Isaac left when I should Zeke right right I'm not getting knocked down I can learn from go back if John zigs left one should win it right by Glover he's gonna knock the fuck out maybe the margins are so small John can take a shot but if it's Rumble Johnson he's getting knocked out maybe yeah we don't know sounds that good but though she was Mighty Mouse so when he beats her who - right soon at seven fights the first time and smoked them so who gains experience then he beats them mm-hmm yep so that takes the pound-for-pound that takes a little off of Mighty Mouse but I think he's Julian when pseudo beat him it's so tough to town yeah it's tough it's fucking listen if they would give to Mighty Mouse owned a bit matter I would've been married you how about your boy sage Northcutt yeah Cosmo Cosmo killed a guy he's a beast the stage is still in the hospital seventeen fractures in his face yeah I know he's still not what you killed a guy Hobbs you know Sergey Kovalev did yeah I know Kovalev killed a guy in a fight um Cosmo Alexander is a world-class Muay Thai fighter I mean John Wayne Parr fought him you know he fought Nicky hold skin he's world class as far as striking it's a completely different level but I guess because it was an MMA fight he was willing to take it but they say foot they fought stand up for man and sage took that karate stance and the dude circled off to his right and landed that fucking right hand and it was on the possess the hardest right hand I've ever seen I was can you imagine just up from a world-class striker with the four ounce gloves on and he's circling in to the right yeah and it's like a fucking bomb it's pretty goddamn strong and cosmos a beast of a man you mean he's a big thick dude see I mean a big thick dude with multiple world titles to his name don't you feel bad watching us - do you feel bad for say yeah it's a terrible matchup I don't know why they agreed to let him fight that guy boo it's just not smart because that because the the kickboxing the stand-up like he doesn't have the experience age is good he's very good but these these kind of losses are terrible for a few for his future because their mismanagement losses in my opinion I agree I think sage is what 22 like look at that punch the plans I mean that is ferocious from a world-class right left full blast to that is a full blast Circle right you can't you can't get hit cleaner than that no you came hip it's be hard to hit a fucking but me why have you ever seen him when he fought Nicky holtz-eakin Cosmo yeah yeah get up class Michigan fuck fuck ha there's the levels there's levels but in MMA Sage's and even rement be they should be shin Se marine well colleges though why would why would I bring this this stud this American stud who looks like right from Street Fighter and go hey first fight here's the most world-class striker we on the roster well because they want him to be tested and I think that if I was chatri I would be looking at it like this when a guy like Eddie Alvarez gets K out or a guy like sage Northcutt gets Kayode or a guy like Mighty Mouse gets tagged and has a real fight on his hands then you're showing the whole world like hey these guys that are coming over here that are world-class fighters they're fighting world-class fighters I get knocked out I get that here another it's a great single for him I think certain it certain so with Eddie Alvarez veteran he should be fight hall-of-famer Bellator champ UFC champ give him the best she got he's seen it all right be tough to get Berlin past him sage Northcutt my team asked him the best she got he's seen it all good luck getting past him sage Northcutt you're investing in his future he's not ready it's Chris boring you've kind of fucked them man well I'm also you try and get in the American market but cosmos not an MMA fighter that's the thing this is cosmos first MMA fight what if sages takes him down and smashes that would have been great yeah but I mean that could have happened to so when cosmos I say style he's not a grappler okay but he knows how to grapple sage is taking guys down in the Octagon before taking Kozma easier than said he's strain with me and Rashad at black ceilings and fuck us up did he yeah a nightmare yeah so I saw it for saved I'm like right well so he's building Cosmo he's older man well he's only 34 37 is he three seven has 1,000 kickboxing matches like you're gonna invest in that now it's a business aspect doesn't make sense to I think it does though because it shows with two giant results over the last two months that one has world-class talent there and I think it makes people pay more attention to one not me it put me off of him really yeah that's fucked up no see listen man i'ma say no is a fucking Muay Thai fighter I mean that's his bread and butter he fights more time stands his bread butter so when Cosmo goes and fights in an MMA fight you would think at least in one area is gonna be at a disadvantage if State Sage chooses to have a stand-up fight with a world-class stand-up fighter that's just bad strategy that stages game those visor game but he's a mixed martial arts fighter then he should become a kickboxer if that's his game it's just to stand up and strike at people then just stay a kickboxer because if you're gonna fight listen man if you're gonna fight in MMA in MMA you could do everything what do you want to do in this fight don't you want to win okay good I want you to win here's how you win you don't stand with one of the best fucking strikers in the world how old is he 22 saij come on yeah yeah but you just tell him this is exercise strategy you you keep that side stance that's fine bait him in but then shoot just get the clinch and drag that motherfucker to the ground let's wear him out I'm with you which he's never done any fight ever so put Letty that's taking guys down before yeah but let's say you serious manager and they go hey here's Cosmo hold on let's just let me go through this with you Sage pros you beat a straight world-class kickboxer in MMA he's also 37 years old a lot of pros cons okay but he's 37 can take him down he fucking starches you and your face it's broke in 17 places and your your career is probably not going well the trajectory is definitely off the rails pros cons that's it's just if you look at the way boxing has always done it and it's been often criticized but there's some real good points to it about developing a fighter you give her a fighter a difficult fight that you think that he has the advantage in but it's an advantage that will teach him to some things like the phone the guy fights with them what is this Jamie cosmos ninth fight was against age oh he's had a bunch of MMA fights why did he say that he knocks out everybody he set it on his um his uh his what the fuck is Instagram post about he's nobody doesn't fight MMA he's no fucking on jello Jesus Christ yeah starch everyone well championship guys here you go yeah years I guess oh so oh you donate cuz he's training with the best of the best as well bottom line is as a striker he's superb yeah he's fucking but then it's more crazy thing is pull up the Nicki Holtz can fight Nicky Holtz can knocks out Cosmo Alexandra that just shows you how many levels there are to put then Nikki whole skin just lost to regen ersal just lost to him got dropped with Annie it's so interesting man when you see levels upon levels upon levels and you don't necessarily know that these levels even exist unless your balls deep in the fucking sport like you see a guy like Nikki first of all Nikki's like one of the best body punchers in kickboxing ever and this is a kickboxing fight as opposed to a Muay Thai fight as well so no elbows limited clinching and you can only hold for like three seconds when you and throw a knee you can only like you can only hold while you're like think one knee at a time or something that they have weird rules you know here's the thing the fact that Cosmo Alexander went toe-to-toe with Nikki Holton I'm probably up your ass on my young 22 year old yeah wide-eyed youngster fighting him Nikki hoes can had an amazing career in glory to some fucking incredible son Joseph Volta Levi were he knocked him out in the last round yeah he's he's a beast man super super tech although it's just tough as shit yeah I mean look at just the way these guys are standing front just checking everything technique perfect perfect instinct perfect defense oh we dropped him with that left hook yeah look Holt's getting some a monster this is by the way a kickboxing fight whole Skeen also fought Cosmo Alexander and knocked him out in one Fc this is uh this is it's show time in Amsterdam this is quite a few years ago it's show time was the shit managed to get it on access TV back when access TV was HD net you know that Mark Cuban's fucking that was dope that MMA live with yes I should go on there all the time that's routing yeah and who's the other guy that bas fruit was on

gonna get hammered dad wouldn't mind stick around yeah juice some arrows shoot some arrows getting the flow tank relax my friend relax so was there some other good fights that happened this weekend oh dude how bout the San Jose versus Kevin Lee um I didn't see it bro again I was at the wilder fight I missed that I notice on just look good and be Kevin Lee needs a new camp heavenly needs a camp yeah yeah I think Kevin Lee should go to for us a hobby that's my advice or Jackson's well the reason why for us a hobby is because Kevin Lee skill set is very similar to Georges st. Pierre striking Leduc very athletic impressive and grounding timing of the takedowns nobody knows how to coach that better than for our army it's a good idea yeah it's not bad at all it's all right thank who don't peek oh just went to Jackson's yes I think that's a great move to opine oh yeah I hooked him up with my boy Vinny Charmin - so I I told him that I think that he should go to Frost hobbies and I told him about Vinnie Sherman who's an incredible mental coach you know he's gonna be champ I actually believe that if he gets a shit together and goes to a legit camp because you remember his coach passed away right yeah and the pholis who was very close to such a shame amazing amazing guy and so he passed away and then it was like he was like I'll just stay here and together this kind of ragtag group and we'll figure it out at the the UFC now is it such a high level to compete with the guys he's competing with you gotta have a good camp man like a legit yeah ouch head coach leader it's no disrespect to any of small camps or small gyms no I'm not I'm not trying to be I'm just saying that an athlete has a small fucking window man like Kevin is 26 right so he's got 10 years as long as what's three out of his last four yeah not good us you don't play with that and before that he was just a PFA eating guys in pretty spectacular fashion right Robert foulest his death had a tremendous impact on him as a fighter as a person and then he fought some really great fighters too on top of that you know and a like went oh man I mean from the jump of that fight from the the get-go and he hit him with that spinning backfist you let him know like this is you're in a dogfight I said that Tony Ferguson fight was a dog fight a dog fight a dog fight yeah these guys have dog fights and when the toady ferguson fight he had a staph infection clear 100% and he looked good 20 pounds was going down that choked out god is like fucking a head man look when you have a you've had staff before right yeah that's awful and the way it drains your body drains your body well the staff does too I mean if you get it - as far as where it is with him he's in a full infection he has a full infection so it's in his bloodstream but the thing that fucks your cardio and your energy like no other in the antibiotics fuck you so they do but so does the staff especially when it's that bad I mean he's got a fucking a giant squirrel growing out of his tit remember that what they told DC nuts and that's I saw it immediately he walked through the Octagon I'm like he's got staph I got that staph decent I say I go hey to DC I go is that staff it looks like staph to me and they go do not talk about the staff he goes that looks like staff to me these he doesn't give a lot of them like bitchy talking to Daniel Cormier can help you talk about the guy who knows staff better anyone that goddamn Elina got here it's he's a wrestling coach listen we would be doing a massive disservice to the viewing public if we didn't admit that it was staff it's a fart it's part of the drama it's part of what makes the fights interesting but my take on Kevin Lee is he's a great guy I really I'm gonna have him on again he's gonna come on against the best he's a great person I like talking to mark because I'll put him on the food truck diary okay he's great I'll text you about two shots with you what everyone odd or about it but anyway I visit there's a defining moment in a fighter's career when they realize they need to make changes they're not doing things the way they should be doing them and they need to make some change but but I think one of the reasons why you care and I care especially with Kevin if it was somebody else some other guys won't mention names with Kevin I go well no he can be chanting he just has to change a few things here you see this kids champion the other kind of nice badge to keep doing what you do he hundred one hundred percent is the skills and the mindset he has the full package he looks good speaks good dress as well has the skills sign me up he's a good person too we're talking you talk to him he's gonna feel it yeah he's just gotta make some changes and he needs a maestro he needs a fucking conductor he needs a Greg Jackie's Duke Rufus I'm Mike Brown at atm yep yep do that Dustin Poirier on food diaries and amazing I'm sorry not Mike Brown that doesn't poor young but he's thought about Mike Brown how great he is and this in the diamond pouria and he started talking about his wife dude I am balls deep in the chicken waffles eating the food truck you know stuff and he starts talking about her and we're probably thirty minutes in I start again Terry OTT he starts getting teary eyed he was just talking about how because I was telling like just a long journey how have you not like I can't believe you didn't stop at some point like you've been doing since you're 18 having nothing stopped and he goes I would he was on say here's I haven't said this before I would have stopped like I've thought about retiring and my wife told me I can't she's like give me these pep talks and like that's nuts man how long you been with us oh she drove me on my first fight my first fight before I got in the car I get emotional because before I got the car she told me her me world champion dude I got shit I'm like dude you give me fuckin chills I like well not cuz you are champ people always in turn champ I don't care let's party chain one of the best fighters on earth pound for pound I'm 45 great yeah top 3 be the best 145 pounder ever and he's without a doubt one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world Dustin beat him yep yeah there's no doubt about it so he said he's a champ in some form he still he has a belt you know you made it and I told her I said I'm terrible at this so this is me telling you this by me deflecting what I should be doing but you know you're gonna fight kabhi and I said I don't give a fuck how that fight goes you've done it brother when you were 18 you decided to go on this journey become UFC champion you had all these dreams your wife how many sacrifices you guys have a little girl now and you're there man I said I don't care if could be beat your ass for five rounds you've done it dude how crit I went please didn't want to hear that though nobody wants to hear I don't care if could be not only but boy well I'm telling this you have succeeded mission accomplished mother yeah mission accomplished how crazy that tear mission accomplished what did he think though probably doesn't think like that I probably thinks he's still in the quest I don't think you can do you think like that do I think the guys who have that weird engine in them don't think like that I never like I've never felt more not to make it about I've never felt more pressure my life to come up with new become a better comic than when I released my special of course I'm like oh shit now now the work starts that was whatever do you have the works don't ever satisfy with myself more than like 15 20 minutes a week 15 minutes where I was I couldn't tell you was I've seen 20 minutes a week I'll have a glass of wine I'll put my feet up I'll kick back and then that little voice in the back of my head it's like are you doing everything you can do get up come on it's kind of a kind of a demon though is Joe like I represent like my one of my dreams was to buy the car that I bought and I bought it we're in bed my girl goes how do you feel it exactly the same like I think what you like material things they don't matter at all and then they say we wake up my my I get out with my son every morning and we always watch cars on YouTube and she was what the I'm watching a different car she goes what the fuck you like looking in the next car she's like there's no way I'm like I need I need goals yes usually about a bottle house I swear to God the next morning she was what are you doing truly go looking at the next house I don't know what to do no that's not my message to dust it was enjoy but don't get the thing about stuff though as opposed to like goals is like stuff you could always just keep buying stuff and making money to buy stuff and then you find yourself being one of those people that just does stuff for money because you want to buy the stuff I've never done that but there are people like the out there right you know I've heard Steve Harvey talk about money like how much money he wants to make per year and and someone was making fun of it and I was thinking well he's in this vibe where he's trying to get stuff and and make money and you got to make money to get stuff and you get sort of in this game of accumulating more and bigger and better things for me the most important thing is the stuff that I put out if people like it because I do a podcast if I do a UFC and I suck if I stumble through something or I make a bad call or it's not that shit will fuck be up for days and there's nothing you do nothing I can do to fix it you know amber Guinea Ferrari it's like there's nothing I wouldn't do a damn thing so the same with a podcast if I do a podcast that doesn't go well if I do a set the set doesn't go well or stumble through a joke all I care about is the stuff that I do in terms of like agree like progress all my progress and that I'll distract myself with stuff but like just watch cross like 50 bucks or something I don't know yeah I'm done that's a Taser not 50 it's like 300 bucks maybe you know I'm saying but it doesn't matter whether that 500 or 300 bucks or this is 22 grand not a big deal 22 grand it doesn't matter American money gasps don't call cash no big deal Rolex locking yeah it's talking shit you're just talking shit like but nobody looks my point is is it's like that doesn't make you happy doesn't make you feel any weight this doesn't make me feel anyway none of it the more I learned the more I accumulate these material things it does nothing that means shit is your friends and your loved ones and what you're trying to do with your life Bob Dylan said it best said they said you know what's what's success to you he goes not having to work for assholes and waking up going to bed doing exactly what I want yeah boom she already doing I'm already doing that yeah the only time I ever felt I guess somewhat successful I'd really don't but the only time so I felt a little successful is when I turned down a big gig on a major Network to do TV I went mmm not kind of good man I'm good doing what I want to do and I own all this stuff and I don't I don't I'm not pressed to do it do you imagine what would be like if you had a boss remember the shit that you guys were dealing with it Fox we were telling you to stop cursing on the fighter and the kid hilarious just imagine how bad that advice is think about how many fucking millions of downloads of the fighter and the kid have been out there how many humans on the planet earth have you could see an overhead map of all the people on the planet a light went off every time I dude was listening to fire in the kid you're like holy fuck it would freak you out see that number and that Fox guy was like huh clean it up wife you know what that guy told me to I started arguing with them he kind of got my face went just like you have your black belt in the Octagon I got my black belt in TV no it's cool shit God did he really say that this guy was blackballed on TV let me tell you he got fired from Fox but of course you did the dirty little secret is about all those guys they don't know what the fuck they're doing they find talented people they have no idea if you get if you get fucking max Keller man you get all those guys those are the guys that are on your television show television shows gonna do well if those are the guys that are doing commentary for you they're excellent they're coming telling you're gonna listen to it you're not a great producer that's not well that shows great know you silent you fucks yeah when you tell a podcast the one free medium left on the planet Earth well you can distribute to millions of people and no one can tell you what the fuck to do there's not another thing like it on earth not one not one maybe websites but it's telling the really content you can get yeah and to be able to have that with no producer no executive no filter and to have it available to you while you're doing other stuff right you could be mowing your lawn right now it's in your ear you're running it's in your ear you're driving to work it's in your ear you're on subways you know people to like if let's say you were 2019 Jay Leno I think that's what you write this I doing a shows this girl are doing Johnny Carson at the time right let's say you're that guy see it's that overproduced show yeah no one really gets to know did you know Johnny Carson from The Tonight Show did you know Jay Leno no no it's when when they went on do stuff after the fact but now people know you pretty fucking well you don't know me pretty well pretty well yeah you don't bore tea or not yeah it's different it's different but even Conan talked about that how you know when he was doing the Conan I heard my word Stern and he was doing he said what I do the Conan show and you know we had a band and it would I was going through this interview but I had to stop it like I was in balls-deep in this interview man I have to stop it because the bands playing we got to get to that or we get to the next bit he's like no no just let me go man let me have this conversation yeah so he's even come over to podcasting and even Howard stringers well that's one of the reasons I want to do long for him it's because they want to over produce all the stuff but if I have to get to you know I want to talk to somebody I wanna get to know him I don't want to cut to commercial breaks I don't have to cut for this band or this bit you want to you know let me talk to this guy well there's a lot of guys that are still cutting their podcast off with commercials they'll stop in the middle and do a commercial do you guys do that we've done it before I don't know if we currently do we just left our current advertisers was a nightmare we just signed with Paragon shout out to Paragon so you know I don't know sometimes we might sometimes you might Joe to be honest with you but but you know what we are doing is you're gonna do it you're only gonna do it once right once yeah but whatever we're looking in this thing is so when we do our Reed I don't you guys do it before but in there's no video but we do it mean Theo do it together on camera and have fun with it so it's part of the show yeah different animal that's that may feel doing read for you you're gonna read this financial thing and he goes and you can save I think seventy-five dollars a year and I when I said seventy-five dollars yeah you know I didn't pretty read out $75 I kind of crack and then Thea goes yeah a smooth $75 here do the financial people get mad at you I don't know I don't give a fuck we're laughing so hard I yeah and get $75 is that really what they're offering I'd forget my seventy seventy five hundred seventy five but or seventy five hundred different if I forget what it was because I earn fifty it was some oh yeah I was something super low and I could not stop laughing then Theo start laughing they left it in I feel like that reader do better than the others maybe but it would be do it would do better in terms of financial I mean about in terms of clicks but it probably wouldn't do better in terms of people like going there and using the product it's funny great thing doesn't matter doesn't matter yeah we got we'll find someone else yeah that's the thing it's like an animal you have too many podcast sponsors these days I'd say no to them every day I get tons of you coming in yeah bet but it's not it's got to make some sense that's can connect with what your thing - it's like got to be a valuable product yeah you gave me the best advice ever when when I started doing advertising on podcasts cuz there's a while before start doing you know you better believe in it man you sell shit people have stopped tuning in they're not gonna believe you I've had a bunch of things that I turned down because I researched it and I was like what is this how does that work yeah but what's good at that I was like oh this is sketchy there was one of them they want to do an uber for babysitting I'm like yeah that's a fuck out of here though you're praising the biggest argument count I ever got in our fucking 90 year relationship is Burger King came towards us and I I grew up eating Burger King man I grew up in whopper with cheese not every day but I'd fucking have when we got them American Ryan said no yeah he can't push that off when we had a straight-up argument had an end I think we did Bert came hungry and they're open yeah fucking a whopper with cheese best burger on planet Earth fuck you an arrow this whopper with cheese makes me take you to a doctor right now get a cat what do you like Apple fucking double from in and outs no I kept doing them and I - or Five Guys Burgers up fat burger five guys over in five guys we can agree on one thing not five not not in and out what's in it for someone much for number one I like five guys and I like in and out like five guys number one though yeah I think I like five guys better because five guys offers bacon and also jalapenos one the speed of in and out of said deterrent to sometimes dared you the one right up here though right five guys doesn't do the drive to like bitch sit down come on in and they have milkshakes at in and out that's a big plus if you're ready to fuck your body up with some poison food that tastes great shell shakes us do it to you so they'll give it to dude I've been so stressed out with this special my diet you might work out something create my Dyson like a girls pregnant yeah pickles and ice cream my girl might be pregnant yeah yeah man been eating pizza every night oh I don't know what it is dude I'm gonna fire stress they've actually said that the people under stress make poor decisions poor decisions eating everything that's been great to really yeah people people make poor decisions food wise I did by frying I've eat pizza every night me you might be onto something yeah I think you're freaking out I'm not freaking out though a little bit you think it's okay and we'll figure that normal no no you're not freaking out but your inner stress you look nobody is just getting judged by hundreds of thousands of people's very weird it's weird yeah it's weird and every time I do it I stay offline for weeks yeah that's what you told me snap line read it like I do my best I try hard I do my best and you might like it you might not like it but I do my best and when I'm done as long as I know I did my best I can just release it yeah I've been able to do that for triggered and I did that for strange times over I was like I'm good I'm good I mean you might like that you might not like it but I couldn't have done it better you know my thing is is the I think with anything is you get more popular with with it's do podcasting or stand-up or whatever you do if you're an artist you put on an album if you're painting or put out a painting if you're a fighter take a fight it's a big fight and you attract more eyeballs you need a lot more people that love it they need a lot of you can get more hate because you're out there more yeah so also you're being shoved down people's faces yeah when you do a lot of press yeah man that's why I don't do press it's one of the reasons why I deliver you don't have to anybody have to listen to me I don't I don't I don't you're at such a different level that I have to do you know but I don't do it for stand up anymore when I go to dance on a depressed anymore yeah but then you're getting 100% your fans yes and and also with with the special it's different because I didn't want like our group like you guys who vouch for me or especially Showtime who was like let's give to get a special I didn't want to embarrassed I want it to go well for them like you know yeah no I know what you said like I want them back I we're proud of this which they are so I should be good with that you know and I know you guys are proud of me so I should be good with us I'm alright you give a fuck you're you're you're trying to get better at something that's very difficult to do some say the most difficult and you put out a special two years in which is ridiculous I told you not to do it of course you wanted to come to me with but I but I knew you were gonna do it so yes no mean we went down there we helped you out we opened for you we you know it was a time it was a great time yeah and you're gonna look back on it like in eight years from now when you have another killer special out well you know like or several down along yeah when do you think you'll do another one do you think you wait another two years like have you thought about three years or four I was talking to I think it's a week I don't mean in the record I think it's me cool to look back and go holy fuck use three years in this way did you have four years from now see the progression yeah four years tons see the progression yes and you can go back and look I think that's gonna be fucking cool man yeah Oh 100% yeah listen man there's some videos me from when I first started out they're terrible there's no way you're not gonna be you're gonna be terrible yes yeah you're just learning how to do something again it's like judging your roles when you were wiped out versus your roles as a black for sure like you don't know what you're doing yeah you're fucking flailing around it's real similar yep it's fine man it's it's where you gonna say though about specials most most like especially season one savory I think three years what Kevin say Ford Wells gonna say Jeselnik Jeff so neck has a really interesting thought process on it and he was telling me that he does he did the podcast recently I love him I do too he's great he's a killer man outstanding he's an assassin yeah and it's on Netflix it's available right now it just came out to me was he called thoughts and prayers is that it I think so thoughts and prayers anyway that might be his other one he's got several but his new one just dropped on Netflix like a few weeks ago yeah yeah I don't think it's thoughts in person I think thoughts and prayers will fire in the maternity clothes fire the maternity ward so what he does is he he works on the material for a year like in LA he just does like little little sets here and there how much together ever puts together his hour then he takes his hour on the road and does clubs for a year just clubs from 1 to then he does theatres for a year 3 and at the end of that year he films so every three years yeah which is not a bad idea if you don't get tired of your shit the problem is you do a lot of sets like I do four sets a night sometimes I get really tired you should I get tired I get tired new bits yeah especially that many times so yes it's hard so hard to stay motivated it's the same bit yeah yeah but it's also look I feel so lucky that I can do it I feel so lucky like every time I go to do a set like I went to the store last night and hanging out in the back with Fitzsimmons and he and Edwards and Owen Smith who I'm trying to convince Owen Smith and never write again because I think he's the fucking Owen Smith can't bring him up to you gotta come see him that guy's a monster oh gosh and the other night he's like Owen Smith is so good and he's got this gig he's always writing but there's no there's a writer's strike right now he's a writer for a major house Tom's and shit but dude his stand-ups out of control so he came with a super night dude he's the best really nice super so is a little Josh Martin Josh I love charge to cheese he knows fucking Tomatoes it was a killer show we did two shows The Improv we're doing more of those two he into fucking kids a killer he's a writer too yep same deal same same deal and I try to talk to him about it too Ian's been on the road me for years and years he opened for me when I did triggered he took I've taken him on the road for years he's also thought I'm not as this guy and then I see so nice to the nicest guy so Santino Santino's nice he's a and man I love me to have clothes bouncing cheeto you know what Podcast Tiger belly I did with Bobby Lee I told my said you owe it you owe it to come and you a fuckin special man yeah at least 30 minutes and he goes in he goes I think it's I guess my broken won't have me on he's disappointed me on it I just think you shit together to a specialist well that's not true that it won't have him on every time I say do you want to come on my podcast he runs away he's sleeping he gets panicky well he doesn't wake up to one but he gets panicky I don't know why he's a great he's he's got stuff in his head that shouldn't be in there not-so-smart duty is lot to say oh yeah I love popular right on here dude I've been friends with Bobby Lee since 96 it's gonna calm me for a hot no not dude forever I just started doing comedy thing because I'm sorry kill this trip club in San Diego that's we started Mexican gangbangers with tattoos on their face and long black hair and Bobby Lee's trying to tell their girlfriend to give him a lap dance and I got to grab him and drag him the fuck out of here I'm like listen to me Bobby listen to me those guys are serious we gotta get the fuck out of here now and he's like fuck those guys

the fuck up they were gonna kill you you have no idea like certain dudes you look them in the eye and you go oh this guy's for real they got the idea of it white shark yeah and like look I'm not the most street smart dude I'm not saying that but I can read a room though I can read predators yeah I've been around a lot of fucking stone-cold killers in my life and now I saw that guy was like oh

shit I'm like oh Jesus Christ like get in the fucking car man come on so fun you got to get out of here that was my introduction like Bobby Lee cuz he was working at the La Jolla comedy saves that door guys yeah yeah that's how he started I don't even remember how we wound up at that fucking strip club because like all I remember was like the world zoomed in like I was looking at through a toilet paper roll and I'm looking at this Mexican gangbanger who stood up with his hands out there like this and and Bobby Lee is act like it's not a big deal and I'm like oh my God we're gonna die holy I was like that just moments we like you almost got hit by a car whoa like that's that's what it felt like I was like oh my god Bobby like that guy's a real criminal like this is we gotta get out of here and his girl was one of the dancers and Bobby was apparently trying to get his girl to give him a lap dance we ran out of there man we fucking hauled ass I drove very fast and I got off the first exit and I turned around and went back the other way just kiss almost following me I was making sure no one was following me Jesus I was like this is real Bobby Bobby sellers we're talking about

hero so you know for me especially us man we haven't yes I wish I had the the same kind of admiration for that that Comedy Store La Jolla condo he goes because when I was there I forget the comics name is some gay comic he goes he they used to take like 14 dudes back there and run trains and come all over the walls because that's why the walls were blue for a long time went uh-huh don't know if that's true Jesus Christ Bobby I don't know if that's true obviously it's a lot of a lot of adding to that you know you guys came you know right right it's not that far-fetched yeah you don't change do you know who the hodgetwins are yes those guys are yeah they do you know they have they have a fucking there's a they were reading an article about men getting pregnant like that women aren't the only ones you can get pregnant yeah no because the way they talk you know you know the way they talk they're big all Jack dudes you know and I'm on the podcast they're kind of you yeah and they get seriously amped up but they were talking about busted and not inside dudes asked can I get him pregnant about how you go in that man's anus and there's Sam they're like yeah they talked fucking like Jews dude because people are saying super crazy shit that's that's a crazy yes yes yes yes yes this is a real argument you know Yale started putting tampons dispensers get the fuck in the men's room because they said not everyone who men's straights is a woman hi my son welcome to the upside-down world how did you ever uh did you ever watch stranger things to come to this what you were watched ranger things like yeah look we're in absolute down we're in the world is upside down right now that's what's happening so just flipped over to the other side people are getting there so progressive

amazing man bro congratulations you're gonna make the best mom dad whatever the fuck whatever dad mom these dudes are coming in dude's ass this is a good prank it's a funny it's a funny little thing

transgender man and now identifies as a genderless alien oh yeah I seen that do we show that guy before his surgery in such a surgery Alan I don't give a fuck just don't force it on me that I have to if I fuck him call you a him yeah I see congratulations to them yeah their graduations you go you've made it a lot of people want to be special but they don't want to work for it and the problem with that is you get that kind of shit you get people that are pretending to be something super special they get attention so they get attention and you're not doing anything and there's nothing there you know what I really love I had Eddie Izzard on who's probably one of the most famous transgender people ever and just stretch introduce on your picture just decided that's what he likes and once you get past that and just talk to him he's amazing humans a human man he's amazing I don't care what I care is when you say crazy things like men can get pregnant that's insane that's not real have you had custody on the you know and was run for governor I don't know what she's doing now but we count I went to lunch with her afterwards normal shit man normal also talks like like like you might go when you were in battle this and just talks like like a fucking human like a you give a fuck yeah all right you want to wear a dress yeah everyone's looking at you because you got the physique of me and you got a fucking miniskirt on all right whatever who cares you give the fuck once you get used to it like you're used to the way people dress period yes you used to everything yeah you know it's just nonsense it's nonsense like I don't care as long as you're not hurting me yeah we're hurting someone else I don't know shit it on I don't care don't push it off in Eddie Izzard say what like he always felt like that this is a man can have babies now play this can we play it or we get pulled will probably its own Twitter will get pulled no no no no sir you'll hear the volume here the audio though no no we'll just tell people what is the it just says men can have babies now in a son I couldn't find out can we hear it copyright laws no don't doesn't matter we'd have to edit it out later it's just look YouTube's in a weird place right now in terms of copyright and we've gotten claims on us for watching something on a screen in the background like you see a picture in a picture and you you don't even hear it and they want all the ad revenue for the entire show how about the UH gee that's ridiculous hilarious how about that when the combine guy were talking about his dick that got flagged when I was okay she's dick popped out attacked for nudity yeah come on come on it's fuckin dick you like you you have to pop down and you have to pause it and just go frame-by-frame ago is that today it's kind of pixelated it's on there for half a second don't even know what you're looking at if I don't tell you and well what YouTube is doing is making a boatload of cash I know what they're doing oh my god this is the world yes they run the world well between Facebook YouTube Twitter and Instagram YouTube owns Instagram now they're all in the world look Facebook is changing elections Facebook is influencing the way the world votes do you hear what they're gonna start doing with uh I think it's Instagram they're gonna start you can as the user your your owner of your own page but the rest the world can't see your followers and likes huh that's interesting because kids in high school and I can with a three old son it's scary worlds with social me I'm sure with your daughter's you can understand is people suicide especially in teenage girls has never been higher because they're putting so much so much weighs on their social media so I'm a follower Tommy likes they get so we get rid of that might help well you know they're reaching the same kind of people that we're talking about we're talking about haters but they're reaching it like local like their friends and people from school they're shitting on each other and being mean to each other and they don't understand what that does to a person yet they don't have compassion the way a grown adult has where they understand that perspective they understand what kind of emotional influence it's gonna have on a person when you shit on them like that I've seen it happen man it's not pretty but also like when you and I were bullied especially you back in the day when you were bullied you could go home you'd think about it but you didn't have to constantly get it right now if your daughter you know lead at school well she goes home at 3 o'clock and that's Amaya yeah and then they gang up and then this person from another school gangs up yeah this person from Ohio gangs up mhm and then they're all fucking taking that I've seen them play little games with each other - it's weird it's weird watching kids play little emotional head games with each other it was like Jesus Christ like people are button pushers right they see a button they push it they want to see what it does they find out it does something they want to push it again make it do that thing and when you find out you can make someone upset you press their buttons you know there's girlfriends to do that boyfriends to do that friends lovers family members people press buttons but I've had family members that would do that they would just press buttons just to fuck with you but even on social media it's like people can press buttons if you if you let them know that that button gets to you right I never I always I never punched down so if it's a guy with an egg for an avatar so and I don't know I'm never ever very rarely I'll punch down or a comment man a verb that's what they want right what's interested me is it affects people like Kevin Durant who's possibly the best basketball player on planet earth and he just got in a Twitter war with just like he's been known to fake accounts burner accounts defending himself online yeah caught doing that he'd this this this guy who works a commentator an analyst for Fox was like oh critiquing him he started firing back at him then another guy like a troll with 55 followers talk shit do me fires back what are you doing but here's the fears the message when I see all that I'm like not what the fuck is he doing I'm like holy fuck if Kevin Durant who's worth six hundred million dollars the best basketball player on planet earth if it affects him what do you think a 13 year old girl with body issues is feeling like that's what's scary yeah or boy boy or girl kids kids the suicide with teenage girls is a lot have you read Jonathan hates books on that Jonathan hate who he's been on my podcast Kalyn knows him I think maybe Kalyn talked to him too I believe but he wrote a book called the coddling of the American mind and part of the book was about the influence of social media and what is happening what unites kids couple years ago yeah maybe you're pretty recent yeah you have to be up-to-date you know he's a shit he's brilliant okay he's brilliant I really enjoyed talking to him it's um it's one of those things where you go yeah this is nothing that we're designed for it's not normal you know when girls talk shit about you across the you know like you see them across the breezeway like you're walking your classroom they're over there and they're talking shit about you like fuck those bitches but if they're saying it online and you read it on a Facebook page yeah her ankles are fat fucking loser get that nose job lol and kids will do shit like that until we should love lol yeah shit like that to each other but if you read it now all the sudden an impact is you really it becomes it hits you in a way that it doesn't hit you if you see them talking shit if I see some dudes talking shit about me and they're over there I'm like yeah or you really took shit what do you do what I feel good feel good insulting people fucking losers concentrate on your own life get your shit together out on lot like you ever go to you you never read a comment I know I've read comments before but I don't read them in fact do that did it affect you it affected me when I first started being on the Internet but over the course of my being on the Internet I've learned how to not emotionally engage choices well you just know what people are like if I've done something that was poor and it wasn't good and someone said that sucked it burns but you know why it burns because they're right it's true they're because they're right yeah when that happens that's that's an opportunity to get better that's what that is that's an opportunity to look at yourself to reassess start from scratch just look at it with fresh renewed vigor and understanding that the negative consequences of failing or doing poorly or you know just not putting enough attention really I know what do you mean like lately your nighttime sure what's the last thing you did that you got negative but it doesn't matter I did that's how I looked at it yeah it's like but that's one of the reasons why cuz I'm always tweaking it like that and I'll have sets that are off and a lot of the times the sets that are off because I'm experimenting with shit I'm moving stuff around you know mine doesn't matter but it does I don't like it I don't like you don't go no when I don't do well I'm not I'm not listening to what other people are saying I'm my own worst critic you have to so if yeah yeah so the bottom line is if they're wrong like if someone says something and they're wrong it's like I don't care like it doesn't bother me if you say mean things and you're wrong I don't care but if you're right I care and the reason why I care is because I haven't done a good job so I care more about what I've failed at then the person's opinions they can't be all invested in people's opinions of people you don't know because everyone's words look the same when they're typed out yeah like you don't get to see if there was like an an intelligence quotient and emotional intelligence of social intelligence if you could find out how disturbed somebody was by their text just looking at it you'd get a better understanding of whether or not you should listen to this person's opinion yeah when you just look at text it could be it's very black and white yeah I mean it could be Cornel West wrote that or it could be fucking Richard Spencer wrote it it's just words like it doesn't you don't convey who the person is from those words it's very difficult so see someone can say something insulting or shitty to you designed to try to get you they're just trying to hope to get you why do you think it's why do you think it's you get it I don't get it I guess they're helpless they're helpless but so that's why there's so much negativity yes on social that's part of the reason there should be a positive atmosphere for some yeah but you're positive you have a fucking Ferrari you live in a mansion it's easier handsome guy ten feet tall it's all good things got a giant ticker here got big dick energy it's all right all these things are fun also worked for it you didn't work for that dick I was born with this thing yeah so I'm saying it's a work for some things I'm sure it is poor boy you've had many good breaks some people have had none some people have had none and they also have a phone and they have a Twitter account and they're like fuck you yeah but fuck you and your fur that's why you're stuck you in your mansion fuck you and everything you stand for thank you because they can't see a real path like if you're standing there but that's why they're a loser because you because you're getting online you spin out hate because you're not happy with your lure they're 17 like they don't get it let's say they're not there's a lot but there's a lot of that 1:17 there used to be a loser at 17 now they're 27 and nothing's gotten much better there's a lot of that but if you think going on Instagram and shitting on who's successful is gonna get you to where you want to go no unless you're really funny there are people that just do it come yeah there's some kind Josie I'll have a section where we reread off people roasting us we end it back and forth eat some people are good some people are some most awful there's there's people that have like formulated a comedy career from dunking on folks online right yeah but that would be Jenny Johnson high five minority though yeah yeah but if you're a good writer here's the thing the world is not it's like good ideas and good writing and being funny it's not exclusive to professionals there's a lot of people out there who are really funny who never figure out a way to do Apple eyes on it yeah look dude when I was a fucking open mic or when I was first starting out I worked for a guy named Dave Dolan he's dead now he's a private investigator to this day one of the funniest fucking dudes I've ever met in my life we used to calm down a mite dickless Dave Dolan he was an animal Allah Oh God dynomite dickless day Triple D he died a few years back but he's one of the rare people that I saved his voicemails now you saved people's voicemails my staff - they're dead yeah like he's one of those guys I'm never fucking delete how do you pass away listen to this I can't wait dickless Dave here that's how Boston is that was just it's hard to hear it because I can't put it on speaker Dave here why doesn't it not go on speaker what did he pass away from cancer he left me this long sweet email or a voicemail but I never delete that he's yeah I loved that guy forever but when we were friends when he was alive I always said why don't you do comedy well I had the fucking you not a comedian he was one of the finest human beings I've got like Joey Diaz level funny he was so he do it how much didn't have the balls you like being a private investigator like busting people got freaked out it was a game for him that works for him then and his brother his cousin rather was Billy downs and Billy downs owned the comedy connection oh wow yeah so he had an in yeah could is easier than for most people when I started working for him I had no idea that he was Billy downs cousin I responded to an ad in a newspaper where a private investigator needed an assistant oh what a great what a great job like as you try to be a comedian be a private investigators assistant is gonna be awesome but what he really needed was a driver he lost his license from driving while intoxicated awesome he was the best but he quit he quit booze fucking cold turkey right then and there and didn't go to meetings didn't do any of that shit just quit gangster oh man he was a beautiful person but he was one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life that guy if he had Twitter and he would just wanted to dunk on people he would have been fucking you up man he would have read his shit and fall on the ground laughing he was just funny it's funny people are just funny these new professionals like oh you are you aren't you can cultivate it I know some comedians that weren't that good and they got way way way way better but I'm sure they were but being a comedian then also been funny in persons a little bit of different it's different yeah there's some people just they're just funny like Richard Jeni who's in my mind one of the best comedians of all time he was always real somber in person likes never it was never really serious he's depressed which is why I killed himself just wasn't happy this wasn't it's kind of a bummer to bone his own skin and there's comedians like that now even at this store yeah you meet him you're like oh wow you're you're very serious about Brody you know Brody I mean there wasn't that serious with a release around me the few times when I was around him he he was fun he would get dark we get dark I don't know enough I'm like your pretend I did yes he was always very cool yeah I mean I think guys like you and I one thing especially coming from athletics coming from martial arts you're you're more likely to like suck it up and you're more likely to not give in to the negative demons and you're also more likely to exercise regularly you're more likely to so when you see someone who's struggling with something they shouldn't be struggling with you like but you're good frustrated hey you're good that's right why are you bummed out your fucking you really good like if you are doing really good as a comic you know you'll call me up and you're so proud killed tonight it was amazing I had such a great Center but that's great that's awesome yeah it's not bragging no no no it's happiness it's happy I tell you because I know you relate to it so Brody who was a murderer you could never say he was great you could never say like Brody you fucking kill me if he would like skirt around it like Rogen always supportive Rogen yeah they always got my back yeah so it was would always deflected he never I don't think he wanted to do I don't think he wanted to accept the fact that people loved him like when you know when he had would have a great set would almost like it wouldn't elevate him like some guys get off stay like Hinchcliffe Hinchcliffe on murder huh get off stage will be like yeah you were the cops or his eyes would be giant Oh high five everybody he's feeling it you know but Brody didn't get like that I'm not saying feels the same in any regard to what Brody is suffering with but you know Theo has his demons what everything it's very it's out there I'm not outing feels the same way where he'll do a set I'm like do that some of the best things I've ever seen man I'm like get the fuck stop get the fuck yeah Tony it's so good dude it's a version of it me radios got his own version and it's not as extreme everyone has their monsters yeah but like a guy like you or me we're very you're goal-oriented you see you trying to get better at things you see things that's how you got good at Jiu Jitsu it so you got good at fighting and so you get a good at comedy everything you want to get good at you get good at by focusing on it and setting goals and trying to get better and better and when you do get better you celebrate you enjoy it it's fun it's exciting some people don't get that feeling man they don't they don't ever get those highs those highs just don't exist it's and for me you know but what what gets me more than anything now is new stuff what gets me more than anything is creations like those little things you come up with those nuggets Watkins show mm-hmm and I'll walk way go I'll fuck how come in the back go dude I wrote down what uh what killed I'm like oh my god you're recording yeah I can run with that Ghost there's something there yeah then I walk away in like the highest high man it's amazing no show you know what's interesting is hanging around you as much as I have is you're you're serious but you and I are more similar than like me or dilly or me and count calendula are so silly all the time mm-hmm Julia might be funnier offstage Nate he's amazing on stage but he's so funny offstage Brian so funny on stage where they're constantly on like thinking around they mess around all the time and you're like you don't have to be that way I thought for the long because I had to act that way because that's way cuz I hung out with Brian and Counting yeah and Billy is so much like this I don't want to do it like I just want to chill and do my set and then talk about cars or whatever because I look out it be myself that's not them I don't want to have to be on and fuck around all it see I don't like fuck around all the time well delete you're the only one they avoid like the real conversations they don't talk yeah just fake and salt each other yeah they should salt each other what I like all right well alright what else man like why did Kalyn got boxing mitts made that have a shake that someone put that's amazing they did a great job it's all there is though I thought he actually had mitts made up I was like there's a back to them but those guys are shot that like that's that's who they are they're counting if it's a room of three or thirty yeah he's gonna entertain and he's that he's the he's the you know the clown that's why I took the money that's not me man that's not that's not what I do I was talking to either house my family yeah and then go on stage and be funny no look at them they're okay Bryant count throwing punches like a guy who's never been punched I think you're right you're right pretty guy you're right you're right brother there's no way it won't fake whenever I see Cal hit mid-thigh fast forward I go to the next page I know he's so silly he's so so how's he getting into boxing at 80 years old look at this he keeps telling me as the shoulders are fine I'm like well why are you punching so slow then if your shoulders are fine what is wrong it's like are you in a room with thick air he's obsessed with it like what are you fighting at high altitude why's the time the altitude if there's no altitude at least your hands would move quicker that's real do you know that that that's with ballistics with archery you shoot high and high out - oh really yes because there's less drag like there's less air why is his hands moving so slow he's gonna be so sad weird he's been boxing with with private lessons for a while he goes Wayne thinks you know I could probably fight pro I went challenge stop oh it count on your pain that man money do I love Wayne oh here's the problem years old and you're paying that man money so if you went Kallen you look terrible you're gonna go well you're the one coaching me so of course I went let me ask some you play tennis right you can see I went you you hit with a pro right he goes yeah I went you pay him right angle has he ever told you he thinks she can make me compete us yeah that's what they do yeah cuz they got a show progress and hype you up otherwise did your awful never fight again you're not gonna keep paying them dude in it great though that's Callen this just people counted a nutshell this is great people that do that that coach you that blow smoke up your ass gonna be super careful those super very careful when Eddie students had this guy it was he was a jujitsu guy and he was fighting in the UFC and his coach his muy Thai coach was like he's Bangkok ready he's and I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa like as a striker I was like no he's not like what are you talking about like they blow smoke they get a fat one of these Tommy Chong joints look at this joint that's a firecracker formation stuff this in your asshole now they blow that smoke because you're like yes on the other end and you stopped believing it man you start believing I'm gonna Bangkok fuck those dudes up I always told that he should make a shirt he says Bangkok ready I think he did did he make somebody made a shirt that said remember that story you remember that fastening so I was there I was in the locker room and he said he's Bangkok ready there's not a better term ever well it's not a better term ever especially when you know the guys not elite strikers just crazy Bangkok ready hmm yeah I'd watch him kick the bag and I'd be like oh no you better take this guy down take this guy down it get your strangle on Australia so it's just old fight sage was in Bangkok ready sage was not one champ ship red sage you know he's alpha male now right is he still there I believe school left alpha male recently did Lance Palmer relief I think when a plumber while Mark who's the chick the badass since since Cynthia Calvillo yeah she would she go I don't know no I mean I don't know what they're doing over there so I can't really comment I don't either but I do know that when bang Ludwig was there they're making some giant ass fucking progress everybody started moving better everybody started putting together combinations better you click you need a head coach fighters need a head coach and even then you might not win right no it's tough enough you need a hot you need a head coach you need you need a beast you look if I was if I was competing really if I was a young man and I was thinking about fighting in MMA I'd probably move to Montreal I got a MA trail or I was talking to Dustin about this at ATT there's so many guys especially guys in the UFC they get there and they were in the you know the big swingin dicks at their small gym they come to ATT and they're expecting the same attention it's you know two problems with two problems in South Florida pussy and pussy and cocaine cookies I've never tried it well Spanish Columbian it's a reason to go down there bro your dick is gonna be hard every time the wind blows you're gonna be excited and you cannot gonna be focusing and you're gonna get cracked yeah so maybe New Mexico huh also Montreal has hot-ass girls the other thing about this is I really believe about some camps can have too many killers and you can get fucked up as you're trying to learn and grow and you never have enough guys that are that you could practice on I think a que because they're so tough they've injured each other fucked if I was wanted to learn how to wrestle and I wanted to be like a better wrestler from France and I know I moved it I agree because DC's as I was waiting at Steve a left yeah he's on his way out canes there you already beat him there dude that's what I say that's what I say yes France but because he's fucking striking the power yeah this is like such a fucking checkmate weapon then no matter what anybody does you're always ready for checkmate boom it's like Wilder that kind of ridiculous power you're always ready for checkmate you're always ready Wilders is even more impressive than Francis I don't know let me tell you something that is in 2013 that is cut to 265 my motherfucking words if Francis and Ghana decides to jump ship and go heavyweight careful where you going with this he will nuke some fools nukes of the louder oh well let's kinda taking a long time to get the Wilders level well there's a world champion yes undefeated yet they've seen but if Francis and look Francis Egon was not ready to box with Walter right now but let me say some starch in 30 say he might or he might connect no he could get this against why there's not the slickest guy in the world we're not talking about Muhammad olympic-level box Francis no sort of a year-and-a-half in he was in the Olympics but he mostly gets buying power and range there's a little bit Olympics medal but he's a year and a half into boxing I mean I think Francis probably cuz well for he did know there's no doubt about it he's amazing but if Francis has a problem with grappling you think about what he did what does he not have a problem with striking he Kos owls you'll see in the UFC true true but Alistair Overeem is a world-class striker I mean he's a kickboxer at the highest level wins the k1 Grand Prix I mean he's knocked out Badr Hari he's beaten fucking Turkish Tyson for sure he's beaten some good guy Freddie's a little older a little older and the other thing if Alistair Overeem entered the box army without with Deontay Wilder he went less men in I agree with you yeah however maybe well if he cut his legs no I'm sorry straight flow we're talking but it was in more time I mean it was an MMA fight so he's allowed to do everything I know I'm just saying great boxing talking about apples and oranges right but think about that if Deontay Wilder fought Alistair over him in an MMA fight right now how do you think that would go he finished him in under a minute he leg kicked the shit out of Saint Hugh a need you take him down to around three seconds but he couldn't do that to Francis and Ghana couldn't leg kick and couldn't keep them off him because France is MMA but if it's I'll stir and and Francis went to the boxing arena they get absolutely ania with you but I mean the thing that's holding well unless they focused on a for as long as those guys did but the thing that holds back Deontay Wilder from people like all the boxing pundits praising him is that they think he has awkward technique he's wild but his results are spectacular okay Francis and gah knew everybody he connects on other than Stevie goes night-night steep a is the only guy steep a sea pay survived steep a figured out how to use his championship medal and his grit and uses takedowns and and won the fight Derrick Lewis take some shots it's just a terrible fight that was a dud fight I don't even think that counts that doesn't care that fight is so that's such of a mess from to Bob that was the worst fight maybe in the history of the fuckin sport agree they didn't throw anything was so but the problem with that fight is because they're such knockout artist you're expecting such fireworks dude it was a big disappointment I said to everybody there is not a fucking way this fight can saw its and I said you can never say that cuz it is us I know whenever you say there's not a way this fight can suck it's gonna suck so disappointed man disappoint it was but then when he comes back and he knocks out Curtis blades for the second time you know which I thought late blades had a way better shot at him the second II - I actually thought he's probably beat him especially after the Francis and Ghana fight yes but it showed that or the display but it showed that in Ghana has really got it back together again and he's fightin JDS mm they moved it though it was supposed to be in Vegas they moved it it's dangerous fire JDS didn't ride for both guys really but yes yes indeed yes I just think in Ghana house if you're gonna stand in front of him man he's gonna hit you or something yeah that's the thing he's one of those I'm gonna hit you with something when he became I'll the coaly fuck yeah man it's like blowout is so bad he really did think that's what happened when you look at the replay he clearly got hit with an uppercut like a shot there something like a car went almost it's all it needs that guy all he needs to touch you he just needs and the more he does it the more confident he gets in it the better he's only been fucking training for six years do people see him first John so bad in vs. John John yeah what you think would happen I think John would take him I think John smokes him John would take him down yeah Genki listen John easily could be 240 pounds easily just go I think what he's doing is just he's gonna clean out light heavyweight there's really no one there forms gonna clean that out and then go to heavyweight maybe he's in it or maybe he just stays at light heavyweight and just goes down as the goat and just keeps beating them all the contend oh yeah DC wants that fight again at light heavyweight Mike come on he doesn't do it at least that heavy weight every weights the way to cut anything for DCC gets past eBay which is a big if together yeah realize like DC DC connected with that beautiful punch in the clinch but steep a has had over a year to stew on that it's been driving him fucker guessing good thing I think it's good for today's an animal I know I'm not worried about that I think he's gonna be better I think Ringwraiths an issue I don't think so DC's been way more active but ste pays a real veteran man he's a real veteran and he's a humble dudes a hard-ass he's not gonna come in there with a lot of expectations on himself he's just gonna do his best I think I'm not worried at all about the size up her fight for DC look if Donald Cerrone was taking a year-plus off and then we're gonna fight for the title block whoo I'd like Donald to get a fight in god I wish she would do that you and I are off on this yeah I wish Donna would take a fucking break and not fight Tony in three days notice no I agree with that too I wish you would take a break and not fight Tony in three weeks notice but three weeks after its last fight yeah but when Donald fights a lot as long as the best on reason it's the best Donald that's what he wants yes he's just likes to get in the groove he likes to stay active I think for steep and be champion and do that though mmm name song who's done it go yeah name one guy well everyone's different I'm not going off measurements there's no stat alive who's ever fought like the most highest champion who's fought the most the most like the most like active who's the most active champion most icees pretty active at light heavyweight heavyweight pretty I can act pretty fucking active and I think John is trying to be really active I mean think about whole divisions fuck yeah those dip out and leave them like the fucking Queen of the Dragons okay George st. Pierre fought 15 title bouts Wow he had 15 title wow wow that's crazy realtor 15 how about Randy Couture but that doesn't mean that these years later stay open 15 over seven years that's still all those years later Randy Couture is still tied for the record of the most title fights that's crazy Mighty Mouse right under that with 14 Anderson 13 the difference is with all those guys you know I mean it's all different eras different division I think era means everything because I think what John's doing the current air is more impressive than Randy or George or any Anderson did who do you think is a danger to John right now there's no one I'd like heavyweight yeah no one absolutely no one Thiago Santos I know we got a hype and I'm gonna go punch a chance to yeah for sure I get that there's no one at light heavyweight maybe maybe you know what Johnny Walker but he's so far removed right now he has to get by maybe three more guys before we start me like I might be a threat but potential hope his shoulders okay mm-hmm if his shoulders okay what that guy does is crazy he starts his people he stock starts khalil Roundtree with an elbow in the clinch remember that yeah statius that crazy this kind of elbow one of them bad boys vicious chaos him with that and then chaos Misha Sarnoff with a flying knee right to the fucking chops freak he's a freak but he hasn't done it like John has to Shogun who to fuckin you know ain't no comparison mushy - look there's no comparison to anyone who's ever fought in the light heavyweight division and John Jones right now there's no comparison there's no threats but except DC but DC lost the lawsuit he's not a threat at light heavyweight DCI says ret heavyweight I think he's a threat right now not have you ate yes heavyweight he's a threat espouse goes up we've seen how it works out for DC but what if DC got more dedicated and disciplined with his diet so what if DC fights against eBay and says so when it's this deep a fight happen is it July July okay so what if DC says okay August September let's let's plan for New Year's Eve with John Jones that weekend and he takes a week off goes to fucking mardi gras whatever the fuck he wants to do drink some drink some beer yeah New Orleans yeah have some pizza kicks back yeah firm and then goes on a serious diet with a real good nutritionist who's gonna check his macros make sure he's eating healthy food and you think that's why he's not being John no but I'm saying where he could get down to 205 healthy where he doesn't have any look Daniel Cormier if there's anything has ever held him back he's he's not the best at his diet and with NTCC great well he's one of the things that makes him great he's a wrestler he's a fantastic Russell that makes him great he's a shit that makes him great he's got his endurance is great incredible man he knows that I don't know about all that that's some people say think about that think about the most shredded guys in the USC well I don't mean he should get shredded what I mean she'd he should make 205 with no problems where he could go to war for five rounds with a guy like John Jones without weakening him I don't know if that's possible you might be right I don't know if it's in his DNA especially at 40 years of age she can't be with me heavy weight his powers up and saw that was steep a I think if he and he's gonna connect which he has in the clinch against John that powers their the the the I still think he'll be an underdog but it that that gap narrows that heavyweight man light heavyweight it doesn't specially at his age I think it it's even further apart now that John's being more active well maybe he wants to do that to prove a point because he beats John problem heavy well yeah I'm light heavyweight a heavyweight dude you're the champ John if you wants to have that like C fight that rubber match go with even though he's tuned up go there and let's see what happens especially for DC it's like DC dude if you beat John at heavyweight and you ride off in the sunset game set match best of all time to ever do it right like how about this Tito Ortiz right now owns Chuck Liddell right chocolate Dale smashes him two times when they're in their prime but then Tito knocked him out and Chuck looked terrible Tito K owed him it looked really bad and Chuck will never fight again and Tito will always sleep at night knowing he just fucked Chuck Liddell up doesn't you think about those other ones right you know anything about it he got it back he got it back in a big way TC we got it back the way he wanted to lift him with the right hand put his lights out and then punched him a couple times when he's out and that's a replay and forum for DC it's like he even after the John loss he went on that fucking heavyweight knockout steep a who some can argue it's the best UFC heavy rail time he went on to beat Derek Lewis who's so dangerous yeah and then you unless they beat ste pay for a second time what the fuck you know you know what I was really impressed with I was really impressed with the way Chuck handle that loss did you see the way Chuck talked about it on Instagram he just basically said you know hey man you know you put yourself out there you go out there you set goals you know you you try and if you fail it doesn't doesn't mean you quit you get back on your horse and yeah I'm get right back to it and yeah I try not to be so judgey man let go of all the hate and all the bullshit press me to and I like Chuck he's a good person I attract is if he if fifty noes are if rather John John's number one Chuck's number two so far as light heavyweights great light heavyweights he's he was the fucking man I mean when he defined the early days of the UFC one of the things about the UFC was like this crazy thing was like cage fighting and here's this guy with painted toenails and a mohawk and a dead tattoo and he's just Merkin people Merkin people biggest like was like the first big big stars who sported to transcend and ghost going to Entourage have commercials yeah those fucking automotive commercial it was like a rock star too I mean that dude went ha where do you stand remember that one interview that he did he was on something he was on all the drives everything and he's like is doing morning TVs like yeah I'd like to fight the Hulk I wish she was real that great I love that what the fuck is that he was clearly on cloud nine animal man like legit where do you stand on letting those whose responsibility is that the guys like BJ panic keeps losing its defined as like a scene out guy like Anderson Silva where do you stand on letting those guys fight it's a very good question but if you're Dana White what do you do because at the end of the day I only do the Commission should go I yeah man he passed the fucking physical so we gotta let him fight but at the end of the day if they don't have a resource or a job from the head man if Dana calls BJ or Chuck just like you didn't chuck he's like I'm not giving you a venue to find that it's not happening so I what I wonder at what point if you're Dana let's say you're dating at what point do you tell these guys stop fighting because I feel like for Anderson although I don't remember him that way the new generations remember him for being this guy for BJ the new generation only knows him as losing we know them as one of the greats hmm so I I feel like they say you can't fight anymore I don't know BJ is capable of competing the level that he's competing at right now when he's losing to these guys I don't know if he is because it doesn't seem like he's capable of it weight loss what six in a row yeah and if I looked at the BJ that I saw against Ryan Hall up until the time he gets leg locked he looks fucking great laughter that happened fast low bro no I know I'm with you I'm saying he looks like he's fit he looks like he's in shape he looks like he's a top fighter but he almost needs to fight a young guy coming up so we could see when he fights Clay Guida or he fights someone like that it's almost losing yeah and then Ryan Hall he's losing I feel like I don't know he's not who we used to be no I've seen you know not but I don't even know where his head's I feel like if I'm if I'm Dana I'm going hey man I'm doing you guys a solid you can't fight her anymore and now they might go on to other organizations but it's not the UFC so they can go on there and compete but you're not gonna tarnish your legacy at the highest level here in the UFC not under my watch No so I I couldn't do it I would like I'll never pick against BJ I would never pick against Randy Couture I just I don't have it in me so when BJ fights like I'll take BJ cuz I refuse to pick against and then someone I respect them but at some point I'm not gonna do it and I don't obviously Danica neither could you be like a dude no more we're done well I'd have to be friends with him my girl's friends with you yeah you know I mean when when Yaya Rodriguez 360 roundhouse kicked him in the face that shit up at the end I mean that well that was you saw that and compared to BJ when BJ beats on Chirk like you're looking at a this is a severely different fighter whose job is it's telling family and friends no one's job you know here's the thing man we can't let the fighter decide well what is I don't think he should be competing at the highest level of the sport but if he still wants to compete like who's to say he can't who's to say he can't go to a small organization and fight for them who's to say I mean he's not a choice is it Justin he's not gettin spark'd out you know I mean he's still conscious he's not yeah I know he's getting beat but he's not getting crushed nope and not all the fights at least I mean the Ryan Hall one is probably the most Ryan halls can tear any ones me off though oh yeah oh yeah if you get if they give him but he's gonna do that to your knee well he's a phenomenal grappler and his super super intelligent guy too but that was probably the the kindest way for him to lose just get tapped real quick rather than just get a black belt beat up like Frank to him yeah I know but I guess it may be again the commission they have a tough job cuz like physically we can't see into his brain but physically he's passing all the tests like who like whose job to tell Bernard Hopkins not take that last fight when he got not got the fucking ring whose job was to tell Roy Jones don't go to rush and get knocked out yeah don't worry that's so old it repeats itself over these guys what they got that's what makes these stories so great when they're in their prime and you're watching on the come-up and so special but it's also what makes this sport so fuckin heartbreaking cuz you know who does do that the NFL in the NBA they tell you no they tell you now that's it and it's very black but that's because someone has to fill that position and they're not about nostalgia they're about who does the best job in that position shouldn't the UFC be that way but it's not that the UFC doesn't know who does the best job in that position until they set you up with somebody when they see over and over and over again then we've salt but it give me six but the argument is he's not getting crushed he's not gettin spark'd out he's not getting knocked out he's just not as good as he used to be no it's not a good argument but he's not he's not as good as you used to be yeah no I'm not saying I'm not arguing just answer why do you think it's still at the UFC in his opponent I don't know why the because he's still a draw maybe yeah that's a good question because because right now the respect is it out of respect like what is it what he's done for the game he's earned the right to go out on his own note but the stakes are so high in fighting it's different than basketball I don't know whose job it's and I don't have the answer and I wish I did I don't know it's it's the most heartbreaking thing in sports I think I agree and I think with BJ if he would have found and I don't know BJ well enough but if you would have found a passion like I did with stand-up or podcasting or something else you probably would have been out never come back maybe but the thrill of yeah I mean he's a multiple time world champion the thrill of BJ when he was in his prime it's probably indescribable like what brings Nate Diaz back you know there's money in the bank what's gonna bring Connor back yeah it's not money yeah those guys were born fighters they're natural-born fighters these what they do and that's that's what makes him feel alive so I don't know yeah the excitement the thrill the fuckin I mean and look we're all gonna die sorry when people say you should look out for their health well then we should stop fighting altogether correct and yeah right stop drinking and no more driving yeah driving is dangerous go walking everywhere if we just walk and people get in accidents walking they'll we find a bump into each other it's a big deal that would be cool yeah I mean it's there's a real argument for that right like this is a give a small window the experience is life do you want but yeah with a guy like BJ Penn the reality is there should probably be a number of fights that you lose in the UFC where you just get cut you speak three was it a signed in paper thing no but man when you've lost two which I did that third one Joe Silva would tell your management he told my manager like me Lex McMahon goes no with this one you know it's spray over we're here no he wouldn't say that he go would we're giving him one more and he knew that was like that was just shot if you lost you were done well even if you won but by decision that when it cut you you knew if as long as you got the job done you its extent I saw one of your interviews is really interesting you're talking about if you bomb you could always go down the improv and have a new set redeem yourself yeah but when you're fighting if you lost you'd have like six months yeah were shit just dwell on that and be like no I promise you I'm getting better and stand-up anybody not I promise I bombed if I'm strong went to their problem they laugh so what's up what's up yeah the life of a fighter is probably the most stressful job in all sports and certainly in all of entertainment besides you know obviously when we're at war and soldiers its clothes thing and get this part yes and I do not I don't admire it I feel sorry for them because I've been through it but that's from my perspective I love those guys they fucking live off that man my watch and I'm like well your check ice I got ya tonight I felt horrible for Brazil I felt bad for Wilder when he got like God he's such a good dude I wish you'd find something else to do yes so the Showtime guys in Makati car lays this into something really cool after this he can make hundreds and millions of dollars I think twenty million dollars that night yeah he's gonna go down as one of the greatest of all time I think so I think he's getting better with every fight and I think if Joshua gets hit on the chin with one of those fucking bombs away we can see some crazy shit I think while there is he knows how to take it - he could take it got blasted by Ortiz mm-hmm if you notice in the Brazil fight he got caught he backs up got blasts against fury yep he gets hit he got hit in the 12th round against fury Josh you're so interesting oh yeah cuz Joshua cracks oh he does he does and he's been hit before and dropped I did Adam and Klitschko yeah got back off the ground and then just arched him I did this interview with Fox Sports Li Hey and she goes who's the most overrated mainstream boxer and I answered on my mmm I'm gonna say Anthony Joshua just cuz I wanted to hear this and he's I got fucked down my fight wilder now but people ran with him psycho he thinks Joshua was overrated no I don't think Jeff I think Joshua's Olympic gold medalist did over rate it no he's being sent he's amazing I just want him in wild fight he's also built like a Greek god you know might be a six man laughs he might be so he's jacked it like 245 Josh you're shredded and heard him commentate yeah he's brilliant ikkyu late and that accent it's lovely lovely chump fuzz gave me so long let's go champ it'd be so on yeah um what is happening with my man Shannon the canons pinkie let's go champ he's been trying to get a fight forever is he still yeah he's always trying to get a fight yeah those two or it's like too much of a risk he's a three man horse race in he's a rescue horseman yeah if you're not those three no was he fight anybody yeah and you would have Jim Gray be moving him up to line why do old hear Jim Gray after the fight what he said here's the wild he goes and people were booing him because he goes I get and I I love it but I also get why people are booing he goes he goes champ Wilder great performance because I hate tell ya and Brazil's behind me us no one wants to see do us to Brazil no one wants to see fight Ortiz next that's supposedly what was supposed to be next I want to see if I'd our teas necks it's either Joshua or fury that's all we want to see when are we gonna give us a who won the crowd when does Brazil got starts and like come on he's in the ring but Jim Greg is no offense so they were booing Jim Gray said that he asked that but I've but I'm I'm like I've been shouting from the rooftops of my podcast saying the exact same thing it's hard and I and I told Showtime this it's hard to sell the fights because no one cares unless it's the ones we want to see which is why what's makes the UFC so great you know you're gonna get one verse the champ you know get the number two guy versus the champ but the best are fighting the best night in night out yes they got mad at uh Jim Gray for telling the truth yeah it's gonna get made that's just that is what it is Jim Gray knows the fuck it's also the truth it's the truth he knows what the fuck he's doing look man I'm all I want to see Luis Ortiz I want to see that fight you want to see what Louis Hardy's in Wilder again a hundred percent do you rather you think that should be next no I'm not saying that should be next look if if Joshua and Tyson Fury decide to fight and Lewis decides to fight or Wilder I'm fine with that you want to see it again I'm fine I'm fine with that haloo sorties is a beast and he's think it's not it's not the best fight but I would watch the shit out of that fight more than Dominic Brazil oh for sure I would love to see that fight I would love to see that fight instead and I think they offered at Ortiz I think Ortiz had an injury the after adore T's Joshua because Joshua was June right yeah yes they offer it to him and he said no he wanted here's but this is this is boxing he's man that goes we want more money in that one double Joshua's team went on short notice now we're giving you I think was five million he went ten oh look Louis Ortiz is Li JIT bro Liege it he's a fucking cubicle limping limping boxer no idea but dude come on how bad ass is goddamn Deontay Wilder I mean he's Ortiz's yes and he cracked somebody's ass Paul he it's so fucking hard so does Ortiz no he does not we're teases a kill he's a killer but he is not a killer the wait a while that's a totally different fury on a killer like water when he comes at one punch power dude water in the world Wilder is made out of wood that dude is iron when he when he fucking hits dudes he hits dudes in a different way it's like they're getting clubbed it's amazing the first thing I asked already did the podcast like how the fuck do you hit so hard like look he just knows he could he can absorb shots he's just smart enough to hang on there and just stand in front of you if you're standing in front of him he none course gimme this fight 15 pounds this is a tough fight this all I'm saying is losing this flu look at this he's getting his body worked he's getting beaten his walk got clubbed there dude he is getting fucking hurt so this is not this is not an easy fight for him and I think the rematch will be even harder I really truly believe that I think whatever Ortiz has got left in his body he's gonna come at him and Deontay Wilder knows that this guy can fucking box the difference I think is with Wilder you're dealing with a guy who is getting better with every fight because he's literally learning on the job as one of the most successful heavyweight champions of all time because he's only been fighting since he was 20 he's getting better and better and better for Luis Ortiz Luis Ortiz is like maintaining right now 60 years 49 years old from Cuba we have no yes 7,000 fights once in a while he's been popped he's been popped for stuccos Jose yes it's fucking fury or Joshua or go fuck your mother and then he dropped him and he dropped him here Joshua wild earnest listen bro if we don't I'm telling you I'm down to see this fight again I'm down to see this fight again Ortiz how he hurt Wilder man no way yep he hurt Wilder that's the happiest Avenue that I fucking I love that job I love that guy I love his story I love how he is as a person he's fun great person he's great and he's also it's interesting how small he is as a heavyweight so thin when he fought Tyson Fury weighed 209 it's nuts man 209 my favorite part is he's such a beast of a dad to bring baby brings him in his wife everywhere yeah the rest the kids everywhere like I was surprised how sweet he was like he's like a warm friendly guy you love him his blessings to everybody blessing his talent yeah like vibrates yeah this is a real deal man good to be around I'm excited about the heavyweight division too because I feel the same way about Joshua Joshua seems like a like a champ of a person yeah I've never talked to him seems awesome how Mikey all these interviews he like comes across you smiling he's charismatic it's interesting up and asked him where probably got one them Land Rover v8 yeah those defenders girls I'm saying that because I saw a video of him where there's a car show where they drove Anthony Joshua around you got a to drive around one of those Land Rover defenders those boxy look on military they're about to release a new one they're coming out of the new one yeah rotors come out with a new defender oh wow yeah they have a new model it makes sense they're such hits just like Ford's coming out with a Bronco yeah they're coming out with a Bronco and they're also gonna have like a smaller Bronco yeah it just took the baby Bronx yeah they're two-door and a four-door wait till they do like the SVT version of only the Raptor version of them wrong shit rather after your Raptor is one of my all-time favorite trucks it is such a meathead move to get a goddamn Raptor she's such a meathead like you got bales of hay back there son what are you using that pickup for zero thing what am i using for being awesome being awesome oh yeah the thing about those lifted with fucking monster truck Raptors or preposterous cars because they give someone the ability to drive like a real off-road vehicle with 500 plus horsepower and just get it from a factory it has a craziest suspension you could just drive over the fucking moon without suspension I mean it has a crazy travel in those wheels so when you drive it on the highway - it's like smooth because it feels like an s-class almost yeah it absorbs everything but yet it's you get it's a monster of a few months and you could accessory the fuck out of that bitch with some crazy bumpers and rear bumpers and tail bumpers yeah sure side pipes right I mean side steps and shit what is up Deonte while there's Gator skin today Oh No let's go champ no I don't support this loving more now want more pictures yeah what are you doing listen first of all that's a rap okay that's not real man skin it's a rap what if it was real Gator skin they would have to glue it to the car you could there's like divots on the little things hush your mouth that's not have an alligator skin I hate alligators so if you know this I don't like him I don't I don't talk about it too much but I'd like a hate for scared of them yeah yeah when I was a little kid I lived in Florida when I live in Gainesville from age 11 and we lived near a place called Lake Alice and lay cows had alligators and I knew there was a lady that was walking her out her walking helican walking her dog by the lake and the algae out and snatched her fucking dog solid and I didn't see it I didn't see it but I remember that being a thing and I've ever seen those goddamn things all the time and everybody telling me that you don't have to worry about it when I'm 11 my sister my sister is 10 and we'd be hanging out this lake and I'd be like what the fuck is to stop an alligator from eating us nothing and I rely remember looking them in the eye and I'm fascinated by them right they're amazing so I always loved dinosaurs when I was a kid that was a saw it is a dinosaur I was always in nature I'm always into like cool nature of shows and documentaries so I'm looking at this thing thinking like oh we're just used to them being around like we shouldn't allow them to be around we're just used to them being around so we think it's cool that they're around but they will fucking eat you know eat your dummy chance they get so I started buying I buy alligator I always have affinity pen always all my belts are always alligator that's gangster dude I have alligator bags for my pool cues I'm achievement alligator alligator luggage I don't like alligators I have an alligator wallet fuck yeah dude I don't like to want to kill them oh wow I want to kill them if alligators if there's too many of them and they were near you you'd want to kill them too they're eating machines they're heartless eating machine they got a brain the size of a thumb I don't like them dude how about the one that Disneyworld the parent said that's their kid they're the two years yes eight the fucking kid gave me know at Disneyworld they have a
