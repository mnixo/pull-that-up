hello Ben thank you for having me - my pleasure this is a subject that scares the shit out of me you and how did you stumble upon the story of fentanyl because weren't you at one point time didn't you write about like rap music yeah I have a book about NWA and Tupac and I interviewed like Ice Cube dr. Dre Snoop Dogg all those people yeah but I was the LA Weekly music editor and I started looking into this story about why people were always dying at raves so like I don't know if you remember a few years back every time there was a rave there like one person died new people died anymore and they always said it was from ecstasy but I knew that ecstasy was really not that dangerous of a drug you know MDMA pure MDMA very few people died from that so I was like what is going on here and I looked into it and turned out it was all adulterated it wasn't real ecstasy wasn't real Molly it was adulterated with all these new drugs and I kind of went down the rabbit hole and I found out that all these new drugs were made in China they're all synthetic and there were like hundreds of them and then it turns out that the most you know the worst of them was fentanyl and that's how I got under the topic and in fence you know most people think of fentanyl they think of it as being a new thing but it's not really a new thing right was wasn't it it was invented in the 50s yeah yeah I was invented by a Belgian chemist he was trying to find something that worked better than morphine in hospitals it doesn't morphine work really good well it does but for things like yeah traditionally people have got a lot of mileage out of morphine but for things like open-heart surgery he wants something that came on really fast and it lasted a long time and so he manipulated the chemical structure of morphine came up with fentanyl it was a blockbuster drug you know and still is used in hospitals all the time it's used you know there's the fentanyl patch for people with cancer Payne and then when you get a like a colonoscopy they give you fentanyl before that and then women who have epidural is doing childbirth that I believe he's usually fentanyl so it's still an important hospital drug and so how did it come to be that this drug from the 1950s sort of reimburses and reemerged during the rave scene is that what it was it was actually before that it first started killing people a little bit at the beginning of the 80s and nobody knew what it was it was from China then as well no back then it was these kind of mystery chemists these guys who there was this one guy in particular called George Marquardt and he was like a genius maniac who read all the chemical literature he learned about Fenton Fenton Ellie's like I should try to make this I bet it would be a hit with recreational users and so he started making it and it stumped authorities because these people would die they would have track marks in their arms like it was heroin they would have syringes but they tested them afterwards and there's no heroin in their system and so they're like what is this and the only way they finally found out was that there was this scientist testing racing horses and apparently fentanyl was being used to dope horses to like so they would withstand more pain and would go longer and faster and completely train harder yeah and so so this guy made the connection he's like oh this is fentanyl this is this new thing and he actually predicted what was going to happen he's like we are in trouble now because not only is there fentanyl you can make a new if you ban fentanyl you can adjust the molecule make another type of fence know when they ban that can make another one ad infinitum basically Wow so the thing with horses would be that they would be in pain so they wouldn't run as hard so they would force them to run harder by dulling the pain I guess so yeah I don't know all the details of it but you know it's performance enhancing basis and it seemed kind of counterintuitive you would think that like an opiate would like make the sleepy right well I don't know maybe just has a different effect on horses so then the Internet comes along and through the internet people started scouring the medical literature and scientific literature and chemical literature and then they find fentanyl exactly yeah because back in the old days you you know scientists would publish a paper they're trying to find a new drug that they can patent say the drug isn't a hit no one wants to buy it it goes on some dusty university shelf never is heard from again but in the Internet age all of these papers start going online and so these rogue chemists that I reference until my book they start finding particular scientists who work on the type of drugs they're interested in and then they start going through all their papers and they pick out drugs that they think would work recreationally and so when fentanyl first came out it was totally legal people you could walk around with a giant bag of it they couldn't do anything and so it set in motion this sort of cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and drug chemists which really still persists to this day although mostly in China now have you ever experienced any opiates personally I've taken yeah like tramadol in like Tylenol three and stuff like that I don't know three years opiates I think it's codeine which is a low-level opioid and I don't know to me it always gets me stoned but it never seems to like deal with the problem I don't really like Opie I just you know what I mean it's like I can't sleep and it's just not like that's not your thing yeah I had the old nyquil had codeine didn't it didn't it did we've been over this haven't we didn't we try to figure this out I I remember I took nyquil in the 90s in the late 90s I was sick like the last time I ever took it and it was wonderful I was lying I had going this is amazing I only give a shit oh fuck yeah I heard I'm sick a lot of people say that I just sank into the bed I was like and another time I had a morphine drip at knee surgery and they gave me a little morphine drip and he's an every time I want it I could just hit this button uh-huh and get a little more hammering that just lying in bed well that's like the irony of the opioids it can produce the greatest pleasure you know and the greatest pain you know I think Sam quinones said that like how can one molecule give you the greatest pleasure imaginable and the worst pain imaginable yeah Lenny Bruce had some crazy quote about it something about that of like getting hugged by God I forget what the quote was but i-i've never had experience with heroin but I knew I've known people that were addicts quite a few and a couple of them that died and one of them that I knew there was this guy he was a pool hustler back of my pool playing days in New York and his nickname was water dog I forget his real name I think was Bill but another was Buffalo Bills his other nickname I don't remember his real name but anyway this guy was an elite pool player big-time gambler but the thing was he had to do heroin first so like they would play games for like $10,000 these huge games and all these guys would come from the tri-state area they would come around to watch these matches in bed on the side and water dog would go to the bathroom and everybody knew what was going on he would go and shoot up and they would come and he would sit on a chair like this just sit there for like half an hour just sit there and then when it was over when the half hour was over he just like he couldn't miss and he was playing this guy this this dude that I knew named George who was also a big-time gambler and he was screaming and yelling that this motherfucker when he's on this stuff he can't miss he had no nerves like nothing bothered him you could scream in his face he would look at you like an alien like it didn't didn't bother him at all like like an insect would look at you and he had this incredible ability to play like at the very best while he was fucked up on heroin and I remember thinking what a bizarre drug I mean think about all the amazing artists that it's clean yeah I think about jazz and John the cream yeah Lenny Bruce so many people I mean you go down the line all these different folks I mean that mug shot that I have out there of Hendrix yes heroin Toronto yeah I mean people like people prefer heroin defense until like I've heard it described as more soulful people say but the thing is you can't even get heroin in most parts of America like pure heroin anymore it's all cut with fentanyl well you gotta go straight to Afghanistan right that's probably probably Mexico yeah yeah Jesus Christ no the can you grow poppies what can that be grown in the yeah I just walk around on this true like nice neighborhoods you'll see poppies all the time you just don't even know you're looking at him and that's actually heroin like you could get one from those poppies yeah it's like if they grow now you know organically and you're not doing it on purpose it's no big deal but if you start cultivating it that's when it becomes just got a place to know they're beautiful look how pretty yeah you also have San Pedro cactus on your lawn sir oh those are pretty too right yeah yeah I mean those cactus I can't imagine there are a lot of trained police who know what to look for is I feel like if you're gonna grow some mezcal you know mescaline cacti or whatever your that's the move just mix it up with regular cactus pretend your cactus enthusiast yeah have it all over your lawn some succulents yeah I'm just really in a cactus man they're pretty yeah it's a water I'm I go out of town a lot yeah so when you know what what scares me is you know I mean I just know people that party I know people that take pills and it seems like fentanyl is things are getting cut with fentanyl a lot it's not you know it's not an uncommon thing for all sorts of different drugs look how many different drugs are cut with fentanyl street drug oh man it is like an awful time to be a young person on the party scene you know like when I was coming up and probably when you were coming up they said the DARE program and all that say no just say no they made it sound like every drug could kill you right now unfortunately that's like almost reality that basically any pill or any powder if you didn't get your pill from CVS you know your pain pill or from a pharmacy that's legit it could be cut with fentanyl and that's how prince died that's how Tom Petty and the rapper Mac Miller all died is that they were taught they were taking legitimate pain pills is that really what happened that is really what happened it's got his from the black market yeah well the guy who supplied Prince has been he refuses to really say exactly where he got it but he's still alive the guy who got in for Prince yeah where is he I don't know I think in Minneapolis or so they should find that fucking guy well the doctor is also like settled it or something I think the doctor might have been involved somehow it's a mystery where he got these pills but you know Prince was like doing the splits on stage at age you know 58 or whatever and he was definitely a guy who walked around with a lot of pain he was Jehovah's Witness he was not a recreational drug user as we think about it you know he was he wanted pain and I'm sure for years his handler or whatever was buying him off the darknet or whatever and they were fine for years but but then a drug dealer trying to save some money increase profits cut it with fentanyl and that's that's how he died and I heard Tom Petty actually suffered an injury or hurt himself at one of his concerts and he just literally walked outside and asked like the first sketchy guy he saw if he had any pain pills and that's what killed him Jesus Christ Oh God and in Prince needed hip replacement surgery didn't he I think that's right No so common for some reason with people who perform on stage who do a lot of like jumping around and going crazy my friend Maynard lead singer of tulle yeah he was he does jiu-jitsu he's really into jiu-jitsu and he's like man I just have no movement in my hip my hip is like so locked up and the doctor went to look at it and they're like hey bro you've got no hip left like it's just shot and it was from stompin on stage he sings he fucking style time in that one hip he just wore that hip out yeah my mom has these issues with her neck it's like degenerative disc disease and you know you've got this like cushy spongy you know well they can do something about that now can ya before your mom goes and gets her neck cut open there's several options one first of all as it's been explained to me the concept of degenerative disc disease it gives you this it implies that there's a disease yeah like you caught a flu that's not you know it's not what it is is bad posture wearing down compression you carrying weight if people carry a lot of things their discs get smushed over time there's a lot of different factors a lot of athletes get a lot of fighters get a lot of wrestlers jiu-jitsu guys they all get it I got it and as you wear it is my neck okay and it was from getting my neck yanked on you know cranked on and and using it to like move people around when you're doing jujitsu and grappling but I found a thing called Regina Kane and with Regina Kane is what Peyton Manning used he actually went to Germany to go do it but now you can do it here in America Kobe Bryant went and got it done as well it's great for people with back issues disk issues and with bulging discs in particular it helps relax the area around the discs it's is your own blood and there's all there's a some sort of strange procedure they do but they take your own blood it's like a very advanced form of platelet-rich plasma and there's a place called lifespan medicine in Santa Monica they did it for me everything bad everything back yeah I mean depending upon how far gone it is you know some people it's already bone-on-bone there's no disc you know and you got to catch before that happens yeah and another thing they're doing is they're shooting stem cells directly into the disks and they're having some really good results with that where the stem cells but a lot of that they'll be doing that in other countries because it's there they're a lot looser with their regulations if they have any regulation at all yeah just fucking fill you up with stem cells yeah and everything starts regenerating yeah but but yeah and it's not just these pills either it's like and like you have daughters I know who are you know maybe getting towards their teenage years right mm yeah and like that's the thing I worry the most yeah it is are you kids too and just yeah because I used to you know I wasn't discriminate I didn't care right especially if you're drinking if you're a young kid and you're drinking yeah I make wise decisions you don't even know what you're doing if you're a young kid you're 18 19 years old you have a three four drinks in you you don't even know what that experience is like you know you don't have the wisdom and the knowledge and the history to go okay I've got three drinks I don't the fuck I'm doing I should get out of here yeah I definitely should be taking any pills yeah I'm and so I'm already like trying to think about how I'm going to talk to my kids who are younger but like you know I hate to say it it seems like marijuana if you can smell the buds if you can see them you know there have been kind of some scare mongering on the internet in certain police departments saying that there's been marijuana cut with fentanyl but if you got in Stokes calm they started to bunk all that so I think marijuana is if you can smell it it smells like weed you're probably pretty safe well there are a lot of people that are growing marijuana that are using pesticides and chemical there that are dangerous and there was one what was the company that got caught recently Jamie they tested their stuff cushy plant I believe yeah so they punch it with the microphone Oh cushy punch we had a guy named John Norris on the podcast and he wrote a book called hidden war and he started off his career as a game warden you know investigating people that caught too much fish things on those lines and he thought hey what a great job this would be I'm gonna get and get a job in the great outdoors I love the outdoors and you know get to do some good for the wildlife well turns out along the way they started stumbling upon these public land Mexican cartel grow operations where they would grow these marijuana plants just giant plots of them and they would use these extremely toxic pesticides oh yeah and also they would use poison to keep animals out and they had vats of this shit laying around and some of the marijuana was actually infested with this shit oh yeah I did yeah my friend Amanda Chicago Lewis is this great journalist folks done focused on marijuana and yeah she put the fear of God in me about those pesticides and carcinogens and the other thing is just like these you know these different oils that people are smoking some of them are marketed as like all-natural but they find synthetic cannabinoids in them and basically you know synthetic cannabinoids like k2 and spice are what they're known as sometimes and those are people call it synthetic marijuana but the big difference is that THC is known as like a partial agonist so it will like these receptors it will it will activate them to an extent you're chilled it's relaxed but the cannabinoids they also interact with the cannabinoid receptors same as THC but they're full agonist and so they make you basically like go crazy and your heart starts beating fast you start people overdose and die on these these cannabinoids and they these are all made in China - I went into a lab in China where they made these and they made fentanyl analogs they let you in yeah I mean it was it was a whole thing I like wrote them on the internet I made a fake email address and I said I'm a drug dealer I'd like to visit your lab may I do that when I come to China and they said yeah what yeah that's like did you have a fake drug dealer named I called myself what did I call myself I tried I had this like Skype avatar picture where I looked like a bro like a 23 year old dude with like big hair like kind of a STONER look and they just they said yeah come by and so so I went to Shanghai and I met this guy at the train station and he owned his own lab and he asked me if I was a journalist actually like pretty straightaway he was like are you journalists though and I was like nah like no crazy question do I look like journalists No so he didn't know whether to trust me so we went to his apartment it was like the top floor of this fancy high-rise he's a total family man he had like he lived there with his wife and kid brings a stranger to his home yeah yeah meets a guy says he's a drug dealer piss him up at the train station says hey come to where my kids sleep yeah exactly Wow and so then he showed me because yeah there the website a lot of these companies in China they make legitimate chemicals and recreational chemicals and they specialize in drugs that are legal in China but banned in the West so banned in the u.s. oh is illegal in China well in the US we have this thing called the federal analogue Act and so that bans all these drugs even before they're invented so anything that's similar to marijuana structurally or in effect anything that's similar to opioids is just automatically banned automatically scheduled but in China they have to do it one by one by one by one and so fentanyl itself was scheduled in China was banned in China decades ago but these chemists spent like this one I met specialize in this window when something is banned in the US but it's still legal in China but it's become popularized on the internet so there's all these websites these web forums where these like drug nerds basically you're like you can't get fentanyl but you can get this thing that's kind of like fentanyl and the whole area the way drug nerds yeah yeah that's what they are and like Psychonauts I'm sure you've heard of psych shorts right they specialize in these new usually psychedelics they tend to prefer that have never been tested on human subjects but this guy was entirely specialized in fentanyl analogues and synthetic cannabinoids and so he took out you know he had his like fake list on his website of all the legitimate you know like cialis and you know legitimate pharmaceuticals things like that but as at his apartment he showed me the real list and that had all these you know it was cannabinoids fentanyl it was like fake valium like different types of xanax and he showed me the prices and I was like all right looks good can I can I go see your lab and so finally he decided he trusted me he called up his driver on the phone and the driver showed up and he was kind of this big like muscular dude who didn't speak any English and I was a little worried I was like oh this is the dude he's gonna break my kneecaps if when he finds out I'm a journalist you know but I just got in the car and we drove like 30 minutes to the outskirts of Shanghai and we got to the lab and it just looked like a regular office park like a suburban office park there was a fountain in in front of the building there was like you know you use the keycard to get in the parking lot and then it looked like kind of a new construction building it smelled like cement we went inside we went up to to the labs all the windows were open there's the middle of the winter and it was kind of a strong chemical smell but it looked kind of just like Breaking Bad like you know like industrial sized glassware you know beakers Bunsen burners all that stuff from high school chemistry and he would points he points out like basically I had my recorder you know on my phone and I had it in my jacket pocket just on record and so he told me I couldn't take pictures and so to take notes I would just say stuff aloud I'd be like oh that's oranges a a light orange mixture that's being mixed up I make alarm and you say it's benzo fentanyl a very interesting and so but but the language barrier was such that he you know didn't think I was being too much of a weirdo that clearly was but so but the cannabinoids would it were crazy there was like a table like this like almost exactly this size that was piled up with the cannabinoids that were there for drying and it was a they were mounds like this high just sitting right out in the open what they look like this is look like pot no because it's not a plant you know it's just basically it's a chemical that's sprayed onto plant matter like dried sage and stuff like that really so they try to make it look like pot and you know you can smoke that stuff out of a pipe or even roll it into a joint but it if you look closely though it's very clearly not pod Wow and so they're drying this stuff that's what I think that I'm you know they also had like drying machines it looked like Matador didn't like it when I use this term but you know when you go into subway and there's the bread baking machines right there yeah it looked exactly like that why did he not like that term of though I don't know I think he thought subway would sue us or something but but they had those and then they had like big buckets of one-pound bags of these these cannabinoids and these fentanyl analogs just ready for shipping he said they were sending them to Russia to Belgium to the Netherlands and then I think a lot of times that's repackaged there and so I don't know if you knew that the cannabinoids like used to be sold legally in head shops like 10 years ago yeah yeah and they would always be in these colorful packets they almost look like a pop rocks bracket they say like spice spice and laugh-out-loud and stuff and so I think in Europe that's where they do that they put it in this colorful packaging they and then they ship it to the US and but yeah he was saying that like he kept like really close track of the law and all these countries especially China like they're scheduling this next week so we're gonna take all this and throw it away and I thought at first he was like probably just putting me on but I think they actually do that like these guys are businessmen first and they want to make money and going to follow the law it just doesn't you know it's not I can do sir this is where bath salt came from right exactly yeah bath salts tend to be Kathryn owns so synthetic cathinones there have you heard of the cat plant Kait yes the the hijackers pirates in Somali yeah yeah it's really popular in the Middle East it's like it's a stimulant against you really have you tried it no I never have yeah but I grew up in Minnesota though and there's a big Somali population and so a lot of there was a big controversy in Minnesota whether or not to ban cat leaves from being sold in regular stores is it legal I think it is I think it's not legal in the US now if I'm not but I don't know for sure interesting but so kh8 ease up yeah exactly and so the synthetic cathinone czar the synthetic version of that like made in the lab but they're there you know there's tons of different kinds you don't know how strong it is and the bath salts they of course it has nothing to do with like salts for your bath you know this was a misnomer and they also wrote called them like incense and sometimes plant food and on the back of all of them it would say not intended for human consumption so that was like the way they got around they thought they could get around the federal analog Act because part of the law says that something is automatically illegal if it's intended for human consumption hmm so these guys just put in your bath yeah he bath smells like fucking toxic chemicals yeah do you remember when the homeless guy ate someone's face remember that and they said he was on base yeah but that was actually disproven there was none found in his system yes crazy cannibal the Cosway cannibal I think that yeah yeah and he was just crazy right I think he may have liked smoke some weed but yeah I don't think he had anything else in his system it was just high on life yeah man the Lord you know geranyl Florida man yeah it is it's funny that one state is so synonymous with fuckery yeah and they also had this thing called Flocka have you heard of that yes I have but I don't remember what it is it's more Kathleen owns and like if you look it up on YouTube there's all these people going crazy I killed like I think maybe a hundred people in Florida during a time and the problem is you know like the prohibition on drugs causes people to do really stupid things right so you have this cathinone like Flocka and as bad as that was once they banned Flocka the chemists started manipulating the chemical structure so they change one little thing they add like a chlorine group for example so like a chlorine like molecule you know it has nothing to do with the drug but they just add it on there to make it so it becomes legal hmm but then it becomes more difficult for your body to like digest it so it becomes worse for you and the high becomes worse and then they ban that and then they make something new that's even worse for you and it's just like down the line and and these Chinese so so that's what all these new drugs have in common my book is about they're called NPS novel psychoactive substances so fentanyl is the most famous and the most dangerous but these include basically like synthetic new versions of every drug so there's you know marijuana the new the NPS version is the synthetic cannabinoids heroin NPS version is fentanyl there's LSD so you take LSD it's like a wonder drug right no one has ever died of an LSD overdose you know people may have thought they were a bird or whatever and jumped off a roof but no one has ever overdosed on the drug itself but but once they started banning once they started really cracking down on LSD these Chinese chemists started manufacturing this new type of psychedelic that was sold as acid and so if you went on the dark web this was like in the like ten years ago or so tip five ten years ago you would search for acid and it you would think you were buying LSD but you were buying this new psychedelic that could kill you and did kill you these drugs are called n-bombs it's like the worst name of all time these these n-bomb drugs and they started killing people and like the suburbs and dallas and really were a music editor yeah so so these kids all thought they just wanted they did their research these were like smart kids who said oh LSD has never killed anyone let's get that this new thing and it killed them and so it wasn't really LSD it was just so it totally no no no really yeah now the crazy thing is that this probably could be fixed with legalizing all drugs but nobody wants to legalize all drugs it's such a catch-22 because like if you had heroin available at the corner store you would have no need to buy fentanyl and if it was like at a reasonable price where they couldn't undercut you like hey heroines five bucks I'll sell it for a dollar yeah it's it's a terrible thing to even say I don't want people to be able to just go buy meth yeah well the way to think about it I think is like decriminalization a lot of times is like a better alternative in my opinion in my you know my research and then legalization right so like the presidential candidate Andrew yang talks about decriminalizing Oprah opioids right and so when I first heard about that I was like what I was like that is a bridge too far but the more you think about it it's like people get arrested for using fentanyl they go to jail and then the recidivism rate is like through the roof people like get out and they start using again they don't get the treatment they need you know and so the opiate you know like people don't realize that fentanyl is killing more people than any drug in American history ever on an annual basis more than heroin more than pills more than math more than crack and so things just get worse and worse every year people aren't talking about it that much but how is decriminalization going to stop that because decriminalization will just make fentanyl more available the point of legalizing all drugs and again this is a very very messy subject and I'm not a proponent of legalizing all drugs I'm sort of agnostic on and I'm like hmm I don't know I don't know what the fuck is it what is the answer but if you legalize them and you can buy them from reputable sources you would know that you're actually buying cocaine you're not you're not buying some fake Chinese spice Jamyang whatever the fuck they call it you're buying actual cocaine and you look we know if you buy whiskey right you get a thing on the label it tells you what proof it is you know that if you have yeah you know three drinks you're going to be fucked up and we can regulate that we could sort of adjust like I had to already I'm good you know but if you don't know what's in it you don't know what the dose is so you don't know what you're ok with and what you're not okay with one of the good things about alcoholic you get a beer that's a beer you know what that is yeah you know how much alcohol is in there yeah well in some countries in Europe they actually give free heroin and these are addicted users yeah and so that you know it's often not the heroin that kills people at all it's the dirty needles it's the criminal lifestyle used to like pay for the money to buy prostitution things like that and so I went and visited these places called supervised injection facilities have you heard about these yes yeah where were these where they have them well they don't have any in this country is this one in Philadelphia yeah and there was a court case in its favor recently the former governor ed Rendell is like spearheading that but I went to one in Barcelona and so these are places where drug use is totally legal inside the facility they have clean needles they have doctors and nurses supervise it and and they even like so they have like this the smoking room where you can go and do do anything you want they crack pipes like that the government provides they're like government-funded and created crack pipes that they'll hand out to people and they've never had an overdose death in one of these places they they have they're connected to treatment centers they give out methadone suboxone all these treatment drugs it brings people into the system so that they're accounted for and these have been like super successful but in the u.s. there's like federal crackdowns on them you know I again it's I think there's an issue politically right because nobody wants to be the one that says hey we're gonna open up a place where people can come and shootout yeah and people like will fuck this guy my sons hooked on heroin this piece of shit wants to help him you know we what we need is detox center so we need his treatment we don't need a place where you can go and shoot heroin you know but like many things in life this whole heroin thing fentanyl thing all these different it's very messy yeah well so even if you're not going to go that far there are simple steps we can take to help stop the opioid crisis and one thing I'm a big advocate for is called fentanyl testing strips and so that's the weird thing about fentanyl is it's not a demand driven drug like every other drug it's out there because people want it we want cocaine people want heroin people don't want fentanyl sneaking it into other things exactly and so studies have shown that if users know fentanyl is in their cocaine or their math or their heroin or their pills they will be much less likely to use it and overdose up from it and so fentanyl testing strips there they look kind of like pregnancy tests they're really cheap just these paper strips you mix up your solution of whatever you think you have heroin and you dip the strip in there and if there's two stripes that means that you have fentanyl and if there's one it means you don't or else the other way around mm-hmm and so it's it's simple its immediate but but again US laws are so insane that these are actually banned in certain states like Pennsylvania so that could be done to help people understand there's fentanyl on the drugs that they're looking for they're looking for cocaine they're looking for heroin turns out this pencil in there what other steps do you think can be taken to sort of alleviate or at least some want mitigate this awful crisis well of course there's narcan and you know what that is it's the like the miracle opioid overdose reversal drug in nasal spray usually and so if someone has overdosed on opioids fentanyl heroin pills whatever you know if you get these sprays they will bring them back to life literally right and so you know that it's available in some places oh man I am not smart enough to know that I do not know that narcan see if we could find out how narcan works how does narcan work um that's amazing though they figured out something that can know from like where else where what else is do we have that in Pulp Fiction with the needle to the heart remember that we would have seen you know what I was asking someone about that recently and that is total bullshit that is like Quentin Tarantino just making something up that big dramatic scene was fucking awesome yeah that's pretty crazy I mean if you could shove off fucking needle in the middle of your heart pump that stuff in like oh and she pops up to life with a needle out of her chest yeah that's in real life it would have been a nasal spray to the nose yeah but this is 1994 they didn't have they did and so nowadays it's like firefighters librarians these are the people who are encountering opioid overdose victims they're encountering them in the library in the lab to collaborate to do drugs or firefighters or EMTs react to people that are overdosing right yeah and isn't it the case that some fentanyl overdoses the the people actually have it on their skin so these people that are helping them with the police officers or see another thing that's kind of a snopes.com thing they started that ya know that's you can't get it from you can't get an overdose by touching fentanyl it won't go into your skin if someone like there was a you know a mound of fentanyl someone sneezed and it was in the air you could get it by breathing in but by just touching it now oh well that's good to know narcan reversing an overdose it says närcon has a strong affinity to the opiate receptors a stronger affinity to the opiate receptors than opiates opioids like heroin or percocet so it knocks the opioids off the receptors for a short time this allows the person to breathe again it reverses the overdose holy shit man that person needs a Nobel Prize never they need the exact opposite as the guy who sold the drugs to Prince yeah yeah exactly you know they need love and respect yeah that's an amazing discovery so that's good to know because we've actually I think we probably repeated that someone told me that did I ever repeat that on the show that people have to work drugs or gloves when they're handling people with drug overdoses have you ever heard of car fentanyl what is that it's a hundred times stronger than fentanyl it's analog reaches uses like an elephant tranquilizer and in one of the Jurassic Park movies that's what they use to tranquilize the dinosaurs oh yeah that's right and so I I interviewed a bunch of dark web dealers for the book I even actually like met one in person what'd he look like well he asked me not to say buddy we don't have this look he was like a buff dude he was like he very much too much we're gonna find him now like when you were recording like Oh what is that orange VAT of you know did you do that kind of same shit when you're talking to him no no because he knew I was a journalist I told him I was and he wanted to say yeah he just he's like people think of us as scum but I want to tell my story and that's that's what journalists like live right what is his story well he was a he's probably listening to this man hey bro that's crazy he was a drug dealer total family man with his daughter he was like feeding her french fries and stuff but he had he was addicted to at one point he had a lot of sort of depression self-esteem issues but then he tried the opioids and he said it was like an antidepressant it you know so became hooked and so he started selling fentanyl on the dark web because it he didn't want his kids to have to live in poverty he didn't wanna his his drug addiction to interfere and so not only that but he he claims that he's helping addicted users more affordably maintain their habits so he is this big like fuck you know Purdue Pharma anti-government anti-big pharma mentality so he blames like Purdue Pharma made oxycontin pills and God that's how the whole opioid epidemic began so it was first it was the pills then people switched to heroin and now it's fentanyl is in all the heroin mm-hm and so this guy says that because he makes a nasal spray to and he says that people can buy his fentanyl nasal spray on the dark web for like 60 bucks take one spray it's equivalent to one oxycontin pill and that's enough to maintain their addiction and so he says you know instead of paying money to the big pharmaceutical companies people buy this it's much cheaper and so he had a whole moral justification of how he did it so he's an ethical drug pusher that's that was his case the problem is that this stuff fentanyl is so potent and and to make it into a nasal spray you have to use this whole thing it's called volumetric dosing when in the water and you gotta get the exact right proportions and he's not a trained pharmacist you know buying it he's a middleman no no no he does it he may he has a whole process how he does yeah but he's not a trained pharmacist he doesn't you know no he's doing it right yeah it wasn't so I told him that I said that to him and he's like well basically I tested on myself so if I'm doing it wrong I would die so my customers therefore know I've tried it so that guy sounds like he's got a great pitch but I'm not sure yeah I mean you got to justify yeah I get it but so many people who sell drugs and so many people who were involved in drugs there are always the people have fucked up lives like to paint the best version of what they're doing yeah that's what that sounds like yeah I mean I feel like if you're selling fentanyl someone's probably died because of what you sold them I mean it's just it's one of those things where it's so deadly I mean what are the numbers in terms of annual deaths from fentanyl in the United States well it's up over 30,000 a year and that's touch more than think about that's more than the peak of the AIDS crisis think about that while people are trying to ban flavored vapes which is fucking preposterous you know it's it's terrifying 30,000 people god damn that is so many that's a lot of people and there's many many many many people listening to this that know someone who's been affected by this that's the horrific thing is that it's and it's sort of snuck up on us where it's this is not a big thing in the news you don't hear about fentanyl deaths in the news he would think that if there was like kool-aid kool-aid was killing 30,000 people a year holy shit if kool-aid was killing two people yeah yeah yeah but the fact that this fentanyl stuff and it's all happening because it's illegal it's all happening in this sort of weird gray area it's you know a lot of people in the margins it's I want to hear the presidential candidates talking about it yeah like there's so little at the Democrat debate they were asked like what would you do about the fentanyl crisis the opioid crisis and they all said basically we got a sue the pharmaceutical companies mm-hmm like Purdue Pharma now I have sympathy for that argument I mean Purdue Pharma and places like Mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals no one started that they're from st. Louis where I'm from they actually made a ton more pills they made like twenty nine billion pills a year opioid pills at the height of the opioid crisis so these company and they made jokes about it there are these emails that were found that people were like it's almost like people are addicted to these pills you know like it's just like Doritos if you keep eating them will make more dude joking around they're making jokes about that while people were dying while people are dying so so I have total sympathy that these we should sue these companies just like the big tobacco lawsuits in the 90s the money will go towards care treatment all that but that does nothing to stop the fentanyl crisis the pill deaths are already starting to drop which is great heroin deaths are starting to drop which is great but fentanyl deaths are still rising and besides you know this guy Andrew yang who I said the candidate with he talks he has a lot of good solutions you know Elizabeth Warren has some some good some good ideas in her proposal wants to put more money but for the most part like these should be the Democrats people you know what I mean people on the margins but they're like barely talking about it I think it's one of those things where just being president right being president as an impossible job there's no way one person can really control every single aspect of our civilization it's just not possible and I think that's the same thing about running for president no person running for president really can address every single issue that this nation is dealing with so they stick with the big ones like jobs and you know inequality and all the things that are just gonna get people to push the button yeah when they get into the booth I mean that's all they're doing this is just I hope you like me sort of pitch yeah I mean you know it's killing more people than car accidents more than guns even do you know that those more people than guns make sense I mean but what kills me is I just don't see a logical first step where someone can do something about me other than legalization of drugs and this is this is also the step I'm sure you've probably heard what happened in northern Mexico yesterday yesterday no it was a not without Sun no nose a new one a family a woman and her children were gunned down a Mormon woman they you know they have these Mormon compounds in northern Mexico and ten people were murdered which women and children by cartel oh really and just gunned him down they then more people injured ten people a little little kid little girl was shot in the back and she's in a hospital it's like they just gunned these people down and this is all just this inhuman violence from the cartels and the cartels that have grown rose to power and prominence because the fact that there's an illegal drug trade so there's money to be made so instead of that money being made by pharmaceutical companies that money's being made by these ruthless murders cartels and this is this is exactly what happened during prohibition in the United States when they've made alcohol illegal in the 1920s was the 30s was it twenty-something was a twenty twenties yeah when they made alcohol illegal it didn't stop people from drinking it just made people sell it illegally yeah and so organized crime rose and then Al Capone and all these different organized crime members they made insane amounts of money and developed insane amounts of power and we're seeing the exact same thing happening in Mexico and again it's an alcohol as simple right yeah make it legal we're adults it's not this the pills are not simple right it's a scary yeah it's the you know the the war on drugs stuff it it's it's increasingly going to be turned towards China you know and in fact Trump has been meeting with the Chinese President and all the trade war stuff the increasing the tariffs this is now tied into fentanyl and so supposedly in a couple days this might be out by then but there's this announcement of a new partnership China says they're finally going to crack down on these drug labs hmm and we'll see if it happens but the point is like we can do everything we want to try to you know we can go to war with China over this issue but you know what is our past record in this realm like the DEA helped kill Pablo Escobar right but since then there's more cocaine coming out of Colombia than there ever was before you know nowadays El Chapo was arrested tried that's doing nothing to stop the drugs the cartels the drugs coming into the US and and and there's every indication that if we do get China to stop this insane like 90 percent or more of the illicit fentanyl comes from China that if we do get them to crack down on it the industry is going to go to India and India is already starting to see these huge busts like there's these Mexican cartel members getting busted in India for buying fentanyl in India yeah the thing is like China and India have the the two biggest chemical industries when it comes to generics kind of low lower level chemicals and pharmaceuticals the US has the most profitable pharmaceutical industry because we make like the brand-name drugs things like that but when you're talking about generics and stuff like vitamin C acetaminophen which is the drug in Tylenol these are all made in China place like India and so they have this huge kind of brain trust of chemists you know people go to university they they learn how to be chemist and then a certain amount of them get into the illicit industry right so Mexico doesn't have that Mexico doesn't have its own chemical industry and a bunch of scientists who can make fentanyl who can make these new drugs so so that makes India so susceptible to it and and the biggest problem is actually not even the fentanyl itself it's the fentanyl precursors and you know what those are you know the technicals will be used to make fentanyl exactly and so that was sort of the main investigation in my book like almost like a tea pages of the book are dedicated to this one company they're called yuan Chung this Chinese company that makes more fentanyl precursors than any company in the world you know they they they're legit and and not only that they sell them to the Mexican cartels and they're totally sanctioned not only sanctioned by the Chinese government but they get tax breaks from the Chinese government they get subsidies they get their land subsidized their staff training things like that and that was sort of the most jaw-dropping revelation that I had was that the Chinese government is not only failing to crack down but they're encouraging this industry they're encouraging the industry that's insane so it's just the the idea is look it's making a lot of money let's just keep making money yeah it's um a lot of people ask me if they think this is a blatant conspiracy to try to like inflict harm upon the US a subversive form of warfare and so I think it didn't start out that way I think that these these benefits were given so that China could increase its exports could grow its economy particularly when it comes to chemical exports so that's why these tax credit stars they're called value-added tax rebates and so what that means is any chemical that you use to - any ingredients you use to make a chemical for exports you can write off the cost of those of those ingredients when you export it so basically it's like a 16% tax rebate and so they originally did that just to try to like improve their economy improve their exports but what's crazy to me now is that last year in the middle of the trade war this was at the height of when you heard about the trade war every day you know Trump was raising tariffs and doing this and that right at the height of that China increased the tax rebate for fentanyl from 9% to 10% so it was almost like seems like a thumb in the eye right like for fentanyl you know it's I don't know yeah it definitely seems like a big fuck you yeah yeah this is what's crazy about this is that what you said before no one running for president is talking about it the the president has talked about it briefly you know it's but it's not I don't see any movement I don't see any big steps being taken I mean I don't know what big movements could be taken I mean how do you eradicate this stuff well have you heard of medication assisted treatment this is like what I was talking about suboxone methadone and there are these opioid blockers too so so there are all these drugs for low levels you know low level opioids so you take your daily suboxone shot and you don't crave fentanyl you don't crave heroin anymore but but it can't just be the drugs you know you see in TV shows or whatever just this line of people and you know they go back out on the street and then they're you know get back to whatever they were doing but medication assisted treatment combines that with traditional counseling and therapy because a lot of times it's not just it's not just chemical hooks you know what I mean it's people's lives they have problems they're like out of work they got terrible family problems they have trauma in their past and if you can unwrap you know unravel those problems really get to the heart of things people can quit and they do it all the time there's another method that is not widely discussed but it's incredibly effective and that's ibogaine I've heard about that yeah well I know many people that have kicked pills because of ibogaine kicked booze kicked destructive self-destructive habits because of it and is it a root there's a plant from Africa I believe it's from the iboga print and I believe it's C if that's from Africa I don't want to be wrong about this it's legal in Mexico and a friend of my my friend aunt clay went down to Mexico because he had an issue with pills he hurt himself Oh God on pills it's really really fucking up his life went down there got treatment was so stunned by it that he started he opened up his own place down there I try to help oh really Wow what part of Mexico so I don't know substance derived from the plant yeah African shrub called tavern na PHA is that right have enough a iboga which is known for its psychedelic qualities and used in african spiritual ceremonies some claim it's something of a miracle cure for opiate addiction with minimal withdrawal symptoms there's something that happens with ibogaine when you take it that it does something to we rewire the areas of the brain that respond to opiates and that sort of are hardwired for addiction it rewires them in a way that they have a very low recidivism rate mm-hmm very low you know repeat addiction rate yeah like psychedelic seems to be you know so much potential there's this professor that I write about his name is David Nichols and he basically spent his whole career studying psychedelics as a way to help people beat cocaine addictions alcohol addictions even fight things like PTSD and it was actually found that MDMA ecstasy is like this amazing drug for PTSD yeah I've heard this the maps is in the middle yeah exactly yeah yeah they're doing these they're finally have gotten clearance to do these studies and in some cases just using MDMA one time is enough in the term you used it like rewires the brain it's like resetting the harddrive yeah we're like turning the computer off turning it back on again yes and I think it also changes the way people think about drugs because these are not escape drugs in the same sense as heroin is or fentanyl is or cocaine is these are drugs that sort of just give you a refocused perspective reality itself yeah and I don't need to tell you about DMT you know yeah it's another one it's the same but I mean that's also ayahuasca is also very successful for people to quit using the quit smoking using it to quit alcohol people that have real issues it sort of gets to the heart it lets you understand like hey we're gonna take you on a little journey into the mind and show you through dimethyltryptamine show you what's fucking with you right this is something that you've sort of stored away in the back of your brain right rotten and it's you're you're always ignoring it but it's always there so it flavors everything you do right and psychedelics one of the things that they do is they shine a bright light on all of those weird parts of the mind that we all have we all have weird memories or weird feelings or weird you know thoughts of inadequacy or self hate whatever it is that caused us to be self-destructive and make poor choices and a lot of times we're not even aware of it these these things sort of fester in your subconscious and DMT psilocybin a lot of different psychedelic drugs which oddly enough the most potent ones they mirror normal human neural chemistry which DMT is a part of normal human neural chemistry it's produced right you heard that yeah and and I've heard that like I wasyou know ayahuasca is like 12 hours or whatever experience yeah and I've heard that DMT is basically the very peak of that yeah like distilled down yeah it's the way I described it as mushrooms times a million plus aliens they'd have like a profound like lasting impact on you oh yeah yeah it changes who you are I just chant you you you were your pre that thing and then you are now you know now you know that there's a whole nother dimension to understanding and to experience it's just it's very very very different than the normal static world that we all live in yeah there's this guy called Sasha Shogun who yeah you know so I got to go to the farm where he designed all his drugs and you know he dedicated his whole career - trying to you know discover new psychedelics that could be used as medicine and so he took like the the chemical structure of mescaline was one of his most often used they're called the scaffolding effect so it's like that's the chemical scaffolding and so he would tweak little bits to try to come up with new drugs sample tiny bit himself if it did nothing took a little more a little more a little more till it till it had an effect and he invented over a hundred new drugs he he was working for Dow Chemical the people invented Agent Orange at the start of his career and he invented like psychedelics while working there that have like the Dow you know Dow is like patent patented and so he invented this drug that was known as STP is a psychedelic it stood for serenity tranquility and peace I think and so this is like a hippie era drug and there was the Hells Angels I actually got into selling it and distributing it it was uh it was this this crazy story but they but the problem was the hell angel Hells Angels got the dosage wrong so they gave everybody way too much and there was this big this big protest in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco in San Francisco it was called the human bein and they were protesting the banning of LSD that year it was in 1967 and so everybody went to the Golden Gate Park took this stuff this STP and there's really high dosages and they all like la they all like freaked out and ended up in the hospital and so what's it made out of I don't know it's it's it's some kind of not related LSD as it's available now I'm sure it is yeah in the dark web you can you could get it yeah I don't know it doesn't sound that great even in its regular proper dose Sasha Shogun has those books called P Cal and T Cal which are basically cookbooks and know how to make all his psychedelics and even he like wasn't that crazy about this one but but anyway after all these people in Golden Gate Park started freaking out and Dow Chemical realized that it was their guy doing this they're like alright alright that's enough shut him down yeah have you ever heard of Hamilton Morris yeah yeah he's great he's so gentle tunes yeah he's great I've seen him on here yeah yeah he's the most knowledgeable person that I know in terms for sharing of these things and he interviewed Sasha yeah yeah he takes a scientific but yet a connoisseurs approach to drugs I mean he's very scientific about like though what's happening yeah but yet he'll talk about it like the way some oh yeah yeah fine wine yeah he's talking about he took a cannabinoid he's like it's my crown chakra is feeling uh yeah his he's hilarious when he's blitzed on that show Hamilton's pharmacopoeia and you know he's dead right yes yeah it's amazing Earl Morris is such an amazing documentarian yes yeah we did a podcast we've done two but the first one we did we got way too high we were you guys talking about that yeah I mean we were useless it's like a Hamilton Morris is on the show that was the early days of the podcast to the early days of the podcast we often got way too huh yeah I had to figure out how to dial it in yeah that's the number one thing people ask me what I said I was going on this show they're looking at - show I would be so useless and in part no information and and plus it's like the opioid epidemic I gotta like write my facts right well it doesn't seem like appropriate time to get fucked up yeah yeah what are you trying to do with this book besides let people know the history offense you know do you feel like with education you you can do some good because people will be armed with facts and understanding and they can make better choices yeah all the above the government is of the US government have been reaching out to me that's great that's good to hear yeah people want like this China stuff nobody knew anything about what China was doing and why and and so I'm you know like the left and the right I sort of like like this which is a rare consensus because the the right wing is really into like China is fucking with us and the left wing is really into this this idea of harm reduction and that's my big sort of talking point it's like the war on drug stuff is I was compared to sex education right I mean we can teach abstinence believe that kids aren't going to have sex stick our heads in the sand or we can do understand kids are always going to have sex because you're always gonna take drugs let's try to help them do it more safely right and so you know if I've been in rooms where it was like hardcore Law & Order Republicans and I just try to like make my point like you know we can keep doing things the way we have we're failing miserably why not give these other methods a chance mm-hmm you know and a lot of times they have a proven track record of success in places like Europe like what are we waiting for Brian yeah we have this Puritan ideal you know this the the abstinence ideal and then we apply that to drugs and I just think it's so foolish it really is and I and it it's also so politically dangerous to say anything other than that yeah I think it's you know the good news is like the optimistic thing is that that's slowly changing you know and a lot of people say well during the crack air it is a lot of racism people say like during the crack era it was all about like lock these people up you know criminalize the users but now that it's like the white politicians kids who are dying from opioids now all the sudden this is a this is a health problem and this is something we need to address as a disease you know and so that's there's no doubt that that's true but at the same time the positive is that like this is spilling into other realms too so I went to North Dakota this small town Grand Forks where this 18 year old kid overdosed and died on fentanyl and it just shocked the town everyone freaked out but it inspired all these new reforms so now they have all these new laws in North Dakota like things like the good some in law where if someone is with you and they die from drugs you can call the police and they won't arrest you you know what I mean because that happens in a lot of places still right if you know they blame the person who were there with and and they have things like they can use Skype like a Skype type service when they live in these small rural towns to get a prescription from a doctor or far away think they can use these services and and what they told me in Grand Forks is that this system is it's spilling over to other even like alcoholism now people are starting to think of that as a disease and so I think there is slow progress being made well that's that's good to hear I mean it just takes time right for people to understand that this is this is a real issue that's affecting everyone I think you're right about the racism in terms of like the attitude about crack versus cocaine and that could clearly be demonstrated by its sentencing ya know people were sentenced the mandatory minimums for crack crack use yeah I was so much higher if when people got caught with crack or selling crack I mean they went to jail for a long fuckin time whereas people got caught with cocaine they didn't go to jail for as long and the treatment there the the sentence is much smaller and dr. Carhart you know yeah yeah he's great he's great as well I've had him on here and he was explaining he's like look there is no difference yeah it's like it is cocaine like this is cocaine yeah you want to break it down to the drug effect on the body they are the same thing and yeah one of them sends you away for a long time one of them does yeah well for my book about West Coast hip-hop called original gangsters I interviewed a freeway Ricky Ross is here yes couple terms yeah so he original Rick Ross the original Rick Ross exactly and he his sort of the innovation of their era was I was called ready Rock and so before people would people preferred to smoke cocaine even before crack was invented freebase that was very exact Richard Pryor got in trouble with yeah yeah so the innovation was to make it so you didn't have to freebase it was ready to smoke so they called it ready rock and easy ease first record label they is called his record label is called ruthless but they were gonna call it rock house records you know for that reason and so he was uh he was a crack dealer before he got in the music industry yeah the rick ross story is the real rick ross story I should say and Rick Ross Freeway Ricky which is with the east column was making millions and millions of dollars did not have any idea that he was involved in that whole all of them conscious yeah it's just incredible yeah they were using the cocaine money to fund the the war with the consciousness and in ystos yeah it's yeah Rick Ross is uh I wrote about him and so I ended up actually playing tennis with him because I was a really good tennis player yeah I heard he was a I was a big high school tennis player too so I was like let's do this and he's you know he's got some years on me I don't know how old the I think he's maybe late 50s but he was he was holding his own we played in like a South Central a tennis court somewhere and he he took some games off me that well his story is incredible because they sent him away on the three strikes rule for life and then while he was in jail he learned how to read learned how to understand the law and he started like literally taught himself to be a lawyer and then realize like no the way they used the law was incorrect and unlawful they the three-strikes means you get arrested for larceny you get out you get arrested for larceny you get out you get a last rest they did it in one swoop so they gave him two charges at the same time and put him in for three strikes and he was able to successfully prove that that was wrong that's why he's out right now Wow he he's so smart one of the things he taught me that you know you guys hear about crack babies all the time and he's like cover of Newsweek babies he was like you know crack babies aren't real that's not a real thing he said that his I believe I hope I'm not speaking out of school I think like his wife like maybe smoked crack while his son was in utero never had any problems and he's like yeah look around do do your research click crack babies is not a real thing that's crazy because I remember hearing that as well at crack babies were the thing we're all worried about in the 80s oh my god wait till the year 2000 all these crack babies are 20 years old yeah I know yeah where are they now maybe they're mumble wrappers because you understand real rap music definitely that's who I am yeah let's generation nas huge nas fan Gang Starr love Gang Starr of course biggie Tupac you know the the classics you know I mean Big Daddy Kane I love EPMD yeah you know god there's so many this it's just that era it was like I mean there's a couple errors and that I just listed but it is lyrical like nas is my favorite I think yes his lyrics they're so intricate you know he's he the way he words things you just go oh shit you know yeah I hear his lyrics you just go oh like the king of he's like the oh shit came yeah for lyrics man he's the best what was the was it rewind what was the one where he played the whole song backwards oh yeah talking about the bullet going back into the gun all the way through the entire story he starts at the end and then backs up the story maybe he had some fucking classics I think he's the best writer in all of hip-hop yeah well you know it's just his beats don't always hit me the right way but he's got so many classics he's earned like the right but but my big thing because I did live in New York and I was an East Coast you know like music snob and like Biggie's clearly the best ever I got one for you fine off you're real cool G rap oh yeah he's the I mean he's the original he's the best he's mine undisputed underground guy like people don't know yeah you list like some of the Great's of all time people don't say Kool G Rap can listen to cock-blocking that is one of the best fucking songs this day I'll go listen that song and I'll make me laugh yeah that was yeah I mean that that like 80s New York stuff is so so much of it hill streets so like so intellectual so amazing wordplay yes but see when I came to LA though everyone's like Tupac Tupac Tupac and I was like I don't get it man he's his flow is not that great you know I just don't get it but but the more I like listen to his lyrics the more I saw he was more than just a rapper he was like a cultural influence he was like a political leader to a lot of people and finally I'm like yes I get it he stood for something and now like I just don't hear Biggie the same way you know because so many of his songs are about you know partying and crime and stuff and the bigger message of Tupac just really won me over and then well I don't think it's a competition but I know what you're saying I mean Tupac definitely had a different vision but biggie you also have to realize biggie was like how old when he died oh yeah yeah yeah I mean Tupac was 25 I'm one of my favorite videos of Biggie is biggy standing on a street corner when he was like 16 17 years old rapping you ever see that I think I have with the lumberjack stuff yeah he's got a fucking eye I think he might even have a piece of paper in his hand where's like reading the rap off where he's got it like in case he fucks up but his forget low was so good even as a little kid there's a fucking kid man you know he's like as good as any rapper alive what can you find that can we play that we'll get in trouble I'll play it for you after yeah well after the podcast we'll play it and his his breath control and like that wait sometimes I feel like you gotta be like yeah add almost something amazing singer a rapper well comedians to a lot of fat comedians like Patrice O'Neal one of the greatest of all time there was something about his girth when he was on stage I was like our and the like this whole thing is big amazing yes what's that a small towel Oh might be a towel oh yeah you're right yeah and just murdering it murdering it around them now look at everybody you know I saw this early Tupac videos and heard early Tupac recordings and his original style influence was actually Fresh Prince of bel-air yes sir humph yeah did you honor yeah yeah well he was like in the background of the humpty-hump dance yeah yeah you can see ya know Tupac was a dancer I mean and when he was young which is really interesting when they interview him he was like he wasn't thugged-out at all like well he's the son of two Black Panther as you know the politics was always his thing what is that from oh yeah solo debut Wow yeah Digital Underground whatever happened to them Humpty Humpty I'm shocked gee he's yeah he's still around he's they were so good they had great shit when you write a song that's as profitable as the Humpty dance I would imagine that kind of like saps your need to do too much else when you're that set but no he has though he's he's the real deal there was a lot of great hip-hop in that era I mean I'm sure there's a lot of great hip-hop now but to me it's like it's almost like like I'm a classic rock fan as well like if I'm sitting there and I'm about to go for a drive and I'm like what do I listen to nine times out of ten I'll go to lynyrd skynyrd Zeppelin or the doors or you know the Allman Brothers Patti love Tom Petty I just go to those classics for whatever reason since there's so much music I know there's great stuff out now I still listen to some great stuff now I love the Black Keys I love them they're still putting out killer shit but Empire weekend album is amazing I don't know if you've heard that what's that Vampire Weekend they're from New York it's a it's a band there they're the lead singer Ezra Koenig is with what's-her-name Jones from Parks and Recreation this ashita Jones new band they're not that new but I'm are weekend fucking amazing Lana Lana Del Rey of them this is great shit out there there's no doubt but it's just it's almost like there's too much there's like but that's it's great about music I mean it's an untapped like it's a well that never runs dry and that's what I always go back to it well it's interesting to me to that much of I mean I it's it's weird when we talk about drugs because drugs seem like a blanket expression that you can throw over things that are good and bad things that are productive like caffeine and things that are terrible like math mmm-hmm but there's a lot of music that you would say is like oh well what the fuck happened between 1960 and 1970 because something happened ya know the music of 1960 and then you go to the music of 1970 you go to the music of 2009 in 2019 they're fuckin the same man it's like there's great stuff there's a lot of variety but there's no like what the fuck happened but from 1960 to 1969 what the fuck happened something happen in that that's something's drugs that's jut your you know it's like the whole societal shift went right around right along with it they kind of fueled each other the the psychedelics absolutely I guess that dirt weed they were smoking probably affected him too while they smoked so much of it it became effective but you know I talked to some people they said there was always some good weed back then you know they'd call it Acapulco gold or whatever but there was no botanist some fucking scientists that are working on like some of the way I have today which 40-plus percent THC mind-numbing you know I can't feel your feet you know that kind of stuff like I don't think they had any of that Keef it was just like I just came back to LA for the first time recently went into a legal weed store for the first time I didn't buy anything but but they're like the dosages are so high yes you know all of them like why there's got to be a connoisseurs market for like micro dosing of weed like where's that what would you want to get is those CBD THC tablets I heard their capsules and it's 10 milligrams 10 milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD and it's so nice it's just a nice calm mellow high like you just like appreciate things a little bit more the colors are a little bit of eye bright but you can just walk around and talk to people you don't you know like fuck I gotta go home and get out of their coverage stop you know and but the thing is there's so many like hardcore stoners today that they need those high doses cuz their tolerance is so high and they're just trying to melt their face off like every time they go in there they're trying to find some new thing that melts their face off harder I just like I don't know man psychedelics like LSD you know I'm like going in the other direction really like we went vegan you know like not smoking weed really not like drinkin much it's just like exercising eating like the best food I don't know I'm just like trying out this new thing just I just want to feel good all the time you know what I mean so just experimenting and we my wife actually got us into like Whole Foods plant-based so it's not you know like you can eat crappy vegan food obviously Nikki Glaser talking about this you know people talk about fake meat and like the impossible whopper and I had one yeah but it's like it just makes you feel crappy like old whopper did yeah so like if you cut out the product the processed food right that to me is what is making me feel like I have energy all the time yes sleep better how thick do you ma'am and that's where it's at you know be be kind to your body your body will treat you better that's just how it is drink more water exercise when you can do you meditate at all yeah yeah I've been I've been getting that yeah yes you Nikki talking about that yeah I mean I feel like all these things that were saying all these the moves towards positive lifestyle choices will and also in some way sort of negate this move towards these drugs and this this that the Vaness of these drugs if people are drawn towards being healthier and happier and cleaner and keep your mind right you'll be less likely to want to seek this sort of that opiate just escape yeah it's it's a hundred percent it's like Johann Hari in his book he's been out here chasing The Scream yeah he like blew my mind with something with these revelations that really it's just like people can age out of these drugs you know I always thought like when you're addicted to heroin or fentanyl it's like for life you're never getting free but when people get their stuff together they just age out of it and then they they don't even have to try so I agree with what you're saying I think the attractiveness of living a happy healthy life is contagious it's very addicting and that people addicting in the right way addictive in the positive way you see someone living a good healthy life and being happy and be nice to people and smiling or laughing a lot and having your life go well were you making a good living and you're you're being productive and creative and all those good positive things those are attractive to other folks and yeah if they see that and they go oh is it do I want to be like Mike over there who's doing well or Cindy who's doing well or do I want to be like those poor fools that are under the bridge that are living in tents because yeah they have drug addicts their drug problems yeah it's I've had kind of a debate with my wife because she you know all these drugs like no locks no lock zone and methadone these are opioids too you know so some people criticize it and they say well you're just advocating for someone to go off one drug onto another drug and my wife in particular is like you know should really be encouraging people to go off these drugs all together and like you know whether it's a spiritual approach meditation all that you know and she's she's not wrong but it's just like what do the numbers show what are people capable of doing you know it's I don't have all the answers I don't have the answers for everyone my friend Artie Lange just I just did a podcast with him yeah I heard about that and he's free and clean for nine months now I've never seen him look better his eyes they're there they're sparkling like he's that's made resin and he's talking and he detailed like all the various ways that he tried to get off and all the different things that he did and nothing worked other than this last time he just he kind of hit that rock bottom thing and had slowly but surely worked his way out of being addicted into this place of sobriety and then two days led to 20 days led to three months led to where we are now and you know he's is so happy and you know he's still getting his piss tested like five times a week I mean he's under it's crazy because he's under this program where if he fucks up he goes to jail I think he goes jail for a long time he's not a dealer and he didn't do any violent crime or anything like that is just a user it's really strange that they've got him on this this drug court thing but what it's doing for him is it's forcing him to be accountable and forcing him to be sober and then he's doing that then and then he's saying look I like this I'm gonna die I can I'm happy I'm alive I'm doing great I'm doing shows I'm I feel good as fucking stories were insane he's so funny he was so far sold much more like vibrant than I've ever seen him before and it was so I love when I see people doing well I love it I love what someone was there their life was fucked up and now it's not fucked up at all like he's doing great on the right path and the more people see things like that I think the better is for all of us I think some people it's like part of their identity to be like that guy who's like drunk yes you know in like the life of the party yes and even like there's so much like I'm no you know I'm not like a teetotaler but there's so much part of the culture is drinking you know what I mean and it's there's so many like I'm drinking beer for breakfast like this is amazing and people get caught up in that and it doesn't agree drinking is not for everybody right you know but they that it becomes part of their identity and so we my wife and I do this thing called Kundalini Yoga man my son already just didn't goes old got my high yeah it does I heard someone else describe it as like totally for drug people who like a guy address because you get that buzz in your head it's like half meditation half yoga and I'm like the world's least flexible person so it's not like hard yoga but it's just that you have to it's mind over matter stuff and so you do things like you know we had to do this one where you put your arms above your head and hold it in this position and do this mantra for like 11 minutes and you're constantly correcting your posture you're trying to like you know look in your third eye and your brain doesn't have time to wander around and think those negative thoughts and how terrible you are right and at the same time it's like a physically demanding thing to do I mean it doesn't look like much but you're like sweating and you know my wife like God got us into that there's so many recovery stories because I really think it's it's it's like people think it's a chemical thing but it's like a mind thing these are often yes and I think that the ability to silence all the internal chatter that you're just discussing like that thing like you think about being a terrible person or you hate yourself or that is so common with people and so many people just live with those those thoughts bouncing around their head and they don't have an outlet and that's another reason why they turn to alcohol or turn to drugs they try to like squash that chatter but when you force that's one of the things that I really love about yoga is no matter what's going on in my life it's business stuff personal stuff creative stuff whatever it is it's bothering me I can do yoga and the difficulty of those poses makes me concentrate almost entirely on them and I take a concerted effort to just think about my breathing and like meditation you'll go off track and you start thinking about things all gonna pay that bill or go do this thing or I gotta make sure I call that guy and but you can get right back on track if you just always concentrate on your breathing always concentrate on the pose concentrate on your breathing concentrating the pose and just know that you're gonna get off-track a couple times three thing but enough you'll stay on track enough so that there is some sort of cleansing effect and when class is over I feel better I just feel good okay yogi I do hot yoga chameleons yeah yeah there's a funny book about that the guy who started that I was like yeah that's the fucked-up part about the place that I go to they actually changed the name called Bikram and this guy's too fucking radioactive and they teach the same postures which he didn't even invent by the way and these are fucking thousands of years old these pressures and the sequence he didn't even invent he just someone authorized yeah he popularized it and look as gross as that guy is he's done a huge service by spreading his yoga across the country and it's it's like many things in life things are messy you know like life is a messy proposition and this guy you could say well fuck yoga cuz that guy's Yoga Yoga is a physical practice done by millions and millions not billions of people it's the same with the liter of Kundalini this guy named yogi bhajan and he he's gross too he oh there's lawsuits against him since he died and stuff like I think any like cult people call it a cult like they wear white there's but he came from the punjab region in India and the the Kundalini Yoga was like only for the Brahmins or only for the like elite class and so what he did was he came to the US and he brought it for like the common people and so there were people apparently who were so upset about this back from India that there were attempts on his life I heard that he you know he wore the where's the big what do you call that holds your hair even the big turban yeah that's bulletproof no but someone came in with a sword and he had a comb stuck in there and it was like I think a metal comb and that was the only thing that saved his life from this sword attack from the back that sounds like a great story this sword bounced off my comb and I am here to teach yoga yeah this happened something happens when people become like a leader of something that especially something that's so spiritually oriented and also sexual there's something about yoga class everybody's in their underwear everybody sweaty and you're all like sort of releasing and it's like it's very sexual in a lot of ways that's why people think yoga teachers like the hottest teachers like if like a girls like a yoga teacher your friend goes dude I'm dating a yoga teacher yeah my wife's taking a teacher training so that's amazing I think it's just like they're literally you have like an aura you know what I mean something about it there's focused yeah you know on making your being more healthy and yes but then for men for gross men problem is like like all these women are like you you've probably such amazing things another thing for you well I mean every call I mean it's like quit yeah such a stereotype like have a cult but don't make it about seducing the underage women in the cult don't you make it the women I mean it's always that's it always they always become sex cults yeah exactly always and don't like steal everyone's money like just change the script a little bit this time yeah I mean everything from Waco to Jim Jones to all if they wind up fucking everybody's wife and take it all the money yeah exactly what was that Netflix documentary that plays some water yeah amazing yeah amazed and again sex sex and money it was all about sex that guy was banging everybody it's like orgies yes and there's fucking crazy but that's always what happens it always becomes some wacky sex cult always yeah always yeah I mean that's the number one thing that makes people distrustful of called sex and money yeah things that people want our life the most these are probably other than love which is probably the wisest way that's part of it too like it's finding someone to care about you that's why people join gangs you know ice-t talks about that his own parents never said they loved him but in the gang they they were like I love you right he wasn't in the Crips but he did like friends and yeah they took him in yeah people want meaning you know they want meaning in life and I I agree with you what you said also about a lot of times when people use drugs or drink or whatever whatever it is that's their vice they become a prisoner to that thought like that this is their identity this is Mike Mike's the drunk look at Mike getting fucked up fucked up every night bro you know yeah and some of the best advice I got is like is to not be so worried about your identity like think of it it was like a small eye instead of a capital I like I think about myself in certain ways you know I'm like I'm like the guy who likes hip-hop I'm the you know the guy who does this or that and that's you know but like do I need to be that guy like if I don't listen to hip-hop I'll learn about all this other music that I might like even better right you know and so the more you just strip that stuff away the more you can get to the essence of who you really are yeah the more you just just enjoy things and not wonder whether you should be enjoying them or whether they fit your package yeah someone not just someone but many people have said this to me and it's one of the grossest thing anybody has ever said they go really love what you're doing with your brand but the fact that people people can see through that stuff so easily if you were really doing that oh fuck you they can but it's also like the idea that yeah you are a brand you're a brand hmm Ben Westhoff you fuckin brand you yeah I wish what is a brand a person's a brand love what you're doing with your brand like yeah so if you ever meet me don't say that well I think you say it I think you pride yourself on just saying what you really think and I think that uh dad is your Brad I mean as lame as that sounds like not having a brand is like your brand kind well fortunately I developed fuck you money at a time where I like during the fear factor days I got fuck you money and I used it to say fuck you and so like it used it correctly huh so I just saw this is I am like I'm nice I'm a good guy like but this is how I think about things I'm not I'm not gonna like the problem with Hollywood it's one of the giant problems is that you're always trying out for the next thing you're always auditioning and that's a people develop an incredibly disingenuous mindset because the mindset is I want to be manipulative to the casting agents and the producers I want them to like me so I want to adopt whatever conglomeration of ideas they have politically socially I want to fit in so this is why Hollywood is almost like universally left-wing it's not because the people are all they all think exactly the same way because they're creative types and that would be ideal right but that's not what it is what it is is the people that run the show know that this is how the shows run the show's run through progressive thought you vote Democrat you support these candidates you want a woman president you wanted this you wanted that you've Pro everything that the left stands for and so these people they don't even have their own opinions they just have these opinions they've adopted because they think it's gonna help them get through and so then they do get through and then they become famous and then they go who the fuck am I like they don't know who they are they don't they don't and then when it comes to like hey tell us your opinion on this like oh my god they don't even know what their opinion is because they didn't have never really developed opinions they've developed an act and that act is say the things that these people would like you to say so that you can continue to work so that you can get picked because if there's two people that are up for a role and one of them is like this staunch libertarian who's like this pull yourself up by your bootstraps thing that you know doesn't believe in white privilege and and the other one is like super progressive I call myself a male feminist I want a woman president like that guy gets the roll yeah I mean that's the ironic thing too though is like a lot of you know like real liberals see Hollywood as this like reactionary place in its own right you know what I mean like the the right wing like Christian part of the culture sees Hollywood is this horrible cesspool but then the left-wing seiza is playing to this you know the Weinsteins stuff all the like worst elements of you know male-dominated corporate culture epitomized in Hollywood so it's it's funny how its hated on by yeah this is both sides but I think that Weinstein stuff is the same thing as the cult stuff it's just like you got a guy gets power and he has a bunch of people that have to like he he creates their careers like you want to be in this movie dick and that's what he did I mean he literally did the casting couch thing a grand scale because well yeah it's it's what happens to so many people where they have that position where they're they're taking people and they're hiring them and then putting them in these magical positions look at her she's on the big screen she's a star I could have been the star but I didn't have sex with Harvey who and then this is this is creates that culture and that guy just just ran through that business with impunity I mean he was just doing it that way forever yeah I think I don't like when you look at Hollywood movies like what it is and what the formula became I always wonder if this is if this is like something that developed organically or if it's like we're hardwired to want to see this kind of like take the three-act structure right mm-hmm like every movie has ever 3x structure right whether it's the most independent or the biggest Hollywood so it's like why is that is that part of our brain you know and take songs like pop songs they're all structured the same first chorus verse bridge you know course again and I don't know well you read any Joseph Campbell yeah I haven't read it but I know the basic ideas yeah and Joseph Campbell did you know the journey of the hero the hero's journey all all that like mirrors itself like that that's the structure of most of these fantastic stories where this hero goes through this transformation and faces this adversary and overcomes it in this story this sort of structure is repeated over and over again it's it's something that's like deeply embedded in an in culture deeply embedded in the psyche of human beings yeah well yeah there you go yeah there's the answer yeah and so so when I'm trying to like write a book like this I want I want there be narrative and tell stories you know what I mean like there's there's drug books out there and it gets way deep into the neuropharmacology and you know but it's like ultimately you know 30,000 people dying of fentanyl is a horrifying statistic but it's almost impossible to wrap your mind around it when you know one person who died like my friend his name was Michael Schaeffer Meyer in 2010 he died from fentanyl patches I'd never heard of fentanyl at the time capatch killed a patch and he was drinking at the same time but then what actually literally killed him was and he he was sleeping with his face in the pillow anything like cut off you know it just cut off his breathing oh he didn't like have the strength to move oh my god and so so that's why they think these these number of deaths actually might be undercounted because his death was listed I believe is like cardiac arrest or something so that doesn't even show up as a fentanyl death for example and so but just yeah just that one story means so much more to me than 30,000 people I don't know for example you know what I mean yeah that's the problem what is that old expression the death of one person is a tragedy death of a million is a statistic yeah I think that was some think that was a Nazi that said that wasn't it um gurbles someone like that I forget who it was someone terrible had that expression but we eat and we don't there's so many people that's also a part of the problem like 3,000 people die every year from aspirin 150 people die every year because co-pilots fall on their head oh no no I think Tylenol actually has the narrowest like therapeutic window it's not really a single death is a tragedy a million deaths it's statistic when one dies is a tragedy when a million dies it's a statistic yeah oh that's a little redundant well you say twice so the Russian people a lot of times I've tried you know many people have successfully killed themselves with Tylenol because it's got such a narrow therapeutic window like the amount that makes you feel better versus the amount that will kill you isn't that far apart and it's the same with fentanyl and that's why like I mean you could drink too much water and kill yourself right there was a woman who did that on a radio show contest he's trying to win like a game station like a xbox or something for a kid it was like an I believe it was in San Jose and they were having a water-drinking contest and there's also kids have done it they were getting hazed for for fraternities yeah and people you hear a lot about ecstasy overdose deaths because people didn't drink enough water so like MDMA isn't usually what kills you it's like you you're in the hot Sun at a rave you overheat you drink you don't drink enough water but actually some people have heard that and then they drink too much water and that kills them at a rave how much water kills you how much water do you have to drink before I think probably let's say you get done I think a gallon an hour for five hours do you think that'll kill you a gallon that is a ton of water for one hour yeah you think that'll kill you for five hours five hours I have no idea I have yet I guess no we're playing a game here I'm guessing no I'm thinking three gallons an hour for a nap for three hours you're dead you got the over/under on that what what does it say Jamie is there a statistic the Miller mote a little Miller Miller that kid millimolar yeah that thing that's like four I know he tells the sodium level things blood level that gets to your brain that's one can fuck you up so I'm trying to find out oh so it dilutes yeah dilutes your so what if you drink water with a lot of salt in it then your speedo could probably get sodium Texas by the way that will give you explosive diarrhea trust me on that last year we were doing the sober October fitness challenge we're doing all's me and my yeah but last year we went crazy we did we had a fitness challenge this year we just went sober and we did bunch of classes and different things but last year we went like five six hours of cardio a day nutty shit and I was drinking literal just giant 64 litres of water with epsom salts or not epsom salts Himalayan salt in it and if you don't get that mixture right that stuff will come rocketing out of your ass like a broken fire hydrant it's crazy and then I googled it afterwards I was like what is that and then I googled that it's actually like a salt enema by drinking a bunch of salt for whatever reason I guess your body just goes hey what is all this water and salt this guy's sick something's wrong here everybody out of the pool and it just backfired on ya it just but there you got to get it right it's just you know only need like a teaspoon you don't need like multiple tablespoons yeah well I've been you know I ran a marathon and I'm into long-distance running and it's gotten to the point where at first I was always doing it for my health you know what I mean I was like I'm getting next getting my workout in get exercise but then I grew like it's so much that it was like negatively affecting my health you know like I ran maybe ten miles with my buddy Jeff the other day and I just felt that huffily afterwards but I loved doing it you know why did you feel awful because you're when I was like grouchy with my kids and yeah my level my you know everything was depleted and I was tired and hungry and yeah then the next day I was sore but it's funny when you cross that plane to just wanting to do the thing itself yes well that's a high as well I mean obviously aware the endorphins that you get from running I never really experienced that the way I did during that sober October thing because one of the things that me and my friends talked about was how when you do do cardio for like five six hours a day you don't give a fuck like you like all of your fucks are gone yeah he's like things don't bother ya like people can yell at you like oh hi keep yelling yes doesn't mean anything I can things don't bother you it's weird like you're on some I don't give a fuck drug and I was Talent we were all talking about I was like if you could take that drug how great would that drug be because you don't you don't use any cognitive function it's not like you're high and you can't figure out what's going on oh you the exact same person but you have zero internal chatter and zero negative thinking it's like it's gone it's like yeah once the meditation is the closest that I get to that yeah things bounce off you you don't you know like judge everything so carefully so harshly you just like things come in you process it you react in your own time you're not letting your ego get in the way I think there's a certain amount of physical requirements that all of our bodies have and most of those physical requirements are not being met and then when you do do something with that where is your body out you know uh and then you realize like oh a lot of that anxiety was just this excess energy yeah that's just this does this body which is designed to be able to perform your body is designed to be able to you know carry groceries and you know run away from animals or trying to get you all there all these different things that your body evolved to be able to do and then most of what you do is sit in your car or sit on the train sit in your chair at the office and that's what a lot of people do and because of that your body's just like well they're yeah exactly yeah I went to the Boundary Waters you know the Boundary Waters Canoe area in northern Minnesota know what is this like this amazing chain of lakes where there's no motorized boats allowed there's no motors at all some parts of it planes can't even fly over it's all portaging so you take canoes and then from Kadena to connect one leg to another you have to carry your canoe over your head and like maybe maybe a quarter mile sometimes like a full mile you've got your big pack side with a canoe over your head well it's two people carry the canoes that's why it is long and it's like the most amazing full-day workout we would get up at dawn and like we'd be canoeing and portaging all day and I had no idea my body could handle it I get my like 30 minutes of exercise in every other day and I'm like I'm good but now we're exercising hardcore like eight hours a day and my body just loved it and by the end of it it was like oh we have to go back to the city life again and it's not looking forward to it yeah if you get your body used to that like I imagine if you you worked on a ranch or something like that you're throwing bales of hay every day and doing chores and walking around your body's just gonna become accustomed to it your your body becomes accustomed to the demands that you require of it but most people just don't use their body enough and there's a really disappointing thing that we're really intelligent people connect exercise with being a superficial thing and there's less of that now there was when I was younger but that if you exercised and you were into your appearance and you were you know you were trying to look good by working out and you were somewhere another shallow yeah a meeting we're concerned with books and like you know like pursuits Yeah right but those things are not mutually exclusive right and if you're really smart you realize that this is the only fucking body you have yeah and if you're really smart you realize that it's good to have a body that's not disgusting yeah the whole like I hope I die before I get old like I don't agree with that like my kids is like Sports is our bonding thing it's like sports sports sports sports all day long and I started to stop to think about that for a little while I'm like there's other things in life you know what I mean what's the values that I'm imparting on my kids for doing sports but ultimately it's just like a sense of exercise you know there's there's some competition but it's like it's not like they're crying if they lose you know a healthy sense of that and just this idea that you want to see exercise and physical activity as your friend because that's a lesson you're going to use your whole life that is a great lesson and I can to bring it back to fentanyl and drugs and drugs of escape the more you can emphasize the more we all can emphasize healthy choices with your life the less attractive those escapes will be yeah you know I think it is you know why do people you know the sad thing is that the opioid epidemic was so often started by people who were prescribed drugs from their doctors and so that's another thing there's a sea change happening right now is that there's all these new regulations about what doctors are allowed to prescribe they're trying to discourage them from taking Opie from prescribing opioids and that's a positive shift I think for people who are new patients right it's like if you get a root canal you don't need some crazy strong opioid you know you know it's like to recover like a from a dental procedure or whatever but the problem is that now they're starting to take away people's opioids when they've been on them for a long term like I talked to this woman from Colorado and she had a disease I can't remember rheumatoid arthritis or something she'd been taking opioids for for years and years and years and now all the sudden the doctor was like I can't give you these anymore you have to take these classes about alternatives to opioids you know and they talked about acupuncture and yoga and stuff like I know that's great but she felt like just degraded you know and and and studies have shown that people if they get their opioid pills taken away they're gonna turn to Street heroin as a result and so the whole the whole thing is it's insanely complicated yeah you talked about that that there's three waves right the first wave is the pills second wave is Street heroin and then third wave is phenyl yeah exactly and so so we're still facing the repercussions from the first one and that's what all these lawsuits that you hear about in the news are all about and the the the another scary thing is that up until now people hadn't been asking for fentanyl by name like we said it's just put in other drugs but now in places like San Francisco even st.
