all right gentlemen we're live with a freshly fed Urijah Faber no more dieting no more weight cutting is this up his mic on okay there we go there it is yeah just pull that sucker up to you Dan Cody motherfucking gar Brandt finally made it yeah here gentlemen what's happening just chill we had a nice little beach run and I jumped in the ocean Cody kept his shoes on and all that good stuff he's got a mouthful of those green belly bars don't you see tucking in your mouth like a squirrel these teeth are specialty that I have like pockets in here I need to floss like twice a day this guy's making fun of me he's like bro you've been brushing your teeth 120 minutes 20 minutes straight brushing his teeth I thought my teeth came you know walked out and I was like man he still brush my teeth made me have the second guest up that I brush my teeth long [Laughter] braces or anything so I've got like all these natural oil gaps it's like I'm like a squirrel my food gets stored up in there I gotta get it out I understand how does it feel to not have to worry about we were talking about this before the podcast not have to worry about weight cutting anymore to be able to eat healthy not not banged up anymore man it's been really really nice you know I was kind of envisioned after even wrestling in college like having a break and then you know went 14 years longer to fighting people but I mean it is really nice to be able to I mean you go train I train when I want to but I don't do this stuff I don't want to I I get in and do the grappling rounds or whatnot but I just feel so much better yeah you do look healthy but you made out of retirement perfect and I mean like you had a long career but you didn't get too banged up like you just and you pick the right time you went out with a win with a quality opponent like right off into the sunset I know man I don't know I was little luck a little bit of it just felt right though you know I mean the last fight went out to what five million people on big Fox it was the first fight in my hometown in the new arena that's like the heart and like revives our town you know we had Cody fight for the belt like coming right up and and you know it was just perfect man yeah you got you timed it good you timed it good you know it's nice it's nice to see someone do it the right way and I hope other guys coming up can can learn from you in that regard well one of the things I thought about was first and foremost like I've been rocked more in the last two and a half years of my practice and live fights than I had in my entire career which is you know a lot of different factors probably you know how many times you're rolling the dice you know you get hit in the head a bunch of different times things are loosened up a little bit you get a little bit older guys are getting better I got Cody gar Brants in the gym and Chad Mendez's and and you know Lance Palmer's these guys that hit heavy so you know I was just like that's one factor then I lost two fights in a row for the first time in my career ever even though it was a decision to dominate and a decision to uh what's his name and call Riviera Jim Ruby era Jim Riviera and it was like kind of lackluster losses but nonetheless is like you know just like you know what I'm not going on I'm gonna I'm gonna call this one at a good time smart very smart man and I really do hope more guys learn you know and pay attention to how you did it and do it the right way cuz like how do you guys feel about like you know you've seen like a lot of these guys are going over to Bellator and I think Bellator signed some really good fighters you know like Rory MacDonald lorenz larkin and they've got I mean Gegard Mousasi they got some great talent over there but they also have guys that are you know late 40s 50s still bang yeah freak show stuff for me we always talked about this I told your eye I said if I start getting fucked up in there knocked out like I'm gonna keep fighting like make sure that you pulled me away from I like be the homie that says hey sits me down like hey let's do a different career path you know if I always say that you know that's one thing I always say you know we're fighters were always gonna fight through it and obviously a lot of different reasons now financially or mm-hmm sometimes it's just hard to walk away what do you do when you know the next chapter your life people don't set that up you know luck I'm fortunate I have a lot of you know good people around me so you know I'll have different avenues to go and I always tell them hey if I start getting fucked up in there tell me it is important to understand that the kind of intensity and focus that's required to be a great fighter you could do anything you really absolutely just apply it yep just apply just figure out what that next thing is gonna being go out at the same way you went out your championship career yeah I always tell these guys you know we do talks before and after practice and it's like a feather in the cap mentality like everything we've got guys in there that won't see the UFC daylight I mean they'll never see step foot in the Octagon but they do get a little bit of pride whether it was one day it was 10 years or whatever being a part of that team and that's something they they add to their life they take on and we'll the next thing somebody just comes in for a week some guys are gonna be you know make it to the big show some guys are gonna be world champions some guys gonna be Hall of Famers you know and and and that's that's whatever your journey is that's a proud thing you can put in the feather in the cap and move on or whatever you're doing next but but it's it's a bigger picture and it's like journeys never over it's just always changing what you do for a guy like Lance Palmer who's a real world class guy but he's fighting in what are they call it now it's not world series of fighting anymore they have a new name for it right what do they change the name real pro fighters or something yeah yeah but the problem is nobody's watching very few people are watching but he's a real world class professional fighter like you see when Justin gage he came over to the UFC you realize like hey this fucking kid is world-class right and he's been fighting in an organization that no one's watching right well I mean the hard part about that is like you said you got a Goethe and you got a Lance Palmer they're still fighting tough ass dudes over there yeah so it's the same level competition sometimes sometimes even even worse you know wouldn't get all the Russians over in Bellator like those Russians are tough fuck yeah you know so like for Lance we just have to exit him at the right opportunity right he has to get on a little winning streak and be at the right time as it is in his contract and be able to jump out and go to the big show but it's hard because he's fighting these tough guys like the last guy he lost he broke his hand in the first round and then he's fighting a tough guy and it's like oh he lost in this show he lost against a world-class dude and he's a world-class fighter so you know it's it's it's hopefully just something where you can make that transition over how do you guys feel about win lose like paydays like one thing that bothers me about MMA is that MMA if you win you get a certain amount and if you lose you get less I feel like contractual I think I feel like you should have a contractual amount that you get paid and I feel like when you're leaving it up to the judges sometimes and the judges I mean I both of you guys have been involved in you know either least teammates getting terrible cause it's all and you've seen it and you go what in the fuck you know like look even in boxing the Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather fight two of those judges had Conor only winning one round yeah oh there's freaking crafter crazy I was looking around at those judges too they were very familiar some of them were having make judges also right there's a lot of them that did that they started with boxing and then they learned a little bit about em and man and it came over and you started judging MMA but there's a lot of them that literally don't know what they're judging or know very little about it and your career could be what you mean you could you might have a hundred and a hundred so a hundred thousand dollars swing right on someone who doesn't know jack shit right oh that's terrible that's crazy yeah that's crazy I guess for me as a fighter I look at it like it's it's rewarding you know right but then in the opposite scale of it you can be on that losing call and horrible call the refs Korea I don't know for me it's anime soap here and like it's yeah here a thing that you do so you got to go in there and fight for two checks is more your training you come out with two checks you lose it's for me I honestly and I always remember getting a check afterwards especially when I first started I was like oh yeah I got paid for this like literally like it had nothing to do with the money at all and then you got that check and then you're like oh man so if you're doing it for the right reasons it should be yeah just get your set amount I think that is so warrant against the guys that are doing it for the wrong reasons I think it was a good motivation at first or this idea when they're trying to build it but now it's not be not building it anymore now it's a world-class professional sport and you know I remember burger riot when you were fighting and king of the cage dude outside remember yeah first time I saw you fight I think you're fighting 55 - yeah I had to start there is no weight class for me at that time yeah now I remember talking I remember I was all pumped cuz Rogan knew who I was because he followed all the underground shit I was super self-aware of like how how much my notoriety was and like the bigger show cuz I you know YouTube I started looking on there and I was like I only have like 1500 people watching my shit and then kid yamamoto has like 250,000 I'm like fuck yeah you know but yeah well I was frightened I mean I fought Tyson my first loss was against Tyson Griffin and Kanak ty casino and that in the parking lot and I hit him just like need him inside trip them into the head dive into the steel pole and just gashed my head open like eight seconds into the fight and I'm just pouring down blood I remembered anything about padding on the pole well they're supposed to do it but the the the crew was running out of time so they didn't even take the time to put the padding on the bottom level they just put the the cleaner like fake leather on the top of it and I'm just fuckin gushing blood I think we talked about this I think we Dave the way man yeah but you know like I said a lot of guys can learn from you and I think it's good man what's it like you know training in his gym and like when did you come here you came there like three years ago yeah about going on for going for an ounce for years I came out I was often injury I had a symptom of vertigo from like small concussions and I broke my hand my pro debut so I had like a whole year layoff and I always reach out to Uriah Lance was out there so I knew Lance you know wrestling him and his brother throughout you know a wrestling careers he always came and you know wanted me to come out there finally hit favor up I was 18 about hey I'm gonna come out take the gym out see if it's a good date he had to pick me back it wasn't till like four years later I was able to make the trip out there I set out the year off I was like dude I'm not waste any more time I know I'm good I want to stay up grin with some of the best in the world I met all those killers out there they had TJ Chad favor Joe Danny and they mad and Chris was on Holdsworth was on you know get he just won the old fighter that's a bad dude right there how's his head do uncrowned champ bro I'm telling you uncrowned check he's doing ok I think he's just it made him look at things a lot different and he's like he's like a gem in the gym he's a coach for us and just like everybody just soaks up what he's got and he's he good just gonna stick with coaching now or is he thinking about my Sylvain I was an option how old's Chris he's 27 still young very young and he's not been off for what two years now almost longer was that when TJ won the belt was his last play they fought the same card so and so he was dealing with some concussion issues yeah a lot of guys I mean member TJ grant was gonna fight Benson Henderson for the title started getting some concussion issues I mean Holdsworth would have it where I'd look at him and one one of his eyes would be all black and one would have like a little skinny dot in the middle and I'd be like dude what's going on and he'd be like God but like Holsworth is like weirdo you know Master tongue always used to say hey you know TJ champion uh you know eighty percent holdsworth champion 100 percent he was like he would never come to our team gatherings he wouldn't go to the river he wouldn't do anything he was like just all about training like almost like a problem you know but that's what happened a BJ Penn when BJ Penn won the wasn't a BJJ World Championship the first American to do it and like you get an obsession and he was just vision vision vision had this obsession to be the best he was knocking guys out on accident and practice high kicks and and knees you know with knee pads on like just cuz he is he's good all the way around but his jujitsu is the top yeah super good and I remember coming out there and with all those guys like a year year layoff and also I mean I'm gonna see how you know how good I am so I went out there and mixed well good with the guys and had a fight lined up like I have a fight in two weeks I'd Louie went out there for a week favor came in the last day that I was there and like matched me like put me through the gauntlet with all these team alpha guys it was wrestling day so I was going with these guys and we walked off the mat and he's like like staring me up and down look at my tattoos dick he said what do you want to do I'm like I'm fighting the UFC me world champ he's like all right he's like hey when can you come back out like I'll be back out next week I'm sure hundreds of thousands of guys been in there and said the same shit to him so obviously I'll be back out came out you know the week after he shook hands shaky sick right man he's like get the five and I'll get get you to the UFC and just every fight I was saving up I would fight we came out there for a week to the camp knocked him out flew back suitcase was staying at the Fighter house it was like 12 people in their dreams Japanese upon Canada all over I mean it was just man you have a weird setup right like do you still have that block inside a block of houses that's that's how our team got built and that was like I bought a house in the in the the time of the market where anybody could buy a house like stated income loans and I didn't I'm like I'm gonna buy a house about like 30 2008 yes crash yes before the crash it was 2005 or 2004 or five and I had no job no income really I was coaching wrestling camps and I was getting like $7,000 but you could do it my Egyptian buddy was her doing loans and he said I get you alone I'm like really he's like yeah so you didn't come do this do that work history because you're coaching now and you went to school as a teacher it's a two-year like all these different things I didn't know that that's the reason our whole economy crashed I was able to get a fuck hidden but worked with you alone yeah worked for me I never defaulted I just moved all sorts of buddies in there I started I mean on that house a block I mean that block of houses we had probably I have 45 people that went through their childhood there TJ lived there Justin buckles live there master Tong live there Fabio Prado our coach lived there like we had four or five houses at this point we've been selling them off so we all hopefully now the sports at a place where we can be in a nicer neighborhood so we're all trying to get in the same neighborhood in East sac the fabulous 40s oh yeah that's a nice neighborhood in Sacramento that's the new that's a new block yes sir my name's Denise in the interesting spot because you guys are like surrounded by its kind of country in a lot of ways you know this is like the wrong time yeah yeah it's like it's beautiful yeah I love Sakurada outdoors activities Tahoes clothes yeah our way yeah you know it's a good spot centrally lit and I mean I that's always say and I think Cody like you know is it's rough as Cody's background was he had a core like a town that like rewarded him for being a champion athlete from football from wrestling from boxing etc and there's a heart to it that's why I feel like Cody's such a good person in general like when you when you get Cody like you know dealing with people and individuals walking on the street he's like a gentleman and like has has a heart for the kid you know is the kids that have disabilities you know these kind of things that comes from that small town where there's there's accountability you know what I mean yeah it's like you know you're a good part of the community you know that's it so I think Sacramento has a big city big enough city but a small enough town feel for that but you lose some other places yeah I definitely have all the little mom-and-pop shops we go to I call big female female fans with a discount it's like almost Friday Night Lights football town kind of like over the fighters out of there so we get the hook-up we get you know you know it's nice and everyone's super nice with us so I moved the gym the old gym was downtown so I moved it to over by this the stadium and I mean stay at our facility it's great so we've got a drive-thru fat 40's know where I live I Drive to the 514 that's who's who making all the nicest houses so it's always nice to drive to that neighborhood oh my god I'm gonna buy a house here and go to the gym so it's nice nice little change up this year we've had yeah just right now you're prepping to fight TJ to defend your title for the first time first of all what does it feel like to be UFC motherfucking bantamweight champ in the world and it's awesome I'll have so fast yeah it's awesome you know now it's about what you do with the belt we were just speaking about this on our honor run yeah he started taking off when I started talking about this it fired up yeah I hate the run my favor like he's a koala to these runs he's always after the practice to do these like sprints on treadmills Mike do this is not fun like 10 minutes press like just on I'm like he's a good shit that people don't want to do I'm like I don't want to do this I just hate was do you think that running like the I've had a conversation with a friend of mine about this with Conor McGregor because Conor doesn't run and he was like I really feel like every athlete that's doing something that requires like real endurance like boxing or MMA or something like that should run like the act of moving your body like forcing your body like your legs propelling your body and constantly working your lungs builds you like the kind of lung stamina and strength that you can't get from anything else so this that's a good question and it's all different because I mean we me and Cody had a discussion and I'm like prefer the title fight I'm like Cody look dude I know you don't like to do them I want to do these fucking runs I'll get on a treadmill and do like a 10-minute or put it on ten and run for five minutes straight and then all and then I'll put it on 12 is a little incline and do like 40 seconds on 20 seconds off and I had to do it with me once things like bro he goes look I've always I've done this kind of thing I don't really like to run it's not part of my regimen I I guarantee I would be in great shape and he went in there and he fought Dominick Cruz and I mean so you can't really argue with that but in my opinion I think it's a great way to get yourself uncomfortable you can run easier you can run hard to simulate like the feeling where your lungs are gonna blow up and your heads gonna pop and your fucking teeth hurt like I like to be able to do that with with running mm-hmm but you can get the same thing on a hard going wrestling or jiu-jitsu go if you're pushing the pace or a box and go is you can simulate like that type of like energy and expenditure but you're forced to do it when you're running really really fast until you till you stop there's no coasting right yeah but it's funny I asked Dan Henderson or I asked Dan Harrison's good buddy I'm like when I first started fighting you know I was training with Randy Couture and Dan Henderson they would come out to Sacramento and do little camps and stuff and I asked I asked and Dan Henderson's buddy I'm like bro how many days a week does Dan run and this is 2006 and he's like dan hasn't ran in 12 years and that motherfucker's a savage dude yeah he's a savage he is the sovereign yeah a monkey's immensely cool toughest dude ever my uncle is all like old-school trainer so we'd like pad work bag work run shadow box you know and inspire we get when I was younger he would get us 50 rounds of work so get 50 rounds you ready for your fight we'd always spar 50 rounds of boxing rounds when you're younger 50 rounds Indy rounds of Caesar right before a fight so it could be okay look five rounds ten times is that what you mean yeah throughout the four or five week here's to your fight you know we'd fight every sometimes we live in that tri-state area so I would fighting I had a bunch of books I'd fight in Ohio on Friday Saturday in Pittsylvania West Virginia on Sunday so I had three fights you can't do that anymore but we lived in the tri-state so we always had these regional books you know and you fight I got this book you only have five fights you know this guy's you know has a hundred so blocks amateur boxing was almost like Em's wrestling they're always you know competing like that but he never really forced us to run we always sparked you know that's when you really fight what happened some was just composed in that he always told me growing up he's like fightin doesn't make you a better runner or running doesn't make you a better fighter so I just always taught the favor every time he wants to do those damn runs he's at my plate Ronnie doesn't make you a better fighter yeah there's a bunch of different schools of thought on it you know some people think that you have to run like long distance just enable your body to dig deep in those late rounds when you're you're getting tired that you'll have more endurance that way it doesn't hurt that's true but the whole thought process behind one person's theory this is why I can't stand coaches that like think it's the only way you know always learn of course you always want input from other people and you have things that work but like even my manager back in the day he always used to worry about Chad Mendes his training because like Chad Mendes Lance Palmer those are two guys that have been training since there are five years old on a regimen like their dad's pushing him make him go to this and make him do that and so they're they're like little vacations they got we're like the most they needed that they needed to go go hunting or go fish get the break for me I was always my dad weed he dropped the trailer off we'd have a Motorhome he'd drop it off at a pond he'd go to work and we'd fish all day no one was having me wrestle or do anything I didn't start so I was in the like eighth grade so I've always been on like a like trying to catch up kind of deal hmm and like a chattin Lancer like get your homework done you trained your butt off you do a regimen and then you take your little break and then you take your breaks you know and it doesn't matter it's just about what you what you're processing as your method that you believe in as long as you really believe in it that's the most important thing the belief system is bigger than anything else it's gotta be there's got to be different methods for different fighting styles - yeah some people move around more like Dominic and some people or more more stationary and you know rely more on power I mean there's got to be different routines that would be more effect and it's kind of about finding whatever works best for you right right exactly for me I like Sprint's I'm like a very explosive fighter and also I have endurance it was like I did the vo2 testing it's actually I tested as a cross-country runner I hate running I ran on the results you know so but I'm more I feel like I do better at sprinting in long-distance but it's crazy like what you have to be in shape for going you know to fight for the cage like you have to be great wrestling conditioning boxing conditioning those are all different conditionings like yeah a boxer comes in and wrestles he's toast in a minute it's right you know and sometimes dressers the same thing they go in there their boxes or just a composure you know it's what made whether I'm sorry what Conner said right after Mayweather yeah shots were nothing he didn't you know it was just the composure yeah I was logged in he's just so efficient too and he knew that Connor was gonna fade because Connor was relying so much on explosiveness and tents and so down there I thought Connor did a good job of suggestions flowy and everything but here's here's the truth it's like if I were to take a pretty good high school wrestler or like even like a really good high school wrestler and put him against an Olympic gold medalist like like a high high level high school wrestler versus an Olympic gold medalist I mean there's gonna be a difference but when when fatigue cracks a little bit it starts happening a little bit one guy's gonna keep composure completely and the other guy's gonna have a little bit of a of an opening and the other guy will be able to to isolate then I think that's what happened with with fight and I figured that would happen I just didn't think that Connor would do that well the whole fight until it happened you know he was doing awesome it makes me wonder like how would he have done if he had six months to prepare how good would he have done if he got in good shape he might have been able to make it to the twelfth round I think either way the the more loose Floyd got the more he was gonna start landing shots he's just a far better boxer he's a specialist you know I don't think it was I don't think it would be it's about getting in shape necessarily because Connor had to be an amazing shape he's already a world champion then he's got this big opportunity that's what I always tell the guys also it doesn't matter what kind of shape you're in being a shape only means you can do more until you get tired hmm I think the better shape you're in he would kept doing more doing more doing more and if he wasn't able to finish him you know what I mean like because Floyd was letting him do more when I mean wasn't letting him he was wasn't letting him necessarily but who's taking rounds off for sure Conor blow out some energy so it's it's like the better shape you're in the more you're gonna output until you get tired but if you're trying to fucking win you're gonna be you know you're gonna be putting it out putting it out putting out I think he would have been able to do more until he got tired but the fatigue would have set in we either way we had this in our wrestling room the board saying it was a teak makes cowards of us all ya know I read that I was like I just I was in the same restroom since I was five years old all the way up until you know sophomore year I was junior your nose done wrestling but I always read that I was like man it's fatigue you know I was like I'm you know a fatigue was but I knew what a coward was so I would go so hard I know how to wrestle really I just would go go go go and just keep scrambling out of things and that's how I always dress well and my brother was like the same exact way he was a grinder old-school wrestler and you know I didn't push me so it was always that fatigue you know fatigue makes cowards of us all so when you get tired you're always gonna get tired in a fight like I didn't know I've never been to the fourth round I've been third once you know with with crews at all these you know questions like how's it gonna be ease his composure is can he go you know keep that power and speed up the fifth round shit I didn't know how I prepared for that and believe that's the thing it's just believing I was tired but I was having so much fun in there you just kind of push through that when you're tired and that's the thing with fatigue sets in some people can neither wilt from it or you know propel them to like when I get tired I feel like I bite down more eyes in there cuz I'm tired I know that mistakes happens when you're tired so that's when he's got you stay on it more right gotta concentrate more on keeping your technique clean and making sure that you well it's an interesting thing when you're fighting a guy like Dominic crew too because he's so awkward like you you're you're preparing for someone who moves in such a way I mean you're right you know better than anybody yeah you fought him several times he was so weird you know he does move weird like the the second time I fought him I feel like I did a good job of of like letting him move and then when he'd land I'd hit him mm-hmm and so the one thing I went back and I watched that fight and I'm like you know you're always looking excuses of why you know why did I lose this fight or not and I think the little thing is count I talked to Kody about this in his in his fight with with DOM was make sure the eyes are on you when there's no action happening because Dominic is always doing this weird it's like peacocking he's moving and doing these little movements and weird shit and so when when nothing's happening who are you looking at you're looking at the weirdo yeah so then it's like he is weird but it's not like it's it's a different kind of weird what was it like doing The Ultimate Fighter opposite TJ like knowing that you guys were eventually gonna fight and knowing that you guys used to be teammates honestly it wasn't bad like for the first what two three weeks it was fine we were cordial like you know it was what it was and until he started going to like the media and like would say that I'm different on and off camera I was like dude like TJ we were just like being cordial and cool like getting through the way into doing that whole process honestly it's it's a lot you know right I'm still trying to train and fight but it was opportunity I love to do it I love the guys a team had my coaches out there my uncle in Vegas it was a good time we had a good time with the team and we were fine until like I said he would go to the media and I talked shit that was different like about choking one mm-hmm and when he was talking shit he stepped towards me so I was like so you're saying that I saw a corner I cornered him even though and the in the end that with no cameras like TJ is like man what's what's going on why he was talking shit in the media saying I'm different on and off camera like I wouldn't beat your ass here right now if there's no camera he's like you guys like you think that and he's like no I don't think you will my ass right now I grabbed his ass up again by our throat and slam against then square it up with me and I was like all right we're gonna throw down like cool just meet him we'll throw it down and that's it no cameras John and maybe that was subside some of the shit so I was getting pissed he was being with me you know right there how many people were there when you guys almost fun no one it was weird I was there how Scott was the shadow - I have a picture of it so funny babysitter like this time but I was just confused on it I was like dude we're cool cordial with each other and then you go in the media that's when I started I was like me I was just kind of like fed up with the whole thing but now it's like so long drawn out for the fight I'm just like if you take all that away him leaving team alpha-male all the variables and you break it down again spider-verse spider this is a fucking fight that I like thankful for you know I mean I'm finally getting to fight these opponents that are there were the opponents that can go out there and show showcase my skill against mmm you know so it wasn't horrible of being around the guy until he would go and talk to you on the media I was just like a pod buzzing man what it was going so how did you guys resolve it when you were alone in the locker room dude when everybody came well literally broke it up did that happen well that happened and then he like put his fist up and I was like all right here we go I was gonna throw like some fire at him like we're gonna fight like a glass all right cool he's gonna fight me and then he put his hands down he's like look how you're acting bro and I was like oh like he went from straight to ready to fight and then to that so I was like whatever it is what it is I just was like dude quit talking shit Media like we're right here you can say it to me like I don't know why we don't have a come here we can talk about it and a couple times we've had off-camera talks like with me and him about the Hojo daddy Stevenson fight I was like look bro I understand you're trying to get your guy back on but Joe should not fight he took so much damage in that fight and he's fighting in six days I'm 25 years old and I would not fight in five or six days after I just fought like that right he was concussed he was hurt and TJ's like aiming like I can't tell him not to fight I'm like you have to tell him like us coach you can't call his wife or his coach or well you have to set the dude we can have I don't want my teammates fighting each other but dude that's gonna be badass and he's gonna get knocked out and be hurt yeah and teaches that don't don't get that in his head Cody I'm like Joe and we were doing in French I'm like Joe look I love your pie in here like you're legend of sport you don't need to go out here and get ten thousand dollars and for whatever it was they were getting getting for that fight to go in there and have serious brain damage he's fighting haider who Hydra has good like I think eight knockouts vicious knockouts he throws his hands I knew it was a bad matchup you know it was an ego thing TJ wanted his whole team because you know he kicked your ass on the team you know we didn't we didn't Silas Lee pick the best matchups or you know who's in there trying to do what we could with those guys you know it was it was it was tough you know it's like teaching an old dog new tricks it was just you know it was hard it was honestly hard it's gotta be weird coaching people in a short period of time like that to metrons yeah right so is you know it was yeah we didn't know I didn't do any of my research on him like how they did outside of the UFC career you know I remember them in the UFC like okay you know this guy's he can fight Eddie Gordon so he's massive let's go with him you know we just didn't know like how they did outside of it you know so I would just assume that like like as a coach if you get anybody and you're working with him for six weeks you would start thinking if I had six months exact get rid of this yeah what I coached when I coached against Don we had we had three months oh that's right cuz you guys did there was the crazy saliva the only life without like how's it just roll of your life that was Vegas man all these guys they that I was I was staying under wraps but you know we had the whole crew out there it was all my coaches were just the the young guys coming up to trying to get them exposure and everything so I had TJ and Lance and you know all the all the guys there were my coaches there running amok in Vegas it was hilarious through the otter season that was how I was I was ready to leave I guess like didn't wait to leave Vegas after that it was just yeah Cody is with my coaches remember for the yeah yeah it seems to me that like Vegas to live in Vegas is kind of like living near a nuclear reactor like you may be able to do it for a couple days but after a while the the radiation is gonna get you yeah from like a whole change of life yeah too much yeah all of a sudden you won't have seen daytime for a couple days also then my feelings on it is that you're around like maybe just me being sensitive but I think you're around people that make shitty decisions you're alone around a lot of that in Vegas is you around a lot of compulsive gamblers just a vibe of the city like this great shitness city there's a lot of successful people you know Dana and the frittatas and there's a lot of people that are making great money and doing well in business but then there's a whole like underbelly to the city that's compulsive gamblers yeah shit and a bunch of other stuff most of all sorts of stuff yeah yeah but I think that it's funny like you go to LA this is mostly talking about like you know people have they're trying to the entertainment industry or whatever it's like LA is like a social climb if you take the the crappy part of the the social scene it's people trying to socially climb oh what'd you do for work oh what car do you what can I get out of this person like try to play the game and have success in Vegas has just sold out like all right I'm gonna go get make a bunch of fuckin money stripping this cocktail whatever it is right so yeah whatever the deal is whatever it is so it's like LA social climb biggest sold out well it just doesn't seem like they has like there's a lot of transient people and there's a lot of people that are there just for the casinos whereas like any other city you know like if you live in Chicago for instance it's a town you know it's a real city people have been there for generation after generation there's a lot of different businesses a lot of variety to it in Vegas you got the hub which is all the casinos okay and you got the surrounding areas that are just sort of feeding off of the casinos it's weird it's a weird big weird great great for short short times yeah the one thing I would say it was cool while you're there is I mean Sacramento is not necessarily a destination spot so when I was living there people knew that we were living there I would get hit up like every couple days with somebody that was coming to Vegas so there's always like you get to rehash like see all sorts of people that you you know would like to see that that are popping in to Vegas all of a sudden it's like to him everybody's hitting you up like it's like you know it's kind of like a little reunion place you know right we're good at all the time now as far as your new place like what did you do differently when you guys move to a new spot like how did you set it up so you have the old spot for a long time right yeah you got to check out the place you'll love I saw it online it looks amazing so basically we just made it bigger and better and tried to cover all the things that that we do as mix martial artists within one roof so we have CrossFit we have yoga we have TRX we have you know conditioning classes that are you know MMA base we have introduction to stuff and then we have the MMA side which is a traditional Muay Thai our pros happen to work out of there we have our own little locker room for the for the pros and we have like like nice finishes there's a cafe there there's an outdoor area there's like you know bathrooms and showers and that's amazing the other place was just it was 8,500 square feet which is still pretty big at the time it was a big scratch and it was like one shower one toilet and it was 13 years of building the team and I mean play stunk and that's a good recipe for staff one shower first time I ever got staff was when I'm out too it was right before my UFC debut literally like Jumeirah two weeks to three weeks before heads and no I got the call like you're gonna fight in three weeks I'm like yeah did you get on that antibiotics yeah I remember he said he was like take out my dude I got staph and like in my leg I couldn't walk it was horrible first time I had it and was it from not showering right after you trained or just really have staff all over your body you haven't your nose and everything else I think immune system down and then yeah but you know do you guys fuck with defense hope yep that's that stuff is this shit guys sake oh yeah awesome this boy yeah yeah great guy so and that that product is fucking amazing he has a bunch of different things like solve for scratches pointment this tea tree oil and eucalyptus and stuff like that stuff yeah yeah but you could stay on that stuff on a regular alright you will avoid 99% of that shit they getting that sleep getting sleep and eating right and and you know shower after your workout now what kind of Dyer do you want Cody like how do you how do you organize your nutrition actually spoke with Aubrey a couple weeks ago we did like I've got a supplement standpoint from on it he gave me a whole protocol pretty weight you know for this camp gay time anytime mm-hmm stuff really man I can eat really whatever I want to have a super I'm it's hard for me honestly to gain weight like I'm hovering around 147 now because we work output so high yeah I was so high and I don't not never been a big eater like I never like to be fool like I don't like that because I don't know so I just I usually do some meal preps I've messed with some meal prep companies my wife's are great cooks usually I'm I had a lot of salmon like I love salmon bison so I keep it out of they don't know and George Locker I work with him so he he who diet okay here's my car here's the proteins and then we get to the fight week I'm literally twelve pounds over and I start doing his diet and water loading and I don't run I don't have to I just do my workouts regularly like I would for you know just to keep sharp for the week lose the weight I mean it's the best I feel the greatest you know I used to always cut way and then like cut a lot away and then get Ivete up and feel sluggish like with with with George and the diet that he's giving me on tousle with it with the on it products I for two months I've been on the hotter products and I feel so much like just better better with them like joint wise like such stiffness I gotta like sit opera gave me a whole thing that does krill oil all that stuff yeah for sure is giant man fish oil is so important for people and so many people don't take it but it's just for joint mobility and joint health and just reduction of inflammation also if it's fuel for your brain it's great for building your muscles like fish oil is just one of the primary supplements that I think people should take my mom used to have us take spoons of that not the pills she would actually have fish oil in a journalist I have that stuff I get it Carlson's I get it in a jar take tablespoons of it but they have it that you put like lemon flavor it and that and different things but you know what it always tastes like shit so you're just essentially is eating healthy you know I don't have like any specific diet you follow no I mean I stick to the you know the lean stuff about sushi salmon I always do that we own a bunch of good little healthy spots around around town too we've got actually I'll send you out some juice liquid ology juice it's fresh juice we have two spots that are like right by the gym they have like super healthy foods good oh that's nice yeah it's like a health bar so you guys have almost like a whole fitness location there it's not just a gym you know and how many how many members you have now we're like 1,400 members Tom what's the name of the place again your eye favors ultimate fitness okay that's what's on it yeah yes I know you were thinking about doing something with the UFC gym I did right we have one we have one out there oh you have one of those too 35 minutes away oh that's well that's in Rocklin which is about 35 minutes away and I've got a partner there who is a gym guy he has crunch gyms and he's in tight with mass Rob and the guys at UFC gym and so he primarily runs that and there's no contact than that in that place you know you can't do sparring and things like that so oh really No now where does any of the USU gyms but so when they have legit this is oh so you could strangle each other you can't kick or punch each it's so when they have like kickboxing classes do they tap each other at least no they no gag work and no drills I mean you're not gonna learn if you don't do something they do they do some jobs they don't do any MIT like no they don't have like one one person hold the mitts and one person hold but you can do a privates and stuff like that is it just like a liability thing I would imagine yeah probably worried yeah well at least they can do jiu-jitsu hey dude you Jitsu and you learn a great technique it's a great idea to to have a gym that's like based around the UFC where people where fans can go and learn that kind of stuff and get a great workout you see this shit Bob Arum said today so the we have a boxing as an enemy and it's the UFC the UFC is the enemy of boxing just a little dummy you just you just got six point five million pay-per-view buys from Mayweather vs McGregor in a boxing match so you tell me how the UFC is the enemy you see I can help you out dude yeah made made made boxing cool again definitely I guarantee you have bumped up Canelo Alvarez and triple absolute 24/7 well yeah me too late I'm so he taking boy I don't know I don't know look Gennady golovkin is a motherfucker dude but Canelo Alvarez get gets better all the time he's a younger guy you know he looked fucking sensational against Amir Khan he's looked sensational against everybody except Floyd yeah no I mean Floyd just boy got him to drain himself yeah I'm go all the way down to 150 or 152 or something lead to a cut down that far yeah he cut down way low and they just look sluggish and Floyd is the best boxer pretty much ever he is boxed him up game playing sector the games yeah and just look beautiful dude triple G's interviews are hilarious he's like traditional like Russian - well I think you know it sounds like exactly how max max I'm here for a big drama show exactly max of course I think it would be a good fight good for the fans that's why I'm here for muchos yes my friends Mexicans love triple G bites like fucking Julio Cesar Chavez man he's a savage he's a fucking animal body punch and ripping butt shots look I think's gonna get it Cody yeah I think honestly Canelo I don't know I just think you know a triple G's a beast I think I think you'd like to know why do you like to know in this I just like his is his pressure his body punches you know is that how he flows he throws a lot of hooks I don't like I'm a big hook guy like any like Mike Tyson I used to watch all Mike stuff hooks and Canelo does too he throws some creative stuff too right I saw I did that I started doing a move off of watching Canelo he throws like a fake hook to an uppercut so it's like this and he goes like that because the guy who cover here and it comes around the middle and I mean mine didn't look as good as his I did a bunch against Scotty Jorgensen when I thought it looked like I was just winding my my my arm up like this but it's like well he has a bunch of little tricky subtle thing he does I like canal he also has ring generalship like that's huge for me like I cut you can knock people out fast or have good combos but the way that you take the Octagon or the ring and next Aukerman and and and then impose your will on them his presence in there he knows where he's at at all the time yeah what's interesting to me about this fight is this is the first time that he's fought a guy who's world-class that is a brutal power puncher like him who's bigger than him who's gonna come towards him you know whereas he fought Floyd for was a smaller guy but just wave craftier and slicker with his style and you know it was an interesting fight but ultimately London wasn't like the most exciting fight because Floyd just kind of out boxed him I think this is gonna be a bang them up fight I thought yeah sure gonna come towards each other and it's gonna get crazy yeah for real this is like the highest stakes fight in boxing because you have two murderous punchers in their prime Gennady golovkin undefeated the only person Canelo lost to is Floyd boy so that was only lost yes is only lost and it's in de ciencias 15 professional you know phenomenal phenomena fight I mean just such a good fight I cannot wait for this fight that's all amped I was an Oscar tweeted about you know he's all but we're still gonna watch you Zico this is why they're all fools if if Oscar just said this is great for boxing this is great for everybody and then everybody would have been fine instead these guys Creed enemies yeah you know and say this is a disgrace this is a fixed fight numbers they're saying Floyd to fix the fight and you know crazy shit that's on my pics about like something you know most about him or something like that he just kills people you know what he does not give a fuck it's so funny he's hilarious that's what happens when you have a half a billion dollars yeah you know give a fuck yes give a fuck in the beginning which is why he's perfect for the UFC I said I pictured he went right before he right after he did the whole deal where they sold everything he was on like ESP and he was on some show and he was just slouched over looked like it like a pile of crap and I took a picture of it and I sent it to him I said bro why don't you sit like you have four hundred million dollars in thing or at least invest in some some fucking Fitness shit or something that Senate picture just all slumped over like this I think he's super stressed yeah I think he's better now I think that time was like a crazy assed time what could you imagine you're about to get involved in a four billion dollar deal and then how about afterwards all the shit starts falling apart Rhonda get smirked connor decides to go to boxing you know the sports falling off in a lot of the pay-per-view buys John Jones tests positive again like so much I mean he was on his way to being a next gigantic superstar right I mean if you take away his his time off right the time off where he get busted before we had to take a whole year off because the dick pills all this different stuff the time off from the car accident take all the time off and John keeps winning and you got a goddamn gigantic superstars the likes of like anybody that's ever been in the UFC maybe even right there with Connor means you don't know even even I mean all the negative stuff that's happened in John Jones people are still booing DC and cheer him crazy has some great PR going against that I don't think it's that at all I don't think it's I don't think they have the brain I don't think anybody alive has the brains to organize public response I think public people tweet to Pete they love John because what John is first of all he's a ruthless killer inside the Octagon and then he fucks up but he's still a bad motherfucker like he brought there was a time when he was getting booed and everything and then he took the time off and then by the time he came back people were back on his side it's like you know he has food when was he getting boot never he's getting booed like before he got suspended the the time before really yeah woody tested positive for coke I can't remember I'm getting booed and if but if he was it was nothing like DC DC wins fights and gets booed crazy you know I mean he beats Rumble he gets booed people get mad at him they got mad at him when he beat Rumble remember they're doing them what are you bowling the guy's just fucking choked out Rumble Johnson how are you yeah for the second time how are you booing I don't get it but you can't the public yeah you can't get fickle it was aside yes they decide who they love and they decide who they hate I did I tell you what though Jon speech after he beat DC was beautiful yeah it was great yeah it was it was great but it was followed up by asteroid dust that's why it's so sad that's I mean look I'm hoping just like everybody else there's some sort of a fuckup yeah and then we figure out something happened something was wrong well I really followed it too much they don't really know it's not good yeah it's not good well he tested positive for something that only shows up in urine tests and so they did him a urine test after the weigh-ins he tested positive for this stuff and then they did a blood test and you know his campus saying oh it's not in the blood test well they don't test for it in the blood ties that's why did you like your intestine a blood test is two different times it's like d-ball like the main t-ball team around a ball or something it's um it's a weird substance that not a lot of people take so apparently Chael Sonnen was talking about it that if he's taken that like this is a real old-school steroid it took a short act short short half-life steroid it's sad it's sad I I just don't think I mean what's what are you proving that's my whole thing well he must have felt like he needed some sort of an edge if he took it if he took it or or the real problem is or was he taking stuff the whole time did he get involved those powerlifter dudes and start taking shit because remember he's got fucking super dude he was massive yeah I mean he was going to heavy weight he looked huge yeah I mean I don't want to speculate oh really you know I know but but you were involved in the sport in the early days when there was no testing they just look at ya yeah I mean when you were when you were first fighting like Paige was there any drug testing no nothing not at all there wasn't any type of anything I mean it was illegal in California so the the only reason we were fighting on Indian reservations because everything was illegal I'm not crazy that is do whatever the fuck they want yeah cuz we screw them so bad but it's not we I mean it's happened so many generations ago it's kind of weird that it's still around you have like this sort of they have a nation inside a nation it's a very odd little situation over in the US we talk about the Holocaust and what happened over there and over and like Jeremy they talk about what we did the Indians well you know what we did the Indian wasn't we know we when it comes to like genocide you know the biggest genocide was disease yeah ninety percent of them were killed by smallpox and all sorts of bugs that they just had no resistance from that's right when they first met the Europeans and it had nothing to do with like a planned attack on them people are just dying off like crazy yeah that's what happened that's right terrific it's crazy yeah but it's thank God they have casinos yeah well something so I've got a bunch of buddies that are native and so they have like different things and one tribe like you had things you could you could choose and one group up on the northern coast took their fishing rights so they can fish with nets and like put bombs in the water and they didn't take the casino right Cena ranks it fucked up hey they did fuck why all the fish you wanna see no money they say slang that smoked salmon it's good it is good but it's not like the conceit of money a lot of smoked salmon yeah there's a place in Alberta where I've been hunting up there and the natives they call them First Nation people up there they're allowed to basically hunt any way they want these spotlights and shoot animals at night they shoot as many as there are their rights right yeah that's part of the deal they didn't get casino fish they got free moose they have free years they're just allowed to use all sorts of you know what other people would think of as unethical techniques you have any hunting trips coming up yeah yeah mom going to Utah soon elk hunt a couple weeks excited you eat mostly I know Chad does that but tries to eat mostly food that he's killed yeah as much as I can 99 percent of the food I eat is wild game other than vegetables yeah well if you shoot an elk like the either those elk heads or how back that's 400 pounds of meat I give a lot of it to my friends who don't hunt you know just like elk but uh that's and that's enough meat for a year you know and then I usually shoot a deer to a year yeah that's what trips me out about people they're so against hunting I mean I'm not a big hunter but like the things that happen like on the farms where they're like you know have animals this Cajun and try to feed him get him fat I mean that's some nasty stuff and this is way more humane and a healthier way to eat right it's definitely healthier way to eat and it's definitely where you're more humane but people love to point the finger ninety-seven percent of the people in this country meat either that or they're pescetarian they eat but you know that there's maybe three percent of the people in this country that are vegans and that's that's a small number but you know they they get very vocal about it and the best way for them to like they can find a person like say if you hunt you hold a picture of a deer that you shot they found your you so that you're an individual yeah whereas like if you have a steak like that steak was raised by a rancher it's on a ranch who's the guy who shot it who knows but you got it a supermarket here it is there's too many too many people down the line it's not you can't point to one person but if I see your I favor I'll holding up you know a duck that he's shot like well that's you you you killed that dog yeah get the vegan cat lady after you again truce that's a true bit man that's a true bit this bunch of commits a community of people to think it's a good idea to feed their cat vegan food yeah there's a whole move to feed cats vegan food in the cat's ticket they go blind and have heart attacks and shit really yes yes yeah cats are supposed to eat something called taurine that only exists in animal food and like in animal protein cats are what's called an obligate carnivore which means they can't eat anything else like I said shit like a dog dogs can eat carrots and a bunch of other shit like dogs eat things like you can eat dogs can eat some grains and potatoes and stuff like that's fine for them they mostly eat meat like dogs are mostly carnivores but they can mix their diet up a little bit and still be okay not cats you you fucking start feeding cats beets and vegetables and she'll like that this chick came after I'll show you I don't want to do the bits on mine a bit but it's like someone got mad at me because I posted a picture of some meat on Instagram it's based on a total true story and it was one of the vegan cat lady's yeah yeah it's just there's a community of people that that feed their cats vegan food they are fucking completely there they're like next-level crazy like if you thought vegans are crazy they're like well we're taking this shit to the next level it's like there's levels to everything you know like this like you were talking about your gym those guys are just tough guys they don't really want to fight these guys who we want to fight and fight in the amateurs and then there's Cody gar Brad she's the Cody grant of vegan a vegan act 2 is he was in sack what month or so ago yeah not even how is that like I was great I was a first caller I went live you know sat down it was it was great I was laughing my ass off Sacramento's fun man they came out was a good time I always loved performing there I've ever since back in the little comedy club there the punchline Sacramento yeah it's great spot yeah it's a great little spot I went up there Craig Robinson was in town he's my buddy he's a good dude and he pulled me up on stage that had me do something I hit it up the place pretty bad is Craig bring his music up there yeah I saved me a little bit cuz out he's like brought me all I would bring my boy up oh when I got up there on stage and then and so I'm like my manager kind of like gave me a heads up like how Craig might pull you up there so I have like like alright well I just told the story the the chick that knocked on my door and came and shit all that I did that but I had Craig do sound effects for it so I was like hey man I'll do this but you got to give me sound advice news on this thing like like then she took a massive shit he's you know doing it on the on the keyboard what does this was like New Year's right someone broke in your house it was just a Saturday night I mean this was on New Year's Day there's more known for uh for this lady shit in my hat my bed my bedroom or my bath and then fucking most things I've done in my life for myself well you told the story somewhere I took a video of it on snapchat I'm like dude this is Robin yeah it's probably up yeah well TMZ to TMZ did it and did a story on it and they did an interview and they showed my whole thing and I actually like got a picture of the chick opened the door and there's like a canoe of shit between her legs and she's sitting in vomit and shit half in the toilet half on the floor in my brand-new house I just spent a whole year building it me and my dad and she just Christ you get in your house what happened what's the storm the door like an idiot so okay so I'm sitting there with my buddy Virgil and his girlfriend it's like one o'clock on a Saturday we're just kicking it yes and 1:00 a.m. yeah it's like inside peace he doesn't put that in there no come on so then I hear a little knock I thought and I'm like did someone knock on the door and then it goes away and I hear again like a knock I'm like I think somebody's knocking so I go in and literally I open the door like this and I got this plump like 24-year old fucking drunk as shit woman like leaning against the door like looking at me and I open the door and she like just walks in and I'm like can I help you she's got a little boiler is that her in the background now that's my buddy Virgil's ex-girlfriend so she walks in your house and they Joe's in the bath she walks in my house and I'm like can I help you so she was passed out in shit and piss in your bathroom so so I opened the door and she stumbles in like all chubby and there's fucking ambulance fire truck SWAT team to come get this chick out of my toilet and so she walks in and walks fast I can help you and she just keeps on walking on my excuse me and she like walks to the end of my house and just locks herself in the bathroom is there her right there yeah this is after she wiped out yeah Jesus well she didn't wipe up that's the crime scene it's weird that she knew exactly where that bathroom was that had she ever been over your house for a party or something no so she just was in the neighborhood so I live on the corner and there's maybe there's a maybe like here comes the tour block there's a bar called called the cheaters I think she's drunk from that walking how do you really take his shoes off are called cheaters yeah is it kind of like to Ashley Madison of bars supposed to go there yeah course of course yeah so anyways yeah you know if you go to that bar like like you know what's going on oh it's an old ass like bar in East sac which is like like the nice little neighborhood and it's like a shit dive bar so I don't know what it's all about the dude's name is cheater he's probably so cheaters bar man about cheap night she got two names cheater Oh cheaters maybe it's cheaters that's on 34th and Folsom is there a posture fee after the are no cheaters okay Tigers yeah look at mmm it looks angry so this is that that that bathroom was not there before I got the house I added that on it poured a slab and built back and everything else and so I don't know how the hell she she dead ended in the end of the end of the house and just took a left so she just got lucky found the bathroom shit all over the place did you ever contact her afterwards generally no like she's got a no it was on TMZ and all these different websites I think should reach out think who cut that one oh yeah girl gets into a 12-step program you will be one of the first people she apologized to make it right with all the people that are wrong in the past I wonder if she's is she's someone in the neighborhood and I don't know but but the truth is like she went into that bathroom like she was just drawn like how could she could she Geum know if you know my house that's what I'm saying I had this Mexican guy that was working for me and he had like an issue he would do the lacquer on all my cabinets and everything and so he took like an extra month and he would get in there and I go into the house like it was being built and he'd be passed out on the seat on the floor he'd just get high as fucking like passed out my theory was maybe he when he was he would like stay the night at the house the house under construction maybe he was having this chubby chick come over or something hmm s-domain passing off to Mexican shitter you guys like team alpha-male in Sacramento you guys are like one of the real super camps in the world like there's like a handful of super camps this country right there's like a TT you know there's Duke Rufus there's Frost hobbies camp Tristar aka there's a bunch of super camps do you try to pay attention to how other guys are running their stuff and try to figure out like what they're incorporating as far as like strength and conditioning you know rehab places like physical physical therapy things along those lines a little bit you know we have a reputation for whenever we go somewhere are going into the gyms and trying to get it rolling you know testing yourself against other people like like kind of an open-door policy at our place to like if somebody wants to come in they can come in and check it out so we've gotten a lot of throughout the years a lot of feedback and done our own stuff but always trying to learn but not necessarily like and we kind of have our own recipe like we have our things that work it's it's about regimen in a lifestyle it's like set set programs throughout the day and you can kind of makeshift your own depending on what your coaches think you need to do what you feel you need to do because there's there's you know two three practices you could hit a day if you wanted to and then there's individual workouts and they go you know some guys do the cryotherapy and then they've been doing that suction therapy and they've been doing believing that the cup stuff cupping I don't I'm like I'm like old school like I don't really believe in I'm not like looking for all these little secret things to do but I think those things help a little wait something's got to help a little like cryo helps do you do that at all I've done it a couple times but you're not like it's not a thing the thing I'm adamant about that I think is good which I would have liked to do more of throughout my career is the hyperbaric chambers yeah you use that after the aldo fight right with your leg with after the aldo fight after the the Mike Brown fight like broken hand broke my hand it had surgery like I mean how I would use that just as rigged limit and then TJ Dillashaw actually got one and had it at his house in his garage really like in Sacramento he and he had like got certified him and his wife got certified to do it and he was just like chillin that thing was so what is the hyperbaric chamber do it's like it's a sausage enriched environment right yes so it's a high oxygen rich environment so it basically like it can like it does like the same thing that red blood cells would do like transport things to to your body faster and help you heal faster so like there's high altitude which helps you like get acclimated in and make more blood cells yourself and this is just like helping pass things through it's like a hyper ice oxygenated environment and what do you what do you feel like it did for you it healed me faster so that's the that I never I was never been like a big strength and conditioning guy even in in in wrestling and in college because I was always cutting weight so I felt like like you know I've always been really strong for my size that wasn't one of my things that I needed to work on necessarily I was working on technique or working on this or fluidity or whatever so I started when I broke my hands I started doing a heavy lifting regimen I used to not like to do lifts like squats and stuff like that because I would get so sore I couldn't do all the shit I like to do like wrestle and run and things like that so I was going to heal my hand while I was doing these heavy workouts and my trainer kept asking me like well like am i sore and I was like no I'm not sore we finally put it together because of the hyperbaric chamber like I was like hyper healing it was like like I would do a hard hard workout never get sore because I would go into the oxygen chamber my schedule just worked out I was going in there quick huh that's interesting yeah was there any downside of doing it no there's no downside is is it's expensive right that's the same reason why insurance didn't didn't pass it to be insured so like there was a session it could be as much as 200 bucks a session well there's an hour and how many sessions were you doing I would get it to where I was doing you know like four sessions a week to him an insurance wasn't paying for this no UFC would pay for it ah that's nice yeah yeah that's so like this is something they have set up at the UV the new UFC Performance Center I think they have all that stuff there I know the underground treadmills the high altitude building I've used their PT a couple of times I'm just we have a very fortunate with Russ back in Sacramento a lot of hills that he does all that I use a hyperbaric chamber as well I had the whole last year you know what sometimes need to kick someone wrong ankles messed up for two three days I would go in there that day and really could put put weight on and move around and be fine what they use it for is great brain trauma right it helps heal your brain like they'll be Ron's and yeah it's the same thing that they do for the bends when somebody goes and does deep sea and they they they're if they're like deep-sea diving they have to put them in a hyperbaric chamber - like acclimate them to like heal them from coming up too fast mmm I mean there's like a real science behind it yeah I know I've heard about people using it for breaks like bone breaks and having some really quick recovery yeah I just never experienced it you should do it feel like what yeah I would imagine it be just a good thing to do all the time but I wonder if there's any negative effects I don't think there is I mean you know they're there they're doing it for autistic kids for people with Lyme disease Lyme disease is a big one yeah Jesus that's tough scary yeah there's so many fucking people that have that and don't even know yeah all the time and broken down they don't understand their immune system is devastated by ticks yeah there's the thing called the Rocky Mountain tick Rocky Mountain flea or some point that I think it's Rocky Mountain tick but uh there's a oh no that's not it it's the Lone Star tick there's a disease that people are getting that makes you allergic to red meat huh and they're getting it from ticks that's a trick yeah you take a tick bite and you don't realize anything even happen and you go to eat meat like you eat a cheeseburger so I'm gonna get really sick your immune system gets devastated there it is the lone Star tick injects alpha-gal into the bloodstream and then the immune system releases immunoglobin e antibodies to fight this foreign sugar after this reaction the future intake of mammal meat with the same alpha-gal will result in an allergy reaction because meat has it's like alpha galactose they're saying alpha gal as short but i forget what it actually is I forgot the actual suit is it does it say there yeah galactose alpha one three galactose so that's the shit I like clearly made a three hours ago and something that's fucked up right got that make sure you got that stuff on you can teach as well you need fish its mammal protein you start eating crocodiles hunt crocodiles only yeah so the hyperbaric chambers is a good one mmm I've been doing the salt what's the thing you've been doing float yeah well you told me to do that a long time ago they finally got one right next to our we own that Island a little vibe health bar in Sacramento and the liquid ology the Jews my beer and they have the right next door they have that diaper that float and float center so I've done that's amazing in that it's cool I mean the only problem is I have to have a quiet mind and able to go to get the most out of it like if I'm stressing about something I go in there I just like I mean I end up like just thinking the whole time whatever I have to be a right place to go in there I think yeah maybe it's a personality thing like you I mean I like it when I can relax but like if I have like a lot going on my mind I can't just shut it down and then I'm stuck in this like a Lingus thinking and I can't I'm like I gotta get out of here and go take care of this take care of that right whatever I'm able to chill I love it I know Cody uses it a lot I use it a lot of one time at a close call like a astral projection I don't you right yeah it was crazy yeah they're basically it's I was explaining to the guy that owned at the time because I quit going I was like one time happen I feel like Grim Reaper came over top of me no shit I was like trying to push me down and drown me but I was like sleeping like a transid always like my body would vibrate and like kept coming I would come back to like the wake I was such in a deep trance I come back up and I'd finally calm myself back down relax and would drift off into the float and they both would cut like just but the whole time I could feel the hot coils on my back with my face you know because it's still you know you're just above water surround your overhead I think three times I finally it was like got up and I was like like somehow it felt like something was trying to do someone's shot I don't know what I was going on in xiety or something crazy crazy Wow I have some crazy visions in there last time I was in there I just kept the that has a blue light in there and I got the music on and I was just spinning and like bouncing office I was just staying busy I'm not gonna relax in these days you would think I would think you'd be better at relaxing now now that you're retired I'm fighting oh no way man I'll have to like if jiu-jitsu is going on and I've been like I'll have to like stop and like look guys we're having a meeting right now I go let's cover this over like jiu-jitsu started 20 minutes ago I need to get that workout in otherwise I'm like you know I you know you create yourself a regimen throughout your life of working out a couple times a day and that's what you do and then you go in and try to have meetings all day and and like get with this and put this fire out and get on this call and it's like I was doing that together with being a full-time athlete so finding the balance has been the key for me well for you there probably is like a requirement that your body has to like blow out - and that and that that's another thing with the diet like you were talking to Kody about his diet like I have been like an overeater he doesn't like like stuff and somebody just call me you know making fun of me for eating all the time I'm like just constantly eating and whatnot because I'm used to doing that you burn so many calories in the day now I have to like be mindful of not like overeating because I'm not putting out the same thing otherwise I feel like crap right you don't want you fat yeah I mean I'm not worried about getting fat necessarily it's more of just like feeling like shit this guy's the best instigator dude he tries to eat rise to like accentuated like like if he knows that I'm like man I'm a little thick and then he'll wait like a day in the milk man babes you looking just always child you to match with Paul meow right yes that's a billion you went to a decision with him man that's chance six overtime yeah that's gigantic that guy is fucking legit man he's pretty good for a guy like you didn't specialize in that and specialized in MMA you know and coming from a wrestling background obviously you have a grappling background you were great at submissions in your MMA career but to take on a guy that's like that accomplished as a grappler that's gigantic yeah it was cool I mean I always tell these guys and I should I believe it and that's what I said about Conor to like you have to in our sport you have to be able to go with a world champion jiu-jitsu player a world champion wrestler a world champion judo player a world champion boxer and be able to hold your own you know that's that's the difference with our sport and that's why it's so impressive and so out so I was saying for these guys and I didn't even for that for that I was gonna train real hard to take it real serious but then I got this the the rampage movie role with in the rocks new movie so I went and spent 10 days in Atlanta and then I had told Chad before that I would do this charity fishing chip with these you know the injured vets and and so we did that for three days I went in there looking like a chubby there's a picture of me I look so friggin chubby in that and that thing and didn't even train but I was like you know I ma I go I I take a lot of pride in my grappling ability I feel like you know I'm one of the best grapplers in the sport so it was good to go in there and do that well you know that and Chad beating Jeff Glover yeah I'm tapping him yeah that's fucking crazy like it just shows you the level of grappling that you guys have at your gym but I've gone like Jeff Glover and I when I first started training it makes martial arts because I'm from Santa Barbara with him and Bill Cooper what is your Barbara yeah I was born in Santa in Isla Vista and we have she's in Santa Barbara I love it up there it's all bro you got to come stay at my house I mean we rented out right now in Santa Barbara I'm ready it's rented out to a family from Sweden but Wow come in and play I'll hook you dude it's bad you bring your family up there it's like a santa barbara's awesome yeah there's one of the best spots really is one of the best spots so were you saying about Jeff Glover you knew him from Paragon so J I've trained with Jeff for years so that you know Paragon used to be like the size like two of these tables like in a little room and and so I would go down and walk down from my uncle's house and go down to Paragon when those guys were just starting and and me and Jeff have trained together for years and and Bill to Bill when he every time like ya build a grill every time I come in there he'd want to go straight straight wrestling like hey can we do some takedowns cuz he was trying to work on that part of his game but like I've trained with Karina I've trained with Hobson Mora I've trained with Glover like when whenever I see somebody that they can whip me in jujitsu I'm going with that guy I had Hobson come stay at my house I go and train with Karina all the time I had Glover I'd always hit him up and go with him so I've been going with this top level guys my whole career that's huge though that's a giant accomplishment for you and even bigger for Chad you can tap Glover you gotta see this guy I mean that's what's always saying I always I always give you shit I've said it like two or three times I'm like I'm like let's roll and you're like ah you just want to try to fucking you know put it on me and this and that and I'm like no because you're always worried about me and other people's guards I said this the other day I'm like whenever I'm worried about you and your other people like cards like in a fight I'm comment I'm talking about your commentary when have I ever been worried about you and someone's card day what's his name Michael McDonald he's like you're right Michael McDonald's got a really good clothes I mean if I'm looking at a fight I'm looking at what what's the possibilities here absolutely no I'm just fucking with you he does have a good guillotine from his back when you fucked him up man he has some good he has some good triangles he's got he's got a good game but that was a big win for you it was a good fight that was a good fight Wow yeah that fight I mean he was knocking everyone out yeah yeah he's a weird one man like in his style because you look at his body you think like how is this kind of a heavy puncher and then he just he our fuckers oh you believe it it's a weird thing Cody's like that look at him all skinny and dopey I've been giving this guy's shit for the last two days because this black guy he got a black eye he got elbowed bys by somebody that was like covering up kind of scared and then he box with my little Joseph Morales who's been with me since he's nine he's a 25 pounder just had his his debut in the UFC and I'm like man Popo got you with that black eyed he's like now it was it was the elbow and I'm like no I mean it was but I was get out he got so pissed he's like you're gonna make it a real hard day for Joseph next time we spar don't you think though that having a bunch of people around you to fuck with you like that is actually probably good for you when you get into a situation with a guy like say Dominick Cruz who talks a lot of shit you're so used to it like that was one of the interesting things about that fight you could tell you're so used to shit talking it didn't bother you at all seemed like it charged you up yeah cuz he was getting fired up because I mean Dom doesn't act like that like you know the way he was acting like our times that we ran to each other I remember at the miz' cocky fight he was talking so much shit about me being fatherless and like Oh crazy I'm like I tried to research this how he's gonna talk shit yeah do that my father was in prison or whatever might do that's right you it doesn't matter so I we go through the I'm getting ready to film to walk in the fight mr. cocky at 202 I catch fuckin Dom at the corner of my eye like look and look look away and I was like okay I'm gonna have to say something to him now we caught you so you see what's up man I was like what's up Manny is like you're gonna talk shit on to talk shit on the media about the stupid even saying like I'm gonna beat I'm gonna knock me mr. cocky out faster than muted I don't beat your ass next and then I was like I don't slam you on the concrete not like Bisbing and who Daniel camara was right there and he's like oh yeah he like look back and like he's like yeah he's like you do have daddy issues like said like the off-the-wall shit like like sorry no he's not about it look he's a great fighter don't get me wrong but when put when it's in that kind of situation he's not I knew he was to play and you knew what that he wasn't about the fighter like any in his so you mean he didn't want to brawl with you exactly he's not a fighter he's an athlete he's good at what he does but I knew that it's different level mentality while what are you but that's a weird statement like the people I've heard people say that before like he's an athlete he's not a fighter but if he's fighting he's a fighter like so what's the difference I think I think Dominick actually showed like I think he got too brave with Cody there's a couple times where he's like all right I'm gonna get in there and show him I can hit hard and and got him in trouble in that fight I think he's a fighter I know what he's talking about with athletes that are that are more athletes and less of a fighter like people say that a lot about Georges st. Pierre yes like I don't know if George st. Pierre loves a good nasty like knock-down drag-out I know TJ Dillashaw like loves can't he like likes to get punched in the face and punter feel about Cody garment will stand there and like if he gets punished he'll March guys down with his face down and like tell him to hit him again like there's those kind of people that like love a fucking like a grinding fight whether he's gonna do it all time or not but like they have an affinity for it like they enjoy it hmm and then some people that are like playing a sport considered themselves tough and don't don't like that kind of yeah it's interesting um Buhl's said that about himself rumble Johnson said I'm an athlete because I'm not a fight I'm just really good at it right yeah I thought was crazy yeah are you chewing over there so what's going on that's chewing tobacco you drinking okay witness that fight lean elbow Dominic was everyone thought I was you know the emotional water the way that he was acting I was like man this is an easy fight for me right because sorts who's out of not like Dominic right well you were a big threat okay what it was right I gave Dominic credit cuz I know that Dom knew that was gonna be a hard fight oh yeah I said I said hey bro thanks for giving for choosing the harder route in talking up the fact that the Cody is the next guy because he went for the toughest fight Cody so he knew that yeah and he came to fight you know I you know he got hit he got busted he was leakin I mean it's I was completely gashed he was still fighting like come on you know talking but all the way up till that that point why I had kicked them and split him open and he was talking shit back to me it was funny I was like he's like what little bitch I didn't hurt like I was laughs like ah though you lie I don't lie to me I know that I got you know so it was fun like it was figuring out but still like talking shit to each other and then going in and it was great because I'm like this is a guy that I pictured fighting since I was a teenager you know and got prepared for him he's you know you said once he hit that he stopped right so exactly once weird he was every time I'd hit him or he get hit with a good shot or he thought he'd get me with one good we go back and forth and so I head kicked him and my knee hit him and he came back up and I saw him like.he great poker face man he's he's tough he knows how to you know when he's hurt he keeps it going but his eyes he looked at the blood and I saw his pupils go really big and I was hey Dom you having fun yet and he didn't answer back that was a great thing like that the third round it was I knew that's okay if I just keep doing what I'm doing I'm going to win this fight you know I end up catching home or you know it's my fight as long as I don't get caught with something because he's eat those looping punches and kicks and he's very unorthodox but I knew right then after that he was like oh shit this is an interesting fight coming up for you to be farting TJ after training with him for so long and all the bad blood that you guys have TJ leaving the team and going to train with Dwayne not so much about the team that's a there's a lot of confusion about what got what went down and it's it's fun let's lay it out for people because take a train with you guys for a long time here's if I send you a text I'll show you the four-minute video of him explaining exactly what happened which is you know it wasn't that you don't have to do that but you tell me from your point of view so TJ left the team like said hey look I first off it was it was lived on Ultimate Fighter with Conor with with the cup yeah he came from that cuz he was there and that's when you're defending him that's what I kind of like you know took it to because he like I'm all about loyalty like we don't you don't do that shit I never really liked Dwayne especially the way he left cuz he was a strange guy and like it was always about money and weird things etc he left and that was like fine that was his deal tgd was gonna try to have him come back and train at our gym for his fight and Dwayne refused to do it and I had a talk with TJ's like was crying and like you know that that Dwayne just wanted to focus on his own Jim and this and that and he's like you know whatever and so he's like I'm gonna spend some time there and spend some time here etc like that's fine so TJ when he got there got some exposure for muscle farm and muscle farm was might help people out here Dwayne Ludwig's former kickboxing champion whose MMA fighter who fought the UFC and then went on to be a coach for a year for a year no no he coaches now a lot right it with his own gym but for you guys he was you're striking coach for a little bit for a year and three months and he worked with a bunch of fighters and he had a very special relationship with TJ right then he moved out to Denver and he moved off Denver to fight his own to start his own thing and then MusclePharm which has a big gym in Denver they invited TJ to come train there so fill in the blanks all right people that don't know the story that are maybe big-time fans so then so yeah so then he he basically said that he wanted to that he wanted to he was doing his camps here for about a year and a half right he'd spent a little time there a little time here most the time he lived in Sacramento so I'm there we go to work with the way and no problem with it I cornered with the wind even after he left with with you know guys and stuff like that wasn't an issue so then I heard and Dwayne actually text me and was like Dwayne said something like well I mean there's a whole side of the Dwayne thing which is hilarious that was him getting weird like a year after he left like acting like he was there he like tried to sue me for a figment of his imagination of some money that wasn't even there and like this whole thing he had like is one of his students write this thing so there is some where he said that I'd like I can't even remember like something like I didn't give him a discretionary bonus that was supposed to be given or something like that and so there was like some some like intermingling 'he's about that whatever so Dwayne texts me and says and I said dude I never said I had to set the record straight on Dwayne and Dwayne text me and says hey I'm not the one trying to steal your team in your fighters I know there's a team out here for being built but I'm not a part of that and I was like are you talking about and then and I had talked to and someone else that said that hey I heard that Matt Brown and TJ Dillashaw are getting paid to be on this team and so I come in and I was like hey we were talking about some team things and teachers and practice I go I go yeah I got the weirdest thing Dwayne text me this and this other guy said this I said are you going to like are you getting like paid to go beep start a new team or something and it was Kody was there and Lance was there and I was there and TJ like lies straight to us about about the whole thing he's like he's like no man no they offered me but I'm no I'm not I'm with you guys you know what about a mil you're like this net and I was like okay whatever then time goes on and we have an actual sit-down talk we go eat sometimes than everything in TJ Chad Mendes my buddy Phil we all go and eat and TJ just tells me like hey man my next camp I'm gonna go out to Denver which he'd already been going out to Denver it's been like a year and a half since - waiting to be gone it wasn't like he like gone or whatever he's like but MusclePharm offered me like some some real good money to like be part of their team he's like so I'm basically I'm no longer gonna be representing Team Alpha Male I like I'm gonna do my camp out there and I'm gonna you know for they're gonna announce me how much money we're talking about he told me the time was I think 4500 bucks a month a month and they were gonna rent him a house and I go and I was like okay and Chad was sitting right there teacher sit then I'm go I go we'll shoot man it was nice having you on the team and he's like why are you getting upset I go I'm not upset I'm just saying like like you're off the team then and he's like well yeah but he's like but I I have a house here I'm still gonna come back and like come in and spar and when I'm in town in the offseason or whatever and I'm like I felt real weird do you guys but real weird and then I said I said well I said so that so he was no longer gonna be on our team he was gonna be on a different team and but then he wanted to come in at the time I'm ranked number three in the world Cody and him are going at it in practice it's anybody's given day you know we can look at the footage if you guys have the footage yeah but uh and then holds worse seven and now and and had just won the ultimate fighter and so cheesy it's basically saying is leaving the team I go bro TJ I said I said you can you know you're welcome to stay on the team but like if you're if you're no longer on the team like you know what does that mean and he's like well I mean it's just a good opportunity man they like I don't they don't have to pay they pay me to Train and and like you know it's they're starting a team and everything's gonna be under one roof and I go alright cool that's never done that where it worked I don't know they know they always tried that but but here's the thing so then after that it was like he's like who's gonna leave in two weeks and so me and teach me and Cody are sitting in there and like we hadn't said anything I told Fabio are an instructor our jiu-jitsu instructor what was happening and he told someone in Brazil as the Brazilian and Brazil leaked it out that TG was changing camps and there's all this drama and and this and that and then I said look TJ so he was coming in and teaching was never the best teammate he would like try to hurt people he's a very competitive guy and he has a temper and like to hurt people how John she shot it we always had the Ndebele boxing he media he's like I just need the bottom like yeah we're boxing Spontini easy to the body did ask there's no secret about TJ's I mean he'll we talked about it when he was still on the team also that he had to be like reeled in a little bit he's just he's just got a temper doesn't call them kill Shaw yeah killer Shaw Dylan shank like all that kind of stuff I mean it was it that was his thing you know he's just super competitive aggressive in cheap shots yes yeah the the super competitiveness thing I'm competitive I don't want to lose someone takes me you know I'm fighting tooth and nail and not to get taken out or get that extra win that round it just at in the bell knees you know I mean that's why chris is out you know I mean kneed him in the back of the head yeah that's I mean Chris Holdsworth that's with the injury I mean I don't want it Chris doesn't want us really talking about that what up with that that was intense we're talking about cheap that's what was that ISM I mean he doesn't care if we talk about it I mean I guess true that's what happened well how'd it go I'm not say I remember to think of Lee Dewayne used to come up to the crisp like hey like grasshopper he's like we have a you know TJ's fight and he'd take it easy honey take it easy I'm Kris ISM killers locking him up everybody I meet Christmas it was the animal and I guess Chris choked him out and TJ got out and fucking meet him in the back of the head what he's down he was down the mat in grappling match sparring it was flying but knees to the back of the head that's what I have a Krista mitten I mean just dirty should I've been a couple times I had told so Chris let him up let it let it was submitted them let them off and then TJ I don't know if that's exactly how it was I I remember seeing the whole thing I don't really want to get to this because it's Chris's gig man yeah that's fine but we already got it yeah already got into just but yeah so so how about TJ being a cheap shot him that's what literally killed Chris's career yeah majora obviously concussions yeah we I'm good friends with Chris and he did together no he went through his that's why his last fight was he had to fight with concussion because he you know he was scheduled to fight his wife died just like that and you know we've all you know it's one of the things that when I first came out there I was never really close with TJ I was out there I was doing well with the guys and a couple of the guys told me like man TJ can't wait to spar you this this is when he was coming off as Rafael since a loss I was like cool like fucking I'm I can't wait to spar with him either he's better and it's gonna be a good round you know and I was pretty worn like hey TJ does some cheap shit just you know keep it go and and others video I think I have some one of the kids that was a boxing and he sent it to me months ago tea day like cheap shot me after the bell I was like remember telling TJ I said look motherfucker you cheap shot me again we're taking the gloves off we're going on the street and fighting yeah I had ice because of that yeah I just don't ever like that especially teammates don't do that shit like hey you you get me you get me but don't cheap shot me at the end of the bell and as soon as you're hitting someone half the cheek like all dude I'm sorry like you know what you're doing so anyway so anyways that being said we knew that was part TJ's thing but now he's not longer part of our team and he also getting paid to go somewhere else he's no longer contributing in any way and he wants to come in and come in and spar our guys and like right like he basically want to be on our team benefit of our team without being a part of the team anymore and getting paid to be somewhere else which I would have been fighting they did he talked to me about like hey I want to work something out where I go get paid and do this whatever but then I'm like okay so that whole week he's in there and he's sitting there watching me and Cody in practice and he I don't care I mean TJ is a competitive he's always looking for edge the whole week prior to telling us that he was leaving he kept getting like hey there's a getting some proprietary Series in this series there's a single a guard series I used to get him with things like having me and Martin Kampmann show him all this stuff we were working on hey can you show me this and show me that like the week before and then so I goes like I go TJ look man this is getting awkward in practice I said look we can I had him over at my house I said look we can build a friendship how do we want to do it I said but this is getting awkward and like you being in practice you no longer being on the team and everything else like you know finish out this this last couple days and then you know you be on your team we can be friends on on the outside we can work on that as a deal whatever and he's like like you he wanted to come in and train with our team still you know as not as not part of the team right and then I was like but you're welcome to stay on our team obviously if you want and continue to do your camps and whatnot and he is just like like out so that at that point it became him taking this opportunity going to Denver being with Dwayne getting paid to do the muscle Pharm thing and then the whole thing with Connor happened on the TV show before this before any of this happened Conor McGregor started calling him a coma snake because me and Connor had one conversation we were sitting there and he goes he goes man congratulations on TJ defending his belt cuz he was so on her team his last title defense and I go thing good but what's up with Dewayne saying that no one on your team wants to be champions that's weird I said all he's just bitter cuz you know he's trying to get everyone to go out to his camp but he's just being a hater this and that and he goes he took that little bit of drama between me and Dewayne like Dewayne saying that no one on our team want to be champions including Kody who sent him a text tweet that said hey keep my name out of your mouth you like a jealous girlfriend or whatever and he said he took that one little thing and then next time you saw TG goes oh there's a snake in the grass and just built it in this big thing so now crazy the how well he is he's so good at the seeing people right yeah so that took like what really happened which is TJ got paid to go somewhere else me saying alright fine if you're gonna do that school but like you know if you're on that team you're on that team and then then Connor turn the public around on him you know because it came out later after the thing and so then TG became the victim and then he did now TJ's new stories that I I I got mad that he was training with Duane Ludwig and I kicked him off the team well you know TJ now has a snake as his logo I know yeah on the Ultimate Fighter he brought in snakes you know I mean even just he's at home with it you know yeah so it's all good I'm weird like if you want to be friends let's be friends but don't don't don't lie we walk back to it I'm ever going to Canada the whole was during the Ultimate Fighter sticking up for for TJ because TJ wasn't saying I the cars Mason you know like inviting in the fight and and teachers like yeah you know like nonchalantly whatever about it but wasn't defending himself like I'm honest native someone calling me it's taking the grass and say I was like disloyal to my teammates and should I we're fighting and that's why I stuck up for TJ cuz TJ's literally I'm like we're partying in Vegas we're having a good time like for the first time kind of a heart-to-heart with him with TJ and he's like so he's telling me this to shit like he said dude I'm with you guys like I'm not leaving fuck that like I'm with you guys so I'm like this is not even I'm not that close with TJ but he's the champion he's you know even the champion you get taken care of him people you know defend him so Connor was doing that he's like what you guys gonna do time it was talking about TJ sounds like me I'll do something bad like you asking for a fight we'll fight him you know broken pushing match and it wasn't going out to the outside that's TJ's saying that we were bet he's with us on my duty I gotta talk about my team so how does it feel now knowing that you're gonna defend against TJ with all this weird drama all this bullshit from me I don't ever get wrapped up into it it might look like that with the show and there's my life spin like this yeah I can live and prosper and focus on when it's time to focus and die it's like flipping a switch mmm I got gonna be doing the dumbest shit like you're fighting Dominick Cruz we're in the back just doing dumb shit am i warming up I'm just I'm just flipping the switch I always was like that since a little kid like wrestling football just when the lights shine that's why I shit like I'm shining the brightest I always feel like and now with TJ I don't respect him as a person but doesn't mean I don't respect him as a fighter the guy skillful he's meanest fuck and he's gonna bring a fight that's gonna be what I I love a challenge like with TJ it's gonna be a challenge I know him like the back of my hand my coaches know him like the back man we were able to dissect Dominick Cruz for me you know through all their experiences this is a guy they build up that was there longer than I've been you know I went out there one a no I had ten fights now with with team alpha male and 11 no 11 no world champion through there you know obviously I was skilled before I got there we blended together that the recipe for success I listen to follow lead with favor and a lot of other guys on the team and you so we know TJ and always gonna do I know what I have to be prepared for so I'm excited for it like all the Jama bullshit a whatever like it's bit it's going on too long like I'm just great focus on this fight and go in there and do what I have to do to get this win again well you have a good mindset and I mean think that is a gigantic part of what makes someone successful in the sport is being able to do that like you said have the confidence that you're going to shine the brightest when the lights are on and having this mindset like you're appreciating the fact that TJ's mean and skillful hockey it's gonna give you a great challenge yeah it's like I mean I'm sure the coucher sound like you what do you think TJ's doing he's sitting on the couch so you're getting I'm gonna do the extra work you know TJ's a workhorse like that right precise for me makes me more to be I need these guys that keep me motivated like Dominic you know used to watch the embedded zuv him he was running alone you know like a sob story on Christmas like I just gotta do this I like it I'm sitting there you know we're having a party that was enjoy this shit like I'm about to fight my first title you know I've never had this time again in my life I'll never fight for my first world title now it's a fight I'm finally getting to defend my title who cares a lot of we were talking about this a lot of people win the title but what the fuck did they do it Brian now it's about creating that legacy and now I have TJ whose man he's a bad motherfucker he was ranked in a the pound-for-pound before and the top ten you sure he's a killer so that's it I'm gonna catapult my career with him and I know what I'm gonna do to do with him you know I would like I've been with I want to know when I was greenness I was just boxing wrestling athletic love to fight now I blended and found my own style just filing getting really composed in there where I can let my show my skills show off and it's I'm fighting hire people so like my skill level rise I've always liked that now what is this video supposedly of you knocking him out oh yeah yep oh yeah true true yeah how come you guys didn't release it I don't first off I don't think my video have seen it it's Justin it was on Justin's GoPro and dude this I literally that I felt bad not bad for it because it was just wherever TJ came followed me around the jail I got wherever I'd go but my gym bag way like a manly islip dude I'm like okay hey like literally like he was off his rocker about him I okay so brick competitors how did it go down what happened I never had them throwing uh you know doing his little footwork and then he did the jump down he does the uppercut and I just threw overhand right whoa out and he got up and he was literally fighting Easton right before the Easton flex I remember the day he didn't go out cold like flat-out he just got dropped off and came back came and he was on stanky leg like Walker and he's go come on motherfucker hit me I'm like just like I'm like like palm I Drive out like no who's saying that after you dropped him yeah he's easy fucking nut I love it yeah he's always so wasn't a knockout as much as it was you just dropped him yeah I dropped them to his I mean he his legs for and then he got back up and started saying come on motherfucker so he was conscious right and he knew that he he was staggering bro he like JA Dotson had him on skates again this was we go and he I was I gonna hit him you're fighting in two weeks I wasn't like that but literally he had to say he fell forward he slipped I'm like do doesn't matter like am I gonna stay England you know and then I was showing Danny how I liked his steel because he like so ran right sorry like throat my head off the lane bring the right hand this and that and the buck was comes over sick dude he goes and it was on it was Christmas Day or something sparring film in his own film is on spine cuz watch you knock TJ out and I was like oh yeah it was like okay you see I've got my GoPro my god that's cool and nothing ever came about it and then TJ was saying that he used to make me cry in practice no I have cried in practice for cuz this motherfucker jumped me on my head before that I made a fight I was like super mad about it favorite comes in has the camera crew the purest labs and like we're going hard like don't show my head I'm like I get mad like you know I'm like try not to get hurt before the fight so like I never cried t didn't ever made me cry so I was like easy talking about making me cry like if I cried right when you get dumped in your head did you get concussed or something you did hurt more like babies I'm like he's out I don't barely remember this I think what's happened first off here's the thing Cody is a dangerous dangerous motherfucker if you're not on your even if he's not trying to you're getting fucking rocked or hurt or whatever so I have to be on on a game with him even if you're going light you know unless he's gonna go light but light doesn't work when the guys accurate and strong and everything else so we had to go so it was just like a like a wizard hip heist lots when you do that a lot rocks me on my head because you're coming after me you can't burn like so I know now there's a camera crew fall in favor it's not like it's it's fucking the fight that's well that came from about the video and like coming out like we have the video you get knocked out TJ you didn't make it he was saying you made us beat us all up like with the Dominic sit down no I think Duane was maybe saying that but he said I don't know you beat your teammates up he's yeah actually for a matter of fact haven't beaten him up I'm like I don't follow mostly what are you what's your thoughts on sparring look do you think that you should be sparring hard or do you think you should be sparring technical and pull back on shots or do you think you should have a little bit of both I think a little bit of both I think beginning of camp you get your your Kent your your rounds into where you're found comfortable then later on I can't your technique you know your your combos that you're working kind of like flight simulation but get those rounds in them because you're not wanting to beat your body up close to the fire I want to feel fresh at the fight and that's how I've always used I would literally get 50 rounds of sparring start tapering off towards into the end of the fight camp as it called in boxing related in camp do you try to spar with only people that you know so you know that you can trust them so you know like especially obviously this TJ fights a giant fight huge fight and it's gonna be huge not just for the event division but for the sport I mean all the major fans are gonna be paying attention to this fight yeah definitely I'm safe with it now like we were talking about I have all these fights logon not even just all the street fights all the boxing matches the sparring work I don't need to spar as much right but I need to we were sparring 10 rounds for the crews fight ten straight fives you know eight to ten each week I'm like buckles is kind of you know it worked you know I mean but we're doing smaller glove more anime based you know the big gloves I may need techniques throughout the window your people just sprawl and brawl kind of shit like I like small glove and you're still peppering the shots hitting them but you're working the whole game takedown submission right so I like that and also fight simulations I like fight like having my uncle come out Pat holder Justin's the the other pad order for you know and then Danny Faber have like four different bodies where they're on you is like a fight they're on run and actually know you're hitting pads and you get tackled from behind you have to work up you think that right right it's safe you're not and that's what I like to do yeah there is there is nothing like you know like like we talked about running sprinting and blowing out the lungs etc there's nothing like actual like intense sparring to simulate what it feels like in a fight though and it's is familiars you get with it it still feels horrible when it happens like I've been I've always been known as like the conditioning guy like I can condition and and like never get tired except your accessories and fights you get tired it's about the poker face it's about being familiar with it it's about like you know these things but they're being comfortable yeah being comfortable with it so you have to get there sometimes it's just being smart about it yeah cowboy doesn't spar anymore really yeah Cowboys essentially does mostly drills and pad work and simulations and stuff like that if he does spar I think these bars super light because he was realizing then he was beating himself up too much and training and coming into fights like already kind of little soft soft but you know yeah them for a week and that's what he loved to do fucking treadmill bike workouts and sparring and pad work you know nothing really else didn't wrestle Ajit's he just loves sparring doing all that so yeah he did he's smart hard though I mean he's hired he said he's like a killer knocking dudes out of a gym like a mat like a like a nasty fucking sparring sparring partner cowboy maybe that's one of the reasons why I stopped doing it probably is maybe all that stuff just I mean look you can't always be the hammer if your head those kind of Rock'em Sock'em robots barring sessions you're gonna get tagged yeah sure right absolutely for me I like getting in those we just had Saturday sparring with a lot of guys yeah we had a killers row of sparring going on this last weekend 10-round you gotta get those in sometimes it's those for me like I've been out of it for a little bit like just knowing that it's a couple you know weeks knock the rest off you know that's why it feels good but you feel good about it like you're like mom we're gonna go in here and fight and I know a fight that TJ's gonna bring it's gonna be I hope it's a phone booth you know I hope it you know stand trade let's let's see yeah I don't know how he's gonna you know she knows my skills you know that I have you know really have gotten so much better since then I was still getting the better of him and I'm not saying even to Mount hor or whatever it's the gym but you're competitive as he isn't competitive I am you're not gonna give an edge in practice I don't give him an edge of practice favor takes me down we're going again you know it's vice-versa I think for every 10th leo that's over time we go 40 minutes after sometimes it's like this guy's one of the hardest guys a break because he's just I'll be the to Domino he's tired all about like I'm talking about that now he's retired so he comes in like these guys like all freeze all fresh but comes in like this guy's retired like favor up and this guy's breaking these younger dudes that are killers themselves because he just has that mentality it's it's a different breed and that's why like I said TJ he's that breed mm-hmm to that point you know he's an alpha male guy unfortunately guys feel like you could never reconcile or do you feel like she's crossed a line into some weird sort of you know retro Sarah I did so much defending of that guy cuz you know he's but you know whatever his thing is here and this and that and I have a lot of great friends that are newer I mean like Cody's newer in my life but we've got a bond I've got friends that I've had since I was like kindergarten and before kindergarten and growing up together you know in my community and like I've got great groups of friends so it's like I mean I can reconcile whatever just stop lying about what actually happened to save your face it's like I'd never kicked the guy off of a team or anything and then he gets a one opportunity on national television to say something about me that's my only qualm with the guy I didn't like Dwayne because of the things that he had done but teaching I would work with things about running a gym and running a camp is that you kind of have to manage like a psychology personality yeah yeah a lot of Fighters are prima donnas and you know not just a trainer not just a teammate but you were also a psychologist and some sort of a counselor I have to be glue which in when I honestly I'm just learning this more and more when I step out of the the the area too much it's like I mean I have to come back in and put out fires and bring everyone back together and that's I would say that's one of my skills is is getting along with people and making things mesh and in finding a culture and building like a healthy environment and like that can get tweaked so easily it's it's crazy it's cancer yeah and now justin Buckholtz is your main trainer now right he's like we've gone to now is we have we have like a whole staff of main trainers because we have so many fighters I mean we just had sage Northcutt yeah year Rodriguez and Sara McMann in the gym right now nice and and you know Rick Glen is about to go and he's a new guide of the team and then we've got you know Darren Elkins so we have different guys like Danny Castillo is a head coach Chris whole just the head coach coached Joey Rodriguez is a head coach Danny Castillo is a head coach we have Fabio Prado who's a coach Dustin Akbari and those guys have been with us for you know 14 years 13 years and I'm I'm in the lead position as the coach I run I run you know practices and oversee things and coordinating to co-op it's a it's a big co-op and different people have different coaches that are like their main gig and you know different skills this is still fairly young - right how old Justin it's like 34 yeah he's 35 I think and is he completely done competing that's a great question you never know with with the fight game you know yeah it only takes a s to be back in the fight game but sometimes guys when they coach they also feel like they're getting better because I understand things more right yeah you see that a lot with jiu-jitsu competitors or other times coaching makes them a better fighter absolutely yeah I don't know if they'll come back but I mean what we've got is a great co-op and it's always a struggle to keep things because there's going to be clicks there's gonna be the potheads and the Nerds and the fucking jocks and like you know whatever so you enjoying it still here's the game did you know what I you know what it is it was awesome I went to Mexico City and I missed Chad's wedding to go and Chad's my boy I loved Chad and love Abby his wife and it was I know I missed a great time but I got to go Corner Joseph Morales who's known me since season he's the oldest member of our team Wow he's been with us the longest and he's he's nine years old when he started with us that's crazy and he you know like Danny Castillo is it was me and Danny Castillo and our coach Joey in his corner and Danny was getting all teared up like we all got teared up right before the fight like we brought it in and everyone's kind of crying and everything and like Joseph I mean he's been through his struggles I went when he was going through a hard time I took him to the front row of you know UFC and and just you know put him right there and let him visualize and so that's that's the stuff I enjoy now you guys in camp huh what is crazy at my house right now he's all by himself at big old house what a crazy style.com Scout he's telling that's a really talented guy quit weird style to write like that Taekwondo based yeah kicking and wild shit like when he hit BJ Penn with a 360 roundhouse kick to the face yeah okay yeah he's good yeah it's crazy good range even said that his hands you know I'm not so good with the range and like knowing like my kicks I'm real accurate with his kicks he says I kick harder and stuff yeah I think that just yeah he feels like he's more accurate with his kicks in his with his hands well the consequences if he's not doing it with someone who's also a great kicker you know because he's able to operate in a range where he's pretty effective and most people aren't yes he's a long kicker - yeah he's been staying he's been staying at my house the last like week and so I'm getting to know him a lot I mean what a cool dude I mean that guy's first Mike I'm very smart he's like well put together he's I got to hear a little bit about like the town he's from Chihuahua in Mexico and like it's a pretty pretty scary place and and kind of his journey as a young kid is one of the top karate guys in Mexico so he's been a competitor for a long time used to have a coach that used to like hit him with a stick so they left that place and the guy called him back and was like can you please come back and I won't hurt you it was then he was like yeah what he was like seven and eight well Jesus Christ he's been he's been in it you know the combat sport for a while yeah I think that Frankie Edgar fight was a very tough fight for him but a good fight as far as a learning experience like and a lot of people had said that I was one of the ones that said it like we'll see what happens when he fights a great wrestler like that's gonna be the real issue with him because he's got all this wild kicking stuff but that stuff doesn't work if somebody grabs ahold you write something Franco you yeah he's a great mix it together so yeah year his wrestling because I got to wrestle him the other he actually post a little video of us wrestling but his wrestling was good it's just like Connor Connors wrestling boxing is really good it's just not Floyd Mayweather good right later rounds you know so like yeah years made a lot of gains he went and trained with Izzy Izzy Israel Martinez who put him through like I you know he's a great coach Israel very good and he he put him through like a whole year of wrestling so his wrestling is top-notch but it's not you know it needs to get to another frank Jaeger level right but it wouldn't when you're a little bit fatigued and they make a small mistake and the guy can capitalize but it's getting there yeah yeah it's uh it's interesting you see so many different approaches and his approach is very unique and it's one of the things that's exciting about him is that he's you got that crazy wild kicking style yeah it'll throw everything yeah a torpedo kicks all kinds of shit yeah that's a guy like to mix up with because you don't see too many of those guys but when you run into him right you know it's good to watch him and feely were trained you know he you got a one he got a win over feely but like feely felt like hot man I was in that fight he's got cocky got popped in the orbital and then got like couldn't see and got switch kick to the dome and so feelings like man it's fun to watch these guys come circle full circle like like yeah ear beat be feely and now they're training together and working together a little bit and then Darren Elkins lost a Chad Darren Elkins came to see us and he's been on like a sixth fight win streak that guys very good jab dude that fight we love this I backtick was one of the craziest moments I've ever seen Scott getting his ass kicked for every fucking second of the first couple rounds and it finally gets ahold of on the damage them down and chaos them and then just screams like I like a demon yeah covered in blood I was sitting there I left during the second rounds like me I can't watch this like I don't like watch my friends and special and shit like that happened somewhere I walked out and next thing you know the place goes nuts and I see Elkins you know knocked them out like who liked it liked it you got it I see you stopped Elkins yet not chuckles yes system off yeah for sure tuff Elkins is the like the pillar of consistency he's always in the he's always at every practice listens in every coach he going hard we have these two Chechnya brothers that come in there they're from Chechnya they're really talented guys I'm actually gonna go corner the guys over in Ukraine but uh they're super skilled fighters but don't have that grind like we we have here and so they keep popping him boom boom boom and then there and then they keep trying to call timeout they like catch him with a couple things and elkins chase now you ain't you not taking a timeout uh-uh grabs the guy why did they try to take time gonna get tired don't be pop pop just flapped his head he'll fly back boom hit him there kick him in the leg and he's like like he got catches him with something like grabs like Oh time outs everybody's like oh oh fuck that motherfucker no time how cuz the grinder he looked great against Dennis Bermudez there's a big win that's a big win yeah and he looked smooth and that's fine yeah he did as much damage his name's a damage for a reason cuz he gets some but it's also like the way his he's moving looks better that way he's kicking and punching his combinations he looks like he's got less extra steps it's like this all smoothness and his transitions and his movement that's what we're working on and I think a lot of that is to do with obviously working the footwork like these guys some of these guys are straight wrestlers and then like alright we're in a wrestle and throw punches and try to take you down but you it's the the footwork around the core of everything yeah you can have throw good hands but if your feet are out of business you're getting taken down you know you're not gonna land power punches so the footwork i religiously work on footwork daily yeah that's all I just footwork Dominic means that is his entire thing is his ability to move is just so unusual as footwork is so weird nice one of the things where you went toe for toe for toe to toe with them when your footwork is equally as good as his it's not better and you were landing harder combinations for us master Tong was all about footwork and body mechanics and he's back in Thailand now and then that's been passed on to our next generation of coaches from he comes back he did move back after 11 years why decided to move back to Thailand became a monk for a day he can't walk for day because because his parents died if you don't go and live in the monastery for within a year and a half after he hadn't seen his son in 11 years since the son was four and he I mean he spent all his time facetiming with his family and he wasn't necessarily allowed back and that he went he went back he's stuck back he wasn't a loud pack how come illegal oh oh so he couldn't come back to America if he went back to Thailand yeah yeah so when he was gone he was gone because he overstayed a visa oh so he uh yeah so that's when you never thought when you saw TJ Dillashaw my corner in Canada uh-huh that's cuz Master Tong couldn't go to Canada TJ every single thing that that the master Tong like knew all his stuff could hold mitts but he was all about that now which see that's what's great about having all these coaches like Justin buckles he knows he knows master tongs style he knows my style he knows every coach you've ever had there Dwayne style he knows you know anybody Dmitri Maidana do you meet you made onyx tile anybody that's been in here he knows Bob Bob's my Uncle Bob's style and so you get a guy like Darren Elkins it needs to work on that striking and we put in with Justin buckles and you know with the cumulative part of the team it works wonders and then you get a guy like yeah year who comes in with a striking background and now we've got all these different attributes with like a sage Northcutt who's with us right now that guy is the hey let's take a moment to acknowledge sage Northcutt as the nicest guy in the planet you know like the nicest dude on the planet I think that guy got into the UFC too quick just a little bit but it wasn't that I super talented and was looking really good in some small organizations but really didn't have a complete game yet I might say he learns really really fast I always mess I was messed with Cody I always get this kind of like man sage wounds a lot faster than you I mean it's not really the case I just like to fuck with this guy but her sister that's a karate competitor yeah God yep she should fight MMA shit the first fight and she lost but she has some potential - that's interesting he's uh he's a fun case you know cuz he's got that weird karate style super fast he's got a streak too though I mean you wouldn't know it but he's got a little mean streak and he's got all the knowledge like everybody because he's nice everybody wants to help the guy and he's so nice that he's just like oh thank you like just like whoever tells them you know calls me mr. favor now when you guys do a camp like say you training for TJ who organizes your camp like how do you organize like your strength and conditioning routine how do you organize like what you're gonna do that day or do you do a base on how you feel or twos who is the coordinator myself basically I kind of that's what we do like favorite always would preach about hey it's a lifestyle change like if you need to do this much work you need to do wrestling get a rep get it right guys on the team and wrestle so I'll figure out what I need to do especially for this fight with TJ I know the specific work that I need mhm combos what he throws what he likes to do a vice-versa so I get with all my coaches like hey I would like to have this much work with Chris personal this much work with motion and movement with a favor pad work I'm my uncle come out and do pad work as well and then I go with my transitioning coach from going three times a week right now I'm usually one heavy day to like movement footwork you know grease in the body so it's just always like usually on that Sunday but okay we lay it out boom lay it out lay it out so we'll see you lay out the whole week of movements so it when you have a heavy day say if you have a like a Rock'em Sock'em robots day the next day do you like to do like yoga stretch out do movement hit pads like how do you how do you work it I usually go Sunday is kind of like a what do you call like a shakeout kind of active rest we're moving in October yeah so I don't feel like garbage on Monday Monday we hit it hard usually morning practice or pad works and afternoon and then jujitsu so it's usually three on Mondays Tuesdays I usually just wrestle and maybe do some pad work because I like to kind of be rested for sparring conspiring so a lot mmm sparring on Wednesday and then I usually do a strength conditioning where on afters and on Thursdays usually my like no impact day usually kind of like it's wrestling sometimes our going around just wrestle if I feel good I'll drill I won't go alive it's and then I would do like yoga more of my hyperbaric chambers I think you go I go towards the end of the week after the sparring because Friday is a it's MMA practice so it's like everything that you're doing the sparring and they you're doing the grappling so is this trial and error that's led you to this schedule that gives you like the thought to take Thursday light and then go hard on Friday Monday hard Sunday light ok this is what it's worked for me so as I said like I came out here literally I was in I was doing my own training auditioning before I came out to team alpha male and I was hitting passes my uncle and I go in and spar I wouldn't even hit mace fire I would do boxing with takedowns that's all we would do because a lot of the boxers I was with wrestled were you know they would do we would just do the boxing arresting so we never do the boxers didn't want kicked right so we're just doing that I get my work and I was working with Paul Spadafora a lot of these boxers in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and I finally came out here and these guys had it like man a system a system like wrestling system that's why I do so well cuz they do the drilling you start out with this we're gonna go wrestling then we're gonna go in the clinch you know back to strikes fit ins like any it goes from this as its structured yeah so I didn't I never knew knew any of that like the first time I really trained you Jitsu was out here like learning in like blending together I always was like I said I was a good athlete good wrestler good fighter good boxer but I found in my own you know style here with like going and doing really the first year that I was here I was just training like for like I was in yeah he actually told me he's like bro this is like a little and we had to tone it back a little bit which like I said we have the this team was built on overtraining it was like I didn't take a vacation for seven years when I started fighting I mean I never took vacations growing up either we didn't have money it wasn't like something we did so I'm not like used to like oh we're taking a vacation but like seven years I didn't take a vacation and so it was like this grind grind grind everybody's kind of keeping up and we've we've shifted and gotten smarter and had more input and etc etc but the bottom line for me is this a lot of advisors right and I like it sage Northcutt it's a great example he could he'll he'll listen whoever is listening talking to him and like and not people want to talk to him all the time and tell what to do right so like there's advice there's an advisory like we say hey this is the coaches and I think that you need to do this and we need to do that but you have to be especially at a high level like this you have to be a thermometer for your own for your own stuff as well so we have set practices throughout the day but if you're feeling way too beat up you know cuz we're not worried about guys not showing up to practice because they're lazy we have the best athletes in the world the right mentality we trust that the mentality and the purpose is there and right so if you're feeling too much you got to let us know we'll take a little back and do it there and so this is kind of what we found for for him as work now when you're scheduling everything yourself like there's two schools of thought on that there's like one school of thought that says someone should be overseeing everything for you so you're not telling me what you do scheduling is one thing but what you're scheduling he's scheduling something with a coach he's got a strength and conditioning and a physical therapists that are making taking that part of his thing he's got you know us as head coaches overlooking saying hey we need to make sure that you're getting your you know this end but there's coaches every single time for that it's not like you're just on your own doing your course right some people do do it that way yeah some people like to do everything on their own some people just like to be told what to do yeah cheered you're gonna do this exactly but that that goes away which ones somebody fuck you huh that's like my extreme conditioning coaches PT coaches with my AMA coaches they're all and my coordinates okay we went heavy with this we should ease back this made me do this many rounds so but that's just started doing that name for the Cruz fight the first time over a heart rate monitor and kind of like track where my heart rate was that it was getting up the high in the 81 80s mm-hmm trying to bring it back down that's the first time I ever done that and will you what so like when you're doing that are you doing that for strength and conditioning are you doing that holding pass like hey that was literally we would throw for 90 seconds we would throw we do it for six rounds I would throw the same combo we had three or four different combos that we'd throw for 90 seconds just keep the input up a little so it's just boom ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom four or five punch combo - with the kick mm-hmm or stop where the cobblestone your heart rates get jacked and you can until it gets down to what before you go again and then I think you would like 140 or something I was getting down I think lower than that yeah so we do that time you giving yourself in the recovery times and then in between yeah I like to do 45 seconds because you think it right you know thing 45 seconds I got another 15 seconds of you know recovery usually you feel good at 30 I'm good at 30 more seconds I put it to 45 it's like in the fight like well because that meant it goes fastest out right I've seen you like talking to your coaches you might bell rung get stitched her yeah you know your eyes fixed and then you're back up there so it's nice to keep it for 45 seconds to keep going because now here you are you're 25 right into 26 26 champion of the world when you look at your future you look at your like your potential future in the sport I mean you could be a gigantic fucking superstar you have the world is your oyster right like how do you how do you plan on dude you have like this sort of like master plan for your career you know what my goal was so long to be the world champion and I grinded towards the head that guy got that goal you know I accomplished that and then it was boom right into Ultimate Fighter boom injury boom fight postponed so I was like I haven't been able to really really set down because well you know you're in training you're focused on something for me I'm a creature of habit I like routine so we have just recently now sat down and I we've said about it you know everyone can win the champion if everyone can be a world title to what you do with the title now I've set these goals to build my legacy you know start going on and who knows who knows what could happen in a year or so like I didn't think I was gonna be injured you know I never thought I'd be out this long right this is the the most trying time of my life cuz I couldn't do something that I love to do and been in pain and injured how you've been injured for may have been years it's been since I dunno year I started having back problems from football and yeah so on and off yet fucking football fuck apples there's all the time all the time damn foosball and so I've dealt it but progressively it was the Henry briones fight was the fight that I almost pulled out of that fight the first five were pulled out besides obviously TJ had to postpone it I couldn't walk but Shawn Shelby got wind of Maddox and our story and that he wanted to walk so I just told him and my back was like really bad then so that's why I really started come on and then I didn't fight for after the hairy fight in flight for nine months ten months and then I got used to kept booking me I thought Augusta Mendes was supposed to fight other Brazilian lineker he got sick the week of the fight replacement and then if I am then Almeida and then it was mr. cocky they knows Cruz so I didn't have time to be like really I just dealt with the pain like there was times where I would take two weeks off of like really training doing anything or it switched side to me my left side or my right side so I was go southpaw until that side started to messed up I'd switch back to Orthodox like it was a lot of like some of the time working around working around it cuz I had to excitons usually can be Remini right for the virginity major and how did that go you know what it felt good I felt like it took the you know inflammation inflammation away so we've stopped like locking up and sitting the shop you know the shocks down my leg but still I was I've been doing rehab since and I've been doing rehab Monday Wednesday and Friday and obviously on Tuesday Thursday doing living so I've been doing rehab and getting to become I feel like a better athlete I'm moving more but it still it's like from being constant a wrestling stance or boxing stance being like that now ivory pride myself open and it's the muscles around it are still you know I just had a little scare couple weeks ago we're good you know we're moving on from that I feel way better my back feels way stronger I wasn't able to fight July like there's no way we try to get optimistic about it going to Germany and thinking that was you know gonna heal you know miracle miracle shots and well maybe would have been if you took more time off more time I think it's like you're a pro athlete so like you're not just having these procedures and then taking a long time to recover you're having these procedures and trying to get back to training pretty quick literally like you know I had that fight so I was literally seven weeks out from when I had the first stem cell yeah then I take him one thought might take four weeks off and two weeks of trying to so I leaves me with a week and a half to train for my title fight right you guys understand that yeah that's insane and it doesn't even make sense so you are October 7th is the fight right November 4th November 4th oh yeah that's massive square oh that's great why did it fuck that I think okay that makes that's that that makes it it was rumored I guess I mean I got hit by a couple of news outlets house fight in October I'm like yeah that's the Vegas right who's on that card who is Kevin Lee I think explain Oh Ferguson Kevin Lee for the interim 155-pound title yeah that whole interim thing is so crazy right they just sort of randomly decide when they're gonna have a title how they do that remember dominant Cruz had it for a long time and they let him keep for a long time and there's some guys they just like all right you're done yeah that's what I was with the whole thing that I said I'm not rushing back if you guys want to make a norm tight or take the title from me that's fine 25 years Lamar I'm gonna I'm gonna get the title back it's right I got it here I'm gonna get it back if that's were to happen right so I don't want anyone to sit you know TJ wanted to go down fighting DJ cuz that was my thing I texted John and Danny cuz I can make 25 that was my whole you know game plan was to fight he did July 8th and I got hurt put out and it was gonna fight deejay and masters for garnish so I was always in my mind was gonna fight in November of massive Square Garden it's just a different opponent well somebody's got to fight DJ I was kind of bummed out that that Demetrius decided not to fight TJ I've never been able I never even knew that was an option just to be like I'm not gonna fight well he said and I guess his mindset is that he's one fight away from breaking the record of the most title defenses ever and if TJ and bent down not being able to beat up anyone in the world in your way yes which is the important thing right about there yes it is but if he lost to TJ and TJ didn't make the weight it would fuck him up like if TJ decided not to if he couldn't make the weight it's a lot of it's a lot of yeah that's a lot so he wanted TJ to fight one time a 20 make the way make sure you can make the way and then fight him I guess it makes sense but the other thought process is your the pound for pound the best fighter on the planet you should be fighting the best fight that you can yeah yeah and that's a really good fight yeah it's like no one's Floyd didn't make sure Conor McGregor could make the weight yeah they just booked the fight and the light on them as a profession how when Jon Jones wouldn't fight jail though that's cuz he hated jail though that was a part part of it was like fuck this guy that this guy might have a possibility of beating me he was no I'll do this through a real camp because I'm not gonna come in here and take this on short notice I don't know man I mean he took the OSP fight on short notice it wasn't his best fight you know he sort of prides himself on having a long game plan and that's its mentality - yeah man this whole thing is so depressing with John I know man apparently we're gonna he was back find out soon what's gonna happen with the B sample you know but if the B sample tests positive as well he's kind of doomed this is years four years it's four years believe I mean obviously I'm not the fucking athletic commission or you sod or whoever calls it out but I think the first one was what well the first one was an out of competition now the first one was a tainted supplement and they give me a year right didn't they give me a year yep dick pills so was it really dick pills oh it was yeah they have they tested the pills they put those estrogen in these messages gas-station dick pills yeah because they make you excited they block your estrogen fill you up with I mean look they could put whatever the fuck they want in those things just trying to get your dick hard the night they're not thinking that a world class world champion professional athlete is taking me go to 7-eleven but yeah don't you think though I mean this is what I've always said that world-class fighters like professional fighters are not like any other athlete because they're fucking reckless they're wild motherfuckers like cowboy like you like a lot of guys they are impulsive reckless risk-taking people oh you know I don't know I mean I guess I guess disciplined for sure I mean professionally Calley kid yeah you're you're definitely different but there's a lot of different guys in the sport you know that have you know those charities but a lot of Fighters it's a big percentage that are wild and John's fuckin wild like if you want to get a wild motherfucker like John who opens up his fight at 23 years old fighting Shogun for the world title with a flying knee against show guy I mean that's how you open the fight that's what that's a wild impulsive dude he just good feels it and goes with it flow today yeah it feels like poppin them gas station dick pills just like this is do this is redline's by the time there's no like all the excuses you know the cocaine was just partying the dick pills that's more the same now this one that was a different thing this isn't what she's saying he's not saying anything no official statement talk to my lawyer yeah and they're saying they didn't do anything you know that would be the most fucked up thing in the world if somebody slipped some shit into your water you know just to get you to test positive but you got to watch everything you fucking eat I mean you you always have to think people definitely do double-cross people yeah definitely in this world there's somebody who would absolutely put something tainted in your food all they'd have to do is sprinkle a little bit a little bit of it and you know dish your food you wouldn't even notice it I mean do you really think that's it happened I don't think anything I don't know anything I wonder I mean that's true though I mean they're so fucking evil people out there that's one thing I've learned is getting older is like just being a nice guy you assume everyone's nice and good it's like there's some creepy negative people out there and it's beautiful when you find nice people because of that though yeah it balances it out so when you know people that you can trust that really are your brother yeah that's like that makes it all the more look if everybody was cool you wouldn't necessarily appreciate cool people as much Yeah right absolutely yeah I mean people everywhere where's all the douches I need an enemy yeah you know and that is have you ever fought somebody that you really liked I fought a bunch of guys yeah who'd you fight you really liked Uriah I liked Charlie Valencia Brian bulls I like Scotty Jorgensen I like Teddy Weinland sorry friends with those guys like Michael McDonald you know I was friends with all those guys weird right I could say probably one who misses a gawky just really didn't speak English but but Cody from the get-go goes hey man I know you're cool your opponents everything but I like I like intensity I like if I like people say that he's got a temper everything he's like that's he's fighting this guy he's getting that mentality that's part of what he liked yeah my thing is I will either you I whip your ass you whip my ass I'm always gonna show you respect after like a you know it's good I remember that when I got signed I thought Marcus Bremen and I don't like shaking my opponents hand before the fight I never like that I never liked glove touching any of that Marcus that we I saw him a couple times no toy stick what's up man like cool man like goodness yeah senior Saturday night and I told him before weigh-ins I was like hey you know go on stage like I don't want to shake your hand out there don't make me look like a dick like if I go to shit you know that's cool it's cool yeah right on man I said I got respect for you let's put on a show and I'm like walking away I'm like all right and he like shook his hand out there and I was like in my mind like oh so I shook it again we were coming back to buckles is like he got me again with the handshake she's like I don't want to shake your hand let's fight how about they throw a British against notorious and against no love man it's because he wears that thing the post-fight press conference I had a lot of respect for Dominick Cruz the way he handled that yes he just he had no excuses I took it like a man yeah he's like he was a better man he beat me I got no excuses there's nothing I could say yeah yeah for sure you know definitely we've had our differences and still might not he still has me blocked on Instagram and Twitter shit on my wife's photo and then block me like you block me like trying to be cool to him not doing like some interview and Dom was trying to needle Cody and Cody's like this I didn't even know what was going on what was happening I was doing the Fox for the Ultimate Fighter and was obviously Karen Brian asked about me grabbing teach advice throw like Ian goes and me and Dominic got into altercation at weigh-ins at 2:07 I really come out I'm just waiting I had my hands full with all the paperwork bullshit they gave us and George gave me all these waters and refuel stuff so I come out of the door and I crossed paths with topical I didn't know didn't even register was him but I'm I proof you I catch something and I kind of like turn back around and he was like how these chick sunglasses on like these big chicken glasses yeah he's like get outta you skinny little motherfucker and I was like well I was like dude we're fighting tomorrow man is like so guy was laughing like really like he wants no first time we saw each other and day before we were in this split room this this much or we're talking shit to each other on a camera I'm like we can't do like sit down and obviously like that yeah it's Jeremy Stephens in there right I'm like man you got and Steve's a good little boy like talking like just riding off a Dom pipe or off his off Dom like he brought in a self-proclaimed savage and Jeremy Stephens like the counterbalance that I was pertaining to be a savage that's what he kept saying I'm like right like I was like I'll come over smack both you guys right now I took my earpiece off I ran through the security and then he was saying I was throwing shit is the whole build-up so we finally saw each other I was like man how's it go being your ass tomorrow like walking off like I didn't just hide it and I see Jeremy Stephens right here he's like all puffed up he's like you're too small little dude he's like give me one of your teammates and I was like drop all my shit and get ready to hit him like an ollie my manager comes out of nowhere swoops Jeremy up but he grabbed me like he like scratch my neck had a big old scratch on it from his nails little bitch and like so it was that and then that whole conflict so he gets on skype or not Skype Fox boy he's about to do an interview about the situation of tough Karen Ryan asked them to come he's like he's just a little dick you know he just you know whatever you respect him for what he did he's because he knows that I always said that he knew what he had to do in that media for people not to hate him you know look how Connor and andrology sometimes a little change little bit after he lost he he took his home Alpine I respect him for that but I knew deep down that wasn't exactly it has to be I danced all over his ass you know it means a great fighter I am Barristan no I'm cool cool I can respect him like hey cats off getting tough tough dude we talked after I got tough like I've been pictured in this and would come on and say hey you're getting joined by Dominic I'm like all cool like that's cool like right like it has to be brief that and says we're professional it's like okay so it goes on about daesik yeah you ever been choked up at weigh-ins and if so what would you do and I'm like really thinking about this I'm like well you know hopefully I would be professional enough to you know game you know keep my composure and know that I'm with this dude's ass tomorrow and he was like huh like just being a smartass something's iconic so you didn't mean to tell me you never been choked up and then dawned on me I was like are you talking about when you brought yourself proclaimed hype man in and scratch my my neck with his little bitch now he's like no no I was like hey Dominic I said what happened in the fight I said I danced all around you and beat your ass made you look like before I said sit behind doesn't shut up and then it was like this is it go on Scott just loves a private conversation private goes black screen the producers come on like we're sorry how Dominic was acting like like I don't mind coming on here and doing this shit but I the first thing I said hey Dominic how are you and I was all just waiting for Dominic to say hi and you start off there he goes I gotta say Heidi I'm talking to you in a couple minutes and I was like oh what the fuck you guys are probably gonna fight again if DOM stays in the game yeah so we had to redo the whole situation you know I was like yeah that's cool so I wanted to rematch with them so honestly TJ should thank Dom for not taking the rematch and finally getting his shot so that's right after the fights at EJ what's wrong I'm doing these days you know I know he has Planet got some serious issues with his feet because he came back real quick after the knee surgery and maybe pushed it a little too hard that's a that's a tough one I mean that's why his feet were all taped up you do a commentary yeah probably getting decent money for that I talked to his coach they're gonna try to get you know we wouldn't we in the winter wasn't scheduled but he was trying to fight on the same car tour around about so it keeps hitting that transition who do you think would be a good fight for him to fight for Dominick it's good question what about last year very very good fight that's very good fight but I think doesn't he doesn't Jimmy have a fight he just beat the dude that you knocked out oh if I elevator yeah it was a very good fight that's right he beat Almeida but I feel like he has another fight lined up maybe I'm wrong maybe was down I'm thinking of well the day before the fight like height before the fight is always so interesting man see how people react see with her heads at like when Connor came out with a hard-on against Floyd what is he doing is he fucking where the rubberband around his dick the balls just to get it hard before he gets out there couple shakes before that's all this fucking dick was half hard but he's standing there and that's just what it looks like when it's limp but it literally looked like it was half hard when he's standing there at the weigh-ins yeah that that's a like a no I know I've seen a couple of guys I think Miguel Dixit weighing a couple other guys that had that same thing I think it's like an involuntary thing that happens when you're like hungry or something I don't know tell you what I'm hungry like a survival we have to go we had to get real creative on the Physical Anthropology of why you get a hard-on when your back is about to get in a confrontation maybe you're gonna fight over a female out the nature and I can make it just was such a weird probably once things confrontation - with Connor screaming yelling armor for just standing there literally like not a worry in the world it was interesting how Floyd handled it yeah he didn't have a worry in the world we're seeing that the guy he's composed yeah yeah he's so composed 15 oh man 15 oh you know I said that he was the only ever reach that and break that record but apparently there's some another guy that have fought and I'm like a really light weight that made 51 and oh oh really yeah that I didn't even know I thought they're talking about what's the Rocky Marciano I was thought that was the record Chavez it wasn't he like up there before he got defeated - good question but he didn't retire with a that retirement question yeah Ricardo Lopez yeah I think what weight was he does it's a light flyweight yeah what is that what is light flyweight meet him away Jesus minimum weight what the fuck is minimum weight but Ricardo Lopez he believed he retired at 51 and oh oh he retired somewhere around that range does it say yeah oh we had to draw 51 wins 0 losses in one drop ok the wind drop yeah the one draws the it's so funny that people worry about that shit it's so weird oh yeah that's one thing about MMA fighters as opposed to boxers like with a boxer who was always undefeated record that was like that's such a big selling point in the in the universe 3 yeah I guess it makes sense though because I mean you're trying to make a case that no one could you know show something intriguing about something that could not no one could ever beat this person but the difference between MMA and boxing those and MMA you're tested way more yeah up to the title and you're fighting world-class fighters pretty quickly as soon as you start getting because II really whereas in boxing you're taking care of your Brecker gets patted and you slowly worked up to a world-class fighter if you have a good manager maybe 15 the 20 fights and you're trying to maybe start writing some okay people you know especially with your knee getting do you think that's the way to do it not know with those guys know because a lot of those boxers have had 3 400 amateur fights not like they don't need groomed into that maybe to get out of the the shoe-shining amateur style but Amber's house switching know what the heck you're getting taken away it's more you know it's it's setup and the point system how it's changing yeah with the Olympics you know taking the headgear off and how they're changing all that so they're coming more professional setting stuff up not that you know pitter patter shoes shoeshine you know that's how it's been but I don't think they need to be be like that but I think in boxing is a huge records you know years 37 oh it's 28 knock it's a weird gig I mean I guess the difference with with with the UFC is UFC has always had a reputation of putting the best fighters against the best fighters which I think has gone away a little bit I mean they still make sure you got tested do you think it's gone away I don't think it's gone away I think what they try to do is have even matchups because there's like like a Ricci and uh and and what's the name who's fighting Alvarez for example they just want to see that fight and they're both very tough guys it could be bet you know champion and uhm yeah just yeah but they want to see mattress but they do that all the way down like they're not gonna they're not trying to set up mismatches right they're they're trying to get it more evenly matched but that doesn't mean that there aren't guys that they could set up with mismatches within the within the thing is what you want to clearly see a guy get a tuneup fight we're in boxing it's a big deal rock scene guys get tune-up fights and you even call them a tune-up fight yeah it's gay tune-up fight before the big match yeah you know and they go in there and they fight a guy that's not expected to win and then they get set up for the next fight but it Tunes them up get some sharp and then they have the world championship fight I mean that happens to get into the UFC a lot though yeah a lot for me I have over half of my professional fights are in the UFC I signed a five and oh and you know so I have my fights have been in the UFC against you know UFC obviously you can say the premier organization with the toughest fighters it's not even close but it's getting close now you know when you look at what Bellator is doing right right now the it's UFC is always gonna be the top of the food chain it's always like the the premier organization as far as the public knows hey but as far as the quality of talent Bellator at least finally has Rory MacDonald you know they finally have all that they're growing around yeah also they are as well yeah you're right but I mean getting you know kr Mousasi world-class guys like legitimately with pay yeah I mean Rory has a victory over tyron woodley and a victory over Demian Maia so he had a victory over the one in number two guys that's interesting you just mentioned Rory go back to we're talking about with training Rory I mean that's a guy who he's a strange character and like I wonder what goes on is what's his motivation for fighting and what started him etc but I saw him do a an interview about his trainings that come like I talked about coaches making you do shit just and you're just like do whatever the coach says he was like look I've been doing what all the coaches say he's like I'm gonna keep getting hurt I keep doing this and that he goes I'm gonna take things into my own hands a little bit more you know he's the guy that did that but he's having a lot of friggin success yeah dude he looked like a fucking world killer when he beat Paul daylily yeah you look perfect Paul Savage - yes that's gonna be an interesting fight Paul de Leeuw lorenz larkin oh yeah style super sidekicks yeah longer than UFC nope no ends lorenz larkin just fought Douglas Leeman for the title he lost a five round decision very close fight very good fight dr. Salim is another one that guys world-class I mean he's he's right up there with anybody in the world at 170 in my opinion okay he's been around for a while - yeah yeah you know what pisses me off is Ben Askren still fighting over in one Fc like Jesus Christ I am the number one hatred saying yes out of his retirement fight that's it drives me crazy should have been though UFC a long time ago I always wanted to see that guy pissed off Dana this style was weird right the style was weird that's one thing but pissing off Dana was ultimately the end at all I mean he was talking some serious [Music] Yeah right here it's too bad really bad how he mixed up with those guys fuck you I would have loved to see that guy fight the best in the world in the UFC you know and we'll never know now it's really unfortunate yeah he made some decent money over there I want to see I hope he did I hope he did he's just a fucking phenomenal grappler man I mean here's a perfect example that guy destroyed Larkin on the ground or it's not locked in Lima destroyed him on the ground yeah destroyed core stuff on the ground just a bit manhandled those dudes got a hole those guys was rag dolling fools just throwing them around like that unorthodox weird wrestling style I would I wanted to see him fight the best fuck yeah you know who'd have been a he'd have been a terrible matchup for is Georges st. Pierre hmm George always so he starts hitting his nice little shots but he always ends up getting the nice takedown man how was he gonna do in grappling it's a score that would've been a good one awesome and I always wanted to see to well you know that got him in trouble with Johnny Hendrix right but Johnny Hendrix is a different Johnny Hendrix back then yeah interesting Priya Sato huh dude you saw this agent lives bro aye-aye-aye stick that's that's one of the thing that makes me want to get back into it is now that you saw it isn't there I still have you saw to test me just in case there's an opportunity that pops up because I really yeah they pop in all the time seems like you weigh about a buck 60 right now well a buck 60 do you think he'll come and he does practices with us and shit who always give him a hard time like I still got it he's yeah he's yeah I think you retired are you like kind of retard mom mostly retired I'm retired I I'm I'm definitely retired but I'm not I first off I loved the fight that's the hard thing about retiring is it takes so much time energy and there's so much to learn that I'm definitely a better fighter when I retired then I then I was when I was like you know it's not a crime even yeah as far as skill set goes right but like there's a lot of skilled guys out there and it's just like a focus thing and a motivation thing like so you wished you thought it was there the entire career oh god are you kidding me hell you ever feel any temptation when you knew that so many guys were using shit I had I had a couple people sit down and try to talk me into it before they tried to talk you into just like hey you know like everybody acknowledged somebody talking about and I had a coach a long time ago that was like hey everybody and I'm like no I don't think so III take a lot of pride in the fact that I had my career and I didn't I'm like oblivious I'm like like you know like when you're not in the circle you're definitely not in the circle yeah they don't tell you about what I don't want to tell you you know everything else so I I think a lot of pride in the fact that and I and I'm you know teaching my guys that's one of the conversations I had with Kody I'm like bro no we don't need any of that shit dude that's all mental it's a mental thing the problem is the difference is when you have someone that strong mentally that is like a scientist on himself and also has all the attributes then it matters right right when you get a guy with math class fighter and then on top of that they take some shit and then I yeah has the mentality right that everybody's doing it mentality is what allows like champions to do it as well right this champion never did it congratulations thanks beautiful I mean all right gents let's wrap this bitch up right good luck man can't wait to see you master Square Garden that's November 4th November 4th that's a big fucking you anyway there's a historic venue man that's gonna be amazing fire where I favor you right favors ultimate fitness Sacramento California arrived favor on Twitter and Instagram and Cody you're you're on Twitter and Instagram thank you gentlemen it's a lot of fun and thank you all right yes [Music]
