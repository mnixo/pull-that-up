the Joe Rogan experience hey did you see tiger yesterday dude I was watching it while we were in Georgia we were in Georgia for the UFC right and I had a comedy show out there and we were me and Santino or watching it on the screen on Saturday yes we watched it Friday or was a friar Saturday Saturday so Friday Saturday anyone yesterday well whatever days it was right I think we watched it two days in a row it was in the gym every day we were there but then I got home when I saw it on my phone I was like holy shit I don't even give a fuck about golf I know it was big powerful I made a comeback a huge comeback that I mean that's amazing 11 years later oh my god great somebody put on Instagram one of my quotes oh yeah and I attached to that it was pretty cool that I love a guy get like I love what I say I love a success story but even more than that I love a guy fucks his life up and then gets it back together again story it's the greatest yeah it's the greatest how much most good must feel to that guy the world again and then he like yeah was so messed up and then the back problems and troubles and the kids and the wife and the thing in just 11 years yeah and he didn't stop working he just went to work and went to work and went to where easy 11 years later and so he won a major championship recently right did anyone win one it was a big deal he won a major championship within the last it wasn't a major but it was it was a major this this was the first major he's won in 11 years okay so the other one wasn't a major but it was a big event yeah it was absurd he wins that whenever as I Wow he might be back he can he could fucking win big tournaments again and then he just oh it was so cool to see the crowd just kept building over the weekend and by yesterday it was massive thousands of people around the greens isn't hanging on him ah the relief that you saw just coming out of him was so great and at the end like he walks off where as a kid he was only like 21 when he won the first time hugging his dad mm-hm at the edge yeah and now he comes off 11 years later all this time his dad's past and he's hugging his child his son now he's the father in the same spot I was just I was trying not to cry the whole time maybe or this guy or the guys like louis c.k who's selling out everywhere and doing great comedy like he can't he could sell out fucking staples center right now multiple times in a row what's crazy is he doesn't want to doesn't wanna it's just doing comedy clubs just working yeah he could easily come back like Tiger Woods easily right now he said something so fucked up do because they asked me why I did it he goes I like to jerk off and I don't want to be alone I like to jerk off and I don't like to be alone like and then you know he's great man yeah I mean he LC did some creepy shit definitely did did some creepy shit I drove of it but he then molested anyone I don't think we know exactly what happened either I can't say too much because I don't know but I think he did some regrettable things and I think he would admit that but I don't think he did what a lot of people are claiming he did in terms of that's when I heard how often he did it or who he did her with the circumstances were but it was either way there's no defending when it was bad no it's not good there's no it's a terrible thing to do but what's the punishment for that you know did he not pay for it he lost all his jobs lost all his TV deals 35 million dollars in a year of work and people still were say no but he's still he's fine I've heard that argument that he's fine like what these are also these are also things that he did like more than a decade ago right what when do you offer someone compassion like when do you when do you let some explain themselves when do you when is enough is enough or should he have to do something like what would people like someone to do well I think they're mad because something because there's only a year and then he's back and killing it because he's so good at comedy cuz like what Tiger was right people hated Tiger well there was that but there was also the material that got leaked when he came back so people are upset at the jokes the Klan joke yeah but the rest its if that shit falls in line with how he's always done jokes though no he's always whether he did this or not he says the fucked up thing to say it's part of what makes him really funny and he does that in real life too it's not it's a style of comedy man I mean it's just like a Quentin Tarantino has a style of making movies his style of comedy is to say fucked up things so that compounded the fact that people are upset at him that a year ago you know he just said he was going to take some time off it's um I don't you know I think it's really important to know that I don't know what happened and in you know he knows and they know and it's it's never good when someone's upset the jerked off in front of them like that miss not a good time for anybody but also him losing thirty five million dollars and only being out a year I think people are upset that it was such a quick turnaround like it would TJ it's not a quick turnaround man I mean not as a comic but for to the normal person like a year that ain't shit dude cuz that's my natural ink scene you know you're getting interviewed and some fucking idiot comes here and cuts your any of y'all well you should get punches slapped upside your head you know that'll teach you respect not to do it and nobody else again I should immediately done it but I didn't I answer this question but lightning maybe maybe not he goes on to say shut up I have to I can't take that my daughter might be watching this interview I've been telling her stand up to bullies your whole life don't go running to somebody in town so I was picking on me handle it yourself that's what's wrong with this country I think with this whole somebody picks on you go to somebody else I'm not gonna tell authorities this hooligans picking on me I'm gonna handle it myself you know cuz I'm gonna see him again he's gonna think he could pick on me got a handle in myself you know I'm in my any of you man you're gonna steal my moment I just worked out here just music but out here you barely want a split decision in your own country I knock this dude out and you're trying to steal my shine like this that that's what I'm saying I mean and then he got famous off there which I hate so only thing I could take back about that night that it wasn't filmed that him filmed it it'd be even better you know he was just gone off in sinus you know neon got his ass I think it helped you to know did it help me able to helped him more than anything no it helps is people know who these people knows mas Vidal doesn't take any shit people known that since hey nobody's before rainbows have color they're ready knew that man they didn't they didn't need to see me whipping this like I see they like to see it they like to get remembered ah yeah they like to see people have consequences for shit talking in this weird era of constant shit talking you know I think people enjoy it they like it and if you guys ever fight it makes it a bigger fight for sure my gosh man let me guess but does that like I beat number three I've been in this sport for a while been beating up guys would that validate him to fight me one beat in the top-10 guy you know still yet to be the top-10 guy you know like but he could get that fight off that that that's a new age in era that right right that's a concern yeah that's a concern I'll fight when he's when he's beating the top-10 guy I'm gonna be the first guy to expose him to break his face but until that moment comes you're talking about the business side cuz you already saw on the personal side any day of the week I will address you but on the business side get to my level but he put in the fucking work will be the top ten guy knock him the fuck out did you worry at all about getting in trouble for punching someone in another country I was scared out of my fucking life Joe that's what I'm thinking I was scared I thought this guy was gonna kill me man I might have not looked it but I was scared out on my life yeah I get it I'm very cold blooded you know I get that from from genetics from my pops in them but I was scared out of my mind I thought this guy was gonna take everything I have you know you had to do that I had to defend it I understand but did you worry at all about them arresting you or any weird shit like that over there at me or nothing I wanted to press charges ah that's how scared I was but I'm in charge because I understand my man yeah but that's not five so you were in danger I was fuckin head of in danger and did you not see it was not just one assailant him and his crew of hooligans you know I lawless people I had to defend myself I did everything in my right to defend myself was one against like three or four dudes and they know it at some video there's no such thing as a perfectly fair competition that would be designed by God to be per effect and be perfectly fair right we're always making choices about what kind of competition we want to have and who we want to allow into it and what sort of outcome we want to have you know what I mean right just like in baseball too many home runs move the mound up or down you know how they change the rules a little bit can they want more home runs same thing with same thing with track and field we change the rules a little bit to allow this person to not allow this person right I think that when we're talking about people we should always try to include more people not less we should you know like if and if hey if you're a double amputee and you can get your way into the Olympics oh you can make a plausible case I think we should try to entertain that notion and we should try to find a way to get that guy in there right as far as trans athletes go you know we could have we could sit here and talk for three hours about like all the different ways that hormones might affect your body might not affect your body and I'm not an expert on that and I don't want to claim to be right but a sports with trans athletes who are you know competing with the you know with their gender right that's that is a sporting world that I'm more interested in right and I think we should find a way to make that happen I know it's gonna be really complicated complicated and messy right and there's gonna be a lot debate about it and it's gonna make it's gonna be uncomfortable you know there's gonna be a lot of arguments but you know I hope that that's the world that we have moved forward to that's my that's my point of view my point of view is that there's a reason there's a distinction there's a reason why we make the distinction to have male athletics versus female athletic s-- the reason is that males have a physiological physiological advantage over women so in most sports most physical sports we do not have males compete with females the question becomes when someone who is male transitions and becomes female do those same physiological advantages apply and what what are they what is the evidence well the evidence and competition seems to be that it shows that it does apply particularly in weightlifting rugby mountain biking power heavy sports that are that favored larger people stronger bodies males that transition to females have a significant advantage in their breaking World Records so if you're a woman and you're a natural woman and you don't take any extra hormones or male hormones you taking steroids or any sort of performance-enhancing drugs you're doing your very best to compete and you're at the top of the heap but then someone comes along that was a man for 30 years and decides they're going to be a woman and this has happened and literally transitioned a few months ago and competes as a woman and destroys records and dominates you in that sport that's bullshit and that's not competing on a level playing field that's a person who's biologically a male and who is a male for 30 plus years of having testosterone run through their body and affect their tendon strength and affect the shape of their bones and the mechanical advantages of the male hips versus the female hips and then they're competing with smaller people who have been a woman their whole life it's not fair it's it's as much cheating as taking steroids when the other person doesn't or taking performance-enhancing drugs when the other person doesn't maybe even more so maybe even more so because you also have there's a bunch of advantages in terms of reaction time that males enjoy it's like it's some significant difference in reaction time between males and even untrained males versus female professional athletes but I see at the beginning of my guys call it career like I used to not prepare at all I was still drinking using a guy up on stage I chopped shit up I'd get into confrontation when I say chops you up I'd take up animals shit part animal parts I've got from butchers like like a skull we've all meat and stuff and sinew on it chop it up for anyone's release locusts get into confrontations of like so yeah exactly the reaction you're having is direction they were having like I was the front row would I had like two fights I've got scars on my body from Bad stand-up gigs from a time where I go to a confrontation like I was making a point about pedophilia saying oh we're all one cultural mind so when a particular Peter file is transgressed against a child were all responsible fuck well that's how you know I've still got the scar on my leg that happened the Edinburgh in Scotland people didn't take it well what I was trying to do was like create I didn't have the skills the chops the experience than you know so is so under equipped but like what I was trying to do was create environments that felt much better at doing that now I can create a kind of an uncertainty in a room a kind of a sense of chaos and what's happening and then bring it back you know I hope to a humorous conclusion where people feel safe and amused and all of that kind of stuff now I think it's you you cut like because I did cry and do that in comedy clubs and yeah it was conversation it's not what people want so don't you think that by prepping your stand-up in those [Applause]
