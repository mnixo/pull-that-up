the Joe Rogan experience what were you saying before the podcast started you were gonna bring it up again about veganism coming from a religion yeah veganism started with the seventh Adventist Church I believe so there was a you know a group of people that had a church and the guy that led the church as part of the the church was like you know they were following the Jewish kosher laws or whatever at first and it was like no pigs or whatever else shellfish I think no pigs or shellfish and then the guy just said and like it just sort of took it to a next level and said like no no meat no animal products at all and so these people that were in this church were like the first real group of vegans the church of seventh Adventist I think is what it's called is where it came from like 1863 is when that like movement I guess started everybody I'd started early I'm sure people were doing it earlier they're not obviously but I think that that's where the the roots came in and I just find that really interesting because it you know it does seem like a religion it seems like they it seems like a lot of times you get I get called out a lot on Instagram and stuff like that from people that are vegan saying like I can't believe you do this and blah blah but I would never go on their page and say anything to them at all well so they're proselytizing I mean that's that's a big part of this whole community is its there's a moral high ground they stand on it and then a lot of these people especially people with vegan in their name and their screen name there was go after people yeah and they try to shame people and what they're doing is in in many ways is a very good thing they're not participating in factory farming right they're not participating in the horrors that we see these fucking PETA videos where you see cows and pigs and chickens are just being tortured all that fuck that is disgusting and that should be eliminated and shouldn't be a part of modern culture but in terms of like the humane raising and killing of animals look they're not gonna live forever and I don't care what you say I'm not into animal suffering I don't think they should suffer but if you try to say the people are not herbivores or that people are herbivores rather and then we're not omnivores you're crazy it's just not true it's not fact and they show picture these are not the teeth of carnivore these energy that we're back or stupid or omnivores they show you a chest and everything we look real similar in our teeth to fucking chimps and chimps are omnivores and the human diet is a very complex thing when you attach that human diet to ideology then it gets really screw it because you're not dealing you're not dealing with people that are being honest about dietary like what is really important and for our dietary requirements how your body functions what the studies show if you look at it objectively the objective the first thing anybody should say first thing across the board get rid all the fucking sugar that's number one yeah get rid all the refined carbohydrates eat more vegetables I think you guys don't eat more vegetables eat healthy fats get some form of omega fatty acids recognize that the omega fatty acids you get from flaxseed oil are not as bioavailable it's fact from studies not as bioavailable as it make of fatty acids you get from fish and meat yeah just not the meat the protein you see well broccoli has 15 boobs it's not as bioavailable you fucks and you know it's not it's just not yeah so you can get bioavailable protein from plants you get it from hemp you get it from quinoa you get it from peas pea proteins very good but it's not as good as the the protein that you get from meat it's just not that's a high right but Noah you never saw a hunchback from the bottom right like lower back we can make that like a lumbar pad lumberjack yeah yeah sleeps all night and it works all day like if you look at Roy Nelson he's like the size of a really good middleweight ya know he is yeah but meanwhile the guy knocked out Cheick Kongo knocked our Brendan Schaub knocked out some big fucking heavyweights yeah knocked out Mitrione I mean fucking bad not a lot of people yeah yeah sniffles Trouville right oh so did you knock out so I think it was I do not remember that fight um and the worst thing is it's what is right and so you would think that people gonna help the left up yeah but somehow he connects anyway it's like wound up with their arm bars yeah no you know it's gonna happen you can stop it no almost knocked out over him remember that yeah yeah he heard over him yep Stefan's true BAM Jesus Christ crazy yeah I mean Roy's like six feet tall Stefan Struve seven feet tall yeah I mean fucking animal Roy's an animal and honestly I mean look at his gut right there how much is that it weighs about 250 right he's he I'm not bullshitting yeah they're I guess he is 50 pounds overweight and he's a world-class athlete I mean you cannot say that Roy Nelson is on a world-class fighter there's no way a world-class fighter and he's 50 pounds overweight so you drop down 50 pounds now you're 200 pounds you make 85 you cut weight everybody does that cut 15 pounds you're 85 you're world champion you know there's no butter bean you know we were somewhere an Atlantic Commissioner told me from all the boxes on the card he had actually the best blood pressure and cholesterol for real he said we were a shock that the guy is in a phenomenal shape yeah that's insane Butterbean made him look like Yair Rodriguez look at him Jesus Christ actually looks guy here is the whole family look exactly like that I here go upper right hand corner yeah that's what he looks like for news that it's worse meanwhile he's another guy knocked dudes dead man he is so funny at such a good time with him and there was a Prince George in Kennedy he was there he's a player very funny guy that's funny you know he's a fucking hell of a kook apparently you can't tell but it like watched a video of butter bean cooking some ribs and I was like damn that looks legit like yes smoker he was cooking him in a smoker he broke the rule though don't get high of your own supply Jaime was watching the video of dr. Berg how did it go he should know the I he dad what had to go again today yeah and I was watching right before you got here in this I don't know where she was from but she was saying like you're the CEO of this company and you should know some of these answers and she was like listing all the shit he didn't know yeah yeah I was like this is ridiculous night afterwards now they've shown which I guess it's part of now public information his notes oh no that he had like as references that he was looking at I've only seen one picture of it mm-hmm just very weird stuff that like seems blatantly obvious that he should know or should say that's different from what we maybe we think we should yeah I think they should be able to tell it I get the impression that this company grew so fast that they don't even know what the fuck is going on in oh well that was the other thing he was talking about their influence on possible continue he was talking about his influence on all these different upcoming elections that were coming up and about how they wanted to make sure that there was no BOTS that were influencing these elections and I stopped and thought about it I'm like oh my god in that moment of him saying that I realized like what pressure he must be under what pressure that company is under there they went from being a thing where people could share pictures like of hey this is us on our summer vacation like hey you know fucking we're gonna go to the pub on Friday that's what Facebook kind of was right people would talk about certain things in the news they would have opinions you put up something a bunch of people comment on it that's what it was now with this last election and with him testifying in front of Congress what I'm seeing is Facebook being like one of the most important sources of influence in the world today and it's not really being completely managed oh I feel like the Russians the Russians yeah maybe there's a little bit like Google needs to be looked into what's going on Mike so we'll go also probably like they have a data I think someone was just looking into this you know people downloaded their Facebook profile and they're like my files one gigabyte well how much data is in here right people found out a way to download theirs and find their information what what does Facebook know about me well apparently there's also one that Google has on everyone and it's much larger oh I'm not shocked I don't know there's there's and here's the thing that it is an endless cycle yeah I mean we just don't have that next unacceptable word right you know like everybody knows I think a lot of people know that as far as somebody who's doesn't have is developmentally disabled retarded was kind of the moat the latest term that was once acceptable is clearly not now I mean that is kind of the point but before that you know moron was a medical term was it yeah mongoloid idiot was what they used to call Down syndrome children that was like hundred years ago on the birth certificate right but I'm saying you know people who are saying you know just to stop saying Rick they're not wrong that you know but there is also another word down the pipeline right there's something else is coming yeah that's gonna be a medical word or term and then that'll be used to insult people but that's the way people use language like once we identify this is the word people use to label someone with a developmental disability people in the slang will grow from that yeah people will start using that well what's interesting to me is that when we're talking about words you're not going to change the way people think so words are supposed to convey intent yes supposed to be sounds that we all agree mean a certain thing and the more depth the more access to words you have the more you can sort of flavor your conversation so I understand what you're saying like if you're saying this guy I kind of get it but you feel like this fucking guy yeah I'm like well Tommy's really mad yeah you know I mean that and to take that out yeah it's like I don't know exist so sometimes you take those things out when you're like on a television show or something like that but all television shows because of that all censored television shows only exists within a certain band yes a certain frequency they never get out of that like the Joey Diaz frequency is like ah oof yeah there's no fence ah true this this frequency that you get on like late-night talk shows our sitcom this very narrow band that that there's no cunts in that band there's no you motherfucker this all those things are not in there which is what you're all of it I feel like whenever you're for me when I'm watching something like that part of my brains always like go find a motherfucker somewhere and I was like kind of wanted [Applause]
