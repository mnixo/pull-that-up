this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is a bonus episode we had no idea we were even going to be able to do this as recently as yesterday you fucks okay we're making it happen so the only sponsor is on it comets oh and an IT used the codename Brogan save yourself ten percent off any and all supplements shortest commercial ever cue the music Justin the Viking Ren is in the house to tell us about some amazing adventures it's gonna be educational enriching good for the soul experience Justin Ren first of all thanks for doing this I'm so glad we could fit you in I was I was a little worried we weren't gonna be able to get you before you got back to the Congo cuz you're on this kind of a whirlwind thing you know you have your back in LA or for only like a few days right actually I head out to Vegas after this and then I'm driving there and I fly out tomorrow for those who don't know Justin was a contestant on The Ultimate Fighter is a mixed martial arts fighter and the heavyweight division for the UFC and then I started reading some stuff I think the first thing I read about it was on the underground which is mixed martial arts calm it says great website that we both belong to it's probably the best mixed martial arts message board in the country in the world really and there was a thread where it was talking about you going over there and helping people in the Congo and working with these pygmies this had become something you were really really devoted to and I was like wow like who saw that come and like check this guy out I saw a picture of you before that with a pig that you had killed with a knife over your shoulder you know I'm like guys a fucking savage he's got a pig over his shoulder yeah there's a picture of you with this with this wild hog over your shoulder I'm like I'm a party with Justin Ren and the next thing you know you go from there and you're you're mixed martial arts fighter hog killer pygmy saver I mean you're over there helping all these people in the Congo how did all this get started man I just heard about how much they were suffering and I had no clue like I fighting I wanted to fight against people you know and I wanted my dreams my everything and then when I heard about the pygmies I just heard the suffering that they were going through I heard that they felt forgotten heard that they were enslaved I heard that the four out of ten is the smallest at that you can find four out of ten of their children died before age five and so for me I was just like man that's brutal and I knew that they were not given citizenship in their own country and so I just went there to just learn and see and sit with them live with them sit around the campfire that's where I've learned most whenever the slave masters aren't around whenever whenever those guys are asleep then they'll really open up and tell you what everything's happened and so it's just a ton of suffering that's how I went over there just went with a burden to find out what was going on could you put that a little closer - yes absolutely what did how did you find out about it at first what was the what what mean what led you to this uh I had a buddy that was having a plan to go to the Congo and he was going all by himself and I mean just completely utterly alone and it was like the worst conflict zone on the planet and heard about what he was doing heard about what was happening with the pygmies and heard his wife was a little worried that he was going and I just was looking for something with purpose and passion and I felt like I could be passionate about fighting for people and so I went with him and heard all the terrible stuff that was going on and we went there to see what we could do to help wow that's so inspiring and for folks who haven't seen it there's a video that Justin did that's gone viral and this has really brought a lot of attention to your cause and and what you're doing there's a video of you with these young pygmy children that are is this the first time they're seeing a white man to preface the video this is actually not the pygmies the video it's actually the band - and the band - are the tribe that's actually enslaving the pygmies all right and so it was yeah it was around some of the pygmies but this was the least remote location like you'll see that there wasn't many trees where I went was 85 kilometers deep in the jungle where you couldn't even see the sky because the canopy of the rainforest is so tall and so this was the band two people and the band two people are ones that enslave them it was actually a gift because I don't that video to me is a real gift it shows me even though I hated their parents you know you can't even see that in the video that I actually would just had a hatred in my heart towards the parents of these kids but yeah so that was brutal because on the ug also I posted a video there were actually a thread about how I buried a one and a half year old in the Congo and his name was Andy buh and so this video that's playing right now you can't even tell that they were uh that that their parents are responsible for the grave that I dug I think two days before that video so these are the boon to people's band to be a in T you and the band to people are enslaving the pygmies and this has been going on for how long it's actually rather recent I mean there's been types of it for hundreds of years but uh they have different kinds of slavery within the pygmies there's ones that they're held to gunpoint there's by the rebels and the gold and coltan and diamond mines and then there's other ones where they're they're in shackles but then the ones that we've actually I didn't get to say that yet but we've actually set some slaves free some pygmy slaves that were from the bantu and we negotiated with a band two people who go up and they buy up the land from underneath the pygmies pygmies don't have a way to make any monetary gain they don't get paid anything and money they get paid sometimes corn sometimes bags of salt sometimes bars of soap like a bar of soap for two days of work they might get a bar of soap to bathe with and so yeah the band two people are the ones that are enslaving them that we're actually negotiating with them to freedom Wow what a crazy environment that must be the Congo itself not being able to see the sky and having all this insane conflict going on underneath the canopy of these trees also primitive dealing with things like slavery yeah and forcing people what's really crazy is forcing people to work in the mines to create the very things that we need to power our most technologically advanced pieces of electronics like these laptops yeah that coltan right yeah coltan I think 80 to 90 percent of it is found in the Congo so it's only found in two places in the world 80 to 90 percent of it's the Congo a hundred percent of its rebel owned there's not a legit mine and so that's insane most of its pygmy slave mined a hundred percent of it is rebel off from the Congo yes the Democratic Republic of Congo all of it is rebel owned so there is no Karma free cellphones electronics no no not smartphones not Mac's not flat-screen TVs so I mean I support it even I have the Apple products iPad iPhone everything whoa bizarre fascinating sort of a statement on humanity that is yeah it's actually pretty crazy man because I had some pygmies come one time and give me some coltan I didn't know what it was though at the time I didn't know I knew that there's gold in diamond mines there and that they were slaves in those but I had no clue what coltan was and that was after my first trip but they'd actually put some Colt in my hands and I was holding it and they were really excited to give it to me you know this is why they're slaves and and and so they thought I'd be a static and so I'm having to ask my translator like what like what is the stuff they're handing me I didn't know if it was like rough diamonds or if deep inside there there was gold or what it was but it was coltan what does it look like it's like this black dark mineral it's almost some of it almost looks like a crystal or I don't know if you can throw like a picture almost like coal yeah almost like coal it's it's long and jaggedy it's kind of a I don't know you know those like crystals that you can you used to be able to buy like better oh yeah long like that there'd be a black one of those almost and sometimes it has more of a coal like charcoal kind of feature to it and it's it's heavy but it's it's a great conduit for electricity and that's why we're using in all our smartphones and and that's why they're slaves but I wasn't excited about it I didn't know what it was and I but for them you know the hell think how crazy that is that's why they're slaves yeah and I don't even know what it is yeah and they're just a static - give it to me and then while it's a huge source I mean you needed all over the world yeah and most people are completely ignorant to what it is in a set especially where it comes from right yeah it's very bizarre like I had explained that to someone when they were talking about how much better it is to have an electric car and I'm like do you understand that that car is filled with conflict minerals yeah like it's not that simple it's not as simple as like you're good in the guy with the gas guzzlers bad like no there's a lot of fuckery in creation of your car batteries like lithium-ion that's another reason why we're in Afghanistan there's a lithium stores there's trillions of dollars of lithium in Afghanistan and that's what you need for lithium ion batteries yeah yeah it's a man it's insane I I can't even I don't mean I know we have two hours but I don't even know if I could get into some of the stuff I know that Shane from vice has been on here and someone was singing someone else on tomorrow is he really yeah man I wish I could meet that dude he's a cool guy you want to meet him if he could say - till tomorrow you can meet him all right we'll have to see about my plane back yeah he'd be happy to meet you yeah he's a big coolest motherfucker on earth I think he's awesome yeah he's a great guy he's super easy to talk to - just really like down-to-earth he goes to some of the craziest places oh yeah oh yeah he's returning back and forth you know I wonder what he think about me going for a full year just I know that he said it was a crazy time going there and and I just would want to pick his brain what part he went to is that what you know now you're about to go for a year for a full year yeah I'm gonna go for a full year and I'm partnering with the oldest university in the Congo and they have been working on this project for seven years and we kind of just linked up together to where our visions just are kind of the same we want to free these people and give them a sustainable ways of life so I'm one of my best friends now was born and raised in the Congo was educated got his doctorate in Australia but then he came back to the Congo and he's the Dean of the school of Community Development so he teaches some different ways of agriculture water wells all these kinds of things so he's actually setting them free and that's what we did in September we saw 60 slaves be set free put on thirty acres of land and get a water well now it's doubled now since I've been back here it's been 120 slaves that free men women and children put on 60 acres of land and then now you know we were wanting to find a way we think that me go in there for a year and if we were able to fundraise fifty thousand dollars so we could find a thousand people at 50 bucks thousand people fifty bucks that's a thousand slaves freedom and it would it's it's a nuts amount of stuff that that would do how many people are slaves right now there well the pygmies in the Democratic Republic of Congo there's a few different it's hard for them to do a census you know I mean these are hunters and gatherers and nomads and slaves and then in dangerous areas and then really remote area so there's a few different censuses and that they've tried to do the lowest I've seen is three hundred thousand pygmies and then another I've seen is six hundred thousand and pygmy actually literally translated means elbow height so I mean they're smaller than everybody else it's almost like they're just the worst bullying victims that have ever been so the average men's height is four foot seven so are they in any way like have you ever seen any of that stuff on the The Hobbit people from this island of how the remains they found now yeah they found remains of people that lived you know tens of thousands of years ago with with humans and they were the real tiny like almost people like things right it's really interesting when you see like some of them like the pygmies where you have like a whole race of them that are like really tiny like that it makes you wonder like how did that how that separate strain branch off way way way back in the day in the evolutionary chain of these these people being developed it's really odd yeah yeah I mean actually one of the one of the problems that they they have is that they're called half man half animal by the surrounding tribes and so that's one reason why I've met people that have been that their families members of other families have been victim of cannibalism and so yeah I've had pictures that Center guys of cannibalism they actually the surrounding tribes believe that if you can consume the flesh of a pygmy that you can gain superhuman strength I mean from taking the genitals off of small bullies and putting them under businesses it will bring you wealth from eating their flesh yeah the rebels believe that if you eat their flesh that you can what is it it makes you but not bulletproof but what is it whenever a bullet can just fly right through you so basically not invisible but you're impervious yeah so it just that's what they believe you teach children's genitals and they put them under a business yeah that's what they'll do to them and no uh think that that brings them many blessings it that some of the witch doctors have done that in Uganda but they do it in Congo the part of the Congo that I'm going to is it borders Rwanda and Uganda and so I'm right over the border and then in the jungle kind of boo Nia's where Shalom University is and then eighty five kilometers from there there's a part of the Congo called commander they say it differently than that but then we go from there deep into the jungle and where that is there's some different rebel groups that have that have done just brutal stuff there and that's some of their beliefs there's one place get so messed up that what's so new crazy man is they should be the richest country on the entire face of this planet they have every element on the periodic table every single one and uh and they have the most fertile soil they have gold diamonds now coltan with all this taken off they should really be the richest country there is and then all the corruption and everything just ruins it it's it's so it's so crazy the corruption is so nuts the warlords and the whole system that that they've got going on down there it's it's so it's so bizarre to look at you know the United States of America here in 2013 everything is and then realizes another part of the world that exists in the same time that is essentially living the way people lived thousands of years ago with guns though yeah absolutely and that's what's so crazy is the pygmies I actually have my grandpa's I've been accepted as family there now and my grandpa Jayla wha is his name Jay Lou WA and he gave me his bow so his pygmy bow and arrow that he's had for 34 years hold it in your hands it's actually pretty tiny man it's pretty tiny butt but in it it has all these things that are almost like a pygmy tally mark and it's all up and down at the top of the bow and the bottom of the bow on the inside and it's all the kills that he has of certain types of antelope and he gave me the I think I have like ten arrows five with like the metal on it and then four that are just straight wood that are sharpened and they have this like circular thing around the tip of it and I thought the ones that are metal would be the ones for the antelope because they look like they do more damage but it's actually the ones that don't have the metal on it that are just carved out of the wood that are the ones that go after the antelope because they dip the the tips of them in poison so it's poison dipped arrows and those are the ones that go after with the biggest ones and this the metal ones are more for like monkeys and small little pigs and things like that Wow so you're gonna go there and live with these people in like a tent made out of leaves yeah it's a twig year at Wigan Lee fuck man you should hold up what do people see the picture do you have it on your website or anything and did you send me those pictures yes and some of the pictures over yeah it's a twig leaf Hut and they they rebuild them basically every night every night well it depends on if it was raining the rain forest and then if it's if the wind is blowing I actually have pictures of I think like the widows and orphans that lived in one hut together we're just in the middle of the night it didn't even rain that night but the wind blew and their whole roof came off and so they have to go get the Leafs again and place them over banana leaves and different like those big elephant looking near Leafs right and so they just get those and they cover up in nine different villages I went to last time was there for a month and nine different villages I went to not one of them ever owned a blanket so they're just sleeping straight on the dirt man that's it and no blankets so no one's know just sleeping straight on the dirt Wow first time I went to one of those tribes was I saw the chief and I was putting up my tent and they about lost it and had a little air up mattress you know and I had a sleeping bag and I mean to them that was the ritz-carlton so I let the chief have it and I said the chief yes so I let him have that and I slept in his Hut and yeah and then psyched yeah he was me and they they all passed around the air up mattress and they're actually like holding it up above them almost like what crowd surfing like like crowd surfing out of concert but they're doing that with air mattress so everyone can feel it Wow so they've never had mattresses I mean this isn't like a new thing to them they've slept on dirt forever yeah I haven't come across one pygmy in the remote locations that have been - are there ever pygmies and other locations that have cities no no they're actually basically if they come to a city at all so yeah there we go that would be home sweet home for for a full year that's the kind of villages that I'm staying in and if you look in there I think on top of one of those huts there's like a few clothes and if they if a piggies had clothes they've been a slave so there's basically the only pygmies that are that yes so there's some of the clothes so obviously these ones were have been slaves and most of the ones I've ever been to have been slaves there's only been like one village I've been to where they were so remote that they still weren't enslaved and they could be hunters and gatherers but the deforestation with the trees falling that you could drive two Mac trucks through those are scaring all the animals away to where they basically can no longer live like hunters and gatherers because the animals just flee from all the trees falling so there is it loggers is that what it is it's loggers but it's also the guys that are like the band to the slave masters they can get the pygmies their slaves to go cut these trees down into pygmies trees are holy they believe that the ancestors of their yeah their ancestors live inside the trees become trees and they bury their dead inside holes inside of trees they find opening in it they'll put put their dead there and so they're having to cut down what they've lived in for thousands of years and then the rainforest preservationist and Wildlife conservationists they they push them out they'll buy up the land and they'll say pygmies aren't good for this and they'll kick them off the land and they'll buy up thousands and thousands of acres actually thousands where nation people do this yeah they'll kick the pygmies off so they're more interested in the trees than they are the pygmies absolutely Wow yeah I've heard from my family members in the pygmy tribe and when I say this like literally I have pygmy family that are more family to me than some of my family here in the US like someone crazy cousin who gets drunk yeah sure yeah there's some piggies I just love man that I love and uh and you speak their language I don't speak the language I speak some of it man but but not a lot and during that year there for my birthday coming up I'm gonna get rosetta stone I think and uh that's what I'm asking how could you not live there for a year you say you love these people what have they been talking shit about you the whole time and you learn pygmy and find out I'm the crazy uncle what is the language that they have like what is it called Oh it's like oh right it's not the clicking it's but it's close it's actually a tonal language a polyphonic actually there's there's some sweet videos I don't know if you guys want to pull any up button on YouTube there's a they do a thing that I love called the water drum and that actually isn't gonna be on my YouTube thing but you could look up pygmies water drum on YouTube and there's some sweet songs they'll have like seven to eight women inside the river and then they they each have a part to play and Wow and they just slap the water and it comes out the beautiful songs or they also have something called polyphonic singing where they each have a tone that they do and they actually some people call it the language of song and that's trying to think of that but their language sometimes they're joking around with each other getting into it and it sounds like they're kind of singing to one another Wow so that's the ones that are in the more roommate remote locations the ones that have been slaves for years and years and years they've started to learn to speak Swahili yeah there it is and you're not in it for just the boobs right is there a drum to that as well or is that all just the waters all the water yeah this is just three whenever they get like eight to ten in there I think it's about ten songs it's just where it take a pause wipe your eyes Wow they also have something called the tree drum they'll hollow out a tree and they'll get some harder sticks and I'll just beat the side of a tree and it's it's odd man it's sweet so what are you doing for food out there the last month I went I took about 40 to 50 power bars with me man my bag was so heavy cuz I took I took a supplement shop with me and but I mean they caterpillars I've eaten like I normally don't ask the different parts of it but um like whenever they do goat which actually pygmies only goat they believe that it has evil spirits inside it so even though goats are really easy to raise they won't eat a goat the hunters say that goat makes you weak in the knees and then the women just don't like the flavor of it and they all think that it they've seen it evil spirits come inside of them and so they don't eat goats did they see drag me to hell the gate becomes either the go comes evil remember that I never saw it but yeah and so they they eat the leat chicken though whatever they're slaves for I have a picture I think of uh of my buddy Harry and he we call him Harry because he's the only pygmy I've ever seen with facial hair that's why that video was so unique about me because I went over there it wasn't just like some guy from America that one giant white hairy dude that's why my buddies started calling me the great white Sasquatch they think about your tattoos oh yeah that that is crazy not to the pygmies the pygmies actually tattoo their faces sometimes the women I've come across a few of them that are more like traditional or remote those women still carve their teeth I don't know if you can do with that little they actually carve their teeth and it look makes them almost look more like a piranha to me it's not attractive but to the pygmy men it's a yeah the the pygmy men to hate blowjobs I hate I don't even want to be tagged those teeth good perfect you're my girl I don't know if you guys can find a picture of that but uh it's pretty pretty crazy-looking one of us my own there's a lot of strange things that Wow oh my god that African people do to customize their body the neck rings that's very strange the stretching of the lower lip it's the Surrey women do they put a plate in their lower lip one of the the Masai they do their big gauges in their ears yeah whenever they get so big that they they start flopping around I've actually been brought in to the so the pygmy tribe brought me in his family the Masai tribe had a ceremony and made me a warrior and they painted me red head to toe they gave me a spear that killed two lions Wow oh I've seen the mane of the lion that it killed the head warrior you know gave me my name which is mozuku Simba mas I'm Evan and that means though the white lion Masai warrior so I'm a part of the warrior class the Masai and whenever the wind blows with them and there was big gauges they'll just twist their earlobes and then wrap them around the top of their ear so it looks really funny but uh but that's just on a windy day so they killed Lions with Spears is it because the Lions are attacking them or just they just got to be gangster a little bit a little bit of both you know I think the younger guys go out there to impress the girls but to kill a fucking line with no way to show your dick ah the what is it the guys um oh the they they're those are Shepherds so the pygmies are hunter gathers but the Masai are shepherds and so they take care of different cattle and goats and so whenever they're doing that they have to protect their herd and that's against lions and Jaguar she does and leopards and so my spear they actually showed me the skin of the leopard that had killed the mane of the lion that had killed and he also said it killed a man so I guess I have a murder weapon but uh holy shit yeah but he was protecting their cattle a thief came in there and actually came with a room GU which is a club and so it was a room do versus a spear and it was a warrior so anyways it's pretty pretty crazy Wow what is it like what kind of a head does this thing the spear head what is it like this spear heads about this long and it's heavy I mean at all yeah actually they they have this the wood part of it in the middle of a Masai warrior Spears uh from like a olive tree of some sort okay then they put it through the fire and make it really really strong it's a hard wood anyway they they know how to treat it through the fire make it like rock-solid and then one end is almost like looks like a javelin and so that's then that they use for either target practice or just sticking it in the ground whenever they're walking around the other and they only use for whenever they come across the line Wow so one end they throw it just like to just to practice yeah and we took some balloons over there to see if the kids would like it and to be honest though the Warriors liked the balloons better than anything because we'd blow up those balloons and just tie them throw them on the ground and then they would the different warriors would stock the balloons almost on every time almost the first throw every single time they nailed it Wow how far away I mean not too far because the winds blowing and they're they're stocking it and whenever they're going after a lion they normally wait until they're close because if they miss you know so they they wait till it's close and so I mean probably hear to the doorman only like 20 feet well I guess some of them did it farther where some were getting it from all the way to the to the window so someone could actually throw him pretty good and sometimes they get jacked when they go after these lions oh yeah the the spear that I have the guy this the warrior that gave it to me seems almost like it's like most is his name that's like most and the other warrior man I'm slipping on his name but I took a picture of both of them in the one guy that I met he had this these teeth marks out of his me he's a kneecap but he had a big room goo which is a club but it was it was like a walking stick for him and his knee was really swollen and it had these chunks out of it and then we I asked him what happened to his knee and then he pulled over they always wear red because that way if they're ever wounded in battle or anything hit someday you don't know that they're bleeding and so he pulled down as his shuka which is like a robe of sort for the warrior class and he pulled it down and down his shoulder blade in the back of his like shoulder he had claw marks I mean just wicked claw marks and so the lion had attached on to his shoulder onto his thigh and then bit into his knee and the head warrior is the one that saved the other warrior and that's the spear that I have hanging up in the house Wow so as the lion was biting him homeboy jacked him with the spear that came after him in this one that wasn't even on a lion hunt this was just they were going after or they were tending the fields tending the flock and a lion came after the guy to fuck a cat that's all I have to say oh yeah I'm more of a dog guy yeah I'm Way more of a dog guy I I have chickens right now I just got little baby chicks yeah my little girl they wanted to get chickens so we decided to get like a little old chicken coop sort of a situation but the fucking cat I have two cats and my one cat this motherfucker just paces in front of that door left and right doesn't matter if he's trained doesn't matter if he's sweet he purrs he can't wait to murder one of those birds he just can't get it out of his head like in his head he's got to get in there and fit he hears them he sits out from the door and meows and you know it's it's almost like you want to kick his ass you're like come on man once you fucking leave them alone they're little chicks but in his DNA there was just no stop in that that's what he wants to do you know have you ever seen a live oh yeah I've seen I've seen two different times I've seen two and one time they were sitting over a it was either cape buffalo or a what is it a water water buffalo water buffalo I think it was a water buffalo and uh it was still chomping down on that also it wasn't paying attention to us I had my spear though and I did but I wasn't gonna test it out like some guys are trying to get me to go over there have you practiced with it I have practice with it but I'm not gonna use it man no they already gave me the ceremony and gave me the spear made me a warrior and in fact the other ones they can't be a warrior until they kill a lion so they come back with a female tail you know waving it and if it's a male they come back with a lot the main wrapped around them yeah you gotta be a war you have to be a lion killer to be a warrior yeah oh my goodness until then you're kind of a lesser class it's a country yeah so I thought I was a warrior that's why I try to connect with them you know hey I thought they wrestle they just do takedowns though they don't do any like ground fighting you show them some moves I did it I wrestled two at the same time and so they thought that's how they thought I was a warrior because they were like oh wow it's wrestling like we can't get a line of them did you submit anybody teach them how to tap man no I for me I would just pick him up and put him over my shoulder I did that with both of them at the same time wants to do it you got to remember they're they're skinny dudes dudes no I did start to put one in a guillotine choke but then I'm started thinking man this guy killed a lion he's not gonna tap right no I kind of hurt this guy I'm just gonna play around with them so is he trying to wrestle with you oh yeah can't figure out yeah for all yeah yeah get double underhooks he's like what is he doing I'm trying a couple different kinds of like collar ties and trips yeah and then they do like a double kill almost like a Thai clinch real and so they do that and they just kind of like circle each other and they just do that amongst the the warrior class just almost like a ranking system of sorts so but you should be able to go in there and school those dudes yeah when it came to rest it create a whole elite team you have Masai warrior Kenyan wrestling team that'd be pretty crazy it's like you could be like a your own Sandra Bullock movie a white guy goes over there teaches them how to wrestle brings in us to the state championship that got leaves for shoes ooh teaching Masai out of fucking tap people yeah they probably don't underst this like probably so many different techniques you can use out on they don't see coming oh yeah but the craziest thing is is that they have all these cactuses and briar bushes all around so inside the village the wrestling was was okay but it was just it would happen anywhere and any time I remember I had those five finger shoes on and I stepped right on a briar bush and it went straight through the sole of it and into my toe and I mean just I'm like come on guys let's at least we're used to you know so you just said it like we're used to the mats we're used to the yeah to the sissy stuff so those guys are just probably barefoot too right yeah they're barefoot I got shoes on I got I got hiking boots on I have of everything so when they step on a briar bush in their barefoot they just walk it off I don't know I didn't I didn't I guess I'm the only one even while wrestling I'm not aware enough to know there's a briar bush around they myself a ridiculously tough feet oh yeah especially with the pygmies the Masai too but a lot of the Masai now are getting uh sandals made out of tires so like tires that blow out you know della they'll make it out of the rubber from the tire but the pygmies they don't have access to stuff like that especially because they don't have anything to bargain or barter with they don't have goats they don't have cows they and their slaves so they are mostly barefoot all the time and they're running through the jungle and stuff like that and so they're the soles of their feet actually almost like the soles of shoes almost I mean not not I mean they don't have the gripping and stuff and but uh but they're thick they're really thick have you ever seen that that show where there's two dudes I think they call a duel survivor or something duels are fun I don't remember the Cody Cody yeah yeah and then or Landauer's I don't know whatever homeboys name is walks everywhere big Tillett yeah yeah he's got pigtails big gorilla looking dude he doesn't cold weather yes no I mean there's like stuff everywhere I saw the one and because I'm trying to learn from those guys some survival stuff which the pygmies know more than anybody but while I'm here you know learning from that show and they did like the swamp so like Louisiana or something and there's all these water moccasins and all his stuff and he's barefoot in there he was walking through and poisons first time I saw him scared like he was he was terrified walking through that yeah one bite from one of those crazy fucking animals that lived down there and you're done I mean you got a lot of that in the Congo as well I've watched some documentaries in the Congo and there's the only place in the world where they have spiders that move in packs oh yeah yeah and then they're ants Manor pretty crazy my buddy I took with me he went to take a dump behind a tree and he put his uh he put his back against the the tree and he had these ants crawl up and just start biting them like these ants though make you bleed they're they're chompers on him like literally and then what's what's the most brutal part is they try to find the softest spot to bite or something they with their sensors and so whenever they came up my my leg I didn't notice them because how fast they are I didn't notice them until two were on my left nipple and I was like pulling this thing off and I mean I'm having to pull the ant out and whenever I finally got it off I literally was bleeding like just from a fucking yeah and yeah and they travel in these things like I'm talking about they look like roads so sometimes the the path that you're walking on if it's a pygmy path they're small really really small sometimes the the it's wider than the path of ants like I mean like a road a road of ants like this thick and I mean the the answer when we let this long and bye ninja yeah but there's millions of them that they make these roads that are wide they answer god damn terrifying yeah and you know they are Bryan Callen a good buddy mine was working I think in Borneo I think he said it was I forget where it was it was in some jungle but he said they would have to pose it in Congo no no so but if they had to put turpentine over the posts of they they had a suspended tents put turpentine over the posts of the ants didn't Klein Apple him he said when you were lying in bed at night you would hear the ants walking through the forest yeah absolutely hear them you can hear them yeah I mean it that's the part see that's that's why I know I'm passionate about this and that I really feel like this is my life's purpose because I don't I don't like creepy crawlies my stuff like that man and I think I sent a picture of a black mamba I almost stepped on and luckily the pygmies killed it it was marginally and and it was it was pretty crazy because all of a sudden I heard I heard the Hut next to me which it this tribe was a chief and I heard his wife going nuts and I would sleep with I would actually sleep with the yep there it is that's the Black Mamba and that almost got you yeah is like five or six feet long probably did you guys eat that thing see I thought about it and they they believe they believe trees and snakes are their ancestors and so even though they killed the snake if it's a Python they won't kill it though they won't kill a Python they'll drag it to where it's safe the only Python I've heard of him killing was whenever they had gone fishing and then they had it almost on like a stringer of sorts and then a big Python came by and took their fish and then the guy was so mad he killed that Python but the pygmies were mad at him for killing a Python because they aren't poisonous but the black mambas they know how dangerous they are I think it's like 20-30 minutes and you're gone and those things can get up to like eight or ten feet long and then the fastest snake in the world oh one of the most venomous so last this most aggressive one of the longest and so it just seems like Congo man like everything there's some of the most beautiful places in the world I mean the mountains covered on the equator covered with I mean the most gorgeous trees silverback gorillas I mean just some beautiful stuff there but it was in the wild no I I haven't I haven't I think they said I've heard we've heard them and we've heard definitely monkeys but I haven't seen the gorillas have you seen monkeys oh yeah oh yeah it's the Masai not the pygmies but the Masai actually will target practice with their renews their clubs they'll throw those at the monkeys and so poor monkey yeah monkeys get no fucking slack it's just like the pygmies the pygmies the monkeys the little guys get picked on yeah and I actually that that black mamba that was up there I heard them go nuts and so whenever I got up and I crawl out of my hut which I mean those things for me to get inside sometimes I have to be on my elbows and so I start getting out of it and I'm like what's going on and I had a video of it in I actually cut it off right before I asked the question but I didn't know what kind of snake it was I thought black mambas were black like just black but it's actually their mouths when they open their mouths it's like pitch black inside their mouth even they're like teeth are black and so that's how they got their name black mambas and so but they're they're gray on top and then white on their belly and so I didn't think it was a black mom but at all and so I was uh yeah I was getting out of my Hut and then I got slapped in the belly and stopped and I didn't know what was going on until I got my phone on because it's pitch black yeah man that's the thing I almost stepped on and it's like twenty or thirty minutes and you're dead oh what a creepy-looking alien creature they had only hit it in the back of the tail and so he was still slithering around actually help Wow I don't think I uploaded it to anywhere but maybe my phone so they would they won't eat these even though it's a source of protein no hungry are they edible though black mamba I don't know about my mama's I know the the pythons are rattlesnakes are actually pretty tasty yeah I think I think if you cut it off far enough off far enough down from its head then I bet it wouldn't be poisonous but they weren't gonna eat at all huh yeah and then I I asked on the right before this video cuts off I asked if if it's poisonous and so yeah I don't know if I can if I can email is so P pretty much everybody there must know somebody who's been killed by something natural in that area oh yeah whether it's a crocodile or whether it's an a lion or whether it's whatever the hell outs is out there yeah the rivers close to the pygmies are full of crocodiles hippos so crocodiles and hippos living the same thing Oh hippos - man that's another problem right when hippos kill more people even than crocodiles yeah a lot more I got a video of hippos and crocodiles all in the same water hole and the hippos were like swimming right next to the crocodiles and they don't give a fuck about the crocodiles I'm never remotely concerned I don't think I don't think hippos are concerned about anything and I don't have to know but they they do like a bark I mean it literally sounds like they're barking like a softer bark not so like like doggish but it sounds like a bark that's how hippos like communicating well and so like in the morning and in the afternoon like it towards like the Sun setting and Sun coming up the hippos are barking and so you hear that and so you know your little leaf house yeah and you hear these murderous giant pigs yeah they like I think they are thinking like a pig or cousin to a pig or something like that probably yeah I think I think I think and I think there's even like pygmy hippos so uh it was like pygmy hippos pygmy crocodiles pygmy monkeys which are like the size of your finger um like my like actual monkeys that are like donkeys the size of your finger yeah are you anywhere near that area of the Congo I think it's called Billy do you know where that is any billi bi Li Beni is really close BTN I know that's a yeah it's um have you heard of that chimpanzee that they found there oh the one that's supposed to be massive yeah I've heard stories from the pygmies talking about a like human type not human type they weren't talking about like Bigfoot and if they were I guess they're talking about me but no they they talk about different kinds of animals and but they also talk about the scene spirits and stuff like that right right but I mean I've asked him about I forget what they call it there's like a actual like Swahili name that they call that that potential dinosaur of sorts yeah well it's friend David Cho actually went out there looking for it a long time ago for Vice he went for Vice calm and he went to look in the Congo for like a brontosaurus Wow well so crazies they like there's a saying the Congo is called the heart of darkness and on the Dark Continent and they like the pygmies I think are the ones that have the saying that it's I can't really say it eloquent like they do but it's called its they say like it's basically hard for a fish to navigate through the rivers and because of how thick everything is and it's just hiking and and everything is just I it's actually I guess better to be a pygmy because it's it's hard to move around especially whenever you have like a 80 pound pack on your back I'm trying to figure out how how I'm gonna go I haven't sent this picture in but that's a part of the ways that we get through like 85 kilometers hiking and wow so is so thick yeah people tried some European noblemen tried to live there they tried to settle into the Congo because there's such a vast amount of resources they just figured look we'll just carve out a little place and then make a house and the forest just swallowed it all up yeah I just couldn't keep off yeah I think in the 18 late 18-hundreds or early 1900s that was whenever they went there for all the rubber mhm yeah and really slaughtered a lot of the Congolese and then since then they they came in for the gold and diamonds and now they're there for the coltan and you can go through whole colonial like like settlements that are from like the from Belgium and other places that have settled there and it's from like the early 1900s and it's just almost like ghost towns but they're like the Belgian colonization stuff and nobody lives there like trees are growing up through them and everything but they're brick buildings and the Congolese don't live in brick buildings a lot of them don't unless you're more towards the city Wow so um these pygmies that you talked to had they seen that big giant chimpanzee had any uh no III don't know I whenever i I heard lots of different stuff and normally they open up around the campfire at night I would have to pretend sometimes to go to sleep for the Bantu slave masters or the kids to leave and so Shalom University calls it camp fire University for the pygmies because they'll open up and they'll be real around the campfire and they'll actually cuz if I ask him in front of I had a chief of the band to come to me and welcomed me it will first he was like what do you want with my people what do you want with my property and then he and then I told him I just there to learn I was with the University were there learning doing research and just here to help and benefit and then he gave me an egg he told me he had a gift for me and so he gave me just one single egg it wasn't until and I was so grateful and thankful because you know he gave me a gift and I was gonna be able to eat it and everything else and as I'm cooking it and and the pickings are helping me cook it and after I eat it they finally tell me around the campfire after I had pretended to go to sleep and then got up to come back around the campfire to talk for hours until we fall asleep around the campfire they finally told me that the the egg they gave me wasn't the Bantu Chiefs it was the pygmy Chiefs and the pygmy chief had saved that to give to me because he heard that a visitor was coming and so the Bantu chief like just you know took his gift completely stole it and acted like it was his and really it was the pygmy chief and he was giving me everything that he had to give me because that's food for them like foods food is their livelihood and that was a clean source of food and so yeah it's just it's pretty messed up how they treat them wow that's so that's gotta be so strange for you to be around both of them to be around the Bantu people and yeah do you do you try to communicate that there's there's something wrong with this yeah absolutely man in uh in so in six of the places I went to they referred to him as these are my slaves these are my people these are my property kind of sorts three of the places I went that were even deeper in the jungle they said what do you want with my animals because they believe them to be so low-class like that I see a man the the the tribes that surround me it's most of its banned - sometimes it's rebel sometimes it's other tribes but they they treat them worse than they treat their cattle and they treat their go well they don't have cattle but they have goats and I don't know if that falls in the cattle category but uh but they treat their goats better than they treat pygmies that's insane and they've always done this this is just well the pygmies used to never have to depend on the Bantu so this is why I mean on the ug some people have really been they're really interested and they've been trying to find out what kind of slavery there is and the slaves that we've been able to set free they weren't in shackles and they weren't held at gunpoint like I don't know how to do that with the rebels yet maybe in the year I'm there I can befriend them like I had to befriend the slave masters so they'd want to learn and stuff and so with the Bantu people we just had to sit there and say like hey you know these are people like I'm an educated guy from the United States not really that educated but uh but the Shalom University guys those four guys I'm with to have master's degrees and to have doctorates so they're really educated and they're the ones leading the university so Mike these guys are knowledgeable and and and I came from us these are actually people like fully human beings and the Bantu eyes will get big like what and then they'll see us treating them like humans treating them like they have value treating them like you know they're they're like like they should be treated right and so it starts to change some of the things and the pygmies are more slave to the Bantu through circumstance they used to not depend on them they used to be hunters and gatherers and not have to worry about it but whenever I can see the Sun at times and it sounds like this earth quaking Thunder going on all throughout the day Thunder going on but I see the Sun it's not raining on me I'm like why is there thunder and then we finally get close enough to where we see some of the de force station going on and these are these are trees that you could drive to Mack trucks through you know and and and they're cutting these trees down and whenever those things fall it sounds like thunder and so the animals just flee I mean and I think I think last I heard and I don't know that it's scientific maybe someone can find it but uh but I think they said that the deforestation in the Congo the second largest rainforest in the world is up to the size of Texas or over Texas in the last like 15 20 years last 15 20 years man they've de for stood the size of Texas and I've seen it I've gone to places where it's just big lush awesome forests and then you go to this place and it's just like wrecked and it goes from like looking like the rain forest to now it's looking like this might turn into like desert II kind of stuff because like they've just it's barren and no one does any or makes any attempt to replenish the forest no not all and see that is why the rain forest conservationist wildlife preservationist are getting involved in ways that they're trying to buy up that lien and protect it and I agree with that that's why I feel like what what Shalom's wanting to do and what I'm wanting to partner with them it's a it's a all-encompassing thing where it's like human slave liberation it's a rainforest preservation and Wildlife Conservation it's it's it's attractive to all those people there mas be a tremendous amount of money that they're making from those trees they don't know Oh massive amounts I mean some of those are very rare woods other things that they're using for is is charcoal that's see in the Congo since they don't have like electric electric plants and things like that they have to cook for them to cook if they burn up wood it's not as long-lasting or his hot as charcoal so I have a picture of a woman that was a slave for charcoal and she had her slave master put this bag of maybe 120 pounds minimum I mean the back of charcoal was taller than she was I mean a pygmy woman is small I don't know if you can pull up one chai busi Koo the picture that says chai busi ku but I mean these are small people and they're carrying bags of charcoal where to slavemasters put it on their back tie a rope around their head and this woman having to walk four or five kilometres you on these little paths carrying this charcoal and they'll cut down the trees to make charcoal they'll cut them down and they'll start a fire and but they'll put like dirt over the fire and it's smoulders and it I don't know if it's a week long process or a few day long process but it makes it just long burning and so that's how most people cook in the Congo and in Rwanda and in Uganda and in Burundi and those places will get charcoal from the Congo jungle because there's so much wood they don't even think about it Wow yeah what a fucking trip so these these poor people that are are just recently slaved these these poor people these poor pygmies before that they they were be they were able to hunt and gather the able to do everything were they treated as people then uh I would say they were treated a lot better but still they've never been believed to be fully human they've always thought of them as subhuman part monkey part and part man and the thing is that with the Bantu the relationship the band - and pygmies used to have is they would trade the pygmies were master hunters and they still are if there was more wildlife especially but they would go hunt bushmeat and then they would come to the bandage what's pushed me and push me like some monkeys also antelope and just anything wild game inside of so that's try boo siku that you just put up that's my mom and the tribe oh grown woman yeah she's in her mid 40 she's probably as old as my mama's 46 so that's try boo siku and she's awesome Wow that was her first picture ever taken of her so I have some other ones where she's smiling but that that's the one that shows her her size so that's how they got their name pygmy which is elbow height so they really are just like the bullied people of the world yeah he's bullied people the world I mean I there was times that I've gotten sick to my stomach hearing the stories that have happened to him and and that's what I was saying that the they would go hunt and then they would come to the edge of the forest where the band to are and the band to grow corn Grob grow beans and they would basically want some side dishes to go with their meat and so they would trade sometimes like the the wild plants that they would gather and they would come and trade their either bush meat or their hunted animals and their different kinds like mushrooms and stuff and they trade it with the Bantu people's for some corn or beans or rice or cassava Leafs which it can make golly out of as I kind of paste like thing that takes on the flavor of the meat and they were had a trading relationship sometimes Bantu would go find the pygmies because they wanted some meat and they weren't the best Shepherds and so they could grow the corn and beans but they wanted to meet and so that's how the relationship started and then they started to get exploited whenever they could no longer hunt like they they they really can the animals started fleeing in the wildlife conservationist and and rainforest preservation preservation asar trying to push them towards the road they made a bunch of promises I mean a lot of these NGOs that had their special interest would promise the pygmies if you go off the this deep forest if you let us have this we'll take care of you whenever you're closer to the road we'll make sure you you're taken care of and then they just never took care of and then the band to buy up the land from underneath them and then enslave them and say you're on our land you work it and so it's just kind of a whole crazy how does these people feel about you taking off going to America to let everybody know about them and then flying back again amis they say this must be so bizarre for them yeah well that's what's crazy at first every all the night well I've been to more than nine but the last time I went I went to nine different tribes and of pygmies little nine villages each one of them I never seen a white dude before so that scares me I mean there would be times that it would take an hour maybe even sometimes a little over an hour before someone in that that tribe most of the time was always women or children that would finally come up to me and touch me to make sure they don't go through me like I was a spirit or a ghost of some sort and then once one person felt me and I'd play a game with them or something like that and then more would I mean literally come out from hiding behind trees come out from from the forest whenever I come in sometimes they'd flee run cry kids like flailing on the ground like just freaked out by me but whenever I'd make friends with them then they would ask me one thing every place that I went in all nine tribes they asked me will I help them have a voice that was the thing they're like we have no voice here they're the only tribe not allowed to have their citizenship in Congo and like this so they have zero voice wow what a strange turn your life is taken that this is you've gone from being on the house and the Ultimate Fighter you know competing in the heavyweight version of the show to now live it in a grass hut in the Congo what uh that's a string or a leaf hot rather what a strange journey you're on man yeah you need to be honest I wouldn't change it I mean with especially with this video going viral in with yesterday us talking about a book deal and and today I went out to to lunch with a publicist that really worked on The Blind Side and the movie invincible and I forget some other big-time blockbusters that he worked on but uh I mean people are saying that this is a kind of crazy story in the whole thing is a Sandra Bullock movie yeah there we go I'm gonna have her I'm gonna have her play me this Justin a chick yeah well we pulled it and more likely to believe that oh there's more vulnerable situations get this giant MMA fighter going to the Congo kicking people's asses any right yeah yeah no I mean I just the the wild turn is me and I just feel like it's it's something that I can be fully wholeheartedly passionate about and I'm I'm fulfilled doing it and and when I say they're my family I mean it oh you seem very very sincere how old you Justin 25 so this is a good time you don't have kids you don't have responsibilities you can you can go and just follow your your desire and your passion and your your your interest here yeah the only thing that really I mean I have a future wife and gotta find out what's that you gotta find her in doubt Jesus Christ she's in dows and you're going to the fucking Congo for a year so how did she think about that um at first oh well at first she was pumped then she's done like some different trips around the world and has gone and helped orphanages in Mexico and she kind of has a heart too maybe one day started an orphanage mm-hmm and so she's got a great heart man she's awesome she's gorgeous but this the first time I went I went one time before we started dating and then the second time I went it was hard it was hard for her because she started doing some research started finding out that the Congolese people call it the African Holocaust that's what they call it because depending on what stat you look at they say it surpasses the death death toll of the Jews in the Holocaust which is pretty crazy but some stats say 6.8 million Congolese in the last ten years some say over five million but it's between five million seven million men and so it really is like one of the if not the it is the worst conflict zone last year in 2012 because then she was saying maybe I'll go with you and I was like yeah and then maybe we'll well we'll talk about that and but the stat for 2012 was that over 400,000 women were raped in the Congo it's 58 women every 60 minutes yeah so I you can't bring your woman to the Congo especially not the Congo is the most dangerous Walmart parking lot in the world and so it's it's it's been a crazy journey it's made us both grow a lot in our relationship to me being gone for that month there and her you know sitting there and thinking about am i okay because that no contact so all this different stuff we've really been on a journey and we were talking about even getting married before I went and then now we're talking about waiting until I get back from the year but it's just something I know I got to do are you going to come back at all during that year so far no it's my break yes pretty great actually my girlfriend's sister is getting married and I might want to come back for that but Wow but so far no and it depends on my visa luckily with Shalom University I might be able to get like a student visa I might be able to do something with a school to get a year-long visa but if I can't get a year-long beast I might have to come back and you have no income while you're doing on oh no man I have the last year and a half me and I've honestly felt like I was just a nut like not a nut I knew it was right but I felt like a loan not like everybody could be like oh that's really good but why don't you go back to fighting I mean I've won my last three fights and then I took some time off to go see the world and see what people I could fight for and I couldn't find anyone better to fight for than the pygmies because they're the worst off people grew up on the planet and but yeah I mean it's it's been a crazy journey you know from people family from close friends all saying I'm an idiot for giving up fighting and I could actually do it well and at grudge training center going from from being invited there after The Ultimate Fighter to then being kicked off of it when I was a drug addict to then being invited back on to it and then me saying you know I'm gonna I'm gonna leave and go go here and then them being like what are you doing you know my coach Trevor Whitman he's awesome I love that dude better coach bro he's one of the best guys I know as a person too he's just incredible him his wife a big giving hearts and we we set up three different hospital visits for the grudge fight team I was a fishel volunteer at the Denver Children's Hospital so we went there three different times as official like whole team and so that was great that was how I start showing them hey I've really made a life change here I'm no longer the drug addict that was coming in here and in I mean we're actually a depressed drunk drug addict tried to take my own life all this different stuff and what were you what were you addicted to was a addicted to a bunch of dudes bunch of these pills I had three different doctors that would that would give me scripts and I'm had one doctor that would give me 100 at a time and I could go to all three of a hundred at a time which pills well hydrocodone a lot but then also I even gotten to like harder stuff like hydrocodone is that vicodin yeah and then and then and then oxy and I mean oxys the hardest right yeah bro I I don't I don't remember two to two and a half months of my life like just there's no memories except for there's one hazy memory it was for my best friend at the time and we're building that relationship back but uh my best friend I'm the guy that got me into fighting my first fight was because he was in the hospital and and he couldn't make it to the fight he had a staph infection where they almost thought he's gonna lose his leg it was that bad a lot of guys get that oh man yeah and he got he got yeah put to the side like they literally thought we might have to take his leg it was deep into his like oh they thought it might have been in his femur bone so he's laid up me and and and then I went to the to the promoter told him he's out then the guys start talking trash he just ended up in the hospital one day early and the promoter had watched me wrestle it was in Oklahoma and so he knew my high school wrestling coaches who were both two Olympic gold medalist both wrestled Oklahoma State were national champions there Kenny Monday and Kendall Cross and Kenny monday-friday MMA for a while yeah yeah he was one of my training partners too whenever I was in coaches whenever I was fighting he's been a coach of mine since I was 15 years old and then yeah anyways the guy his name's Justin McCorkle I think he's like 4 and 1 pro MMA heavyweight and yeah I missed his wedding not just being there but being the best man and I remember I had an eight minute voicemail and meeting like ten seconds through because it said something like you missed my wedding and then I'm like oh freak you know and then it paused and he was you miss being my best man and then I just remember hanging out because and going straight back to the drugs and so I'm a medical marijuana license for three years which I'm cool with people having that but I went with I went I would always piggyback everything like I would the reason Grudge voted me off the team was I started waking up and fixing my steel-cut oats fixing my egg whites getting my berries putting in the steel-cut oats fixing all that but then starting on my vaporizer before practice and then hitting the pain pills and then starting with washing it down with hard liquor man and so then I'd go train and they knew it they knew that I sweated out out of my poor was coming liquor they knew that I mean the bro I don't know I mean I was going through a literal when I say depression I mean like the darkest deepest most desperate time of my life and what was that being caused by selfishness I don't know I mean a lot of different things that that didn't it didn't make sense to me I grew up at 13 years old I was I was heavily bullied that's when I found the UFC 13 I sat at the lunch table by myself had people throw stuff at me I I was invited to my middle school crushes like birthday party and and it was a costume party I got the invitation like no way costume party wins a prize and I remember her dad worked for dr. pepper and she loved transformers so I came to the party as a dr. pepper transformer like with the dr. pepper cardboard and made out of uh made out of duct tape and then dr. pepper boxes and I got there and I was thirty minutes late everyone was pointing laughing and calling me an idiot and that was whenever I was probably I guess maybe in the first fight of my life was suicidal thoughts cuz they're like so worthless you should just kill yourself 1300 I mean yeah I mean I love it so me yeah oh I dunno cell phone so I walked and I got to Dairy Queen I lived in the country so we like they call that the Texas stop sign Dairy Queen and and so I went to Dairy Queen and I think I remember one of the employees coming out to throw away trash and I'm like sitting there behind the Dairy Queen right in between kind of the dumpster and I'm like what's going on and I was just sobbing and then I went inside and called my mom she wasn't there for a little bit had to sit in there they asked what was going on anyways that was this big left turn but that's when I found the UFC and I thought maybe a few weeks after that and I thought these guys don't get bullied these guys like modern-day gladiators I and I was I mean I was mesmerized by the sport of it because I love sports and I always played sports growing up but this was multiple sports but in one and I'm like man if I could just become one of those guys I'll have all the passion the purpose the significance the I'll never be this dude that I am right now and I'll be the exact opposite and so I set out for that and started at 15 so wrestling under two Olympic gold medalist seventeen won my first national championship 18 was living back and forth with the Olympic Training Center 19 started fighting professionally 21 I was on The Ultimate Fighter 22 fighting 23 is main event at the the Hard Rock in another promotion and I think every time I got my hand raised and it got worse as this drug problem got on but uh I stopped looking forward to even the victories of fighting started looking forward to the parties after the fight and then I started thinking like I don't know every time I get my hand raised if you can find a picture of me or a video of me smiling after a fight that would be the first for me because I don't think I smiled after any of them well I was always looking towards the next one you know most guys jumping up smile and screaming when was your issue with with drugs was it after the Ultimate Fighter because it was it was before and after it got really bad after and I mean it got brutal after I actually the the week of my John I don't know if I've ever I told Loretta hunt this a couple of days I did interview for Sports Illustrated and I think the week of my John Matson fight I was taking handfuls of pills and I was and and some guys can function and and fight and everything me though I would piggyback everything if I got if I got high needed I needed the pills or I needed a drink or I never did one thing that was much that was a huge problem of mine I always piggyback that I had to have something else and so I was doing that the week of my John Matz and fight for the finale well you were there I was high that week and the pain pills like lots of pain pills like the day before I didn't the night the day of how did you not test positive they didn't they didn't test me on that one they tested me when I fought at the Hard Rock but at that one they didn't test they only tested the main events I think that was the time that there were stationed and yeah or even the I think the Commission hit a time where they didn't test everybody on the card they're only gonna do like the mean of 10 fights or something like that then I was kind of in that window wow yeah that's crazy man what would happen if they did test you I would have begun would you like a lot of other guys do but I mean not a lot of those you knew you weren't gonna be tested I want you to kept taking the pills anyway yeah I would have taken them anyway I didn't care I never did any sort of steroids never I already I already felt empty enough I guess some with some of the victories and I think whenever you got real bad was after that Roy Nelson fight on the Ultimate Fighter and Dana and rampage in Rashad and coach T and basically everybody except Roy was telling me that it should have well that I won or that it should have gone to a third round at least because I think one judge thought I won't to thought he won it was a split and that we only went two rounds and for me this was my dream and and so whenever that was taken from me and I felt like it was taken in a wrong way then what really got bad was after the Matteson fight I lost a split decision again so two back to back I just I lost it I went straight I mean I don't even remember that week in Vegas what started you off on pills in the first place he was in an injury yeah this way so you know how many times I've heard that man what God gets injured his doctor puts him on pills Karo Parisyan same story yeah went off the deep end how goddamn addicted or the addictive are these pills and they just did I know an amount to people I remember uh I bet I bet my mom would confirm it but uh whenever this happened I was 18 and I was living at the Olympic Training Center and I wrestled against the world champion I didn't give up a point it was kind of like I could have given up a point it would have been similar to I could have tapped it let it snap mm-hmm but I just didn't want to give up a point so I let my hair and snap and anyways I probably took at least a month worth of the oxycodones and a week after that I went back probably took three weeks worth what happened it's your arm what position was it in just wrestling greco-roman wrestling have you ever seen a gut wrench like Scirocco how they go to turn somebody huh so I was fighting it the post explain to people who don't know anything I was on my belly a guy who maybe he took me down and and once he's on your back he goes to do a gut wrench he wraps around your ribs he starts to crank down with his shoulder on the back of your shoulder blade so you're trying to fight it so your back doesn't break 90 it breaks 90 degrees and your back angles towards the mat the guy gets two points or what maybe in one point sometimes but I didn't want to have my back break 92 where he get any points so just let it keep fighting fighting fighting fighting fighting and I tried to do this Hopf thing and whenever I went to do the hop that's whenever all his weight came down on it super experienced guy is like 33 34 and I was 18 at the Olympic Training Center where he was a world champion Olympic bronze or silver medalist and it just snapped I whenever it snapped and went completely behind my back one of my buddies at the Olympic Training Center puked because of it and so I was laying on it completely behind my back like if I was on the bat the mat right now is completely behind my back well except it was this way oh yeah this whole part of my heart is wicked this whole part of my arm was under my back so uh it broke it it dislocated it and it tore the olih nary collateral ligament so they did a nerve transposition so I have no more fun they moved it to where it's right here so if I talk on the phone too long these three nerves go numb or I was sorry these three fingers go numb and then they took a they were gonna do is it a cadaver or cadaver cadaver cadaver so they were gonna use a cadaver but different nerves that's zombies yeah no I know for the the torn ligament the UCL the ulnar collateral ligament but then instead they used the there's like three tendons and your hamstring that are kind of like this and he took the centre one out and they said a tendon is stronger than a ligament and like we want to put something strong in there if you wanted to be an elliptic calibre athlete mm-hm and they said that that was actually may be harder chance for it to take but it was the best chance to take instead of a cadaver which might be weaker a smaller person and body could reject it right I think you Dominick Cruz dabba graft nonsense blows it out has to do it all over again yeah and so they wanted to use that tendon because it's stronger and he said it's gonna be from your leg and he goes and you want to fight someday and I go yeah and he said well this will be like you're kicking someone in the face then and I'm like okay that sounds pretty sweet but yeah so that's whenever the drug problem probably started I remember I was I was piggyback and even then kind of started going into depression because I thought man did I just lose my Olympic dreams in my MMA dreams so and I was doing all the oxycodone that whole the how old of you at this time when you hurt yourself 18 yeah so you're 18 years old no drug problem before no get on the pills and I that smokes we're in a drink but nothing ever no nothing where it had to have anything I have people in my family that over the same issue I've got injured and all sudden taking pills for his back and he's a fucking loser now I mean he's just gone it was a normal guy and now he's a loser and I've met so many people that know somebody that has that same story or that have that same story and then like you pulled themselves out of it it's so terrifying there's no terrifying how they're just handing out some of the most addictive medication that the world has ever known yeah that really is what it is that's brutal man Iowan it's heroin yeah you know I know I Drive on it I would a man and I know that's the you yeah you should have that reaction I I have that reaction to me now looking back at my life and and just I mean I don't know thank God that I didn't I didn't kill somebody or family or but I remember the time that I really wanted to end it I just took a handful of the hydrocodones I was taking adderall too and then I was drinking straight though actually I didn't drink it straight but I had it uh and a sonic hiccup but it was ever clear Oh like a strawberry slush that brutal I told you motherfuckers got a dead pig on its shoulder and then as I had my teachers you know what teachers are yeah and so I had those and um and so I just took it all driving my god Romani oh yeah what a confusion you find you had a book a civil war going on in your brain I did and I blacked out driving and I dude I've been so low that I've woke up in a drug house up in kind of a outside on the outskirts of Summit County and oh you used to live in Boulder yeah yeah so Universal me County is then with like Breckenridge and yeah Keystone so we went there and I loved it odd country yeah I wish I'm in Texas right now so Congo is gonna be beautiful too but I miss skala Congo is another level Congo is a different level of life it's like so vibrant and green rainy and everything I thought yeah I don't know if you know this this is a completely different subject but in Uganda right on the border of where I'm at there's it's on the equator it is the jungle but there's mountains that are so high that they're i think the only glaciers that you can find on the equator so there's like actual glaciers in Uganda in Africa on the acquaintance the equator right outside the jungle what so there's glaciers that's insane yeah so anyways that's completely random what made you straighten up what made you sober up om I knew I was gonna die that was one thing how does it do it did you clean up for me personally I had this guy that that was just brutal man he brutal in a way like he was relentless he was just coming after man saying that I had a purpose to live for saying that you know he told me this and I remember I'll always remember this is my buddy named Jeff Duncan he'll probably watching this he's a awesome dude me and as a great family great wife great kids and he told me Justin you're in the battle for your life like if you this life is a battleground not a playground if you treat it like a playground you will lose the battle and then you started talking like what's your game plan for victory here I mean I got a perfect game playing right like I mean thank God that got it Brian he'd be like no no I'm not no no battle I'm here to play what am I gonna lose that eating too much pussy and so he told you that you have to find your purpose yeah he said I had to find a purpose in that I had a purpose what is this gentleman do um he's a roofer so I he's a childhood friend and not actually he's even older like I had some family friends and a dad a guy that was like a second dad to me and his kids are some of my best friends and and Jeff was kind of in that that core group but he had heard through the grapevine that my mom had come and checked I'm eating and I like two and a half period and I think my dad might have came but uh but she had broken into my house that was in caller ID not broken in but she just was able to get through the back door saw the drugs saw the pills saw how I was living and it looked like hoarders or just just filthy and so she knew that he might be one guy that could get to me and get through to me and so he called me every single day for two months I mean called me left me a voicemail text me and email me and was pissing me off man I was getting livid with him Wow and then whenever I got kicked off a grudge I got up to my phone and got out to my car I was like an angry tears I didn't know what to do because like I was living my dream but it was a nightmare and my dream was reality but it was literally a nightmare are you living a dream as a competitive MMA fighter but you're also I had I had transformed successfully I guess we can do like that I transformed successfully from that 13 year old loser that was invited to the parties and now I was that maybe quote-unquote modern-day gladiator old fighter mixed martial artist and and somehow I wasn't fulfilled somehow I I was a depressed drug addict and and whenever I got to my car I had a text message voicemail all this her stuff they want to hear from them but the text message said this was when your iPhone it didn't just say text message on it it would say like the actual message and on the actual message on the screen it said check her email checked my email the very first thing said a game plan for victory and then whenever I opened it up it said the best thing you'll ever do in your life and it was a trip that was paid for and I thought it was maybe like a deep tau detox kind of thing or a rehab or something like that so I was interested and I just got kicked off a grudge I think Trevor was the only guy maybe Brendan no I think there was like 30 guys or something they got there early to vote on the day of sparring to vote if I stay a part of the team because some of the guys had had it with me and T coach T brought me into his office and he said bro like we can't have our name attached to you anymore like I I'm the only guy that once you still a part I could veto it maybe I'm the head coach but I'm not gonna go against the guys and grudges unique man because grudge is it's a family I mean I mean like it's it's like they I think for Elliott Marshall we threw a surprise baby shower for him I mean in fighters throwing a baby shower for a fighter you know like that's just not normal and a lot of fight gyms or their bunch of gym hoppers and a bunch of selfish dudes and they're never gonna give the coach the money or they're never gonna they're gonna try and knock out their training partners like we we just worked like a had cookouts together all this different stuff but I was the one guy that was that was the problem and they voted me off and so me and I was just I was empty I felt like man now my dream are my nightmare but my dream now that's even ripped away from me so now I had nothing you know I know that you've gone through some growth as a human as a man even some spiritual development and character building and all that but I can't help but be terrified at how smart you are and how together and passionate you are but yet you still got hooked by these fucking pills yeah those goddamn things scare the shit out of me and I know you were a younger the time and mm-hmm you didn't he didn't have the life experiences you have now but you're not a loser so the fact that you got just sucked up into it like that it's so it's so terrifying to me yeah I mean they're they're dangerous man I think they should I don't know how they could they could watch it better you know I I shouldn't be able to go to three different doctors and have one giving me a hundred at a time yeah I mean you know what I mean 100 this is in Colorado yeah at least they have databases I mean I I literally just go to three different pharmacies three different doctors that was the whole topic of a Vanguard show called the oxycontin Express oh I was on it I was aboard it man I was taking the train it's about Florida this Florida had these things called pain management centers well you would go to a doctor and the doctor would say what's wrong I'll hurt my back up you need a prescription for pain pills so doctor writes it in the same facility right next to that you leave the doctor's door the next door is the pharmacy that only sells oxycontin you go in there and you buy pain pills and they have these fucking pain management centers and they're all over the place so you essentially have these oxycontin addicts waiting in line at all these parking lots to get into these places and the places was fit they were filled with poor people that were just hooked on these goddamn pills and I think I think for me I mean I appreciate you saying like you know you're not a loser smart guy or whatever I think but it's true I mean I'm listening to you talk you're you're obviously a smart guy well I appreciate that I think that worked in my advantage for my problem if that makes sense like it fed it I was able to justify it yeah just following also but to the doctors even like articulate it I wasn't the same kind of guy they would classify as we got to watch this guy right he's a professional fighter he does have a bum elbow he's got a back problem he yeah we can trust this guy what was in back problem I actually in my last fight I herniated one disc and I bulged another and so I have a I have an x-ray that they have I messed up actually a bunch from the mainly it was the thoracic mm-hmm the thoracic and then one other two of the lumbar but I have a x-ray of from those pain management places I think I had six different discs where they put these injections into my spine of cortisone kind of like cortisone I'm trying to think that I'm flattered steroidal yeah absolutely that was brutal because they're supposed to be in a Twilight kind of sleep and I woke up during it because he hit something and I just remembered just ah and then they put some more in me and I was out but yeah bas Rutten in here yesterday and his that's arm it's like shriveled away because of neck injuries yeah disc injuries yeah I used to get stingers all the time from wrestling so so amazing how many guy hit you have a bulging disc now and my neck and it's amazing talking to how many guys talking to people I asking how many guys also have the same injury or similar injuries or in their lower back or in the middle back ER it's fucking everybody yeah it's crazy yeah and I mean it's easy if you want to get if you want to get it you know funder or whatever find your addiction of them you want to find a way to feed that you can yeah if you want to find something to take a pill for it though they'll get you absolutely even one of my doctors was in Iowa so - were in Colorado one was in Iowa there man that's uh that's terrifying shit but it's for a lot of people out there that might be struggling with that very problem right now listening to this you know hearing you that you were able to pull yourself out of it I guarantee you you can inspire people to do the same they can realize they can listen to you and go I want to be that guy I don't want to be this guy that I'm now a slave to this bottle of pills that I have to figure out how to get every week you know I feel like that's one of the reasons I have that connection to the pygmies like I wasn't a slave to a band - but I've been I've definitely been a slave to something and and so yeah if there is somebody that's watching me and that you can get out of it because there's definitely hope how did you how did you do it did you go cold turkey yeah yeah yeah I actually I went I ended up going on that that kind of retreat of sorts with my buddy and and he just loved on me man in a way that uh it was genuine it was authentic where was the retreat would you guys do have you ever heard of the hallmark family Hallmark cards sure I I knew that big in Texas I don't know yeah sure but it was actually their house or their ranch and it was they kind of donated this ranch to be for all walks of life kind of all beliefs and for people to come there and it was a vision of this one guy that that wants to just have a place where people's lives can be changed and stuff and man there's easy there's like 2030 guys that said that they are not that said but they literally went to war for me in my in my life and told me how to life worth living and it was it was awkward kind of not awkward but just right at first I was like what's up here this is crazy but for me I had a I had a radical change man it wasn't a it wasn't a it wasn't a slow process it was like I finally realized I have a life worth living and my life can be for a bigger purpose than myself than getting what I want when I want it I can make a contribution to this planet to this world to people I cannot just fight against people I can fight for people and that's what it was demonstrated in front of me at this retreat and I'm not man I have my own personal beliefs everyone does me and but this was a it was a Christian retreat and for me it changed my life man because these men weren't like because bro if you want to go into some jacked-up religious background I got it I've got a jacked up religious background I have family that says if I mean just come crazy stuff like you have instruments in your music you go to hell if you have tattoos you got a lonely tattooed guy in my family and I have a whole back piece and and and all this stuff and I had another one where so they're super like legalistic and this rules and this other one one 13 years old I left a church camp that we can't ever went to I left a church camp with bruises on my neck because they try to cast demons out of me and then yeah yeah and then I went to Catholic school and had a background where you know the parents were throwing keg parties for us and I went there in this place and this retreat and I told the guy bro I don't need anything Christian bro I don't need it I don't want it I know your type like I don't if I sit around a campfire and I hold hands with a bunch of sissies punks and sissies and sing Kumbaya what is that what is that gonna do for me I need a real answer I need some like real hope and man the guy gave me an answer where it was like you know real people with real problems could really use a real God and for me that just kind of struck a chord he told me that if you and this is again this is my beliefs and stuff so I'm not throwing anything out there on anybody but he told me and it made sense to me you've experienced the counterfeit and for a counterfeit to mean anything there's got to be an authentic and he told me you know if there's gonna be a full Lex watch made a fake Rolex there's got to be a Rolex and you've been around the fake stuff you've been around the faux Lexus you felt the weight of them and they broke on you you've seen it and you sometimes gotta get close enough to where it ticks or it has a smooth transition other times you gotta actually hold it because there's that smooth transition on the Rolex instead of ticking other ones are so tricky you actually gotta feel the weight what would you make an analogy to is the fake religious people the people that work no the people that does that that abused me and there's a lot of religious people that abuse people that judge people that always stuff me and and for me and what this guy shared with me and what he did was he didn't look at the problems I was going through except for to help me out of him he didn't come down on me about any of them he didn't judge me he didn't say you're wrong he didn't say God hates you he didn't he said God loves you bro and and you got problems that's okay and love God love people if you can do that thing it would solve all the problems if you could love God and love people that in then that would change things and so that's what changed my life was like wow and what what I had to happen first was see if God could actually love me and then I felt me my own personal experience encounter like I felt like me and God God doesn't hate me he might love me and then I feel like he does love me and then he wants me to love him back in love people and if I can do those two things for me that would change it has changed my life and I believe it will change other's lives if I can do that I think for a lot of people who are atheists they hear this kind of talk one of them one of the things that comes to mind is they're going like where's this god you're talking about where is this evidence to to put it into it the way I kind of look at it like a lot of people have thought for whatever reason that that I don't believe in God or that I'm anti God or or that I'm an atheist I'm I would I would not classify myself in any way shape or form I definitely don't think that I I'm an atheist because I I don't not believe in God but what I think is that when someone can tune in to the genuine intentions of the best aspects of any religion whether it's Christianity whether it's Hinduism whether it's what it really boils down to is love and generosity and and and fellowship and and moving towards good and bringing people together with happiness rather than moving towards bad and what you've done in your life you can call it God you can call it anything but what you've done in your life is recognize the worst possible aspects the chemical addiction the depression the sadness the failure all the self-sabotage and then realize there's another way to do this I've hit the worst possible frequency and I've also kind of barely been able to tune into this great frequency well what is this well knowing the lows and the lowest lows sometimes you can really sort of extrapolate that there's a there's a counter to that there's a hundred and eighty degrees to that just like your friend was talking about the faux looks and the Rolex you know you caught you know for a lot of people that have a problem with the word God you know I have this guy Alex gray on who's this visionary artist really a fascinating fascinating guy and he's also this psychedelic adventurer and he throws around the word God all the time and he's like you know we kind of have to take that word back because the word God sort of has this bad heebie-jeebie yeah like yeah like oh you're talking about nonsense but no you're not necessarily talking about nonsense and you're you know just because you can't prove it and just because you know the Bible was written thousands of years ago it doesn't mean it's all bullshit and the the true frequency of love the true frequency of fellowship is really what what leads to happiness yeah you're experiencing that yourself oh man I am and that's what this this vision is for me with the pygmies in the Congo like a lot of people have misinterpreted it to where they've thought all you're just going there to make a bunch of converts you should take them a sandwich instead of a bunch of converts like that if people if you actually looked at what I'm doing like I'm actually doing slave liberation rainforest conservation and wildlife preservation all wrapped into one sustainable ways of life this and that it does not hinge around it doesn't really hinge around if they become a Christian or not if they don't and they don't want to and they they want to worship their God do witchcraft do all that fine I'm gonna love you the same way I feel like God has put on my heart a desire to love them and to love them well and to love them regardless of their choices that they make just because my choices are love them and it doesn't and if if they do what I want them to do or not like they're my family and so I want to see them be self-sustainable and all that other stuff so it's not about it's not about like are they gonna become converts or anything like that like well it's about I'm gonna love you guys and see you guys go from being slaves to being liberated to being free to be put on your own land to being able to farm to being able to produce your own corn and beans crops which are getting ready for their second harvest first time in history they're gonna have their own school you're gonna be educated once they're educated they can represent themselves at the Capitol they can be citizens of the country after that I mean just it goes on and on and on and anybody I don't think anybody who's reasonable who listens to you would think that you're just trying to convert people because you're religious it doesn't sound like that at all it sounds like you're doing everything absolutely perfect with the the best intentions possible it's a beautiful story man it really is it's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you in here and then talk to you about it and it's become more beautiful the more I hear about it man it's it's really cool and please come back again when you're back in town when you're back a year from now well yeah again you got my number get in touch with me and let's do this again and tell me more things out what's the endgame are you gonna stay there forever man I honestly don't know yeah we're talking about that with my future wife because she I don't think we could live there forever no no but I do want to go back often in this one years is my way of committing to them and this is what's crazy man like I'm trying to find a way to turn this huge publicity or they're going viral I was on Jimmy Kimmel and TMZ and the Today Show and now there's gonna be a book and I'm trying to find a way to go from 800,000 views to $50,000 or or even maybe even 200 to 250 which I know that sounds like I'll start a Kickstarter yeah yeah we're on IndieGoGo right now and what is now that goes it's a it was before Kickstarter it's a crowdfunding site so it's indiegogo.com slash projects slash fight - for it's for the fight for the forgotten but hyphens in between it so indiegogo.com slash projects slash fight for the Forgotten but there's hyphens in between fight - and for damn you're making it difficult as fuck for someone to give you some money I know but where you can go to fight for the Forgotten calm and then okay you hit donate and then it would take you the IndieGoGo page all right fight for the Forgotten calm go there please go there and and and donate some cash that sounds that sounds amazing man if we can help you if we can help publicize things we can tweet things for you just let me know you're gonna have any access to the internet while you're out there yeah actually my buddy that I brought in with me the filmmaker he's got a buddy that uh is developing this military technology that's been picked up by them but they can fly like drones and stuff like that from a briefcase and you take this briefcase and you take it to remote places of the world and you set up these four squares or something like that and inside of that you have perfect wi-fi's high-speed stuff so they're trying-- yeah they're trying to see if they could get that to me because I've had zero contact while I've been there so I'd love to be able to Skype with people talk to people from the jungle of the all I need was some power that would definitely help and when you do do that please let us know and we'll tweet it and we'll get it out there to as many people as we can yeah that's great the whole the whole main goal is getting potentially oh well that's that's actually what I would love to do is if we could get Shalom University and it's it shares it at the IndieGoGo page if we get them a research center on the land and I'm talking about 1200 acres of land if we could get them a research center then that would mean they have year-round students on the pygmy land and they'd be able to develop them and different self sustainable ways of life crops water wells all this stuff college students we get credit to develop the pygmies and sustainable ways of life and so the the big goal would be 200 to 250 thousand I think it's right there and it says what it does and it's it's some crazy stuff we're we're I mean I'll read it real quick and but it's yeah so for 200 to 250 thousand this is with the university this isn't something I made up this is what they've been able to say it would it would literally have three to five thousand slaves put on five square kilometers of perfect rainforest five square kilometers of land for under for the the two hundred thousand dollar price but then after that it would preserve the culture of the pygmies it would get water wells he would get nutritious crops growing so not just not just corn and beans but like like good crops it would have a tilapia pond that's stocked so the corn would feed the chickens it would also feed the tilapia and it would feed the pygmies and it just is a self sustainable way of life it could have like earthbag home technology where have you ever seen those the earth back homes or the Eco domes those things brazii yeah so I today one of my buddies was over there having a meeting with them and they might want to support this project where for in the u.s. three to five men it would only take them three to five days to build a three to five room home and it's under three hundred dollars in the US all it is is sandbags sandbags you fill it with dirt and you make this like adobe that you put on the outside of it and so we're trying to get that technology over there to UM Shalom University is like all on board wanting to do that and so really and then it would have that a could have that University Research Center there where they get and that's the thing I don't want this this project I don't want the pygmies to be dependent on me like if I'm only there a year and I can only do a year's worth of stuff I want this thing to be a well-oiled machine that it lasts long after I'm gone and so that way I don't know I want this thing to outlive me if that makes sense I wanted to keep going on it does make sense it's a very noble idea man and listen you've done an amazing thing so far and we're gonna try to help you so fight for the Forgotten com go there and give some money to the what is it Indy go well this IndieGoGo Duncan indiegogo.com find it folks he could find it you're
