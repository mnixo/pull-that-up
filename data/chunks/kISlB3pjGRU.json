five yes yes yes and we're live Brendan Schaub LG bra and fight companion if you've never listened to a fight companion we're probably not going to talk too much about the fights I mean we usually do for sure Felder and hooker we're gonna talk about that fight but there's a lot of fights going on before that we might just talk shit you never know you never know you never know so uh you were just saying that you were in Vancouver they were giving you a heart [Laughter] it's nice right yes David Trump in Chicago wants it's real yeah it's really nice you know my brother's my tour manager he

mind stay in their hotel the hotel each room comes with its own red scarf dude that's what people get home with oh oh like like Epstein I'd say about a red scarf I don't know what it is you tell me what tells the jet man yeah like Bill burr has the best joke where he goes he walked inside a Trump Hotel goes well this woman should be doing like this is these these the hotels are great like this what are you doing you know like this is it man I stated the Trump Hotel in New York before he became president before all the controversy it was so calm like it was great it was just it was just a hotel like you could stay back then now it's like a political statement yeah now it's a little weird but in Vancouver they really don't care but the thing is is it was like I am Legend I was the only person in the hotel just doing whatever I want Africa do you think that the hotel attendance is like way down because Trump is president oh god yes that's right no one's in the 5-star restaurants no one's there man how I want that's our designing I wonder how they how they operate like that strange right you think you just have so much money just keeps it running to kill fuck after the election all calm down yeah great hotel oh man phenomenal hotel great president too edgy brass Trump supporter fuck yeah how do you how do you say this guy's name holy shit I forget how to say his name ain't the one who figured out Russian bad motherfucker is you polish dude that but did you see belt or last night Bruce fought this rushing I think he's Russian he's 23 and oh and I was like yo he's probably like that padded Russian record maybe this dude's takedown defense was fucking filthy cuz Ruth three-time national champion Penn State when the best rest of all-time collegiate wrestling he's like you know the protege and he's the guy who's gonna do it all for Bellator the heat right take single leg dude this dude was sprong took him down I was so impressed man shit what my decision real close decision with the dude is Wow gangster man and that said Bruce first lost then right yeah he's 8 and 1 now he's such a stud yeah I watched a little bit of it but there was too much shit going on

know what's gonna happen but if if while there connect wow there's you saw in the Ortiz fight like he knows how to close the show with one shot and on rematches too like he's gonna know when Fury like all fury has to do is like leave him one opening that's it I thought he needs that's so 12 rounds how many guys didn't he knock out just one just one just one guys in fury well no one's Davern but he went about a knocked him out in the rematch in like 30 seconds this is ready survived the first one which one his record is insane nothing guy who'd survived one and then got knocked out what's his name Stearns earlier he's really early he got dealt with though it like wasn't a good fight I'm sure he's Severns Davern most of over yeah start burn yeah he starts over down in the first fight did he get knocked down yeah yeah not done yeah but in the rematch it was it was a destruction there's memes of it it was like one of the worst not he it's harder than Tyson yes well here's the thing about it man ya know what yes well I would say yes no one could have bigger no one's had a career like him he has 41 knockouts in 42 wins who the fuck has that he's got 42 wins one draw 41 Kos that's crazy on 10 pounds of lean muscle for this fight do you see him in the way and I'm worried about that I'm worried about Tyson Tyson super Tyson pounds heavier than they were when the first shirt on hell any man yes telly excuse me tell you I was talking about that yes you never leave your shirt on at the weigh-ins unless you're fat and to me when I see that and you know Tate entice if it's my favorite boxer but when I see that and his you know he has the mental issues my god that ain't good well what I heard was that he had hurt his ankles and training and he was talking about it say he did something stupid I mean what the fuck did he do that stupid we hurt his ankles I dancing or some shit like he always does Eddie her and said he he saw when I saw something and was like I was I had fury for the rematch eat pretty easily winning by decision because then he saw something because I'd only give it away my money's on wild or now Wow no you never know what that hearing noises lastly

couple of days trying to shake the cobwebs out and then you got a fight Jesus Christ and she won yeah she sucked a little better she's a beast beast she's getting better way better yeah it's interest you know she's only been doing martial arts all just any martial art for 10 years damn where did you growing up nothing ten words out a lot though it's a lot what she heard to start fighting the UFC as they do in martial arts training period for years I was like what that's nothing and but she was already 18 in Oh in my time how crazy is that it's pretty nuts bro that's amazing she's fun was she good interview wow she's hilarious you know who I hate I had a peak go on oh how is he I love him really God you just what used to root for more he's such a good dude he's feel so young you know so just like people have already written him off which is insane crazy that one fight that we saw live on the show that was insane I fell out of my chair yeah one of your cracked yeah well he's with Jackson's now I know and Greg psyched his like mentor he left his hole all his trainers yeah he was out here yeah and then you know he's like the LA hustles rough man I used to be in it were you driving all around he needs like I need one spot so he went to Jackson's one spots the move Manhunter so that's shit to think about man all these people that that have to travel and do you know wrestling over here you just go over there it's like it's gotta wear on you it's gotta wear on you all that Tommy oh Beautiful right hand oh that's well that last line belt or that that other champion he's one of chioma's guys get knocked out my clock is not working by the way oh it's not no it's an error to take making go in five seconds oh oh he's gone oh leg lock look at that Oh interesting look at that shit so you know what you saw you saw that right there you know he did he went for a leg lock didn't work he stood up so that was a that was that could have been planned oh just like gaming my advanced ramp yeah so you can get that sleep down 340 in the clock right now 313 312 311 310 so if you want to sync it up that's where we're at um we're watching my stuff I have I think that's how you say his names versus riddle I liked Hardy as a commentator man dude he's great he's great Dan Hardy's a fucking awesome guy yeah he's just an awesome guy he still wants a fight that's so strange for what um I think he just feels like he wants one more challenge he wants a fight at 170 which is crazy cuz he's real thin now he looks like he weighs about 170 he was always fighting to 170 though I know but he's a really thin now like he was way thicker he's not training so much so I just don't think he lifts weights anymore you know and he was on that vegan he might have been might have gone playing bird shit is so hot right boys flavor shot I was like oh wow it's a hundred eleven pounds he says he feels better than ever but you know what you got to think Rashad was talking about how great his Endurance's if you lose muscle mass you will gain endurance that is a fact you have less tissue they have bodies pumping blood through you have a castle Wow their fight is weird tonight because Wilder gained muscle and when you gain that weight that is more tissue that your body has to pump blood through and we'll see you know because one things about 102 pounds though yeah but then you got to look at you need more work to move stuff because you don't have the muscle I mean doesn't it balance out like that anymore new stuff yeah because you have less muscle right so to move a body you're gonna need more oh yeah so I got in a boxing match in a boxing match like in the first fight Wilder wake 209 pounds crazy yeah crazy and he still was so light walking so light he oneshot and puts puts Tyson Fury down he's got crazy power even at 2:09 but I think there's an advantage for him being really light in that he maintains his endurance like deep into the fight in the 12th round it still has crazy knockout power whereas if he starts to fatigue in the 10 11 and 12 rounds because of extra weight that would be a shame I think he knows that if it goes past like eight he's not he's acting an outpoint fury that happen he has to finish him so he doubled down on that put ten pounds on maybe and then few years ago cool hold my beer and then put on a ton more weigh 270 that ain't good especially with his this style he was a little chubby in the first fight yeah the first fights fine though because he really shouldn't take that fight at the time he felt like to let just tomato cans then they toss them to Wilder yeah it wasn't smart man well we'll see what happens I can't wait I'm interested you know in I'm interested in who changes things up and how they changed things up the thing about Tyson Fury is he's probably the best boxer in the heavyweight division he's six foot nine he's got beautiful movement he switches stances he'll fight you southpaw Orthodox he throws punches while you bitchin but fucking Wilder can turn the lights off with one shot oh yeah well round this what he says he says they have to be perfect for all 12 rounds he goes I just have to be perfect for one second and fury eight fury ain't knocking him out it's not his thing that's nice demo I'm he's doing - I know all right play that game two rounds - no two rounds the winner of this well the you'll probably get a trilogy match gets in their contract they have 30 days or something like that to agree to a trilogy for how it is yeah you know I'd love to see Joshua verse Wilder though hmm I think wow that puts the lights out on that yeah I think Joshua Joshua was an interesting fighter he's smart he's a great boxer but even he's realized that being too bulky cost him so he slimmed down a lot isn't lift weights anymore he looked great against Ruiz he looked committee he's good against true yes he boxed him but I would just like to see him trying to take it to ruiz and get it back get too much on the line didn't got stopped in that first firefight you know I'd like to see him the second fight stop him never really he's got two 80 was how much more in the first fight - 60 60 something care like so he came in pounds heavier in the rematch almost like Rocky - right there it was fat he would've been partying he didn't I don't know if he didn't take it seriously I just think he was having a good fucking time we can't take you serious for him to get overtime yeah we thought it was gonna be a tough fight but also Vanessa loves quesadilla water party and eat all the tacos yeah if that guy got a nutritionist he'd be a light heavyweight you know it's not that big guy no it's not sure yeah good for him though man the roller dance you know he's a fucking phenomenal boxer great hand speed is coordination is incredible I'm excited to see if he gets his shit together I want to see him get his shit together let him fight Ortiz yeah man yeah but he's 85 years old I know but just like a big fat Mexican one occasion I wonder if he's ever gonna be the same again after that right hand pregnant while they're at that right now like you said sixty at least at least those Cubans man I mean everybody says that about the Cubans you really have no idea how old they are and they'll have like 900 fights before they come turned pro like well yeah captain for sure yeah for sure a lot of amateur fights yeah they're talking about Canelo verse Billy Joe Saunders yeah that's kind of confirmed we've been tight like this for a while that's it's my number one fight fight very interesting fight my number one fight is Terence Crawford versus arrow Spence Junior Errol spends junior and Terence Crawford is the number one fight not that fight never gonna see it because no because the stupid promoters in boxing they're ruining boxing way to go guys I don't know there's a lot of money in that fight man there is I come together but it's just like you know it's just like with Pacquiao and Mayweather like we get it four or five years late it's just mailboxes does it's such a shame that's why the UFC went cool story dude and just sailed on past and just crushing it because we get the fights who want to see every time you get the fight you want to see this fights pretty good right here we wouldn't even watch that how do you say it is it Radel or riddle is it possible to put the fight on there too because his heads and do I know the big-ass head this giant maggot hat stay in the Trump Tower wearing a mag ass no brain that's a pretty magnet white supremacy oh my god colors and says we can't wear red hats can't wear red hats at all huh red hat with white letters someone will try to fuck you I wear this make America great again it's all there I wear this all the time oh man you got maced in the face because she hadn't said make Bitcoin great again and so I'm a star in the face fuck yeah look you can't make a Bitcoin grid again also

snow is like it was a commie Central Roast listen you can't buy your way to the white no you can't because they think we'll Trump dude no he didn't he's still got charisma Bloomberg has zero at zero zeros for nothing pop you can't have higher people to write funny things for you that shit ain't no it's terrible for all of its gross I'll deal it from Bernie they're trying to steal it he won today in Nevada Bernie's killing over I'm not out of my boy Pete don't have the experience suck your dick he's fuckin he's his resume is impressive well he's so mayor of a city that's not doing so well and they're not happy with them oh really they know especially the minority population in South Bend it's one of those things where if you're a mayor you imagine first of all it's hard enough being a fuckin mayor alright you have a lot of things to do night man you're also running for president how are you doing that you stopped being mayor last month apparently oh did he step down oh well that's smart that's right yeah this is boyfriend let's trail with them is this husband you piece of shit okay takes over now there's not a mayor anymore that's the same thing for Senate election I kind of senators do that how come senators and congresspeople can be they can be senators and congresspeople and still be on the campaign trail like you're clearly not doing your job no way there's no way how are you allowed to like half-ass your job you just put the other job on the back if you go this is a job congresswoman and a senator and you know like you're definitely not doing the best I don't see how you could there's no way because that's like saying like you could have asked the job like while you're there Yanam that's but you must do something you're running for president if they sign some shit no running for president yeah you're busy but being a senator right but I mean while you're running for president there's no way you could be on top of all the senators get water both laughing good for mayor Pete for stepping away and and giving that job that nobody wants to somebody else yeah I guess I'll do it those guys they get these gigs like that as a stepping stone it's so transparent Oh like when Clinton was mayor of Arkansas or you know of governor of Arkansas who the fuck wants be governor got some big trouble no disrespect Arkansas that's when he got in big trouble big trouble that's when he was getting all the fuss we've dropped in for Barry seals yeah it was dropping that Coke in on Mena Arkansas that's that's the real deal that Tom Cruise moving oh yeah fuck yeah that movies based on a real goddamn story they busted them because these kids got murdered these kids got murdered that found the drop these kids found the cocaine they dropped cocaine out of planes Barry seals was flying in from South America with coke and they were yeah it would push that a parachutes and Mena Arkansas so they would go and pick it up we're talking fucking millions of dollars with a coke and these two kids found it and so they murdered these two kids and left their body on the railroad tracks damn and the official story was they they smoked marijuana got so high that they fell asleep on come on who bud so the parents the parents knew something was wrong they knew this wasn't know how their kids were so the parents got autopsies and they found the kids had been stabbed when you try to blame weed for some shit and you don't know exactly how it works did like a pound of mushrooms you might do yeah walk away from the Train yes you're here too you're out man so this this whole place 15 Arkansas and they were already dead they were already dead before the train ran over what's the move yet he's made in America American made American he was all about Barry seals yes drop in cocaine I mean that guy met with all the major cartel people you know I mean he met with Noriega he met with Pablo Escobar on what my boy Billy had something to do with this Billy Corbin Clinton Clinton oh yeah yeah for sure yeah Clinton was a secure movie Clinton lets him slide in the movie they bust him at one point in time and hasn't released as iran-contra scandal was all connected well listen man they were making money they were making a shitload of money somebody was making a ungodly sum of money bringing cocaine to know who that was we don't know we don't know but we know for sure that at one point in time the government was running cocaine through South Central Los Angeles and my friend Michael Rupert busted that and he got on television in front of fucking what was it was it c-span I forget what a was c-span like LA City Council yes and he said on television I work for the Los Angeles Narcotics Division and we have personally caught CIA people selling cocaine in the interstate and the fucking whole room was going crazy buddies cheering and screaming cuz he said yeah he's still alive no he committed suicide his boss was uh allegedly George Bush singer he was the one on top well that was Freeway Ricky Ross Freeway Ricky Ross was the guy was selling on that shit had no idea that the reason why he was able to move so much coke is cuz he was in business with the government Jesus he didn't even know it Freeway Ricky Ross he's been on the podcast before yeah yeah that's the real Rick Ross like you know Rick Ross the rapper he stole his name from Freeway Ricky and boy did he run with it though yeah he did he ran with his killing it well freely thousands he also owns van der Holyfield's house in Atlanta Oh bro bro nothing's that the Bellagio it's the craziest house you've ever seen well isn't it like 75 bedrooms or something what are you gonna do with that I just watched a van der Holyfield Mike Tyson one the other day on Instagram fuck what a fight dude what a firefight yeah that was one of those fights we couldn't believe it live when they stopped the fight like he did it nuts Holyfield did it bro there was a really interesting interview with Mike Tyson the other day man on his Instagram page my Tyson's a deep motherfucker man he's so deep he been through some shit man he's so deep you know I mean he was just talking about like his life and like what he used to try to say to himself to pump himself up because he has low self-esteem you know what Tom when he was on he was on your podcast right man it one question I want someone asked him as they've mentioned it before but no one ever gets really too deep into it on you know the fact that custom auto had him hypnic he did it he talked about on the podcast in depth and then when cussed I did the hypnotism stop yeah discuss was doing it cosmos a hypnotist when he was 13 was a little kid cuss was hypnotizing maybe a demon you know I mean he hypnotized him into being a machine yes we tell him he would tell well there are so many factors right first of all was his terrible childhood right yes Mike had a terrible childhood no love and then all sudden he finds out that he's crazy and crazy physically gifted like us I mean Teddy Atlas told me that when Mike Tyson was 13 years old they would take him to these little amateur fights and he was a hundred and ninety pounds thirty years old one night he just fucking just a pain just naturally jazz another 13 year olds like what they didn't believe him they made him fight like 16 17 year olds cuz though he's not 13 colles I wonder if there's our end video of him being hypnotized backstage I wonder maybe that was the fucking toast amaz said he would do it backstage before he walked out I don't know about that before the fights backstage well he hypnotized him from the time that he was really young and he told them like like you don't exist it's just the task the task at hand you happiness break these guys down he was still there's all these factors right the guy has no love here's this terrible childhood then he's physically gifted and he winds up with a fucking one of the all-time great boxing coaches particularly for the mind yes and Teddy Atlas when Teddy was young and his prime was also an amazing boxing coach and he's up in the Catskills where he's up in the mountains in this secluded environment so he can concentrate only on boxing he's getting hypnotized and he's watching Jimmy Jacobs has this insane library of fights everything from Jack Dempsey to Joe Lewis Henry Armstrong he's like he's watching the all-time greats he's watching them like in all this black and white footage Jack say oh I don't want a story I don't nobody me but there's so much that led to him becoming you know at least for a few years the greatest heavyweight boxer ever and you think the hypnosis stuff actually worked yeah fuck shit fuck yeah for sure it happened on other people yeah you could hypnotize people look at his face when he'd walk into the ring them early fights he looked like a murderer yeah he was gonna like a monster who's a monster he was incredible man though I mean look no one can sustain the kind of pace that he kept up no early days but man when he like when he still maintained when he fought Marvis Frazier that was as scary as a heavyweight has ever been terrified when he fought Michael Spinks this is as scary as a heavyweight was a phenom right it was just like this what his fight was like everybody shut down watched it yeah starch dudes of people complain he was too short you would think that maybe there'd be some UFC fighters that are like well what's up they are I'm sure they don't Vinnie Sherman does that shit these were Vinny Sherman he's a hypnotist he's also a commentator this is Tyson in the early days - oh that's him at Marvis Frazier look at that face the Marcus Frazier fight dude that was the fight that was the battle scary oh they're asking they're all scared you'd remember Bruce Selden's face oh yeah Bruce Seldon got knocked out by a punch that's the worst because of his afro that's by far the worst ah dude Mike Tyson was just destroying people back in the day just destroying people it was a different time man look at this boom that was when he won the title it was a different you know though the heavyweight division before him was bullsh I still didn't test backboard hey you could say the same thing he did he's that guy that didn't test backed up do you think he was on the sauce Tyson come on bro you think he wouldn't ice it admit that I think he would he would anyone ever asked him let's go question he's so honest I would ask him I would ask you shut up I should have I didn't think that's what they did back then everybody on G was small look at her vander molen Evander hole he could win okay came out of jail though evander holyfield for short did something yeah when Tyson came out of jail when Tyson came out of jail he was so ridiculously ripped what was that McNeely those name think duty fought with yeah yeah go to some poor soul people who boy to jail oh nice and they've got him stakes and Roy he's probably in prime rib every night his time in jail no didn't we talked about so many we were you know after three talking to Mike motherfucking Tyson yeah you don't go too deep three hours yeah for three hours you only get so much you could talk about you know it was it was just incredible to be you know he had the funniest take on him tomorrow Uman come on Ron said he was doing this thing with Mike Tyson he's hanging out he goes he goes then he goes it's like you sitting next to a lion and it's like that's really Mike Tyson it's like a lion's there yeah you're psycho hope he keeps it together I've done a podcast with him and it was like as one of his first podcast is me him and ride was there tightest it Isis on the side me hear that the exact same thing I was like well we didn't freak the fuck out he's in he's in all sweats and he's so out of it like on medication yeah he's I could drugged up blind at that thing yeah I wonder if they got him on medication now if it's just we I think it was before the week he was on his medication and then it was you know not his fault he's kind of out to lunch on these pills but it was a weird podcast in that funny that you guys get on all these pills when we'd just sorts it all out yep for somebody remember that story talked about when he's to date that one Robin Givens and then they broke up never probably married right did they get married to you Mary and then after they got divorced he said he was apparently still banging her every now and then and then he shows up and I get Brad Pitt's with Brad Pitt was thinking he's a whole week [Music] pulls up in a Porsche stay in the room while all the people that should disqualify you from ever dating her to your ex huh who's your ex dude sometimes gross Oh fine you'll risk at all dude Mike Tyson John Jones it don't matter if they're fine enough dude you'll risk it all this is Figueredo who's gonna fight uh Joe Benavidez for the title will they do that title after that what do you do it's hard to get people excited about dudes away 125 pounds unfortunately the hardest just if Mighty Mouse couldn't excite people man I mean Mighty Mouse is the the greatest expression of mixed martial arts talent I've ever seen I've never seen anybody as good as Mighty Mouse and he couldn't get people excited nobody wanted to buy those nothing pay-per-use nothing yeah it's unfortunate yeah it's a bummer but I think it Mighty Mouse did the right thing going to Asia is the right move because they love them all they love them out there and let me guess this Joe when when you see if the main event 125 pound fight versus a light heavyweight fight or heavyweight fight you feel different about it depends exciting when Mighty Mouse fought so who died was very except the first time the second the second time the second time yeah but you see I was excited to it is what it is though cuz 125 pounds but if I see you know John Jones versus da McRae's or John Jones or steep you know steep bay or something like that yeah I get your dick hard did you know you're about to see some shit yeah those little guys it's just it is what it is man it is what it is it's unfortunate you're always gonna get the most excited when like we're gonna watch Tyson Fury Deontay Wilder tonight heavyweights as heavyweight division goes so does boxing that you could say that about MMA to I think with MMA is different there's still real exciting fights in the other lighted divisions and there is in boxing as well like I said air sprints junior Terence Crawford that's if I don't want to see but like in the UFC I like welterweight 170 middleweight 185 155 145 male do my it is fucking crack it let's crack one through 15 is bad fight 50 45 to 25 is just 20 pounds that's a big deal though the biggest deal it's weird a huge deal it's weird the UFC's never been better it's it's so not so much not so deep what do you think about how to sonya saying he wants to fight steep a steep a he's crazy he's tall enough yes he's tall enough he's got the friends a big boy man I think he probably walks around about 210 215 maybe I don't see anything wrong with that so he would only have to gained like 20 pounds he would he would like to steep a up on the feet there how long do you think stupid keep it on the feet that's that's the question what he wanted wrestle but also see bacon look what's his wrestling Cleveland State Division one double a national champion know Stevie's a beast man she's an enormous man - I mean steep a is an enormous s4 yeah base thick is fuck he's a fighter he's walking around 250 solid as a rock you know 250 doesn't have an injury or something yet some rough time so he's got a bunch bro how's he gonna come back after that well he may not Maury might he might not I mean I think I mean I don't want to say too much about what his injury yeah how open he's behind but they if he could fight he would be fighting right now they would set up that rematch with DC that's what they would do what a 3-part through you yeah that's the day we do that's what they're I'm swimming for John you got a fucking heavyweight did Johnny heavyweight is X I it's the only things I very exciting very exciting very exciting it's interesting now I want to see the Dominic Rhea's rematch as much as I want to see that I want to see that fight they're talking about yeonbok ovitch I know which is interesting I mean I'm interested in seeing that but I just don't think he's gonna be able to stop John from taking him down you know I yeah he's gonna have a problem with that sure cuz Corey Anderson took him down shit load in the murse fight John is a different beast whore Corey Anderson dunno he's for sure gonna get that title shot building up talking shit to Johnny got starched they just got cleft lip playing that gage home bitch fucking he can crack see what he did to Luke I know broke Luke's jaw I know he punches fucking hard man and at light heavyweight he's not depleting himself anymore he's a good example of a guy who went up and it worked and it worked worked for spectacular yeats whatever the fuck he wants now who knows man I mean where John is now you know I mean John has the toughest fights with guys that he's not totally pumped for yeah I'm saying makes sense yeah my job Jones that's something to go to fucking heavyweight before it's too late man got every way to fight DC how about that that's what I'm saying you got Steve a there you got over what Francis if if DC Rosen tries to fight one more time and he wants to fight John and heavyweight I mean that would that would maybe be one fight that he would get outside of Steve Bay because he said it's steep a can't fight anymore he's probably done you know what do you mean that's a DC I'll do if he don't oh he's 40 years old yeah you're right yeah I mean and he's had a great life and he has an amazing career as a commentators one of the best commentators ever you guys are great together he's fun I love that right so if he wants to if he decides that this is it you know that could be that could be it John might get him out of bed for that though yes Jonathan have you it yeah I'm like do it if DC decides that he doesn't have to lose weight you know like one we give one more shot at John Jones that heavy weight I like his chances better than the light heavyweight they fought two or three times two times two times yeah do you think it like every way John has too much of advance cuz DC DC you never be my light heavyweight we just on the issue Scotty books for yeah it's just not there I'm for it's on for trial FTC have you wait though DC you know he can crack a little bit I've not to see a heavyweight yeah he'd still be an underdog but it's definitely better his odds definitely get better as the weight goes up DC's an amazing heavyweight man he just stupid against eBay but who knows how good John will be at heavyweight I've seen with other heavyweights here X all he dragged dolls bitches he's a beast man nice and he's walking around a natural 234 right every bit of it John's also get an Old Earth oh man is one site called is it 31 32 that oh no I said miles on him though he's got a lot of miles he slowed down a tad let's just call it what it is it's what you got a wonder how much of that slowing down is his enthusiasm how much of is physical what can we write yeah I mean maybe if a big fight comes up like a steep MeOH I know or Francis you're right you're right and that I said yeah you're right I I go back in front of yo maybe Sloan dad's getting older and I go or maybe he just doesn't give a fuck about these contenders he's fighting and you know he's out partying and got a super ball and then he's like here the week before the fight is that the Super Ball he can't fly you know beat them again cool yeah fight yawn what yeah we're yeah let's do it but then he hey you got Francis you make one wrong move and you get knocked out I bet we see a fucking gnarly ass John Jones he had a couple of years off because involves troubles outside of the Octagon right two years where he really wasn't fighting but other than that he's had nine solid years against World Championship as well they never did anything to him no money he never he never told us tusen damage the one fight where he didn't train Gustafson just didn't do a lot of damage one fight and shit yes that's basically know that he's yeah you're right he starts to everybody hurt his elbow on that Hamels face he's never been knocked down right no never been knocked down I mean he slipped against Thomas by Dominic hit him in the chest and knocked him down but it wasn't a knockdown like Tyson Fury Deontay Wilder you know wasn't that kind of not just when took him down that was doing time he got taken down is that the only time yeah DC didn't take him down yeah I'm excited to see that rematch I think I think Dominic raves it'd be even better in the rematch I think Dominic Reyes realizes now it's all about having the energy in that third fourth and fifth round and haven't I already been to the top of the mountain and and face the dragon I think he's gonna come back by the now here's the thing that dragon and rematches gets way better and goes oh you're an actual threat I'm gonna prepare for it this time yeah he fucks dudes up and rematches yes offense starts DC starts oh yeah yeah I'd like to see it I want to see what Reyes can do to when Reyes Reyes got that rub now right Ray's is gonna come into that second fight knowing that he came a a cunt hair away from being the light heavyweight champion here and you know I mean one judge gave it to John four rounds to one which is nothing embarrassingly bad like I owned the MMA gym as well what's so hilarious that crazy well he also got get off his nuts yeah it's just a song Jesus doesn't make it out you know what people just look at fights differently sometimes you know what I mean because back you know there's dudes look at rounds where even to this day where a guy gets taken down and he doesn't do any damage but he you know and they'll still give it to the guy on the bottom just cuz the guy on top didn't do any damage you know to me and then there's uh guys that for sure no matter what if you get a takedown you're gonna win around the the other guy didn't get it takedown right and there's guys that I mean in the early 2000s that I knew some judges I don't want to say any names but they would give up they would give around to a dude who escaped a bunch of submissions because that guy had him in great positions and he couldn't play his game he couldn't implement his game and he had all this great position on him had his back in the escape so I'm gonna give it to the guy who escaped like Shane show yeah there's there's guys like that out there so it's not necessarily that you know the retardation was it Ricardo him out I'll meet a judge for a second he was and he's just thought he's like I fuck this nice he's too busy successful school you know it's got that big school od guards up there with him know he is he really my mother Henry interesting gets very mastered it's a very good match for him to calm him down make him fight more tactically don't don't let him get caught in the slide that's Pico was saying when he went to Greg Jackson's they just they're trying to get him out of that six gear like didn't we you don't have to finish this guy in five minutes right use your skills and they're like trying to harness them just because when he seemed fight it's just there's so much fuckin passion they just wanna destroy people oh he has a ridiculous power but he also he also destroys people in training like world class got destroyed the stories about him are insane man just I mean I'll tell you I fear I'm knocking guys we know where he just mops the floor with them so he gets in there with a guy who's four and one or five when he's like oh I'm gonna fuck this dude up and he gets so antsy and wants to get him out there that's when he gets caught well it's also he's standing up with everybody he's got an incredible wrestling pedigree and here he is standing up with everybody he's not threatening with the takedowns yeah at the very least look if you're fighting an MMA fight right at the very least you should make it so that the opponent has no idea what you're gonna do you know and he doesn't do that his problem is he's also a world-class boxer yeah like work like threat when I talk to Freddie Roach about him he goes oh he could be a world champion box right now at 140 he's gonna be a world champion that's crazy he was i he was it when he was younger I used to toss him in there with Mikkel Miguel Cotto world champions you know and he held his own won some rounds my flat fucked he wasn't he was a kid that's crazy yeah it's nuts man he's such a is he now 23 22 or 23 Wow lives in Albuquerque has horses there also you bought a farm out there yes yes like you just moved her thing out there it means everything everything got horses he's in full control of you know booth with Greg Jackson and they're just doing work man Wow it's a good story that's a very good story that's interest when she comes world champion right if they can turn him around he said he walked like he was thinking about what coach is gonna work with and he walked into correct Jackson's but just his office was like right away I was like oh this is this is home really as I moved a week later why did what was it about just said there was some weird connection there where like mentally there he was just on the same way path it was just like yeah this is it man well he's like I've never felt better I've never you know and I get it Greg Greg's a mastermind man Greg's the to me the best there is how many people do they have at Jacksons if ter guess like how many fighters I haven't been there so long I don't know there's a ton but when I hear all like the the drama every Big Jim has drama but Jackson just gets out there more because the guys talk about it but it's just like they're like oh he gives John Jones too much attention you talk about the best fighter of all time tella the the best fighter of all time yeah yeah yeah yeah no shit dude of course yeah and these other these older fighters I kid it man you know but take you know Johnson up he's still there man he's in the race while you guys aren't yeah so if you're Greg it's tough to figure out dealing with these personalities you only have so much time man he's also the figures stars so he's like the Phil Jackson you have Michael Jordan over here yet Scottie Pippen yeah Dennis Rodman you got all these guys in trying to manage everyone's ego and animate just a different animal and you got Mike Smith sitting over here guys I'm on the team too ya know we know we know dude cuz Mike Smith a real guy just made him up yeah they're probably those Jim dynamics it happened in Denver man everyone got you guys got famous next thing you know your coaches wearing a shirt that conflicts with your sponsor but he's getting paid it's just crazy he's doing the interviews and shit that's what's happening they're sponsorships on his mitts fuck dude really no yeah that's crazy if a coach is wearing some shit that conflicts with your sponsor training you that is not good how do you work that out I mean you know that that's business dude coach got to pay the rent to kids - just fucking doing this for free no no so chatty over here yeah it's like relax every once everybody's you said blow our sponsors all over about the I have no personal sponsors hey are you working with Tony will you been doing with them Samms we've been preparing for khabib for a long time yeah for the dos Anjos fight we were preparing for him but we were also preparing for we're always preparing for the worst-case scenario and khabib is the worst case scenario he's probably the best ground-and-pound er wrestler ever right this is the toughest the toughest challenge ever for in MMA for 10 planet that's for sure this is that I mean this is it this is this is the worst-case scenario that I've been talking about this is what I prepare for every me personally my Abu Dhabi is at the gym when we have drop-ins and since 2003 and I mean who knows who's gonna drop in that night and challenge me so my I always prepared for the worst-case scenario some drop in is 190 who wrestled his whole life soo and what am I gonna do with them that first round the the the only round we go with probably one round maybe two I'm just I'm just focusing on stuff that he's never seen because I come at him with stuff he's seen then that's not a good that's not a good strategy I'm gonna pull him into some some uncharted territory and that's what we're doing that's what I've been doing with Tony he's pretty much just uncharted territory we're gonna you know we the thing with khabib khabib is he's undefeated no doubt one of the best fighters probably of all time yeah yeah one like you know again right three but you got to remember this - I Quinta maybe there there are some there are a couple could be fights we watch all the could be fights where you do see where he you don't see the classic could be like with Gleason to bow that didn't go down like like I missed the holy carries he heavy weight got knocked out boy nation got knocked out Jamie's over here watching the fight he has a mullet like Theo fuck watch that what I was saying was there are some fights where it could be was too much what human there are couple you also look at that dishonest fight he clearly won that but that was things that he couldn't do that he could do with other people dos Anjos dishonor he couldn't get past us on your guard you know what I mean it wasn't that easy to take down um you know and Tony you know is when you compare like you know the Conor fight with khabib you know Tony wrestled this whole goddamn life Tony's there's a light-year difference between Conor's wrestling and Tony's wrestling right so you got that Tony will throw Darcis standing and from all different angle in like oh you're trying to take him down so could be it's got to worry about that there's gonna be Darcis coming on the field don't give up too much weight everybody knows that you can watch that no I'm only giving away stuff that you can watch off yeah you know what I mean I'm not yeah yeah are you gonna be there ii was i happen to be in Brooklyn for that yeah yeah and so we're focusing on the stuff you know when when khabib has his way when he when he's in a fight where everything's going his way you know it's against the fence so there's there's a look against the fence that he always has it's that same look and then when he drags the guy down it's that same look and when they are halfway back up there's that look and then they're back on the fence there's that position that look boom so when it comes to khabib I mean it's gonna be the hardest challenge ever right and for both guys yeah for sure for sure but the advantage that we have is we know exactly where the fight is going to be if khabib gets like you're successful if he's successful and there's there's different phases there's the stand-up days there's the clinch there's the the fighting against the fence there's the dragging and then there's that in between the fence and dragon we know where the fight can be you know the one thing we don't know is how is it going to look is it gonna look like you know khabib has his way and passes Tony's guard like he has against other opponents or is it gonna be like Gleeson - Bower he's having a hard time taking him down and he's having he's never getting inside control never passing the guard against Gleeson is it gonna look like that how is it gonna look they could look so many different ways we'll never really know until they match up you just don't realize I don't weigh but I will I will see this is we got all sorts of landmines waiting for wheels back yeah we know where the fight where he wants to take the fight and there's gonna be some traps there all sorts of huh and no one knows about we're not talking about it but we've been working on this for a while so who knows what's gonna happen khabib has all you know has my respect a million percent is that guy's insane Tony tony has so many goddamn weapons so many do you two might have more weapons he might have more weapons than anybody in the history of the UFC that's fair you might have to be hard or yes a great scrambler there's so many different areas get it everything about this in the history of MMA who has no more Ford arcing than him no nobody no no close the one thing I'm fucking he catches him late in the fight when everyone's covered in sweat and blood like barbozza yeah yeah he the Darce is one of those techniques that is you could learn really the learning part is the easiest part like learning how to do a Darce could be that two minutes two minutes but mastering it and mastering it enough to be known for it and getting grown-ass men who are experts in it ground fighting on it that's all that very few people reach that status again they're Darcis everybody knows that arts every grappler in Abu Dhabi but like the last Abu Dhabi 2019 every grappler on the card knows how to do a dart stay know how to teach it they could do a seminar no but no one did it only one guy oh the route oh lo one of the rotolo twins he's from autos that guy and like he was parson he was the worst arse is all over the place why everybody else out her to him how come he was only able to do because he's strategizing for it he's looking for it and and and the strategy is not like a thing that he's thinking about consciously it's in his DNA that's the different reasons because he's old he's looking for it subconsciously it's in his strategy it's in his DNA that's how that's how Tony is tall man and not we're not I'm not satisfied with him just knowing it dude we work on he or he has a mastered but we're working on it even more and making sure that if khabib is caught and one of those things were making it so we're making sure that that thing is fucking excited when Poirier caught him in that guillotine his Poirier had him in a guillotine port is a black belt - yeah guillotine yeah he's a good one yeah you know what anybody can lose you know I mean Kabila's not invincible what there's some fights where he'd look like he said human you know and we watch those fights and we see we see where you know he has you know not quite I mean yeah they're exactly yes the big thing too is Tony's cardio is just ridiculous yeah my second and none his car is so fucking good it literally ridiculous because he'll have a crazy super high fast-paced fight and then you look at him he's not even breathing heavy his stomachs not even moving he loves and and he throws elbows more than your average UFC fighter probably like elbows are like I think I think dependent abhi wants to do no matter what happened in this fight III see cab even Tony fighting a few times I think those are classic kind of a who knows villagey ones then who know they match up just so weld I guess please gods of war get them together in April I saw Tony's jumping running on her tires it's old oh is that all well thank God yeah man there's this is awesome Tony man where it says where they show on this guy from like it's like in the middle of a canyon in some like forest and there's like a tight he's like walking a tightrope it's like some dude is walking a tightrope with like a balancing pole you know it says something like Tony when Tony trains or so it's he's he's extreme and that's what makes him who he is yeah what kind of wacky shit is he doing when you train with him dude he's got you know he's man he's got this I don't even know how to explain it I don't know what to talk about you really can't give up secrets he's just on top of like the later the latest shit you know just the latest training instincts training reaction he's super into like like shit the NBA would be doing like what I can't even explain it you're not trained you're not supposed to talk about it I don't want to talk about it okay let's go to the fight yeah please don't need to know is Darcis and elvis in poster dogs great that poster is amazing although tony is taller that's weird they have it like that anybody tell her it's quite a bit taller yeah it's where they have my god super long arm see that's why it's abortion those arms dude what those are those darts is coming from everywhere that posters amazing if that poster up again the posters dope that poster gives your heart that's all you need oh dude look that's the best fight in the UFC go make it sorts of normal size yeah look at that fuck they got that one right they got that one perfect that to me is the greatest fight ever in the light have the light weight to 100% the greatest fight ever arguably arguably greatest fight ever yes yes that's the greatest ground and pounder right took out Conor choked his ass out fucking everybody up and then here comes Tony the fucking wild enigma you coming at you from a thousand different angles fight gives me chills man just stop and think about what Tony's been able to do to people to like think about what he did a cowboy he just he just takes guys that look like world-class fighters and he makes him look like they have no business being in there with nothing about Pettis yeah he's Josh Josh Thompson no to me that was a great fight two heavenly famous anos yeah you remember when he threw that spinning elbow and then he threw another one right off that he's so good that's just that's one of his that's one of his most powerful weapons is that he doesn't he does not hesitate to pull the trigger he's never cautious you know a lot of guys you know you hear about these guys like the goal is to take what he does in the gym out to the ring that's the goal if we could do that he's gonna be unstoppable Tony that from day one he was healed anything he does in the gym he's gonna do in the ring no hesitation you know what I mean there's he doesn't ever hold back on pulling the trigger it's a very exciting fight it's the best spinning elbows in a rolls now has anybody ever done that nuts I mean probably but no one at a level that Tony's fighting at yeah I don't think in the UFC anybody's thrown to fuckin fuckin elbows man in a row he don't give a shit Pecos was talking about uh what deca stallion is that he's a tech staying guys and he said Greg Jackson goes basically told me this is you have you're obsessed with training yeah that's all I like to do and Greg's like where does that come from he goes because a few years ago and even before that I'd go training dagestan and see the young kids there he goes so at night all I do is picture those young kids he's a guy they're not messing around then he wasn't they're starting to make their way here but we haven't seen anything yet here so I think of them and that's what I said that they in Pico okay because he was out there training he's describing himself well he was like yeah he has but he goes you go out there that that's all they care about he's like and so that's why I try to take the same kind of approach you think people don't realize what those kids he's like I'm telling you man well we're starting to find them over here yeah he was there trickling in is but wait for it here's what he goes you if you went over there blow your mind crap you know you're all free you remember I I was working with Aaron maybe 10 days that's right you know where I fucked up I fucked up really really bad the day I met him also the day I met him because in my experience you know we talked about this before I've know I work for the UFC for eight years backstage I'm talking to all these fighters I see them come and go and when they go I remember how they go they go because they couldn't handle the worst-case scenario it's either a guy that takes them down at will and they can't do anything about it or a guy that beats them up on their feet and they can't take them down so that's usually when people when people get cut from the UFC it's because they lost and there's only a couple ways they lose it so what's the worst-case scenario they couldn't handle the worst-case scenario so and you you constantly see these world-class grapplers having you know striking coaches that convince them to strike and then they listen to the striking coaches and now they're world-class grappler and they're striking so I didn't know anything about Aaron Pico follow wrestling I didn't know anything about him Joe Tex and goes dude there's this dude Aaron Pico he's a good wrestler he wants to come train with you a text like that means nothing to me I just even from Joe it just nothing to me how many how many texts do I send Joe someone trying to get ahold of Joe I said to him just cuz I I'm the dude he send them some he said to me it's like he knows I'm not gonna respond exactly exactly so anyways so then he finally he finally kept bugging Joe and Joe said dude and I said okay because I'm come to the gym like I don't I'm not looking for new and I'm a guy yeah I'm not looking for that no I'm just focusing on my school my students if you want to join in then you can join it I'm not looking for anybody alright so he shows up to the gym I didn't know anything about him and you know and he told me about his wrestling background and then Joe is telling me then I looked up I before he showed up I did look like I did look him up and I'm like Fogg this guy's an amazing wrestle cold English it pays shit about him right so I told him I said this might be the last day I see him dudes come and go all the time I don't know how long he's gonna stay so I told him I said listen my advice to you if I was on my deathbed I'd say don't listen any striking coach is trying to tell you to strike you stick to what you're good at you take dudes down you pound the shit out of I mean you work on passing the guard and choking him out okay Joe and I had no idea this whole training camp was all about staying up on his feet and striking so I'm telling him I'm telling him not to listen to coaches yeah so once I found that out once I started talking to his coaches and all the show I'm like oh my god what the fuck did I tell them no I just assumed that he was gonna you know the game plan would always be generally 90% of the time take the guy down pound the shit out of him pass his guard mound I'm taking his armor take his neck that's what I assumed but I had no idea that that was not the plan so he came to me for like last resort stuff like if the fight you know ended up on the ground you know against his will he would know some shit right he would know some ground ship but so I told him basically not to listen two coaches that have been with him his whole life you try to help them since he was a kid so right away I got off you know we got out I got off on the wrong foot that's all I'm sure you understood one thing I'm kind of right but the one thing I worked with him a few times and I always I always looked at it like this could be the last day I see this guy yeah it happens all the time so I wanted to make sure I left him with someone if he went with someone else I want her to leave like a little mark and you know what he got me so we went all in with the truck and the twister heavy great things about well tell him I said thank you and he did leave with that he was the last time you know before he ended up you know going his own way and all that that's who it is shut the door bitch he did he did feel really crying counts here ladies and gentlemen he made cheese he brought grocery bags because you're one

wants out well I think you'll see I think she got poked earlier in the fight manchego anyone is that what it's called manchego 12:12 month day how do you know what to buy how do you know this shit Matt do you know about cheese I'm mr. Krabs I grew up yeah I'm a foodie cuz O'Brien uh cuz we school on the road together he won't let me eat that like any chains takin all these like special places now I'm exact same way ah that's so weird I know I need to I fuckin need to what's that I'm also just eating meat now at four doughnuts yes with I felt like last night I cheated I I was I've cooked for my kid and she wanted pasta and steak so I cook steak for us and then pasta and there was a little bit of pasta left over I'm like let me see how much a small bowl how much shitty to harden yourself fella shit right after I ate it I've been eatin almost only meat and eggs you're over the last few months no good dude I feel amazing and I need to do something feel amazing what's amazing feel like like you wake up in the morning what's amazing my energy levels are like the same you're fucking out no a shadow I'm a little aggressive but do you not need a nap no no naps no nothing dude when I eat pasta or bread everything crashes I just think my system me I've heard people say to when you get older that your body just doesn't want to eat that stuff anymore true I don't understand how that's possible is it possible that when we were young we just weren't aware of our bodies I don't know I just I feel like I need less food or I'm more sensitive allowed I feel all the exact opposite you guys I feel like my body wants more like donuts and like I want donuts yeah believe me it's my brain my brain wants don't ya so bad do I take my kids to this donut shop on the way to school sometimes what's it called Oh tell anybody voodoo doughnut it's a good doughnut shop is it against a local place okay and so but when we go there it's so hard for me to say no to the doughnuts but when I say yes I always feel like a piece of shit it wasn't even that good doesn't even that good in the rest of daylight but boo do doughnuts damn that shit the crazy thing about voodoo doughnuts they got I got children's coffins in the shop I don't know what the purpose is but that's pretty fucking awesome Illuminati shit bro you should be dude they got children's conference into it she is stoked no doubt Karolina so you know I hadn't never look into shit like that it's a different body I'm the Asian the Chinese young lady different body but yeah it's very trapped out trapped out with the easily yeah yeah she just with some traps and shoulders loose oh she's fit sometimes I say a gal that goes across fit yeah Carolina's having a hard time with that right I she's protecting outfits it's a real struggle when we get to the main you need the Crescent kick right to that thang boom mmm Crescent kick hell yeah so he don't feels like the owners never saw throwing a crescent kick in the MMA Jackie Chan derson Anderson threw a crescent kick at somebody want I don't think he ever did inside kick like that this way inside is this way oh no no no but what about hitting with the inside of your foot Jackie Chan oh yeah no he hit with the outside this is the last round I think that's how you think is the outside axe kick maybe I'm confusing them cuz axe kick the outside goes like this he's right down inside goes like this keeps his keeps going good job it's hard for these people that realize that title contention is kind of out for them and then they just keep fighting because someone says hey do you want to make 50 grand it's a bummer yeah well I need 50 grand but how is he gonna make 50 grand exactly how else are you gonna make 50 grand but here's the thing about the UFC that people always talk about like Oh fighters make so much more well not really see at the top of the heap fighters make more but it's only like Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao when you look at the top levels of boxing versus the top levels of MA MMA fighters make a lot of fucking money but then when you look at the undercard the top with the top guys make the big money but the undercard in boxing Harold's dog shit they paid you nothing but all the money goes to guys like Canelo all the money goes to the Earl Spencer juniors it turns Crawford's when it gets down to the actual undercard fighters they make fucking chump change and you're saying the UFC they pay make reforms better in networks the undercard guys make more in the UFC and they do now in boxing matches but God she's black terrible she's about to do that three-piece soda thing right there she please peace in a soda you see that she was like sit back like sodas when he boxed up Leon Edwards in the back I guess I'm gonna think of George but yes I suck on them what do you think about Maz Vidal versus oozma I love it what I love it well I just love the fact that maza doll is gonna fight for the title as Mossville Oliver been on your podcast yes yes he's greatest that shit yeah he's great he's great I love him I love that dude I think he's been in my gym a couple times I love that guy I told him I said hey dude I got a move called three-piece in a soda after you and he goes dude I kind of know it show it to me I gotta know it I it so if someone asks me I have to know it it's just the combo to pass it's a three piece and the sodas ahead it's a the chest pass okay got it like I'm on top one pissed push the legs to the side to grab the hips three grab the trap and the soda is the head in the chin so that's a three piece in the south I love it wet though what is the white cheese what does that make a Brie it's a soft milky open that up daddy a beautiful what up cheese daddy now as you got you in a cheese oh yeah nonno was really in a weird cheese Bourdain he would he would be in the stuff that stunk like stinky cheese I don't like that don't know man we used to add stinky cheese stuff when we did fear factor to make it smell worse to make people more disgusted we would go to this very all of this rolling no too far it's too high up she's too high up not totally but I'm not buying it the formaggi a look at that oh shit shit Oh crazy things Chinese girls tapping oh I don't know about that she just just turned over that leg she's in trouble that girl's a break that trouble yeah she's so what she's in real fucking trouble snappy that's an example of people always say oh leg locks are dangerous in MMA some are yes some are but some aren't some can actually save you in MMA some leglock positions if you're fucked up and you know shit that she can't she can reach her face here so this this that when you reap if you're reaping you're safe bro she's tearing this girl's knee apart what's what you do she's doubling this that ain't working she's going up danger Lina is not she's out she's not the reason he's in big trouble that Jill I mean it's not she's not guaranteed that she's gonna tap her but she's still in danger in real danger especially given how high the shit she can transition here shit she sliced that light look at her she's doing better now yeah you got to realize not here Elena's in the third round she's been getting she's gonna get her again she's gonna push that reap watch she's gonna push her right leg push that rip it up she's again she's in danger again interesting he's got what his widest shit see yes yeah she's polish as wide as he can see yeah that's a mommy foot right there she gets his every count reap oh my gosh she wins this I'm going to lose my fucking mind why because I just okay the reaps out now now the research is just a gloss it cut well she she look on the right foot she got in half Wayland where she was kind of half in on the reap and half in on the guillotine that's the widest foot I've ever seen that foots time walking right foot is dead where is this being fought by the way this is in New Zealand if she underhook the girls know that's like oh yeah had she under had you know to us that's nothing that's nothing it's nothing nothing with the right see her right arm if she under hooks that left ankle if she under and then takes that leg to the other side and takes her left leg and puts it on her other side on her left hip that's honey hall right there that's a whole different game she just can't reach that foot her left foot she can't reach it if she could under hook that left ankle and pass it to the other side of her body roof it over right that moon but he's not thinking about she's just thinking about that he'll look she should take it over to the inside look at what she gonna do it she's travelled he's going back to the hill oh now she's on top she used the leg lock to get on top look at that she's the leg lock to get on top that's it that's a part of the game that we we in that we haven't really seen that much that's what I always find look she's on top now rightful got a leg lock and now she's on top though it's too late but it's a shit transition it's interesting how many different layers there are to jujitsu on the ground it was the scrambles on the ground there's so many layers and sometimes you only see people it's like people having a conversation when they have a real limited vocabulary versus someone who's like very eloquent who knows all the different words and all the different ways to use them the game keeps growling it keeps growing I pronounce it [Applause] sure did you see her face sorry she wasn't longer dangerous it's the main event next we got sakes nope fuck man she what is the next fight

don't you don't think science just made up the coronavirus y'all think Chinese I think viruses can sometimes spring up on their own the only bio lab that deals with that in China is in whoo that is true that's the only one there there are legitimate scientists that are speculating that this might have been something that was accidentally released from lab and although they don't contain those things very well particularly when you're dealing with a country like China that doesn't have the same sort of standards that like when you have in galveston at the CDC Center where they have things like Ebola and all these different things in the containment they have incredibly strict procedures they used to handle that stuff loosey-goosey they didn't that main guy who was dealing with coronavirus that the chinese guy he died for me it was blowing the whistle on the corona virus and then he was censured by the Chinese government did die they problem yeah oh he died in a fucking Club

packed it brings out the best in you right know your best performances are in front of packed houses and they're screaming but a lot of comedians never get to that point so it's like a catch-twenty you never see the best of them and Sam Tripoli it took a while for him to get to that point but now he's at that point dude I am a witness I watch him smash high-level dude smash performing with him forever I would watch that guy I have the best set of my life he'd come up and follow me and do 50 minutes across Afghanistan when we went there for the USO tour he would be the one because all this were too afraid to open because it like you know you didn't know you'd be like Afghanistan to those who spent two weeks there and Sam me Doug Davidoff and Steve Byrne went there and Sam would open not cuz he would not cuz he was he wasn't opener at all cuz he's fine he's all of us but he was so good at getting the crowd going and his improv he was just I called he's the monster he's the best he did so just had kids he just had twins baby jokes the baby Joe can be fun oh yeah oh yeah hmm so what is the co-main is this the COMESA coming okay mmm doo doo doo doo that that knee brace you do yeah I don't like that I see a dude with a knee brace unless the sakuraba soccer trick he could be his other knee that's hurt you know this dude on the right so that's what I would do if my right knee was there I'd have a brace on my left knee solarium I think it's a pole why do you say that thinking appalls did you guys see this gentleman fall from that pole [Music] Joseon stars Tweety Bird hi DJ that a strip club for ten years and mice the strip pole at my club was probably one-fourth of that that was fuckin hundred why would they do that why would they do that yeah what are you doing cuz they don't have any regard for the safety of the gals that work there how dare you it's some dangerous shit plus they have a high ceiling and they wanted a pole people people just they just don't respect the work you know that Paul sure that's dude come lose our tie the other guy on a pole that's a real shit I don't want to talk about it there was the pole dancing class whoo oh yeah I think she's still got a flex is still there what I went to when we used to train at legends rather there was that pole dancing class Chris Reilly's girl used to teach right next to it for the longest time lemonade's cute and the same thing as a pole and then you'd hear like some Nine Inch Nails and shit in the background you're like closers that we had on the east side was sketchy neighborhood but a great spot that's the diesel where we filmed me and GSP working out together doing turnouts that that was the spot where Michael Jai White sidekick the bag and said it flying and snap white is legit as fuck he's legit as fuck we were talking about sidekicks and Michael Jai White who was Akio Christian guy he did a hopping sidekick on this bag and fucking sent it flying it snapped the chain chain had problems but it was it didn't look it's not normal that someone throws a kick on a bag and the chain breaks the chain had probably did a chain was that Chris had told us the chain was falling apart it popped before but it was the perfect explanation it was a perfect demonstration of his technique it was like a scene in a movie where the scene was me blowing you up for 20 minutes on how amazing your sidekick is and how you fold bags and this and that and and all these stories about your sidekick and it goes oh really and then he looks at the bag and he throws a sidekick and he breaks it off the ceiling and I'm like there goes my seat great guy - he's a great smart guy he's a really smart guy Michael Jai White is he's like all the guys who've never fought in MMA or you know like fought professionally he is his technique is as legit as you're ever gonna see as legit as anybody like his wheel kicks roundhouse kicks his sidekicks everything's perfect guy I think where he got in trouble is he did that video trying to give you know Kimbo and some other guys like advice on fighting yeah I think he the way he was explaining that kimmo didn't want to listen some people thought was disrespectful particularly because kimbos dead you know I wouldn't mean you could you know I just think all of this kid where come or come on over to robbing the house over the head that's over yeah he that that fighting he didn't let that dude breathe no damn he's good his grappling with going on what's his pedigree that's Mike Bernardo Mark Bernardo a former big-time kickboxer goat the fucked up knows in his corner where is it from from Poland oh okay damn tore him up what we can say about Michael J all the other guys from Poland know that kids from pulling a Kreutz from Poland as well you think roots American I think he's American oh no you New Zealand I'm sorry he's from New Zealand that's why you like that's like came out like a fucking banshee yeah oh that makes sense when you step over with that left leg horse hard it's so hard to get on the Frank Mir Nogueira member that crap oh boy stepping over your head like that you don't just how much you're in that position you just kind of late you don't tell them I said you're on unless you're fixing Gracie oh that's not good dude no yeah it's gonna be sore in the more well the problem is it's tearing shit inside of his shoulder that might never be the same again you know I told you when I got an MRI on my shoulder was having some problems and they said your shoulders been dislocated and I'm like I don't know maybe you don't know that your shoulder was dislocated I'm like I don't know okay how did your shoulder you dislocated your shoulder ever been in a bad position I started laughing yeah and I was like yeah like fucking 20 times a week like what are you talking about like if someone gets you in a Kimura and you don't tap your shoulders in a bad position all the time like all the shit that goes on there's little pieces of stuff probably floating around inside my shop yeah it's the same gadget warrior Gavin O'Connor good so I should pass on this movie to well the problem was the fact they fought two days in a row which is never gonna in the history of the world you didn't have to do that that movie this is the problem with fucking movie producers they do move warrior there's some crises there's some great scenes in warrior but they decided to get lucky with it when they get fucky is when they they make things happen that would never happen like guy fighting hardcore cage fights two days in a row you don't do that the next day you're a wreck on a railroad track you barely walk that's also why you hate fucker that's your - right Foxcatcher date that's even worse I love that folks catcher they changed a real story they fucked with a real story well here's a big part they made Mark Schultz fight a Russian guy in the UFC he fought big daddy Goodrich it's MMA history I mean it's it's a big natured well documented it's a show they also made him gay like it like like in salute you know kind of kind of insinuate yes you know in the movie yeah Graham would his insinuated some stuff in the movie that was not good what are you saying no don't say it no I'm not I'm just saying is it Instagram so why did you guys talk about war how did you guys get into movies real listen let's go let's fight movie with what I'm just an American speaking Buddha jej is a real mayor and he's a good guy you should shut the fuck up no oh Ben Affleck there was a commercial for his movie that's welcome Brian was saying this is by the guy who directed warrior and I said so I should avoid this movement too and and then Brian was like what the fuck you liked warrior I go except for the fuckery like when they made them hearty same night that's different that's the two days in a row isn't possible you be so busted up your face would be justified the elephone man yeah l phone man holy fuck poor guys dad yeah one night in one night you ever do it two days is different you don't look yeah I don't even think they should do it in ones that guy I don't know I must have fought earlier he's all cut up he looks like a rugby superstar boy he's getting his dreads he probably liked it earlier in the card probably flanker oh so is this gentlemen's from New Zealand to mark Bernardo is a beast that Jesus Christ he's a serious kickboxer I've watched his videos like serious kickboxer back in the like legit k1 days anyway oh for sure Oh doubt did that Kimura man the step once you want to dude steps over your head Eddie what the fuck can he do here once the guys he's got his right arm see how he's attacking us left arm it's too late right there it's too late but he needed to use his free arm to go in between both arms and hook mm that stops oh he's kidding so this arm so this arms getting Kimura right yeah so this one is you're free yeah you gotta get it in between his arms and hook this arm just like that I mean you could still get your back Jake on camera but at least you survived that the more but then you got to deal with the back take oh we were 10 when you went to the bathroom we're talking about Kimora's like I went to get an MRI when I had some shoulder problem they told me my shoulder had been dislocated and like was there ever any time where your shoulder was in an uncomfortable position I'm like yeah like four times a week like what are you talking about like if you do jujitsu like at least for golf ball that's kind of floating right he's a bad joint yeah it's not connected to anything it's the muscles around the gong ball in the socket that actually keep it but it's in such a weird way yeah but I'll tell you one thing man one of the best things that I've ever done from my shoulders is well you and I were doing the other day we were hanging on your shoulder hanging from your shoulder apron it's so good your shoulders need to like they need space yeah like it need it needs that and hanging it's just gigantic another thing that's really big for me man is club bells those clubs those metal clubs the amazing with you know I don't like it it's a it's almost like a bowling pin yeah yeah yeah exactly and you do these shield casts we throw it over your shoulder and and put it in front of you so it's like this shit mm-hmm it's all this building up of all that tissue and it gives you a nice range of motion I love those this is a good fight Benavidez and Figueredo it's one gonna be just win exactly the belt I love that really decision I want him to get the belt and then retire yep exactly he's like what 37 mmm and 125 one time how old is Joe Benavidez been doing it for a hot second he has been you guys are close you known each other long to Lovejoy the nicest Kevin his wife all time may you know levy there different amazing but Joe is like legitimately one of the nicest guys ever great he's been training with Casey Halsted for the last couple years to in Vegas really better makers nice beautiful it's a fun one no no no he had a ACL reconstruction right and then he came back him one mm-hmm and now he's fighting for the fucking town figure he knows no joke though man that guy can cut for a hot second and he's a powerhouse man yeah yeah serious power this dude rides fucking water buffaloes and shit there's videos of him riding the scrape these motherfuckers like this thing it's the skull up there Ryan's it no water buffalo yeah that's an Asiatic Buffalo that's from my boy Adam cream tree shout out to Adam thing with a bonus shot that thing in Africa no we shot in Australia they brought him to Australia they're invasive species and they literally have to shoot them they have so dangerous so many up they call them the black death that's right there's so many of them in Australia they have why they brought their some asshole everything in Australia is brought their everything stag kangaroos every red no no no no how weird is it that people they don't live in a certain country have sympathy for the animals that live in other countries but those indigenous people they fucking hate try raising like lamb a rat in lion territory or leper talking about recovery channel or NatGeo going extinct yeah we got to stop the poachers but meanwhile the locals are like these motherfuckers ravage oh shit it's like that was watching new line kids the king with my kids and I was like where is their balls where is his balls there's no dick like my mom there guy stop daddy I'm like he doesn't have any balls this doesn't make any sense watch me turns around it's a male lion you're gonna hit him where's his balls you could show his fangs you did show fights with hyenas you can't show lion nuts yeah that's that's outrageous for watching good know kids you're educated balls you can take setup all everyday nuts balls removed bombs like reduce testosterone and there they get tired all the time I've done it before with dogs where there were one way and then they they get they get fixed yeah make sense you should not let your dog just breed and have fucking puppies and shit where no one's taking care of your dog then the puppies fuck you're irresponsible but Marshalls not fucking anybody he's with me oh no problem he's fine Paul does Marshall he's 3 you know he has more followers than 99% of the world he's a sweetie pie dessert I love that dog so much every time I come home you sleep with oh he just oh no no my wife would never allow that shit but I hug him I just love him and he's just the nicest dog ever like every time I see him he just runs up to me he when you pet him he leans against you like he can't because he shut alive oh yeah like crazy I can't do it you can't no yeah you know what I used to be like that too what my would me and my wife moved in together she brought in animals who brought two cats and a bunny right when at first at first I just didn't like the attitude the cats didn't like me I didn't like them I don't like the meowing I fell in love with the bunny remember when I was in love with a bunny I remember he was telling me I loved this bunny so much to go bro once you have a son you're gonna fucking want to kick that bunny the bunny died before my son from what is boredom you're like this shit everywhere but it doesn't stink and it's just dry you just pick it up with your fingers it's no big deal you know what I liked about dogs and cats they're predators they're they're more they're more in tune with social like with the social dynamics where's Murray animals like horses and deer they just sit around waiting for someone to eat them cutest fuck you know they're cute but they don't do shit we are out exactly but there there are also predators kind of predators have more complicated brains they're thinking about recently don't Reese considering like how you feel about them how they feel about you are we all in this together like dogs they just lick your hand like come on so much that's not true cuz Mike I ignored my cats forever and they don't give a fuck no no no they don't but once you give them love yeah what the cat you know you know when you feed a cat stray cat it's gonna come back yeah once they learn once you give them love I finally started giving my cat love cuz the her brother died and now we're the the rabbit died and her brother died so now we have one cat nurse yeah and I never gave Bernie love and like a year ago a year ago I started giving her love for stunts like you know what I just started petting her and now and then real quick she just come every time I come to home through the door walk through the door she starts meowing at me and wants to go to the couch where she's like takes me to the cots let's go cuddle together after 12 hours we take yeah now we're like cuddling and we got like this loving relationship I swear to god or cat goes yeah I know what she wants the freedom of she's got this disorder she has a disorder where as soon as she starts sucking on her arm she wants nothing more than to the huddle with me all this newzealand yes I perform there did you not realize yeah you just stand up yes like fantastic heard it's amazing a theatre that it was the most beautiful place I've ever seen people in the whole country Shaco five private beaches people told me like if you want to fucking escape reality move to New Zealand yes it was so beautiful please Eddie Oh flight and driver buddies it's a problem 15 my companion comedy show there and New Zealand it's we take these two fucking boys hunting but I don't hunt alright you couldn't do this they want to it I'm not gonna kill no animal I don't want to see it you stay you you prepare the pot yeah make us eligible shit went down I'd go to Joe's house I go you killed my bunker I'll just make sure no fuck what's dangerous in New Zealand I has to be some dangerous I can't just hunt like rubbery players Samoans well they have hard stags they're stags are enormous in New Zealand they're these invasive species including stags right yeah everything's invasive success there's a few animals that are indigenous to no tar I don't think you know what roob ours are you know what rule bars are second plant rhubarb on a rule bar is a big-ass bumper in front of your car for calculators because you see them when you see them you're not supposed to stop your if you stop and try to swerve you're gonna get fucked up the route you're supposed to go right through them you got to go right to one you gotta nuts make sure I didn't make this up this is what tastes good and kangaroos those kangaroos they're looked at as like rodents and yeah I'll strap it on don't we love in America don't know totally have you ever seen a show like these thousand kangaroo strong herds that are running across the field when you realize what happens when you know of any predators and you have these animals just breed and their their populations get unchecked to the point where they have to bring in snipers a problem to thin the herd bro there's videos of kangaroos running across these fields where you're looking at like thousands of yards let's see the show yeah yeah yeah we all played it but what's a predatory animal that I know in New Zealand they used to have Haast Eagles which is an enormous eagle though the biggest eagle ever they actually preyed on humans though and then people wipe them out right it was huge what about what about cassowaries New Zealand that's a good question yes where is no joke but it's like it can we hunt those no you don't want to fuck with cats we can shoot it they've alternately you they killed they've even though they probably have something like a vulture I need some Danish to hump what is vultures hang out what stay out of my California are there yeah turkey vultures yeah a lot of turkey vultures out here they're part turkey or a little turkey nasty-looking neck I've seen a bunch of them dan dan hook is a tall kid dan hooker is a beast man he's German Supersport him and fucking Vulcan offski that's an amazing gem well they're discs that I mean Vulcan a skis Australia right and those two guys are New Zealand these guys are being fucking dead stir that's a really good argument for gym of the year is city K you have to give it to him well she can give it to hard to beat you city kick I've never heard of them Ski ski yes oh okay they have Australia as well Australia for volc√°n on skis it's it's an amazing champ how far is Australia from New Zealand it's not it's right next door closed right next door how far is the fight to an hour if that yeah cuz I flew from Sydney straight flying to Denver yeah it was easy I've been there once Hamilton it was so beautiful man I need to go it was so beautiful if we go Brian we should go and do a comedy gig and go hunt some stacks done all right can we do it your buddy has properties he's got everything does he have stag he's got so much money that your rich friend they say it goes if you look that way in that way that's all my property is anything and Zeeland we can hug you that's fine go have a private jet or yes he does and it will fly from here to there yes all right I mean he has that I mean and then you just want to do the comedy show and he keeps no I'll go hunt it with you guys % I'd go for it yeah he's great I'd go for the experience for sure I don't know if I could actually physically shoot the thing go out you know I like whatever I like it's my pattern my favorite meat ever is the meat that I've killed myself it's not even close hooker days and gentlemen making that walk big fight he's taller is he normal very long he's a long she's gotta be like perfect build for fighting man long limbs and he's got like these fucking bulging shoulders and giant biceps and shut he's a freakish body a perfect body for fighting some say freakish sounds like nice well you could say that I like this guy though I like him and but the problem is I'm friends with Felder so if I appear biased that's one of things I love about fight companion I am dude super bias towards fairness yeah it's hard it's hard not to be but that's the other problem with my other gig as a UFC commentator you know I just I can't be that bye oh here we go look at that screen look at all these fucking look at all these guys they're two rows you stop fuck you up if you stand next to a block you latigo their feet yeah they don't how to really get choked that's the crazy they see it there any new zealand grabs things are gnarly right being it sounds like it's supposed to be from Museum of the most dangerous down there and hunt in New Zealand and he's making the walk first I wonder how the read I see is he ranked higher why is that what they're doing yeah be no fair fell does confer elders more famous no no it's that eldest my rank lowered is what I'm saying filmmakers here's the thing they're in New Zealand Dan hookers from New Zealand neither guy's a champion why isn't Dan hooker coming outside there's definitely more of a well-known name in New Zealand and yeah maybe an American I feel it's weird that hookers coming out first that is strange you think about the winner of this big fight on their hands you big boy who is she this for a fighters in that division man that division is almost overrun I firmly believe the UFC needs more divisions firmly no I like it that's an ounce and every ten pounds every ten pounds now then you get like boxes to already put up with know it boxing is like every four pounds no buttons and then four different fucking organization who is hooker who is the biggest guy he beat hmm uh hookers that some big wins man let's make up his rest resume uh olive should up Jamie well his last fight who the fuck did he stop in his life all right that's how I quit James Vick oh she lost about lost about Jim Miller earns oh yeah he got that flow Bert Bern's is a big well jim miller big win yeah areas lost by two so he lost adjacent night how interesting interesting what year was that Jamie the Jason lately he's been on it 2016 he lost Jason Knight interesting four years ago and lost yeah year Rodriguez ah interesting but you know what over the last few years though he's been on fire yeah one two three four five six so he's six of his last seven dude and Mark T a case he's a beast - yeah k Oh Jim Miller killed Gilbert burns monster Barboza whatever shit happens starch James Vic then beat al Iaquinta this is I go to stand kicked for kick with Barboza sometimes guys are too tough for their own the good-looking fella the filters face he's an animal man he looked at the alias' like you're an animal he's an animal fellas fired up for this fight man I mean I did commentary with him he was like real like edgy he knows like dude you're so edgy dudes laughs and he's like man I can't wait to fight this motherfucker he was talking about he's like he said he's never been more pumped up for a fight and never been more angry for a fight he knows he's like this guy's a fucking animal and he goes it brings it out at me he goes I know he's dangerous and he was I I can't wait to go out there and fucking smash him he was he was like we were doing commentary shit a month ago right how many weeks ago it was whatever it was and he was so amped up like it's not you think that it's like they train and then they get in there in a big fight and then here they are now they're edgy no he's edgy weeks out this is your prickly one no he's not he's good dude remarkably calm and sweet he's a great guy and UFC it feels like kind of weird to say that my companion I can't hear this what UFC still isn't kind of weird about you doing fight competitive love it they love it they love it do it for a Tuesday night contender series so you should do it for Tuesday night contender series oh shit I'm like wish Lissa if we have a night off then I'm doubting the problem is Tuesday night at the stores one of the hottest fucking nights of the year it's the best night Tuesday night is the best night of comedy yeah it's fucking incredible cuz everybody's home how weird is this a night it's crazy we are in paradise when it comes to stand-up comedy we aren't fucking there there's no other club in the world like that right no there's nothing nobody doing that people talk about the sour the sellers pop this hours fine well not only that the seller has good comics does the Comedy Store is loaded every night with murderers yeah every night every night it's a savage fest here we go with Sarah Silverman I mean I think Elsa Mac it was it was noisy as it was you're on with the best comics ever and it makes all of our levels come up because you see these people on before you murder and you can't be half-assed Paul Felder about to make shit happen help poor Joe he was telling me the other day that he's not uh cuz I'm not doing anything but the comedy storm and that's the best place he still does the him probably did the improv well yeah yeah but he was but I don't want to I don't want to throw anybody under the bus but he was talking about certain clubs like in the now instead because I'm not doing those anymore you know the Comedy Store that's yeah that's where he said that's when he messed up with his special by not donuts commie stories yes yeah that's the best he said he was going around everywhere so just for something door I think he thinks that but I think the reality is he just needed to do more specials with the problem is when you haven't really done a special then all sudden you're doing a special 30 years in the comedy it's got so much weight attached to it you know and I've been telling him for every should be doing specials I've been doing specials forever when you do specials forever I do a special every two years every two years oh here we go again I'm doing it again I'm doing it again and the last one in particular when I went onstage it felt like a show it was like one of the only times I've ever done a special where a walked onstage it also was in Boston which is my hometown but when I walked onstage I felt like a regular show it's cuz I do another show all the time so if you watch that special and you know he say like you know I liked it that's funny that's the show that's right it was as close to a regular show as you can get a lot of times it's not a lot of times is tension its it's tight you're you don't know you don't ya you don't feel you don't feel loose you don't feel like a show another thing that I did was different was the last couple show San Francisco which was my best one up to date and then this last one which is I think even better than that I did both of those where I did four shows so I filmed for four show yeah that's cool so closely mostly used the second show Friday night but they were all great it was just a matter of like but the thing is you feel loose because you know you have for show I met Tony Hinchcliffe touch me after your first ones like oh he could stop you'd be fine the first one was great to be said and then the second was even more epic a little loaded yeah you said your first Wingo so you could stop now once I knew I had it in the tank I smoked like four fucking joints oh my god we got barbecue at him but I was like should I get high in but she chose him like let's get barbecued I got barbecue because I was like where he got it and then I was just I was ranting I was making shit up whose open up for you with Chappelle do you still have Santana and Hinchcliffe an inch closer pal and then in Vancouver it's Santino and hinge clubs in Tony Santino so fucking an animal he's my face that's an animal show about Santino and Bobby of a podcast together no good for them I know I'm excited and Bobby was talking to me about it he's like well have I waited so long I was like why have you waited so long here we go baby these guys could we go today he's gonna be scrapped it's gonna be a wild fight man rough some wild fellas I have how they want to put his gloves up and hooker said no Brian's not familiar with hooker ain't your boy Feld is gonna roll through them huh no I don't know you wanna bet on this you fuck I hate so much you want to bet I didn't want to do but I'm gonna bail there because because Felder is very scrappy and we'll know cuz the theater major has to be real he's a theater major you gotta go with a theater major he's dramatic and he's pissed here we go now Bryan Bryan give me give me your assessment who's gonna win this fight you think Felder I'm gonna just go with Felder because he always always is in the fight and he's always history I don't know you don't know who hookers let's just be honest be brain and shop what do you got I'll take hooker via decision classic fights a fight tonight by the decision hookers already shot throwing that low calf kick he likes that as much as anybody he's a giant fan of that low calf kick yeah we go interesting interesting set up oh no no you know what it is his low his calf has already fucked up he's hit like four or five low calf kicks hooker has four already yeah oh he threw a bunch of them really right off if they're fighting like this thing doing the decision it's wizard yeah cocked up ogre is the master that like ah you mean you know what I mean right now boys night out college of Zeeland yeah college straight before us fucking around tonight oh there's another one those low calf kicks or so it goes motherfucker they suck kick you there you wanna feel you see him setting it up he keeps hitting it - he hit it again and Felder's not even checking held was trying to get the timing down he's just not there yet the problem is even though you look normal your leg is don't sell not Felder you hop off that left hook don't sleep on Felder felt is a fuckin tank ya know thing about tout Felder he's really big for that division he was walking around 190 pounds yeah and guess what drops down to 55 he just let though I think that's why Felder walked out last cuz he's ranked ranked 1 ahead of hooker Oh 6 in hooker 7 well it's probably like a psychological thing oh you checked that one oh they give him a little Jedi little tell you so touching the face not a big deal he's been there before but you look at hookers body it's so weird he's got like big-ass fucking shoulders and big-ass biceps it's almost like they're they're Tommy Hearns kind of stuff yeah it's like they're from a guy whose bodies big old that left left hookers hands are down that's what I'm talking no it's the type AIDS it is but with Felder keeps targeting that left hook that left hook was just a hair off and Felder beat Barbosa hooker got stopped by Barbosa I hate MMA math but there's something to that and that was felt depressing this you know you got you got fucking shop all over hook curse dicks no no fight when you got shot like Phil you know 260 pound man on your dinner asshole I like don't you twist I like Felder the fucking I hate you don't know who cooker is you've been on the hooker train from day fucking one dude I love Kiwis you do want to marry them burn them I don't know dude I don't pretty good it burns little oh oh hooker is so fucking aggressive with that low calf kick it's crazy I don't chop a tree down guys what I called now we have celery stop again that hooks there is trouble miss landed to really hardest around ya hooker could be a little bit trouble man well the fact that hookers been stopped by Barbosa and got beaten down in that fight and eventually he just crumbled that's amazing you felder knows that and felder knows that he went toe-to-toe at Barbosa and he's got that in the back of his head six as a seven fuckable Felder's won five in a row yeah felt it was right have been a rending he's Felder's fucking smart and he's been training with Duke roofers is arguably top two or three best striking coaches on planet Earth coast to goofus is a fucking machine mm-hmm no switches oh man no boys failed it just seems a lot more sturdy doesn't it yeah she's strongest fuck bro he's a big fella yeah when he's walking around in between fights like how the fuck do you ever make 155 very interesting long hooker Dan huggers just got crazy biceps like biceps and shoulders that don't belong in his body he's probably stronger these price Oh Jim strong well chimp strong and ridiculous power yeah yeah separate boys got the look though dude yeah I'm just it's there it's there yeah and it's if you're a born again I'm a hooker if you're hooker fans should be worried well if your hooker you gotta watch out for the hook I'm telling you the fact that Felder knows that Barboza stopped felt that barboza stopped hooker but that felled her beat bar Beau's in the rematch and he went toe-to-toe with him the first fight as well good but by the way by the way Felder likes a fucking Mouser sophistica he likes to give him the he likes to get it out and he's getting after him now man yeah he's really pressing this fight oh shit oh yeah I give that round felt yeah I mean Grasser the big moments of for Dan hooker with the low kicks especially the low calf Cape but that's not enough do they get that word press the fight Felder troll dissent in the Octagon more often no not enough no not another problem is hooker definitely lost that round even though it's in New Zealand weed fellers going forward feller stolen more hands they might count really kicks divorced I can't drive I tried that I had no I can't I put my kid to bed damn it felled his right eye swollen off what happened I don't know jack he did you have the piss out of them I know but that's quick to have swell up boom oh that low kick that's what it was he looked terrible it ooh there's the jab low peg Jabby oop hooker so long he's so long boom there's a left hook almost missed it done Oh real bad that what that right eye looks like it's closed God filled her such a dog he's such a dog but that is not good at all that's a giant distraction that right eyes closed up its that's only the sake of home yep and this is a five-round fight let's see if Felder ones up but here's the thing about those kind of swollen eyes if they have a good corner man they always do and they have ends well they can push that shit aside they can move it a little bit yeah let's just if it opens up it's all right right let's see what Felder can do in this round boy there's really no speed advance they're both pretty dialed in I'd say fellas faster I think so I think you're just testing this entire second hands below you just jumped this is a really well matched by really well matched six or seven especially when Felder understands how significant it is as does hope no wonder this gets a huge fight against a big name yeah well gage he's waiting in the wings right nobody wants to fuck with him and he's a scariest guy in the corner Dana gage you turned out a bunch of fights yeah just wait there gage here's that alley you know it might be ollie I based a combination of both yeah who's gage you waiting for Bali Warner Tony like you want once the time it's a big boy nobody's called Tony nobody keeps fighting him because he you know what is that could be fight calling up at the in the lightweight division is called out Tony no they just pretend he doesn't exist yeah they just jump over him it's April 18th Bryan hits that Lake and then just bounce boom he's thrown that low calf kick so oh look at this oh yes though didn't jump on him Oh kangaroo oh shit it's gonna be hard ohh mmm dude he's all he needs is that right hook in the right leg in and that he's got the seat belt and you know what he could pull him back into the truck if he knew that got a lot of time if he took his right ankle and went behind filters let's go to him that would collapse him but you have to be really confident with as long as fuck man this is dude hardly can fill the hey dude hookers right foot that's the one that's based the left one is around his right knee right if that right foot hooks Felder's left ankle dude and they clap that'll collapse him isn't that what cron did to his crown you got to be comfortable with the truck game if you're if you're not you're not gonna do it you're not gonna feel it feels awkward but man he's got it right here and he could just go from the truck to the back anyways he could use oh man that right there's the thing he's winning the round doing this yeah just hanging free well that was just a moment and there's no damage done I don't know if fellas that's close it depends on how this last two minutes go you know judges are man yeah again he's able to get that without getting punched in the face he's throwing it so sweet I like the way fielder pulls the doing I've been with GABA when he does that just dive into a fucking double hooker just hit him with a nice left hook and if elders not seeing it very well because of that left side oh I shot because his right eye so swollen that that left side of hooker is a dangerous weapon Brian if you're watching this fight with Stallone like you should watch your fights what's that sound like this is like no one asked you questions sure how they're hurt Dan hooker with that one low chick that one low ticket he just did not like it he did not like gnarly now don't kid yourself Felder's face to face is beat up oh the real issue is that one eye that right eye it's really swollen his nose ain't helping no nothing's helping but his nose is a mess anyway yeah it just noses a mess coming into this fine he's not worried about that damn nasty show man Dan hookers Oh went for the spins oh he clipped them well a little bit of a stumble of legs together - bullshit how does such a father get the marketed this what the clutch I think he hit him with the elbow on that Jeep and he wobbled down around his folks we got three more fucking rounds guys are so good man we got 30 seconds I feel like it's roughhouse so such a good fight it's so evenly matched is so back and forth Dan hooker is so good and so is Felder and Spell there's such a fucking about second round to no choices and he said one choice and he said no why are you asking the question there was only two answers the first half hooker had the position on the back control there that spinning elbow and the punches by fell during the fact that now I give it to Felder in that situation because of damage I gotta see this I like the fact that hooker had his back but he really didn't do any damage right he held a position for you know a good 30 seconds or so but the rehab may be longer right but the reality is when it comes to actual damage and big shots landed buildings - Felder and then also fell on his face - nothing you have a two of them fellow man I'd have to look at it like the problem is your face is beat up the judges hey man we're in New Zealand these judges might never give it to felt hey they can't be any worse than New York aware of the fuck you wanna yeah Houston Houston was bad dude there's gonna be some bitches out there's I fucking hate fight companion Olli let me talk about his hookers you guys keep saying the hooker hooker Felder is pushing the pace on hooker which is very rare he's going after hooker but not not tactically like Barbosa but like super aggressively like in your very breath yeah nice jab he's catching them man yeah oh man this is a real fight is a real fight yeah real dangerous fight Felder's mind is so fucking strong one of the things about him that's so interesting is he's such a smart articulate guys great commentator but behind that this had inferno you know there's something going on inside that guy's head whatever's going on in his head is dark nice uppercut there he clipped hooker with that uppercut up now hookers trying to get it back seam get like ramping up he's trying to get back that uppercut woo that left hook is dangerous and hookers not picking his fucking right hand up his hands are super low a lot of the time a lot of those long arms he does he's being a pest it's volume that but well he'll so pay he's trying to set stuff up and so is Felder but neither God makes you very men God that when Felder lands that really it's not doing much damage on hookers face but fuck man when he laughs he's make him pay dude Felder's doing more damage in this 100% oh look at this he's also throwing for the fucking bleachers he's trying knock his face yeah he's trying to knock his face off anytime hooker makes this day shit if hooker leaves himself in the pocket he knows Felder's coming back with missiles that jab is so nice tell her land that left hook now this one's over oh good right hand by Felder was a good exchange for hooker - no it's not bad he landed a right hand that exchange who could just doesn't have that power does he this is great about the same power he's waiting to set it up the problem is his power is being stifled by the fact that Felder was so aggressive men's threatening it makes you think he looks like he's taking less damage hooker yes no well no just weird though cuz tell them I just have a lot of scar tissue on his face but Felder's landing the bigger shot the sour shot he's got red her skins sometimes it's one or two shots yeah one or two shots can be weird to your nose or weird to your eye and it doesn't necessarily have to be the hardest it just hit you at perfect you know to be honest - fellas hookers catching them does a nice left but I felt that there's change it looks super even to me it looks like that's hand by hooker beautiful left hand by hooker that one went straight down the pipe they're about to start swinging here oh my god it's a crazy fight oh Jesus hooker let them up coming in who named that two-piece well I think also Felder's having a high D we do he can't see how that right I kids there's a lot of blood on Philly food yeah oh that nice job by hooker look at that I just see a red mess Oh see and he pulled back out of that kick oh he's lighting that knows the hookers got that jab time dead mother loves this shit man when he's bloody and shit like if he loves it oh nice long oh right hand by felder oh my goodness but to pieces by hooking these that Oh Felder caught him a little bit with that left hand there as he was charging in this is wild this is a high-stakes fucking game here kids cuz one of this job is gonna be good you knew this one happier you that that's five rounds right oh shit that's gotta hurt see whoever wins these next forty seconds can steal his route 100 percent oh yeah by hooker and then he got out who's got the clean left hand well that reach advantage come down all right and see what happens here though you haven't so far hooker has this round yeah I would agree okay hookers face looks fine filter sugar takedown mmm interesting but hooker turns them around yep hooker fucking zombies under yeah showing his strength showing his physical strength too so you probably have it you know Tom a lot of whiskey to watch and I've talked a lot of shit to bride I probably say to one to one yeah elders going to Anna I would say this round is pretty clean ready when you got Felder to want you yeah I felt her up to one rely the hooker won this round because the first two I don't know about baby updo we're all I mean I love Felder he's bleeding everywhere leave this job Oh - hooker - 100 to 1 I can see that - it's me Felder's fucking oh I can see that - it could be 2 to 1 and who knows how they scored that one round where hooker had its back good honest and there in New Zealand and there in New Zealand right my sin not in Houston sorry Houston sorry except for that one rat I love suckin dick did Jonathan Martinez Andre you will fight that was the worst robbery of the night it was on fight pass no no I don't know yes we were 100% convinced Martinez won the fight he dominated the second and third rounds you will probably broke his arm something he had something real wrong with his arm his right hand and afterwards they gave it to you and I looked over at Dominick Cruz and his jaw dropped when when they judge her like what did well beliefs work and today Jeff Hardy so Nate Nate I'm not sure it must be someone who's quitting boxing when you do a round and box the first round they do it so when you judge first round you give it to somebody I'm sure they'd do the same commission holy shit these guys arms are jacked they're not really 55 Felder's 109 pounds and so smoker hookers huge hooker you used to fight 45 which is crazy [Applause] [Applause] oh my goodness come on it's my father's is so undeniably sound so game he's so gay no game he's all-in a little bit there he is well he's risking it he's doing what you gotta do you gotta do it he's throwing himself into the fire nobody sir one fellow I like the exchange let's play the game let's see who goes forcing himself oh he's stumbling himself on hooker let's cook up a couple just right Jesus Christ now hook are starting to show it fell tersh up fellers open those low kicks by hooker money in the bank I like it oh boy to stay calm fell to stay calm keeping that pressure you see hook em up oh look at this hooker for the fuckin takedown attempt not felder not with felder did he wrestle no good here I don't think either one more have wrestle no no no no this is such an athlete man he's just fuckin his strike well he's really a very intelligent he does what it has to do to be prepared he has to do to be prepared he's not gonna go into a fight with holes in his game no you know those guys that go into a fight hoping they don't get taken down Felder's not that guy he just seems like he he's the I works on what he's bad at yeah and he's turning hook around he's a sober fella oh look it has Felder ever fought a high level wrestler that kept taking him down that he couldn't stop the takedowns that's a good question oh look at this hookers gotta sign this he's controlling how good is because this is a great if this was a khabib could be but every could be was fans would be happiest fuck yeah this is a shit he got him on the fence he's gonna drag him down watch he does this every fucking fight but fell upon him I'll stay here for too long just for judges perceptions okay now he's turning careful here we go we're in New Zealand yeah better in a position like that against the fence a rat if the ref broke him up it broke him up and brought him back to the center nobody would give a shit my father but if it was kebede they would never do that right right they would never do that like that I never take a beep off the fucking fence I have her twenties break up fights on the fence and I hate when they break him up on the ground I know people disagree with that and they think it'll make the fight boring [Applause] take it and but he's also realizing he's in New Zealand and he's but now it's very emotional because Felder is putting the heat on her fellows putting that aggressive heat on him you know this isn't just like he's catching him with shit he's pressing him and he's getting in his face yeah and he's making it real out Dan he's making it real dangerous he hasn't lost a stitch of speed in the third round well he's again he's a guy that's not uncommon to a quick run for penis right hand fucking boxing jab I've ever seen hook I don't want none who wants to go to the ground to come down this is not good not good Oh big elbow this is a big round for Palo Alto he's on the championship rounds here mm-hmm by the way elbow off the break elbow in the clinch by fellow guys again if that was Kebede he'd be winning right here right much that round no no I would like the same punches Felder is so far ahead in this round the literally hooker has landed nothing in this round that made you go wonder of rounds the the like the guy in the position that hookers in would win even if he got tattooed a couple times no no he pushed him against the fence but not like this devastate he's not doing jack shit he's just holding on there's no way this is I agree with you and I understand what you're saying but what I'm saying is don't you think there's judges out there they would give it to the guy that's you know it has the control against the fence tough that room well maybe the guy in Houston that gave all four rounds at dominant or two John Jones over Dominic it's hard with winning that fighter Reyes I watched it five times and I watched it two times the next day and then I watched it three more times since the third round is the only confusing round it's a little dicey I would say the ground is hard because John is pressing the action I'd okay I don't think Dom I don't think nobody got robbed hate when people sit right look at Paul's face and I also feel like John one who just dominated the championship round yeah that's got to count for something I agree with you 100% it's got to count for something record straight okay check this out this exact same round you you for sure you thought Felder land way more punches than hooker right but then towards the airless hooker atom against the fence so you just control them this fella wins that round it's unfair sighs okay that's clear yeah okay that's all I want to skip b22 going into this thing could be when you look at the numbers to some some people may gave the first row second round a hooker then you give that cooker this could be it then it's called a fourth in second so you got again you got to deal with fuckery and here's the thing about bad judging I mean this is just an idea but it is possible too bad judging leads to other people going well we can't be as bad as the people in Houston yeah you're right there's like the standard low oh you're crazy if you don't think one of these cues are gonna give hooker four rounds yeah no matter what's happened I think yeah if you could against a guy against the fence and hold him like you did him does that count for anything yeah it's definitely control control it's not everything but it's something hookers faces gets more important is rational natural damage is more important yeah okay but let's say there was no damage at all and one guy ended up holding the other guy guns that guy that guy once because he proved that he's controlling the aggressiveness punches and strikes significant strikes then it kind of changes it right okay I mean again we're going back to this one theme that we keep repeating but I think it needs repeating we need a better more comprehensive scoring system I'm just kidding there's no one do anything job and all we got before of us the three of us we talked about all we want no one ever doesn't even we wouldn't be able to do anything found out what a sport if we don't do it let's talk about it after the end of this cuz it's only 15 more minutes it's crazy and this is wild shit oh he's got that long jab and he's still doing that oh fucking Felder just killed a hooker this is a travesty it's a Travis and set it together cuz they see that would be a rock yeah with the robbery cuz Felder's pushing the fight don't let him do it now it doesn't take nice turn control but fellas got to get out of this see the reason why hooker is doing this is because the other shit is not working and he's losing that yeah stand up games game and fellas gonna get free and when felt that gets freeze gonna land an elbow on the bread question the question is at what point does what hookers do it at this point right here we ask uh it's got to do damage overshadow the damage he took we're exactly half hole so this is where it gets interesting hookers landing now though but hook it definitely added a couple of good Oh nice jab I felt oh this is crazy oh my god crazy this is so evenly matched local searches how much now such a good stylist like look at the fucking shoulders on hooker they don't malaria they belong in his body now de Lilia belong on 170 Tommy Hearns bodies long real similar real similar yep I'm trying to focus on his lats and make sure around so I don't the look at them look he's lat all shoulders and biceps the size of his shoulders and biceps are fucking giant like it's a crazy but that's a really great body for remembering juniors biceps Oh crazy no triceps at all none just all by success who would throw lead left jab oh I'll tell you what your boy hookers getting tired well so is Felder for sure there's not Oh pop that jab hooker oh and Felder returns with one of his own oh my goodness this is amazing quite a fight this is holy shit with a fight Oh jab I felt this jab is fantastic this is so much more fun than doing commentary oh my god all right bet oh it's not even close no it's a joke look at this hooker trying again for the takedown Zealand two brothers gotta get up if he finishes the rowdy 90 we're gonna give them the round you're all right Eddie you got the takedown Eddie fuck out of him and he's not doing any damage well not this fifth Repeller wasn't being the showman he took them down that hooker won this round well hooker did because I take them it's the only since the judges damn if you would have ended in the mount dude that would be a big you think about the judge that happened so he gets fucking bothers me man you've got to give this to Felton no no no out this round no no it's a close fight man you don't give it to the guy the previous four so yeah I guess hook at least one to two it's gonna be close man it's not real close we never just a fight but like Pride rules by the end of the fight don't we say who won the fight I wear Crocs right now and you had a pick hurricane but no no it was so close it was so tight it could have gone either way to the end of the fight look I've taken another guy down that's gotta mean the most right there emails a lot how the end of the fight look exactly don't talk over each other you drops a joke because you you've set that's like in that Jon Jones fight like the fourth and fifth round mean more toward in I don't because that means in the the fifth rounds just as important is the first round no that's not our goal for each other there's other philosophies though because the way I lose an eye though no no the way I look at it if if that first round was so significant like you fucking you hurt him so bad if it was in the same what you're saying how towards the end when they're both missing the pocket for still being on television you know it sounds like babies dying you gotta give this to Felder give us some volumes Felder oh yeah no that means he's gonna lose hold on here goes hooker [Music] that's how course of bullshit no no no no oh my god hey give me like fuck you honey you're sorry and you can't say that's a robbery there's some people that's not a robbery brought first of all thanks one you weren't scoring the fight - that's a great finding that's a great landing way well if in the fourth other takedowns in the fourth round take for sure could have gone either way surprise that hooker want a close fight it's such a close fight they're both great have to rewatch it but I would Oh probably gave it to Paul Felder but I did think the judge is gonna give to hooker well just to be straight on you gotta give it to the guy who's looking the best at the end here's the thing we weren't done reporter okay but the problem is everyone knows when they're going into a fight did their awkward let me hear a pop here can we survive Jamie he knew it was close [Music] it might be it for him I said Wow know what I love it yeah go be one the best come to he's an awesome commentator he's a smart guy he's smart guy too and he's been fighting for a long time that's the kind of guy as your wingman at a club you know to me if you're single you got a club you want this motherfucking hooker now I love Dan hooker that's a great fight man listen Rangers Donohue did you can't you can't be upset in the world Brenner you can't be upset with that decision for sure if you're not watching it look we're drunk and we're outing and yelling shit and having a good time watching the fights but I'm not shocked the den hooker won no not at all and I wouldn't be shocked that was a fight that was about as close as you can get [Music] amazing concert pianists in there what Dan hooker can take a fucking punch yeah no shit you can't be such a bitch to go back and forth with these guys - that's beautiful you got behind them gets he gets knocked out by butterflies on a regular basis that guy series to the guy behind them a stiff breeze looks good Brian counter heard you're on the road doing stand-up next let's wrap this up right I am
