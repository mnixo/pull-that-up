[Music] I think I remember your scene short careers anyways later like to me this this I feel the same way as you guys do with it's sad the way Rhonda LA so it's not that sad because she had such a great run she's a pioneer she was on the Mount Rushmore of MMA in general she was on Mount Rushmore it's really not that sad like god damn what an iconic run man sad is like you got like Mark Coleman her or a guy like if Mark Hunt were to retie like that sad people don't have money and fame she said man it's not that sad she did some great shit at great things you know what's interesting well here it's going on it's like the Ronda fans um they're not MMA fans a lot of them they're Ronda fans and so like you see how they respond to stuff on Twitter and you see like the reaction and the things that they're saying like it's pretty emotional it's very emotional it's also almost like they don't understand they don't understand the support you know get back on the horse like whoa fuck the horse no listen your mom your mom your mom saying stop her mom's brilliant yeah her mom's her mom's brutal she's so brutal she says she goes go let stupid people gets punched in the face sorry stupid people her mom her mom's brilliant and and she's a doctor and the good name for Ronda to out all this is she's gonna find out who's in her corner there's there's been so many yes my spew out is in Holland there's nothing when you're on set you know a lot bullshit is your agents these other people you're working with these other celebrities tell me how good you are well now when you lose that that phone stops ringing and the texts stop coming everyone asks you to dinner that's not you're gonna find out who's in your corner that's probably they might be good for now let me know we did you do the last three years cuz I heard they kind of wiped they come and the other one disappeared who knows who knows what kind of deal she has but things definitely dried up substantially after the Hawley knockout because she's not the same person anymore the thing about all those deals is when you're a winner in Hollywood and they start throwing all these movies at you and you're some athletes coming over it's all predicated on you being that person that they're selling right what are they selling they're selling this undefeated woman's ass kicker the likes have you never seen before right throwing people in their head get them in arm bars that's what they're selling well that's not you anymore now you just got smashed by halle and then smashed again by a man they can't sell your acting abilities to acting - that she do Roadhouse does she we do road they killed I don't know about any of that stuff I just know to his point where there it's it's almost a good thing for it really is man it's not a sad story I don't find as a sad story I really don't well it's definitely sad she was but it's not do we feel sorry for tiger would like that like I said when that foundation rocks like what do you think is different with Tiger is swing no Woods didn't get the fuck beat out of him in 48 so I know and that's fighting but what I'm saying is their mentality changes when Tiger was unstoppable he's happened he's had that he had the scandal yes then he also has some significant back injuries correct or what okay for a better example to your fight example Mike Tyson yeah that's also wear and tear too man you can say that to tell you why I could say that one of the reasons why is because the driver that I had this weekend in Vegas that took me to the airport was Mike Tyson's driver for 17 years I had a long conversation cool dude I wish I could remember his fucking name so I met him for that brief ride the airport but he was telling me how fucked up Tyson was after the Linux Lewis fight he's like dude Lennox Lewis hit Mike and Mike was fucked up for a long time and you don't think that you watch a guy get knocked out you watch guy get stopped and you know Mike was talking after the fight he was like hey you know I'm done it's over and he stepped back but when he goes home and he's alone and the cameras are off and he's got vertigo he's got equilibrium problems and his ears won't stop ringing and his head won't stop throbbing you don't see that he's doing interviews his head's throbbing his ears are ringing there was no internet back then it's harder it's harder to hide nowadays you know to me are you got your daily thing that you do and everybody you got your followers and they all know your daily thing and you guys are doing the daily things you disappear everybody knows you disappear like that no one really knew you lost the fight you never really see them again this also like when you're suffering alone only way people find out is if you talk about it like we don't know what happens so a lot of these guys after they get beat the fuck up [Music]
