three-two-one Joshua what's happened my man what's going on say it so I looked at your Instagram yesterday and you had that video a Stephen a Smith and immediately I was like oh my goodness this explains so much play this play that play this Jamie watch this watch this first of all someone needs to explain me what's happening here it's a dick unless that guy's got a two-foot dick look how low he's punching no idea that this guy should not be allowed to talk about fighting yeah look um just I'm gonna cut him a little bit of slack only I'm serious I we had this here's the thing with Strikeforce we had kind of a similar situation not like this though by the way with Gus Johnson remember us yes was trying to talk in and I love Gus when he's talking basketball I think he's got the energy in the voice that makes people like oh wow they're gripped to the TV this I can understand what Steven ate but this is my issue water release after you just called someone who's a pioneer in the sport you basically call him a quitter you call a guy a quitter first of all I had a broken orbital bone okay you saying he was a quitter he got his face smashed yeah okay he got cracked by one of the biggest punchers in the sport he he has the most wins in the sport he has the most wins by finish he has the most bonuses I mean come on here's the most fights come on you call him that guy quitter he got cracked that's what happens look fighting is the only sport that you could ended early right you can't hand a football game in 40 seconds imagine imagine if you just your front line was so strong your fucking quarterback was so badass you could storm a football game in 40 seconds it'd be a different sport yeah my concern with him though was that like look he's fine he just did the video I get it like it's good but you're trying to learn the sport but I gotta tell you like DC sent me this video he pasted commented on it and I said I say daddy's trying to protect the DC trying to protect him I said you cannot protect this guy this you can't call someone like cowboy Cerrone or any other I'm sorry any other top guy in any organization I don't care if it's UFC Bella of them all that all these organ I do not to these guys these guys lay it on the line every time we're not slapping a puck or hitting a baseball okay we're really out there getting hurt yeah and when someone calls you a quitter like that you better be Kelly I'm not saying he should be careful like watch his back but don't expect these fighters to be very courteous to you next time you walk in the hall and that's the issue that I think we come across here with talk fighters are very offensive when they get offended when things like this and rightly so yeah it's a different thing there's the the emotional cost of losing a fight is so much different than losing a game it's not the same and there's a culture in sports broadcasting whether it's radio or television this just diminishing of people there's this shit-talking that goes with sports you know he always falls apart that guy but that motherfucker needs to give his money back he sucks he this and that the other guys like I can't believe you're saying that you could do that in sports radio and people love it because if you're on the jobsite and you're listening to the radio log in you know you're fucking hammering nails you're right it does suck and there's a mentality that goes along with that kind of sports radio sports guy talk I hate that shit I've resisted that from the beginning and I've shit on those guys from the beginning because it's not the same thing you're not talking about the same thing you're talking about fighting you're talking about unbelievable physical consequences including knock on wood in our sports very rare but death yeah no it's true but the other thing though too is that you're criticizing someone for being a quitter and someone who's been been there on every level of the game every level but not only that but then you look like you've never played basketball or baseball or any other sport in your life either he admits like that I'm sorry so you cannot criticize people and to be on the talk show like you're saying those talk show radios that's the energy you need to bring when you're going against someone like Max Kellerman or any of the other or skip bayless and those guys go ahead and have that conversation with them but you cannot can't look like that culture the culture of the sport look Max Kellerman is a different animal max Calvert isn't incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to sports and and really so when it comes to boxing he's not a shit talker he's just more honest about yeah that's true but there's a lot of currency and being a stephen ace you know he's really entertaining that that shit-talking that he does he's a he's you know he's he's a guy that's fun to watch he talks a lot of shit he gets real loud and everybody disagrees with him and look it's made him a fantastic career that's why and he carries that over to MMA I think it's a bad idea is it a stick though that's my thought my process is like you know how chill has his schtick like he didn't like it the camera turns off Colby has his stick and the camera turns off they're not that person right is he that person in real life I think it blends in you know is that he just had now inherited that person so that's who he is now in real life engineers clay Andrew Dice Clay his real name is Andrew silverstein and the dice man was a character that he's to do in his act Dice Clay is like one of the best impressionist ever yeah he does like he does John Travolta and all these different people it's amazing and in his act he would do all these impressions and he would do this guy the dice man and he would do these fucking Rhymes and he put this jacket on and everybody loved that so much he just became the dice man and then after a few years he was a dice man 24/7 he's wearing these leather jackets everywhere everywhere he goes got weightlifting gloves on every time you meet his got weightlifting gloves he became this guy right and it's a thing that happens to people sometimes where people love one thing you lean into your fans and I think Steven Naismith I don't know him as a human being I've only met him a couple of times he's a nice guy nice guy to me we had a nice conversation on air we had a little weirdness because he was just saying we didn't learn anything about Conor I'm like the fuck you didn't yeah he just destroyed cowboy in 40 seconds like you learned something he could perform under the bright lights in a giant pay-per-view after more than a year and a half out of the game yeah you learned something you just don't know what you saw yeah I agree with you 100% that yeah he did learn something I learned something from him like somebody who taken that much that amount of time off and I'm gonna say this um to be frank obviously I work for Bellator and I do a lot of work for them but the thing is you you can't have to give credit where credit is due I give credit to all the fighters doesn't matter of here in one look Eddie to me is one of the best 55 pounders to ever walk the face of the earth Rakata McGregor to me I thought he did things in that fight against khabib that no other guy has been able to do first off you wanna round yeah that's something people say oh well could be took the round off yeah cuz each maybe he tried to finish him at the end of the second but the bottom line is he still won the round yeah okay and there's not only that but there was a lot of times and opportunities where cabina had a hard time getting the takedown we didn't see that against guys with wrestling backgrounds like Abel Trujillo and those other guys where he was flinging around winning records basically for the most takedowns in one fight yes there's tons of things that Connor does that people overlook and underestimate because he's such a knockout artist and he's so good and his stance and his style and things that he brought this to the next level and I you cannot discredit what he's done in the sport what I learned from that is that from somebody who can take 15 months off and come back and perform the way that he did against someone like Donald Cerrone is absolutely amazing that's why you need guys like you doing post fight commentary and discussing these not people who don't understand the sport and practice dick punches I want to ask you this though cuz it was funny because I could see your face in the middle of it all how awkward is that for you to stand between the two of them and go what are you guys fucking talking about yeah I mean I would have preferred to talk to DC or Felder or you or where anybody who understands the sport I don't think it's the right way to do it the one gentleman to my right Michael what Jamie what is his last name he was great and Steven Smith was very nice to me too and he said he's gonna get into podcast I have no problem with him as a human being I just think look I don't know jack shit about baseball I don't know jack shit about basketball I literally don't even know the rules I don't know what when people foul people I'm not sure why I don't know what's happening yeah I know MMA I understand it so if you want to talk about MMA I'd like to talk to MMA about someone else who knows MMA the like you were saying though I lost this in one ear podcast the other day with Mike Baker okay and he said like look I don't agree with Bernie Sanders policies okay but he birdie sounds probably is a really nice guy yeah it doesn't mean that I have to like what he does in front of the camera okay for for him to call him I don't have to like that I can still like him as a person yeah that's what we need to make sure that we differentiate between the two things like fucking it probably is a really good guy and I actually have met him I'm the Floyd Mayweather encounter fight and said hi said hey how's it going I can't what do you think and that was the conversation it was real quick real brief maybe two minutes but he seemed like a nice person at that time but when when I was listening to him talk and calling cermony it may see a quitter to me I just lost and I lost respect in the avenue that you're not supposed to be working in our sport yes okay and you need to make some sort of adjustment whether it's dick punching or something else that you need to figure it out you need to like I understand I get that it's a good idea for all people that have never covered the sport to try to get into it okay maybe hold off on the videos like that for a while before you both yeah but I like that he's trying and I'm gonna give him credit for that and I think like with Gus there was a lot of rumblings about Gus Johnson in the very beginning but we gave him a run for a while and I really like Gus he's a great person always been great every time I've talked to him and met with them and and worked with him side by side as well calling fights it was Strikeforce great person but his forte is basketball and for him whatever his forte is Steven Naismith yeah he's got I think he may have to stick with that and I think I agree they have to bring DC back in to work with you along some yes DC's phenomenal and DC and me having that conversation would have been a completely different conversation and it would have been it would have been better for the sport because look there's no there's no positive in downplaying the career of Donald Cerrone or what he can do as a fighter what that showed to me was how phenomenal Conor perfumed that's what it showed me and if if either you are I was talking about cricket we were on TV doing commentary and cricket we would look at a place we'd look for it would be fucked up in real cricket fans would be upset at us right now that's nothing that's just a sport right yeah this is you are naked in the most literal sense of the word you're you're naked physically you're naked emotionally when fighters lose it's it's fucking devastating for Conor to smash cowboy like that in front of his wife his kid his grandma and then the whole world like that is that's it's you got to have some respect for that man you know and this sport demands a different perspective it's it's not the same thing as a ball going into hoop and it's not the same thing as crossing a line with a football it's different it's very tense and very personal and it's also very fucking dangerous and to play it off like it's just a game I I just I don't agree with it and I just think that we have plenty of fucking people out there that understand the sport there's plenty of them yeah there's but the thing about him is he's really popular and Jamie when he's saying he just got a giant deal or something like that at BIG's the top paid I had his contract up he's got like an extension to get like eight million a year now or something like that yeah and that's because he's so his personality is so fun it's he's a fun guy to watch and people love shit talking they love to people arguing about shit one person's better at arguing and and Steven Naismith is really good at that stuff but it's not the place for MMA it's just not the place it's not it's not the same thing it's it's not because um because the guys themselves can fight you know when you see what happened last night what Kansas and Kansas state or whatever they started throwing punches it was like it looked like a bunch of girls throwing windmills you know what I mean like that's really the reality of is like a now if he wants to go out there and talk about it go ahead and talk about it he can say all the things he wants cuz these are college kids that can't fight obviously we just saw right you know but we're talking about professional athletes big they've their life has been around this craft yeah and now you're gonna say things like that it's very disrespectful it's just so common with sports to talk about a guy who can't show up on game day talk about a guy who keeps dropping the ball talk about a gopher and you shit on those guys but it's just a different thing with fighting and it's also with fighting like you you you have to know it or no one's gonna respect you if you don't know what you're talking about and you're talking about it in front of millions of people like man that's a bad look for everybody yep it's a bad look for ESPN it's a bad look for him it's a bad look for the sport it's like there's other people that can do this yeah we have we caught a lot of flack for Gus for a while the only Strikeforce did like and then I think it trickle on up to CBS now but and he has mayhem brawl yes these things happen in MMA yeah it's definitely not the words you want to use and that's situation you know what I mean but it does honestly like you just said every does reflect badly not just on ESPN itself but the UFC as well because they're in business together and it kind of looks bad for both like hey you guys we need to monitor who's behind that microphone because we're representing our talent and our talent is what makes us the money but what's funny is with Stephen a Smith he's his personality and his brand is based on that kind of shit talking so this is all good for him this is all good for him like the more people talk shit about him better it is for him and then he just ramps it up even more and more people are paying attention the ratings go up until he sees cowboy in an elevator who's quit now bitch yeah get out those are the things I gotta tell you you just no no think about this if he said something like that about a Nader Nick Diaz and they saw him in a fucking elevator with fuck him up they would fuck him up legitimate like you would just gotta be like doles or scenarios you just gotta be careful now Cowboys never gonna do that hey man kind of just watch it you say come on man like I know my family's there and my grandmother's there you know my kids there right you know let's dial it back a little bit that's Cowboys a fuckin he's just an amazing person you know yeah yeah yeah when you're talking about athletes and find it like nadie is though he's sayin shit do you he just gonna sock you look everybody knows what happened what happened is Connor had a spectacular performance cowboy got caught off guard and he got finished quick that's what happened yeah all the other stuff is unnecessary the moat the emotional devastation of a 40-second KO like that is we have as a with as a respectful human being you got to leave all that other stuff alone all that shit talking if you want to say it in the gym to one of your homies and you're just hanging out and maybe one of them doesn't like cowboy and you know and someone talks trash and that's private and no one hears it that's fine and good but when you want to do that publicly you want to broadcast that and then also do it on ESPN I think it's just it's just short-sighted and I think it's foolish yeah I'm gonna go a little bit more hard on the paint on guys like DC who are on my post right there defending him right now he's a very well hey man he's trying to learn this boy I said deej quit trying to toe the company line right now Kendall Grove that goes on there to say oh you know what I can respect the fact that he's trying to learn it look at this he's trying to better understand our sport it means he's a massive star he could talk from his perch and no one can touch him yet he choose to try and learn the game so there's some weight to his opinion you're a little off base champ look just because Steven Naismith might be good for business in the ESP business for you later on I said that doesn't mean you got to tell that line buddy yeah I'd like to give him a hard time but DC is one of my best friends man and he's absolutely hilarious and just fun he likes to do this to stir the pot because like you were just saying with Steven a he likes to do this type of stuff people keep talking yeah DC like so we're here right now that's exactly what DC does he's brilliant when it comes to this type of yeah and I'm sure he really does love Steven a as a person Steven is he's a nice guy I like I said I've met him a couple times he's a nice guy but just to like there's a there's a style of broadcasting that sports radio and sports broadcasting that they do this kind of stuff you know but when it leaks over into fighting fighting is just not a spoiler you can call it a sport in kind of a sport but it's its sport in its highest sense of expression where it's you literally using your body to try to stop another man's body yeah it is intense as it gets and I think it deserves more respect that's just my opinion that's how I've always treated it that's how I when I when I talk about fighters or my my concentration has always been to elevate my concentration has never been to demean someone unless there's something that they did that's illegal and through some sort of sort of blatant foul that should be stopped or something that's really dangerous that they're doing that should be chastised but that the sport is it's just it's it's a higher level of consequence and risk and ever and it needs to be respected that way yeah I feel so I got I listened to your show quite a bit and I like a lot of what you had talked about before when you first got into comedy about talking about how some of the other comics was like kind of shit on other young comics kind of up-and-coming and when you came in it was like a different you try to just and grant in people like hey I want to build you all all of you guys up that are with me on the same set if we're doing the show and we're all in the same night let's all just fucking make each other look good I feel like especially in fighting whether it's boxing MMA anything along those lines we got to be elevating each other to make each other better yeah okay this guy is good this guy is good without talking shit cuz we like yourself as specifically as well as like even myself and other guys that have shows and podcasts and start talking we're on a plot on a different level of platform they can really kind of either make or break some people's careers yes also with also the sport is confidence okay MMA is a confident level anytime you do wrestling it's a one-on-one combative sport in term wrestling an MMA confidence is key if my confidence is low then that means that I'm not probably not going to perform my best and that when you take a loss it goes lower and lower when you got to hear it from fucking people that don't know the business like this right here it's just another thing added on and for other MMA guys to shit on other MMA guys all that does is tear them down even more and you could potentially I'm not saying ruin their career but you're you're not helping them get to their goals in their levels it's better if everyone shines and we all handle ourselves as a class and respect and I feel like we just in general need to hold ourselves to a higher standard if we're talking MMA and making sure that we showcase this guy is really good like here I'll give you an example all I do when I talk about Frank Jaeger is how about how such an amazing person even when he has a bad performance he's still one of the best to ever do the game and all the things he's done from the pool before in the past I say the same thing about BJ Penn somebody who look he exploded on the scene I was training with him when he had that that first run-through did Thomas you know all those guys he was training in aka all the things that happened now to me those are just bumps in the road as fighters get older you know and they just don't know how to react like this is it I don't know what's going on like they they need somebody to step in not shit on them they need someone to step in and talk to my text and talk to him all the time it's like hey man this it might be time to move on it might be not me whatever the deal is but there good people at heart I know them personally and we should just be talking in general about lifting these guys up to the next level and that's the way I think every sports should handle it the argument against that would be the massive success at Connors had shitting on people in press conferences and shitting on people and leading up to a fight and the fact that that's built up so much animosity but also so much attention like the Aldo fight duty that he made that fight by talking so much shit and it was it's a big part of why that fight was so successful and it was also like some serious psychological warfare when Aldo went into that cage with Conor you could see the weight of all that shit talking was weighing heavy on him you could see it it was like melihat slept you know he's probably really fucked up like that emotionally because Aldo was super respected he was the fucking king he was the guy that had torn through the featherweight division for years and he had beaten everybody beaten the best of the best and were widely regarded as the greatest featherweight of all time and then all sudden Connors his shitting on him shitting on him and shitting on him tearing his picture apart stealing his belt at press conferences and all that craziness it made the fight way bigger but it also fucked with Jose a physically and emotionally so when they actually fought he had a diminished performance he was he was too emotional he lost his composure rushed forward he tried to you know tried to hit him before everything was set up and he got cracked for it yeah I understand what you're saying in those turns but look when you're promoting a fight promoting a fight to me is is a separate thing though I think Conor over set the boundary when he talked about khabib and all the other family stuff especially when he posted the picture with his wife that to me is we were over the like I understand like jails done it a couple of times when he talked about Jenna Jameson and Tito and that whole situation like there's moments I think the word guys have stepped over the line but if I'm talking shit to you taking your belt and doing those things look I'm marketing the fight right that's a separate issue than doing what some guys do and if you get a percentage of the pay-per-view it actually benefits you in that car shit's on you which is even more disturbing yeah but but the other thing is what was it look always whether win or lose Connors never shown a disrespect after I've haven't seen that I haven't seen that afterwards as far as like in the cage when they see him hey great fight even when he lost to Nate the first time he very respect yes very respectful and I think look there's a difference between marketing the fight and then you realize when the fight is done shaking hands be like okay look let's do it again and I thought that to me is that's not that's a fighters mentality I want another crack you whether I won or I lost I want another crack at you it's okay to market the fight but once the fight is done shake your hand that's that's what this is that's what this sport is about that's what fighting is about that's what it's always been about you know from back in the days when guys who just put it their dukes I mean that that was we fight each other cake help you up off the ground shake your hand and move on well people like that about it it's one of the things you remember when Ronda Rousey beat Miesha Tate and she wouldn't shake her hand after the fight and the fucking boos were so crazy I was interviewing her after the fight you could barely hear or talk you just bow people didn't like it they didn't like it at all ya know that's that's you're gonna always get that I think when there's districts blatant disregard you know disrespect for somebody especially of that caliber like me chete and after the fights over yeah like what people want to see is that it's resolved they don't see these crazy endless wars yeah well you're never happy you just armbar D fucked her arm up yeah they're still upset yeah we got plenty of endless wars everywhere else exactly man when you see Connor at 170 you know obviously he beat Donald really handily but do you think he's a legit 170 no I don't think so cuz arm we saw with kabhi kabhi b could potentially be a legit 170 but evens him he'll be a little bit too small for guys like Guzman yeah guys like Mon now I think he'd get I think you get out wrestle Usman he can out wrestle Cole because I think you know I'm not saying I'm % I've seen here my last time with DC I've seen him wrestle with Olympic caliber wrestlers in our in our in our room I'm telling you right now I didn't see what Jordan burrows at your place I didn't see him train with Jordan but I heard Jordan was coming with head came through yeah I wasn't sure if they I wasn't there during that time I was right to be a fly on the wall to watch those two guys but I can tell you this he trained with Ed Ruth yeah I was and it was um what it was what yeah like yeah I mean you don't wanna say anything no but there was moments though were you know ed was able to get some stuff on him but he was able to get some stuff on that as well and Ed was able to get the tired Kabhi was able to get the takedowns as well on a three-time NCAA national champ Wow and you could tell look could Yves had more experience in terms of MMA you know like Samba was basically just Emma made with Aggie top on and you know occasionally wear shin guards with Edie Edie was relatively new into the sport when they first started training and and was able to do a lot of good things to him and could be was able to do a lot of good things to him without saying too much both of them definitely benefit from their training together and that's what's great about our gym is that there's no it's not a pissing match in our gym like sure guys want to one-up each other when it comes to sparring but I would say that Edie he got the better of learning the most from that situation whereas khabib realized that his stuff works on the top caliber guys in the world well you guys have a take a you guys have one of the most top hit like wrestling heavy in terms of a high-level wrestling like you have one of the most concentrated camps yeah what people need to remember is that that camp was ran by crazy Bob Cook and Bobby our first Xavier crazy Bob cooked but then also when they linked up with when Bob cook linked up with zinc and Entertainment and seeking the zinc and family is very interesting all three brothers were all Americans at Fresno State Russell with Lorenzo Neal who's a professional football player in the NFL but also wrestled at Fresno State also an all-american those guys all linked up and they're big big into wrestling so what they've done like it literally could tell you this is he would the three brothers would if I brought up to a wrestler right now that I'd never heard of you probably never heard of they could tell you all their stats they could tell you what they did in high school they could tell you what they did in college I could tell you how far they potentially will go in the Olympics you know I mean like that's how much ingrain that they are into this so a lot of the reasons why we get we've gotten guys like Edie Ruth Aaron Pico was silent them when he first started his career and DC you know Doron when all these guys that have come they've all they've all come through because of Duane's incan Aaron Pico is a crazy case right it's he's such a talented guy and he's still very young yes but there was so much hype on that kid right out of the gate and they put him in against real tough competition right out of the gate yeah look he fight a fight he had to fight tough competition the game there's a couple things but people need to understand is this is if I'm gonna pay you this amount of money because there's so much hype around you then you're gonna have to fight this level of God Brian okay now the problem with what happened with him he's not a fifty five pounder he's tiny so he he could potentially make thirty five real yeah he's not a big guy so that's what people keep forgetting so one night when he wanted to stay at 55 we said okay we'll give it a go let him get one or two fights you know in that position but no one wanted to fight him no one but we were calling some of the best guys in Bellator you know at the time they're like now let's we want to see a couple fights in his first before we go you know throwing our names out there to fight this guy we'll see how he is you know what I mean and so when that happened and I'm not knocking them and that's smart on their part I mean every every top guys mean like yeah let's see what he is first and then we'll figure it out but then as soon as he lost his AK Freeman who was tall long lengthy you know good decent submissions not not a will beat it in our world beater but he was good Aaron got exposed in the first fight got clipped then jumped in on a double leg got guillotine was out okay then he decided to make the loop down to 145 had a couple good performance he's got big dogs he's got big dogs in his hands he's got heavy hands but he's at boxing base with wrestling background which works if you've already been around guys that have been done plenty of kickboxing if you're just a boxing bass kicks come from angles you're not used to like different from punches and so he just needed to get to a camp and stay focused on one area with one or two coaches that will groom him into that not only is it Jackson wink I think it's perfect for him because he's there with good really really good grapplers and really really good good guys and so with with Jackson they're grooming him and telling him how the gameplan Jackson is one of the best at gameplan I mean you can't deny that and the fact is is that he just needed someone to get in there now I do know like he had a couple little issues like obviously he didn't he really didn't go to high school I mean like as far as he was just traveling around and trying to become the best Russell in the world I mean it a young age he's you know he's he's winning everything and that's it's hard when you take someone from school put them into that type but they gonna have success and they think they're gonna continue to have success on a world-class level like like you know any sport and and he he says he had such success at a young age his dad and his family got really involved into doing that and in pushing him in that direction and that's not always the best scenario in situation I think sometimes you need to have management and trainers guide you when you're talking about a sport that other people have no idea what's going on yeah it doesn't work that way you know like if people think like oh I think family members and I hear this all the time and I can speak from experience my family sometimes comes in and says yeah welcome you know you don't make what Conor McGregor's making it's nice I'm like are you fucking kidding like you know like those are it's not the same you don't I mean I would explain the entire business yeah I don't have to explain everything and so when you have someone like Pecos parent his dad and his you know his brother I think we're kind of helping with management and trying to get sponsors and do this they were expecting people to like to talk you know to bend over and be like hey you know like yeah this is Aaron Pico and this and that because he had such success at a young age and how good and talented he was in the gym but like Alvin Ireson said man we talk about practice it doesn't it's not the same thing you know hey he's sure he's great but when the lights turn on and the fight happens and we're sparring in little gloves not 16-ounce gloves okay it changes the dynamic of the game changes and you also have to take into consideration that yeah he's had a tremendous amount of success in wrestling and yes he's got very good hands but he has a small amount of MMA fights and yes his MMA you know that's that's the difference there is a difference and he's also a really young guy who's experienced some pretty high highs and pretty low lows very quickly I think guys need to be managed better and what I mean by that is I mean the same way boxing handles it boxing you see guys get to 15 16 you know when you see a guy like Kobe he was 28 no you know how the fuck no one gets there yeah you got John Jones who's essentially undefeated you know that the Matt Hamill fight in my mind he won that fight yes we crushed him yeah I mean there's never a moment in that fight where isn't doubt he just got disqualified but and I don't even agree with the disqualification but he's a rarity it's him and it's khabib and maybe there's a couple other guys there like elite high-level guys that are undefeated they're the outliers most guys get thrown the wolves like really quickly but in boxing you see that all the time because managers slowly groom their fighters they go okay Josh you know what Josh you're a fucking great puncher but you know your your your inside game maybe should be tested we got this tough Mexican dude who likes to fight inside so gonna match you up with him you should beat them but it's gonna give you some seasoning and they'll move you along that way okay we're gonna try it against a long lanky striker sometimes you have problems with the jab and this guy's got a significant reach advantage let's see and then boxers the boxing managers and coaches they don't think about this shit for days and weeks before they commit to a fight whereas in the UFC the USC calls you up hey you want to fight khabib on three days notice really what and then all sudden you're there well because boxing managers are usually in cahoots with the promoter so the two of them work together that's not the case with any promotion in MMA like the man that the promoter is the promoter and the manager is the manager and you take what we give you and if you don't then okay we'll put your myself for six months you know okay that's like those type of things have been presented to me a couple times you know and do what Joe was the the manager at that's our the trying to matchmake me when I was supposed to fight Anthony Pettis for the title and he called said hey Pettis is out he said yeah we want you to fight some tough Russian guy ah you know that I've never heard of and I was like I just knocked out Nate I'm lucky and I'm supposed to fight for the title I'm not gonna fight some tough Russian guy from Dagestan I've never heard of no thanks it's like fine I'm gonna shelf you for six months and I just told my say man I'm pretty good with my money I'll wait so he just said okay so the week later I got the Benson fight you know such a fucked up thing to even say to someone it is shelf you yeah it is though but you know in reality though like look here's the thing and I will say this and I will stick up for Joe even though I just said that I will stick up for Joe Silva I met with him shortly after that and he's like look at my phone you see this this is your division he's like you see all these these are all fighters in the division he's like you see that ones at the top that you wanted the fight get all those guys in red they're hurt he only had two people to choose from so and those two people were already smashed up against each other so what do you do but that's the thing like do you just take a fight because you want to keep fighting but how how does it move your career when you are literally one shot away from the title because when you knocked out Nate Diaz first of all you the first guy to do it you did it spectacularly with a head kick a lot of people forget that for some reason people keep saying this that stopped my god go back watch these think up for me I appreciate the OS mate always but so you're in this crazy position where you're really knocking on the door for a title yeah and then they saying go fight some savage from the fucking mountains yeah it was really good fucking dagestan yeah the scariest fucking humans on the planet well it's amazing how many tough guys come from that part of the country or they've the world they've exploded on the scene and I think it's amazing to see them grow and I think I've seen you know when he first came in what could be first came into a K I was like nah he's tough he's just a wrestler you know but he still had some submission defense good leg locks good he was physically strong then um he's just he just gained a lot more confidence now with anything in the gym doesn't matter what it is like I said well I've seen him wrestle with DC I've seen him wrestle with Luke Rockhold I've seen him wrestled obviously with myself we wrestled tons of times guys like Graeme and all those guys you know and he's phenomenal like when people ask me when you said something about him who you're saying we're talking about him like oh you're talking about oh yeah yeah with him know him with us Mon and I think he out rustles those guys wow I think you're awesome yeah I 100 percent of the gal Russell the guy that I thought he without a hard time my wrestling would have been Ben Askren that would have been his guy I think that guy right there would have been the only guy that I think could have potentially I wrestled him Ben is hurting them and you can see how he walks yeah you could see his hip all fucked up he's a hip replacement yeah I need to get it done I mean like if that's the thing anyone he does he's never gonna fight again why he's done I think isn't he done I think he's he's done because of the hip yeah I mean I don't know what the recovery process is if it is it a hip replacement or is it just replace let's scope it all out clean it out and see how it goes and then see if he needs a hip replacement after I know he and I discussed it it's it's a mess yeah yeah there's a lot of these guys they're so tough they're almost too tough for their own good and their training on injuries and just push it through the pain and they're just chewing up the cartilage and tearing up the labrum and yep and I want an iron here's the thing like to go back to the Joe Silva thing but then the lot of it is because conversations like that it's the conversation like well fine we're just gonna shelf people these guys when they when they get a call for a title or they get a call for a fight I think on the main card or you know their that's their their families are starving and they're hungry people think that everyone's making Conor McGregor money my whole family thought I was making Conor burger like welcome you're not making them like I'm like you guys I almost want to shut that someone's got a gut in a beer yeah yeah you know maybe next time I talk to talk to these guys all its own definitely tell him to give me that Conor McGregor money yeah um you know but look that what I wanted to talk to you about was like you had a you and Brendan had a talk and conversation about guys like Lima and other guys having you know competition with top guys I think Lima is a top guy I think Michael Chandler is a top guy I think Bellator has several guys that could compete with anybody in the world yeah and I think the same thing about one Fc I still maintain to this day Mighty Mouse is probably the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet probably yes you mean Jon Jones has faced stiffer competition because there's different competition in the light heavyweight division but the way Mighty Mouse was running through the division the way Mighty Mouse would just did not get hit but the expression of martial arts in my opinion when I watched him I have never seen anybody more impressive so what's your take on them him being traded them I think they offered him a tremendous amount of money at one and the flyweight division has never been a moneymaker for the UFC and Henry cejudo beat him in a very close decision and I think they just came to a position where Mighty Mouse was like look I'm not gonna make as much money in the next fight because I lost but one Fc is gonna pay me X amount of times more than that and they're giving they gave him a huge contract man you know and they they look chhatris amazing and what they're doing over at one Fc I think it's great for everybody I think it's very for the sport I think it's great that the athletes have options I think the competition is great for the UFC when you see someone rise and someone start smashing people over there and everybody goes hey that guy might be the best 170 in the world that's good for everybody because then you could set up potentially like a cross-promotional fight if some someone's that big and we get to find out we get to find out who's the number one in the world that's what it's supposed to be all about and the more competition there is the more big organizations there are in the more places that athletes go it's way better for the fighters yeah and that has to be taken into consideration yeah so I worked for one for a while and I work for Bellator now but I was doing K side commentary for them and I I called a couple of Timofey now so you can fights the guy's not down he's a fucking monster so if you like it I told Jamie I said before you gave I said I'm gonna call on you a couple times I said a lot but he stopped Alvarez I was like that guy is a fucking he's got dogs in his hands and I'm telling you right now he either loses by submission in the first round or he knocks you out in the first round I want to say up until like his 10th fight or ninth fight or something that he'd never got out of the first round either knocked you out or he lost and he was his record at the time was nine or ten and one when I was calling his fights he had only had one loss and I think he had lost by knockout but he's got heavy dogs got good hips and takedown defense areas the kids into nominal he's just fucking rock solid rock solid everywhere fucking super savage and his approach that guys he's elite man I mean he's elite in terms of you know he could fight anybody in the world that's his size yeah I really liked that guy's a fucking animal man for him to beat down Eddie Alvarez like that you're talking about Eddie Alvarez a guy who's like one notoriously one of the toughest fucking guys in the sport period and that was a real wake-up call for a lot of people there's you know some guys over there just cuz you don't know their name doesn't mean like look when fucking zombie came over here people know his name and then they see that guy fight like what the fuck where'd you come from yeah 360 Brown House kicks and crazy fucking scissor sweeps and taking people to submitting um head caking I'm doing everything there's hundreds of guys like that out there everywhere they're everywhere and that's the other thing is they're not just in dagestan sure I think right now that's a market that needs to be tapped into across for every promotion but they're also they're also in Asia somewhere they're also in other countries and everywhere else like um you know I do know that there's there's a lot of top talented guys like Ann in Sweden and Switzerland they just ever get to play because there's there's not an MMA market there really but they're great jiu-jitsu guys there's good MMA gyms out of all these places especially in Italy and all these other places we're seeing talent come and um when you when I saw it when I heard that he was fighting when I heard and he was fighting out sounds like oh shit I said either either and he's gonna be able to get him down and get on top because he does tend to fade a little bit does not you can as the ink incentive the second and third round but if he can't get him down on that first round he's gonna get knocked out hunter because Eddie's guy I love Eddie but he's always he got a little Chinni at some points not to the point where he gets knocked out but you know he's always been rocked comes back and then fucks people up yeah but this is a guy that I'd seen him just starch guys I mean he fought this guy what was his name something fall along and there was talking conversation about this guy was gonna you know knockout Timothy and I mean I don't think I it was almost like an Alistair Overeem that type knockout you know when in gone and snapped his head that no oh God he was out cold and so when I see guys like him and like and there's other guys you know that are in them that they're in these organizations all around like to me Patricio pitbull is probably the best 145 pound on the world and I'm a big max Holloway fan but I've talked about this before with with big jon is that styles make matchups and Big John has talked to me about that being in the cage calling or roughing Max's fights and and he said Volken offski will give him problems and sure enough Vulcan Vulcan offski gave him problems he said that will let me know how good Patricio pitbull would do against max Holloway the speed the wrestling the power all those things Patricio has and to me Patricio is better than Vulcan Oskie just from what I can see not from the max fight but from a lead-up to all the fights so I take guys like Lima I take guys like Patricio who knocked out Michael Chandler at 155 pounds I take those guys and I'll put those guys against not just UFC guys one guys all these guys all day long these guys are nasty in their tongue who is this right here this is Patricio pitbull tricky which is the older brother at 155 and then there's Patricios at 145 and he's also now the hundred fifty five pound check yeah but to me look to me hee-hee now like when I'm talking like you turned my hen rizzuto guys attach themselves to guys because they can make themselves better I'm not gonna go train and stake my claim with someone unless I know the two of us were making each other better that's his main training partner Henry pseudos and that's Henry Rhodes his main training partner won Archuleta was on like a 19 fight win streak and then faced him won Archuleta didn't look like the same one Archuleta when he got in there and when guys are that good at that next level that's what happens they make somebody look like they don't belong in there and that's what happened I was like man because people keep giving MVP a ton of shit and I'm like dude this guy is that good Stephen Thompson in the beginning wasn't getting any respect either and look at him like he's got that style of like oh I could get him down I could take him down I could do this but guys are so good at their one craft that men you just can't get to him and they make these guys look like that you don't know this and I'm with you on this and I disagreed with Brendan Brendan thinks of you not in the UFC you're not shit I know I don't think that's true why do you get the wild I want to know why why why he's got a little Stevie Smith in him just a sprinkle look he's one of the best I just saw his show but he likes to talk crazy shit too but he also believes what he's saying he really does he believes what he's saying I disagree I mean the Michael venom page thing's a perfect example he's so good that Paul Daley turned into a fucking wrestler yeah I want to tell you a story on that real quick he goes all daily mercs people all daily turn to some of the guys at Bellator and go hey man I just want to apologize before he walked out I just want to apologize it's gonna be a boring fight this is gonna be a boring fight that's great but look if you watch how well Michael venom page moved in that fight you almost understand it because Paul wood that traditional Thai style that Paul knocked out lorenz larkin yeah and lorenz larkin is an evil man he's nasty so good when you watch him you watch his style his movement I mean against Neil Magny throwing those those oblique kicks to the body who the fuck does that ya know that stuff that a lot of guys like to throw to the thigh yeah he's hitting him in the body like a front kick with that black and I'm like Jesus Christ he's so technical on his feet he's so sweet on his feet so for you see him get knocked out by Paul daily you realize goddamn that Paul Daly's a motherfucker that left hand of his is one of the best weapons in the sport everybody goes to sleep and here it is hey you see Paul taking him down and I was like I can't believe this I like that the fucking power that he has Paul Daly's power is like his left hand in particular one of the scariest fucking weapons in the sport it really is he just you know probably 36 now yeah he's not the same guy that he's 25 not bad though he's still really damn good fuck yeah if we put him back I'm just saying we put him back in the UFC I'd still say he's probably in the top five or six well he always had to have a problem with real rust yeah of course he is but I also think that his game has always been shaped like guys like John Fitch were able to just grind and grind and grind but guys like Lou Sloan and Kobe they don't they grind on you sure but with John when he fought on the last time he just was he just John's at a different stage in his career where he's not letting go of the lake for anything loose Monaco B will make space to throw punches which could get them in trouble mm-hmm against somebody like him because he has power in his left hand is fucking NASA and ridiculous like if you pull up you see the fight with him when he not when he wobbled or dropped Nick Diaz yeah Nick Diaz don't get drop the shit know how crazy is Nick Diaz Nick Diaz forced him into a dogfight yes he scores do we do a dogfight yes yeah and that was one of the most freakish weirdest knockouts that was amazing but things that was when UFC had first taken over Strikeforce and I was sitting there case size and I'm thinking to myself this is hands-down the greatest MMA one-round fight I've ever seen in my life it was a man Vern I'm not amazing he just wore him out yeah but he just put that fucking Nick Diaz pace on him and wore him out but when he clipped him and rocked him and dropped him I was like oh my god Paul Bailey's gonna stop Nick Diaz fact that Nick fought him that way yeah I mean Nick didn't try to take him down Nick didn't rise to admit him he just went after him just like come on let's do this but let's not forget the history of Nick Diaz man well it all started with Robbie Lawler the history of Nick Diaz started with Robbie Lawler like come on motherfucker my god yeah and that's what that's what elevated him to that next level I called it he walked into the Octagon he started yelling stalked him motherfucker stop and Rob you Lara's like what is happening here what is this like Robbie Lawler was this dark destroyer everybody was scared to him he was a spooky dude he was flatlining people and Nick Diaz not only was he not scared of him he was talking mad shit to him he was fighting this like what bitch will be doing bitch you doing bitch and people don't understand this is so funny I have talked I was talking to big Johnny the day on our show I was saying like hey man the guys I didn't got so damn tired when guys talk to me remember when Nick Diaz did that to Frank Shamrock yeah I'm sure mark was like I can't believe this has happened it's usually Frank that does it I trained with Frank for years and like where I'm in his guard he's like come on Josh get up like throw punches do something I'm a fucking sub you I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that and you're just like shut up man showers want to punch you harder and it makes you more tired and the fact that Nick was doing it and out car-dealing him yes Frank's thing was always being the best shape so you could put like when he beat Tito yeah just put that pace on him and Tito couldn't keep up and then he finished him yeah Frank was not the same guy when he fought a nigga that time but let's be real like at that time like it was just it was awesome to see somebody like like Nick do that because Nick though if you can recall at the end of the fight picks Frankie up it's like you're legends do not sit down there like that you're a fucking legend and that's what people talk to me all the time about my fight with Nate and I say look man ain't nothing but respect for both those guys those guys are fucking animals not only are the animals but what I love is I love people we were talking about Big John being a good God before we came on the show yeah Big John McCarthy and I said absolutely and when I think of guys that are good guys I think of guys that stick by their friends no matter what you got to remember that brawl that happened on CBS right we were talking about that as well that brought with mayhem Miller Jake Shields Nick Diaz but guess what that whole scrap pack though they die for each other yeah and you can't knock friendship like that and I and I look at those guys and they're really good people from Gilbert Melendez his wife Kerry Nick and Nate and Jake's like still one of my good good buddies Gillis is well but even though I don't talk to him anymore really like but it's still I have nothing but respect yes those guys themselves they did it on their own and they're fucking amazing I will buy their pay-per-view every single time they fight no matter what agreed and you know Nick D has changed the game in terms of his elite cardio he did something that was a new thing and that new thing was he's not gonna hit you with 100% power he's gonna heat with 50% but he's gonna hit you twice as much and you're never gonna get to breathe and he's gonna stay on top of you and he's gonna talk to you the whole time so he's gonna fuck with you psychologically he's gonna disrupt your breathing by constantly hitting you huh and then once he realizes you're hurt then he's digging to the body then he's putting it on you and on top of that black belt you do two skills really good wrestling takedown defense fucking chin made of iron and an unstoppable will like his will to beat you was just unstoppable one when Nick was at the top and Strikeforce to this day I think he's one of the best fighters has ever done it yeah to this day no I agree I think a lot of that unstoppable will though comes from him doing triathlons that's like hey I cannot stop otherwise I lose my time and I'm only got five more miles or eight more miles until I get to the bike or I get to the run or until I'm at until I get to this I'm done with the swim those are things in your mind as an athlete you're always thinking like I'm almost there yeah okay I'm only gonna run till the to the the two-minute mark a I'm only gonna run to the 5 minute you set goals for yourself as you go should I smash the goal ok one more go ahead those are the things that top athletes do and I feel like that's what he's done with his career he used triathlons to help get him there yeah it was always good always nasty like good Jiu Jitsu great phenomenal guillotines his game has always been really good when he upped his game and that bought in boxing and the pace like you're saying just the touch touch touch now Bam Bam touch touch touch bet that's next-level boxing that we hadn't seen in MMA at the time yeah and sparring with Andre Ward on a regular basis yes I mean he did look he he he did really change things he really changed things in particularly with that fucking cardio of his he has some spooky cardio speaking of spooky cardio let's talk about Tony Ferguson okay that guy's got some guy and you you have personal experience with 20 yes yeah this guy unfortunately he's getting spooky fucking cardio man III give him a real shot against khabib I give him a real shot okay so um I do and I don't and I'm not trying to take a dig at him I actually am a big fan of his can I was a big fan of his before I fought him and I did a lot of research on him leading up to the fight I never really showed him any respect up until like he's just okay he's a little sloppy's this he's that but once I did the research on him leading up to our fight I ate impressed me what impressed me was dude the guy can take a shot give a shot the guy doesn't slow down the guy doesn't care where the fight goes anytime you have somebody who doesn't care what the fight goes it changes the dynamic of how you approach him because if you take him down what does that matter he don't care yeah he's good with the darts he's good at the guillotine he's good with trials he's good with all those he doesn't care so if he stays on the feet guess what he keeps his distance in his range was his long-range push kicks and isn't and his jabs and his you know combinations he doesn't care where the fight goes neither does the khabib but obviously could be would like to keep the fight on the ground press against the fence doing work what he's done and it continues to work and does does what he does best I'd look for me I feel like the only way that Tony wins is by a cut hmm I don't think I don't think I don't think that he can sub him now I'm not saying it can't happen we understand like when cuts happened you get a little more slippery things slide in a lot faster okay um especially in that Darce position like he's really hit that Darce up from any direction he'll hit it from he'll hit it from his guard and I'll hit it from his but he'll hit it from anywhere yeah so if you're hanging out if beef doesn't put the placement of his head in the right spot it could be a really really tough night for him yeah he hits a V sabor oh yeah yeah so he's got all the intangibles to become world champion I don't he's already a former in the interim champion which I still considered him that he was the champion yes there I have nothing bad to say about him I just think that physically strong key is not and I don't want my knock in hand I'm just simply saying strength wise he is not but Joey I want to shake my hand his hands will go around yours probably twice just break he know he's got such a long fingers that's what threw me off honestly when I shook his hand at the winds his fingers wrapped all the way around my hand almost engulfed my lands like oh shit you got really begins well that makes the power no not just that but when I when there was a moment that's where he had yet risk control so when I got into his guard he grabbed my wrist and I couldn't get my arm free and then in the meantime he's album in my head I got two Mercedes Benz cuts right here on the front of my forehead okay so it was like right there and then he cut me with the good elbow when I stepped in on one but the two mercedes-benz cuts were from him with the wrist control on him elbow me from his guard hmm if khabib gets put in his guard it could end up being a tough fight because cuts cuts happen and when they do happen you have a shaved head there's nothing stopping them from flowing right into your into your eyes your eyebrows are not gonna stop all that blood and if you recall remember the Joe daddy Stevenson Deniz Edwards fights that shit was just squirting out you know there's a Adam pic alati fight as well and Bellator with he had cut the guy on the top of the head and literally he gets a rear naked choke Tsin and you see blood gulps mm everywhere and I'm just thinking to myself in a fight where you you know you shave your head of your heads your hair is always really shorter it's you know it's it's not gonna look good to the to the judges or to the doctor and things like that and by letting like shot brought this up this fights in New York yeah with that fucking lame-ass doctor this stuff I yeah oh he's got a vagina on his eye no one gives a shit like it still fight right you know um they're just they're being extra cautious in New York right now because it's a relatively new sport is what I believe I believe you know and then I believe they had that death of that boxer that was there so then that it just they're just trying to make sure which I understand like the safety of the fighters is most important yeah I would prefer that being in Vegas yeah yeah yeah in Vegas they let shit go although you know I think they mean they did check Maci barbers knee that was crazy it was kind of awesome though because yeah I've done that a lot with my therapist my therapy like yeah you have like a probably great to sprain but you'll be all right like you can tell if that right if it's torn your shits flopping around but you did anything was weird they were checking they're like remember Thiago Santos yeah taro Santos has zero knees yes knee were gone and he's still swinging haymakers at John Jones because he's a fucking Savage I mean look at that fight I could see it going to John but I also I could also see it going to Santos Santos I was like man if you hadn't got hurt how would this might have been different right you're you weren't good really good he's fuckin dangerous shit and that power is undeniable now seemed like he didn't get hurt from anything it was a good weird thing right like you threw a punch in his leg just kind of buckled yeah buddy I remember the remember Patrick Cote did the same thing with Anderson Silva yeah you know uh he would I think all righty would Carlos Condit with tea would the same thing I didn't really do anything it's like a little step back we'll start with Tyron there was a leg kick remember yeah what would the he tore it that was it from the lake kicker was on me sometimes like you know how it is like sometimes you were a little fucked up going into the fight and sometimes you just get a little bit of an injury in the fight and then all sudden a big leg kick but tyrant leg kicked him and then isn't his knee blue knockout tyrants legs would yeah I know I'm trimming them up a couple times he's fucking legs for someone who is built like a Greek god he's fucking one of the nicest he's a great guy so fucking such a great I love how smart he is too intensive his full career like he's getting his like he dips his hands and a bunch of different things right he's rapping he's doing a lot of TMZ stuff he's constantly putting up YouTube content he's on top of shit so that's so to touch on we're I was talking with I guess I keep bringing up John cuz don't I talk about a lot obviously but is fighters after fighting you need to have a game plan yeah and I'm not saying it's gonna all work okay guys something like that's the thing is like I want to fitness gym I own a martial arts gym and I do a podcast and I'd you know and I own a clothing line I do all these things but all of them supplement a little bit of the income that I was making for fighting I think the problem is as fighters need to get into dabbling and other things look whether it's a podcast or whether it's a owning a gym or anything I would recommend no gym businesses just I would recommend rough it's rough I mean it's it's the constant hustle I've got 15 employees so it's a lot of work when you've got that many employees it's like you have trainers that work for you have front desk people that work for you I've got just coaches that help work and help teach when I'm not there like they're there now while I'm here with you and so it's it's and I owe a lot to them like they you know they run the fort while I'm gone there's a lot to manage it's a lot to manage I get back to the room you know later today and I'm get on the computer look at my computer I look at my cameras like how you have here you see a everything's okay everything's going good plenty of kids came to class today I can I've got like over 100 kids and my martial arts gym that's all you know a Jitsu base and wrestling jujitsu got DC's wrestling program in there but all that gym business is hard it's a constant hustle but you have to remember to Evan Pleau so summers are slow cuz indoors no one really wants to train there in the summer it was like I want to go to the beach I want to go run up the beach I wanna go to Muscle Beach and lift you know like those are the things that people who want to go hiking you know camping um that's the fitness side of it there's Jitsu part of it like sure that you two nerds they're in there they're gonna be there no matter what you know kickboxers anything like that they take the vacation because they know they want to be outside Jimba this is extremely hard during the summer you're slow september/october you pick back up holidays you're slow new year's you're back to getting busy because new year's resolutions you all want to be skinny up and up until May okay when it's more a weekend you're all in Vegas you know at the parties that's that's their game plan so you just got to learn to manage your money and budget your money and figure out things to supplement the income during the times that are slow that's really what it is a really smart thing for fighters I mean Brendan obviously is struck paydirt with the fighter in the kid and below the belt and all the other shit that he does and in a lot of ways and also stand-up in a lot of ways he's opened up the door for a lot of fighters to follow that model and a lot of guys are doing podcast now because that I mean Mike Bisping has really good podcast with Luis Gomez and you know there's a lot of other fighters that are getting involved in in setting up similar things too but I think that's really important too to say that they need some like you you can't fight forever it's not possible so there's got to be something you're going to do for the rest of your life to make an income and when you're focused singularly on one thing being the best fighter that you can be it's very difficult to even imagine a future without fighting for a lot of these guys so this is the advice that I gave myself so my last fight was against patrika pitbull which is Patricios brother you know I lost and when I lost I kept going to the gym after and when I kept one in the gym and I was thinking to myself you know you're 40 years old like you know this what do you like what's next you know I'm gonna fight again let's and when the reality set in that like if you want to do something else your new life is gonna cost you your old one you have to have that mentality because I can't keep going to the gym wasting two you know four or five hours a day at the gym and still try to start another career right you've got to leave that behind whatever it is you're doing let in fighting if you're gonna move and do something else then you need to leave it behind you have same intensity the approach and the problem is fighters don't do that like fighters that leave the sport or gonna retire you know they're done fighting they don't do that they keep hanging on to I'm gonna go to the gym every day see all the boys I'm gonna go to the gym every day and hit mitts with my trainer why get established first and another job okay start making that income now make that your hobby go and hit mitts with your coach again your coach is gonna love you still gonna be there if I call upon the arrow tomorrow if he's in town hey I want to hit mitts tomorrow it's a 6:30 all right let me move some guys around for you I only got about five minutes in me you know yeah it'll make some adjustments for you yeah those guys will be there those coaches will always be there for you go back to it I just I can't give any better advice than your old your your new life is gonna cost your own let it go it's okay move on but give the same energy and enthusiasm to your new job or whatever it is you want to do that you did to fighting and you're gonna be great well you have a very intelligent approach about it but for a lot of guys it's really hard because fighting is their identity it's everything it's it's who they are and also the highs the highs of competition the highs of victory they're always chasing that and then when life gets dull outside of the cage there's this feeling like maybe I got one more in me maybe I got one more that's it that's I think that's a social media play though that's what it is they like that they're in love with the likes that's what it is like I mean you only get the like something you see the hearts but besides social media it's been something that fighters have done throughout history way before social media Sugar Ray Leonard did I remember when you got knocked out by Hector Comacho yeah Terry Norris and we like ray get out of there yeah I mean we're seeing it we see it with Roy Jones yeah you know it's it's sad you know and Holyfield did it for years no no it's just look it's it's it is hard to get away from something you've done for your whole life and no matter what it wouldn't it doesn't matter just fighting it could be it could be the NFL you see guys playing in the NBA guys cleaning trying to plant in you know Europe and all these other places because they just love it they love the competition they love getting up and down the court they love whatever it is they're doing I understand that but um you got to move on yeah and I don't mean like you got to leave it behind you just got to come back to it later right when you're established doing something else you got to find the next stage of your life the next well the hardest thing I feel like realistically the hardest thing is like you're finding you're trying to find something that supplemented the income that you were making I was making really good money Joe it takes me a whole year now of work of all four of these other companies to make what I was making it one fighter why not fight and a half it's like God but you have to understand that there's there's a means to an end like if I just keep doing what I'm doing you know and one day off my mancave like look at hens Oh like hens Oh Gracie is a huge school in New York City makes a shit ton of money and you know got there from his career and fighting in jiu-jitsu and figured out how to make more money than he ever made as a higher fighting career every year just doing that but he also hit aligned himself up with great people that was the other thing John Danaher is fuckin amazing you go to his class I went there with Frankie Edgar and some of the other guys that were there I was like good god can I give him like a little 2x2 space to try the move because there was so many damn people there it was an act and this class was at like 9:30 or 10:30 in the morning on a Tuesday I'm like why don't you guys have jobs there's so many killers that come out of that gym he's insane and just the approach and how hands o handles his business every time you see hands oh how is he super friendly how you doing that's what helps generate and drives business that's the thing I want to that the other thing I want to tell young young fighters or fighters they're thinking about leaving be positive man you had a great time being an athlete and a fighter move on now when you move on keep that same positive energy everything you do how you doing hey smile when you walk past people we don't see that enough in some old bitter fighters like why don't be that way you were fucking great don't worry about what goes on like focus on what's next and be positive as you do and I think everything will be great it's hard for guys to accept the new chapter in life you know another parallel is hot chicks when hot chicks get older like some of them just have a hard time let know oh yeah it's just like god damn you used to be the thing you would walk by and every guy would be like holy shit yeah and now you're invisible and for a lot of women that's a devastating transition in their life for like a girl who's an average girl an average looking girl it's not as hard when you get older you know you were never a show stopper to begin with you know but there's something about show stoppers it's like it's just a gift from the universe a gorgeous girl it's just a gift you know you just got fantastic genetics it's really all it is that this facial symmetry on the way your body's built I mean there's a lot of girls that are showstoppers you don't even have to work out and when they get older it's like the universe takes that gift away it's almost worse than having never had it and for fighters sometimes it's the same way because as you get older and you're living a regular life with a regular job with a lot of people be happy with your not happy with it because you're a member being a conqueror you remember being the guy that gets his hand raised and have thousands of people screaming and cheering you remember the after fight party you remember training you member walk in the gym and everybody goes that's the fucking man right there yeah the sport will be on after you it was there before you and I'll be there after you like every every athlete needs to remember that and as far as with women look women go through the baby fat stage like like kids do you know they go through the baby fat stage when they're younger that I feel like they haven't fully matured I feel like when you look and I want to say women don't hit their prime until that 32 to 36 37 year old you see how I'm like then they become a woman they become a woman and they are absolutely beautiful I'm telling you like you look at girl like you look at Jennifer Aniston when she was like probably in her 30s or early 30s or you know late 20s you see her like when she was in that 40 Age good god just way different JLo same thing when I was younger horses so they take care of themselves you're right but I think a majority of women know between that 32 to 36 37 that could be theirs whether it's sexual pee that's the hot spot I really believe because you know look there was a lot there was there were some girls that I that I knew some some girls that I knew that were ring girls and they when they were first started on they weren't as beautiful as they are now as they've got a little bit older mmm the other thing as well as sometimes though they were pretty with natural looks when they started and now all of a sudden they've got so much work done they don't even look like the same person there's two sides to that just let your body mature before you go sticking that shit in your face okay and I'll bet you you're gonna be just you're gonna be a lot more you're gonna be beautiful no matter what yeah you start putting that shit you look like every other person that's on social media it drives me insane to see that cuz it's just you look you guys all have the same doctor I can see it's also you see girls in their early 20s getting their face shot up they're not he's got easy yeah they're not even done the rod he's not even done growing yet physically filling out and I'm thinking gosh they want to fill their cheeks in with that those fillers and all that stuff yeah it's a it's a bummer but yeah it's the but what I like one of the things that belt or and the UFC is doing is employing former fighters to commentary and to to do analysis of fights Bellator does a fantastic job with you guys and the UFC does it as well fighters is you know commentators and I think that's that's a great Avenue I mean it's it's and that's something that's gonna be around for a long time and if you're good at it you're very good at it I really enjoy you're doing it because you have great side that means a lot coming from you I appreciate it thank you great that's but it's such a great thing that they've done and it's amazing that they hadn't done that before and now boxing is caught on I mean boxing had it with George Foreman and a little bit with Roy Jones jr. but for the most part the people that are doing commentary they were analysts you know and you know you'd have like one fighter but the guys sitting around the table talking about what they think about these matchups and what they think could go down like that's very valuable insight to the fans too it enhances the experience for the fans and provides a future career for fighters George Foreman to me it was one of my favorites because he had the best line ever when he told Larry Merchant you see fighting you don't know fighting to me just let everyone know I'm gonna put you in your place yeah without actually throwing a punch I mean and it just let me know the fighters are meant to be in that position and so when you're saying guys like DC stepping up and doing what he's doing I think he's amazing ya know um he's no nasty I love doing what I do and I gotta tell you I've been definitely blessed the fact that I will I owe a big majority of my career to Scott Coker because these are things that sure I had to audition for I still had to get out there and you know and and do what they asked me to do when it came down to the audition you have to be able to nail it and I was lucky enough that they're like yeah you're good enough we'll give you a try so but I feel that the reason I think why it worked out so well is situations like this I had already started a podcast I was already comfortable being in front of the mic this this is one of the knowledge --is one of the things that I got from Brennan when I went on his show the first time on big brown breakdown we talked I'm like you know talk to me about how this whole thing did and how it all started for you and he goes Josh just look at this microphone as if it's a rep every time you're in front of this microphone it's a rep that you're getting for the shows that you're gonna do you know and so when I get now in front of the microphone and your honor you know and we I'm holding it there and I'm talking with Jay Glazer and Chael and whoever else whatever fighters one of the hardest things to do is listen to what the hell they're saying you know like when you're this is why I admire like what you do so well is like you'reyou're you're talking to me and I have to listen to you and you're listening to everything I say so you can come back with an answer most people already have a question in their head they're gonna ask and they don't care what you're gonna say yes and so when you're when you're talking to a fighter right they generally will well for me I did it like this and I did like well you can't do that well you gotta make it about the fighter it's like jiu-jitsu if you're I'm thinking about what you want to do to a person then you're not thinking about what they're gonna do to you you're gonna get surprised yep you have to just you have to flow and the conversation is like a flow you have to be able to listen and you got to be able to respond and if you're not listening you're just talking at that person the people at home are going this is awkward yeah and they don't like it yeah because now I'm just artificially putting in questions that you weren't even talking about it just sounds really bad yeah so when I had done the audition for Bellator Donna and Viacom studios they had sat me in a in a in a silent room but he was like kind of like a room like this with a monitor and I had to call a truce fight and I already knew that I'd knock the guy out it was like it was very awkward I was like oh man how they auditioned that's how they artists really hate call this fight I was like oh man this is I already know the result then I was like yeah so I think it everybody needs to do is set up that right hand and boom knockout I was like yes I knew I was right it was like one of those scenarios and situations but but it why we did that and then the resolver some some other stuff too where they had like someone Goldie do something and I had to answer questions with him and you know there was a lot of things that that came along but that was part of the audition and then I did a show with Brendan Schaub on the delatour's uh show in New York yes so as him and I with Jenn brown at the at the desk and the three of us were up there and that was the first show I had ever done at a desk ever sitting and so that was something that I learned a lot from Brendan I learned a lot from Jenn and I've learned a lot from talking with Big John and coldy and all the guys that were there morale is phenomenal when it comes to me talking I love that guy he's amazing he's a great guy I've never seen anyone write out I don't have you ever seen his iPad his iPad has stuff like have no idea how he can visually see it he types it all up and the writing is so small that if my normal I can't read it ruins got glasses on but he'll read it one time and then he'll recite the whole thing he's got he's got a photographic memory well without a doubt he's got a photographic memory I did you know he'll read it all and then when we do rehearsals for the shows he does this walk down where he walks he introduces all of Bellator and like hey fans everything live like on tv live and all he's not carrying is his his iPad or phoner notes or anything he just recites it word for word verbatim like he did in rehearsals every single time the guy's an animal he's a machine he's an animal and I kid you not well he does show time he does WWE and he does Bellator yeah it's it's crazy to think of all the things he does and he's just honest but like I I am I love how open he is about mental health issue you know about his own struggles and you know trying to let people know the pipe hole of rock-and-roller he calls I said yeah I watch that on the I watch that on a plane ride um oversee that I think I was going to Milan and I watched that and I never had realized the the severity of what he would go through before and after shows yeah until you see that you don't realize what what mentally they go through like man you sucked you did this you fucked it up you did like he's yelling at himself in the mirror after like you knew it should have been this out like he misses a word it's like yeah yeah it's um it's a tough job man I only did that once that play-by-play thing are the the play-by-play commentator gig once with Phil Baroni I mean if L did it it was fun it was fun working with Phil we had a good time yeah but that play-by-play spot is fucking hard man yes that's a different thing you got to take sometimes you gotta take them in out of commercials you got taken in out of rounds you've got traffic you're running traffic you're directing everything it's fucking hard man it's way harder than color color you just sitting there and like and you know if a fight starts happening and things you're just describing what's happening you know what's happening you know how to talk it's not that hard but to be able to do that play by place yet like John Anik is a goddamn wizard Johnny asked the best I've ever seen I've never seen anybody like him he's so smooth he's just the right amount of talk and the right amount of laying back you know he doesn't ever overstep his bounds in terms of like his knowledge base and what he understands and doesn't it's got a great sense of humor great guy yeah I got to tell you when he first came onto the scene with UFC I was like yeah yeah you know but you know I got it I'm being honest yeah but I gotta tell you he's grown on me yeah actually truly like I actually love listening to him kind of call fights and I like I love when his interviews are good everything he does is great do you know him as a person no I don't I've met him like in hey how are you but I don't know I never hung out with he's fucking amazing but everything I've ever heard DC talks is so highly of him he's like these fucking one of the greatest guys super nice guy and so on yeah III in the beginning I was yeah you know you know and then but then as he started calling more fights and his Easter and when I think when I started seeing some of the the front camera angles that you got that the UFC does for like your eyes reaction yeah that's when I actually started really like it was he just and loves it yeah and that's those are things that you want to see from your guys those are things that you want to see from people that they love the sport and they're there in it balls-deep like they want to be the they wanna they want to know the sport I'm working with the guy right now over in the UK because I handle all the UK series for Bellator so I call the fights cage side there and so I work with this guy named Dave Ferrara and he I kid you not from the first day we worked together we meshed and he was great like in he's like hey man I don't know any the submissions I don't know this on that I said let me let me focus on that you worry about selling you know boom this shit happened you know like right and so arm after the very we did the very first fight and he tried that he said something about a killed teen or something I was like you I said don't after the fight I said don't say that I said he was on his back it's a rear-naked then after that he never he never but he also went to a couple jujitsu gyms and started asking didn't take class but he started asking about what submission though is that what's mission so he could start kind of do and he did his research came back and had study had had known what the guys were doing how they had won fights what it was so you know so he's just every since we've done a show he's progressively gotten better and better and better and he's really good now I love working with the guy you can you know it can be a daunting task to step into that world that you don't really understand you're not a practitioner yeah and then to be a comic for look there's one thing about MMA fans if you don't know what the fuck you're talking about they will come down on you like a ton of bricks it's hard no it's true get rough and they appreciate they appreciate someone who's genuine like that's one of the things you were saying when you saw his enthusiasm when Anik you're looking at a video of him reacting to fights genuine enthusiasm is appreciated because you know there's so many fans and they everyone knows how to talk and everyone knows how to talk about fights they did like fuck I could do that yeah so if you're doing it you're not interested in it or it's not really your thing they get mad at you no it's true like you need to make sure that you're you're as an analyst I think as an analyst I had to realize that it's not about you anymore you're not that guy in the cage right okay it's about the guys that are in that cage you got to make them bigger than light you got to make them feel not just feel but I got to sell them to the world yes that this guy is the best guy and so when I have these conversations like with you and when I'm on my podcast talking about guys like Patricio and Lima and MVP and you know and Gengar Mousasi and those guys being as good as UFC and good as as good as um want to see guys I have to I'd say it because I mean it yeah but and I'm not gonna try to push somebody on somebody that I don't believe that in I just truly think that there's guys all around the promotions every portion the desert that are the best that are the best we just haven't found there's probably some guy up in the fucking mountains in dagestan who's the world-class best guy in the world but you just can't find his way to a paved road right you know he doesn't so he's probably the best but no it just doesn't know how to get there it's no different than when we watch a merit have you ever watched American Idol hey how come you know how come you have it you're not a star yet well because I don't know how the business works I don't know how to get in front of people that can make me a star yes that goes with any that goes tough with all the fighters too how do I get in the UFC I don't know okay that's the thing you got to find a way in and if they don't know how to get in and they're stuck living in the woods somewhere and you know trying to be if they don't see that clear path they might not have the same level of commitment so they might slack off or find something else to do there you know it's what we started about this because Brendan was saying that if you're not in the UFC you're not shit I mean I think that's a crazy perspective because when I look at like we're talking about Lima like there are guys out there like I look at Lima and I go he might be able to beat everybody I really believe that that guy's fucking terrifying we knocked out Michael venom page yeah I'm like look he might be able to beat everybody yeah to say no like come on man watch that guy fight look at his fucking power look at the way he knocked out chorus coffee look at those fucking leg kicks man he tortures guys with those leg kicks he's so powerful let's here's the thing though let's not forget when Roy left he was still one of the top guys I see okay and just because and and look I don't know I'm not trying to like ding her dog but what Dana does very well is he he develops the narrative and then the media runs with that narrative very well so they they before he even before they even put pen to paper dan has already wrote the story for them because he know he's already gave them the narrative like Doug you and I are talking about earlier with Connor yeah he made Donald Cerrone he caused him losing 40 seconds Dana came out and said it's not that Connors are cowboys bad is that Connor looked that good that narrative was written for all the media to go ahead and follow because that's before they wrote pay in the paper that's what the narrative was he wrote the narrative for them I just feel that like look there's guys out there that can cross boards all across themas one of them Patrice shells one of them there's guys I think at 135 pounds that we have that can do it as well we've got tons of guys not just us even in one but I would put our guys I would understand I say are but I just say because I came from Strikeforce and we got no respect man it was so hard Joe train horse guys integrated with the UFC we realized how many of them became champions Luke Rockhold and how many of them were world-class guys Mousasi there's so many got Tim Kennedy yeah so many guys came over from Strikeforce you have to remember this is I've been getting criticized for a year not criticized I've been being told I've been told for years that I was never a top guy for years because I was in Strikeforce right and I said well I also know what the guys in the UFC are making and I'm making more in Strikeforce so I'm gonna stay here like at the end of the day to me it it's about making money like borign this is this is I'm a prizefighter let's talk about that is it weird though that like this is the only sport MMA is the only sport where you have these names of these organizations and they're more like boxing nobody gives a fuck of as a WBC title or the WBO title they don't care they care is it Deontay Wilder is here fighting I want to see him fight Tyson Fury I don't give a fuck if it's for the bubblegum title it doesn't mean anything to me but for MMA for some reason because the promotion's become like the NFL or the NBA it becomes the big thing we know there's world-class fighters everywhere it's not like basketball or football where the best guys are definitely playing in the NFL there's so many different organizations and I almost feel like fighters are hampered by the names of these promotions I almost think like we'd all be better off if it was just MMA you know to call it the UFC the problem with that is it's great because everybody knows is a very high quality to the UFC events the production value is amazing it is so much attached to it and so much history but at the end of the day it's about MMA fights that's what it's about and whether it's in Bellator or 1fc it's about how good are these matchups how good at the fighters what am I gonna say well I believe it all started when I believe I believe it all started when credentials were taken away from top MMA media organization our websites and saying hey if you do we don't like what you say you're not gonna get a credential to get in so then they replaced they brought in the mate the other media websites or whatever was USA Today whatever was other media sites that came in and just said it's all about UFC it wasn't a sport anymore it was a UFC brand and we had the best fighters and once you took away sure dogs credentials you know all the other people that were doing what other companies at that time had web they took those credentials away now whoever came in was like well shit they're gonna do it to those big-time you know MMA websites why would they would do the same shit to me if I don't tow the line and that all of a sudden became like fighters now when you see them put it's all about UFC it's not about anything that they're doing like you as a fighter I think look even though it's an individual sport and sure you guys should be pumping your organization I get it but you should also be pumping you because after you're done the UFC will be fine you need to worry about building your brand whatever it is you do to make you big yeah and and it's all for I'm all for the organization the organization does a lot for the fighters I'm not here to piss on any company or any organization they need to make sure though that they're doing what they can to make as much money as they possibly can and I go back to the Strikeforce thing I was making almost double what the guys were making in the top five in the UFC at the time now there was a lot of talk about backroom bonuses and this and that but I was the I was on privy to a couple of those back your own asses when we got bought out and I went over there they were not what I was making on the other side of the Rope so just to give you an example I'm I came over they were like oh wow you're making that they were like whoa what do we got to do you only have one fight left and I was like well he got a match or at least beat it you know like what I'm making now and then in the thought process were like where the fuck am I gonna go though Joshua kind of fucking stepping on your own dick here you know cuz it's tricky right because yeah and negotiate correctly no I couldn't really and that was the thing I couldn't really negotiate at the time I was just like shit alright well let's play this out so I took the least amount of fights I could possibly take wondering if Bellator was gonna be around long and you know and if Scott was gonna stick with the UFC or if he was gonna try to go do his own promotion again you know a lot of a lot of my relationships are come from people that have been around with Coker to me is I think one of the best guys if not the best cop ever done business with I've learned a lot from watching him out how he approaches not just fighters but the promotion itself you know I the one thing I admire the most about him is that like you just don't you don't need to shit on other people like the new UFC or one to say that my organization is the best he takes that martial arts attitude and approach to a lot of things and he never I've never heard him say bad things about Dana White never in a public a private conversation and I I have golf with I play golf with him a lot I have lunch with him a lot I've never once a heard him say anything bad about anybody else in the UFC that's not his approach he's approaches I'm gonna have fights I'm gonna try to make my guys that are fighters as much money as I can and my organization gonna do something that we're gonna do and let them do what they're gonna do I appreciate that yeah he's a very universally loved guy I I would really like cross-promotion fights you know I really would Bellator just did it with Rison yeah you know and what's your I mean what's your take on that I think it's be good for everybody like I said I'm obsessed with Douglas Lima fighting at 170 pounds I wanna see CEO fight yes I'm looking for Patricio to but I look I feel like right now 145 in the UFC is so fuckin talents - yes I'm comfortable with some of these matchups that I want to say I really am interested in seeing a rematch from Volken Oski in max Holloway now I think max Holloway with just a few adjustments checking those leg kicks and maybe a little bit more movement he you know I think he can win that fight but I think volcán a ski with a few adjustments might be able to put on even better performance and now that he's beaten the the goat featherweight I mean who knows I mean a lot of guys you don't really see what they're capable of until they win the title and then you see the confidence take over I mean I think cross promotion with all the champions it would be fantastic I mean look I'm a terrible business person obviously I promote everybody I'd be like fuck you Bellator let's be friends fucking I'll blow you guys up - I wouldn't I don't think the way the UFC does is sort of an isolationist perspective like when phaidor was a champion they would get bummed out that I kept mentioning him when a door was over in Pride and I was like you got to take any consideration fedor emelianenko you mean I might be the best fucking heavyweight alive and there was a lot of guys over there that were fucking phenomenal fighters and we absorbed a few of them and there were some problems with that you know obviously there was problems with the fact that the contracts that they got from Pride a lot of them weren't real so you know there's we thought we had fade or we didn't we fought we thought we had a lot of guys they had to just put him under new contracts Mark Hunt was a good example he wrote out his contract and then there was a problem with supplements you know a lot of those guys were on the Mexican juice but because it wasn't in the contract I fought over there and they said we do not test for steroids I can contract and it's in anyway so tell me there was a giant bowl yeah it was was it actually was I want to even say it was underlined yeah no look so I agree with cross-promotion I want to see that i 100% want to see that but I also think though - you got to look out for all promotions we're gonna cross promote let's not have champion versus champion let's have your number two guy versus this number three guys let's make the best fight here's the thing do you think it would hurt the UFC cuz I don't know if it would I think it would definitely help Bellator but I don't know I hate the name Bellator I think everyone did and I honestly I think everyone did it was true I mean but here's the thing like you already did already spent millions I'm probably close to over a billion dollars and trying to make sure that it was marketed properly back then when Scott came in it's like let's not try to rebrand this Scott Scott's brilliant when it comes to doing this thing these type of things but you notice how he got rid of the he made it very simple the logo is simple everything is simple now and it's easy to say oh that's our logo right there versus this big word that says would like us I don't know what it was behind it was like a Bellator fighter or whatever was yeah it went away gone yeah so like he look at all these things it takes time to get branded do you remember king of the cage when they used to have the king of the cage a giant bodybuilder dude yes it was like the mascot yeah yeah I shout out the terrier okok good that guy look he's been around forever she ate guys like that cuz even though he's not getting rich but he's also making sure that young and up-and-coming fighters have a way to get their name out there and still fight it you know at a high level we know bud bratzman was one of the owners as well he's a really good friend of mine he actually sold him my old house he lives in my old house he's a real good friend of mine I I met him I don't think but bud and Terry were partners in that venture and they used to have this guy who was this enormous fucking bald bodybuilder dude who was the king of the cage now and he was like a mascot yeah remember yeah I do remember he was always wearing like a dry-fit shirt or like a really tight really tight yeah fucking huge muscles yeah but it was so strange it was like but he's not the fighter no so weird give a mascot yeah hey whatever man everyone I'm gonna try something different cats are weird for it's a fighting mask because remember the UFC had the dude who was the bald muscular guy in the logo do you remember them that you bas Rutten it looked like bas Rutten remember the early days of the UFC yeah logo had this guy who was his bald Jack yeah and that was like a part of the UFC logo with some bald dude yeah I do remember that I heard it looked like boss like when boss won the title I was like does this destined for you yeah that's true how weird is that no one like that ever won the title up until boss but that's like so when Scott came in he changed the logo to make it simple like big basically what Dana and Lorenz on those guys did basically made it simple like yes yeah so I think I think it's good for the sport we'll see like look the name itself was like hey do we want to rebrand this no you don't want to waste all the money you did trying to rebrand a new organization that's just too hard and it you know at the end of the day it's you know the execs talked and they're like hey let's just try and make some changes make it simple make everyone just fall in love with us all over again but you know for a different reason the other thing too even though we are doing a tournament format for our fights we're not doing them every like Bellator before was doing every Friday a different weight class and I didn't even really I never paid attention because it was just too hectic to try and keep up now you have big fights scheduled you know every you know once a month you know with the tournament fighters so like this weekend we have cyborg fight Julia but for the title which is phenomenal area under looked fine yeah Julia buds a monster she's an animal and I mean people are in it's funny cuz everyone just keeps overlooking her and she's also Jack and she's not only is she jacked she's got her essence gotten a lot better and I need I remind you guys her only two losses have been to a mana newness and Ronda Rousey when Ronda Rousey was at the top of her game now those two losses those who were extremely early in her career she's been on a terror ever since then and she's been doing phenomenal that well I've had like it again talked with John him and I talked her it's her confidence her confidence needs to be at a different level of guns on Dziedzic she's striking I think is better than then cyborg yes I think it's better real her striking is better than cyborgs denounce a bold state can't she take a shot from cyborg who knows but I think there's a lot to be said like cyborg doesn't throw the straightest punches in the world right you know she throws a lot of hooks so if Julia compression of the fence get inside the clinch make her that dirty getting that dirty boxing get rid of those loopy punches and be inside that pocket right there then I think she's got a good chance well after cyborg got flatlined by Amanda Nunez the whole game just changed yeah everything changed okay okay yeah well first of all Nunez has fucking hammers that lady throws hammers it's crazy it's crazy how fucking badass he is I look at it though - that cyborg had been undefeated for so long hadn't lost and so long that she's just like I'm just gonna walk through this chick and it just cost her I think her confidence was that none of these girls can hurt me I could beat her you know and when she got hit I'm gonna hit you back she was thinking she was gonna impose her will like she did against everyone else right okay and she's gonna try to do the same thing to Julia but right and it's a matter of whether Julia but responds and we're gonna know I think in that first round whether Julia is going to rise to the occasion or if she's gonna step back and let cyborg dictate the pace like a lot of other girls have right I think with Amanda when she pushed Amanda back Amanda hit her and cyborg got rocked in a man of pressed forward and she thought she's gonna hit her back and he became with it's exchange it was a very sloppy fight I think from both sides but a man has big dogs and was able to land the clean good punches and timing yes she what she did very well in that fight was that she made sure that she didn't blow her wad and waste less punches she picked she was picking and choosing her shots so she was making sure that they were landing versus just throwing you know aimlessly and not landing you see that a lot of times people get rocked and the guy just comes in he smothers himself so much that nothing lands and the guy recovers and you're back to fightin yeah you know when I knew that Amanda Nunez was a fucking dangerous dangerous fighter it was first of all the first round went well well you know it's just a lot of fights where you saw it you know you started to see it with cat Zingano the first round she almost had cat Zingano out but then she faded and then she got put away later in the fight which just shows how tough cat Zingano yes cat Zingano is a fucking savage she's at Bellator now yes I know very happy to see her over there but when Amanda Nunez beat the fuck out of Miesha Tate and strangled it I was like oh god damn yeah Jesus cry and then when the Raquel Pennington fights an under looked fight because Raquel Pennington is as fucking tough as they come that lady impresses the shit out of me and the fact that she was able to stop her and beat her down before she stopped her you know you just you realized she was on another level at that point in time but still with a cyborg fighter had questions I was like she's gonna be look what she did to Holly Holm cyborg just bullied Holly yep she was just on top of her beating her down and Holly is a phenomenal strike yes and I was like man is and then but the difference is amanda is her hands Holly you know has good power two hands excellent timing good counters but amanda has like legit one-shot knockout power yeah I agree I just would have liked to have seen them do a second fight because I think I think that cyborg would have fought a smarter yes fight and I would have been a different outfit made it different she would have made the adjustment yes she would make the adjustments not just made the adjustment but we saw with Germaine Dharana me when Germaine farter then Amanda as the fight goes on she's not the same fighter why do you think that she decided to move over to Bellator why do you think she didn't pursue the rematch oh you know the answer to that come on Joe just you can't I think the comments this the two being treated like that you know certain ways people talking behind our backs ain't you know calling her you know a man whatever it was those are there's not just that but then also to a little bit of them I think some of the mistreatment in that in that whole thing the other thing as well listen I like all that stuff aside she's got a relationship with Scott Coker she had him from Strikeforce and they've always got along he's always he's always amped her and got a memory he's the one that first put women's MMA on the on the on the big stage you know her and Gina Carano were the ones that made women's MMA that next level of what a what because there was something that happened between them were the UFC was like we're getting out of the cyborg business I'm trying to remember what it was I don't remember what happened but there was some sort of a dispute that they had was it before everything was before the Amanda knows no no no no no no they put out a video Cyborg's boyfriend put out a video where she put words in Dana White's mouth and they were fake yeah they mistranslated it on purpose willfully and then she had to apologize for it and then the UFC was like get the fuck out here you can't do that yeah and that's when they released but that wasn't her right that was her boyfriend and her manager - his room oh yeah yeah that's what it was so that's why she got out of the best that's why the UFC got done with cyborg but here's the thing is that when she was with when she she's been she would having loss in what 15 years or some shit like this gina carano well before the gina carano fight her first fight very first of all she lost yeah but whenever so that first fight she hadn't lost since then it's been close to 15 years all right and to say that like now all of a sudden because she had one loss after a man she lost a man is that she's done like she wants to fight easy fight she was it Julia but is not an easy fight for no you know and but that we go back to when I was talking about the narrative the narrative being that Dana shapes the narrative the narrative is that look if you want to fight over there you're gonna have easier fights and the press jumps on board and the fighters jump on board and it becomes an issue that's why I feel like we're not seen cross-promotions well I just think it's a business decision in the UFC doesn't have any vested interest in blowing up Bellator and making that bigger and Bellator would get bigger along the way but I think Julia bought hangs with any 145 pounder in the UFC and I would like to see her fight in the UFC I would like to see cross promotion with her as well I just feel like it's just one of those things where it's it hampers the the fans because the athletes they're just not gonna face each other well let me let me go to this is we already saw across from ocean when UFC was basically asking or I don't say begging but they were they were trying to force the issue with Chuck Liddell fighting in vanillin yeah and remember that but they got fucked over because they actually sent Chuck over there and then pride didn't send anybody over here yes you know and and I here's the thing those we've already seen with Scott what he says he's gonna do he does and that that's a big reason when I had the I Ashe the fight Caligiuri it was supposed to be they sent a Oki over when it was dream and they sent Naoki over and Scott was supposed to send Gilbert over afterwards to fight each other so a Oki fought Gil in Strikeforce and then after Gil beat him he was supposed to go over there and fight him in a ring that didn't happen so I got a call on like 12 days notice and Scott's like you need you can you do this for me and I was like I was I'm literally sitting at the fucking courtside of the Warriors game eating chicken strips and drinking a beer I'm like I'm like let me go home on a run about four or five miles see how I feel and I'll get back to you call him that night at midnight and he's like I'm like yeah I'm good I can go so that's how I took the fight with Caligiuri on like ten days notice and just so look when people want to talk about how the Japanese do business and what happened with the UFC I can understand I can understand while they're hesitant to do cross promotion because one when I actually accepted that fight with ten days notice I was supposed to fight Aoki but when I got there they changed it to Caligiuri wow that's a big different that's a big difference but what they do is what they do is once a wrestler won Jitsu guys sure but the other thing too is what they do is they say hey here's another amount of money here's the check for this if you switch them you take this guy so there it's different you know like they're so sneaky over there it's I don't know if it's called sneaky they just they really want to I bet Aoki now is wishing he would have fought me cuz he got knocked out that I by a kickboxer because they made him fight a kickboxer and that's what Japan is famous for hmm they really wanted they want to put fights together that people don't expect to happen you know we saw hoyes fight the big sumo guy and you know and those are fights that people talk about for their once for the ages man look at when phaidor fought that big what hung mantua yeah we still to this day we still do this day talk about those kind of fights you know but you know even phaidor wouldn't fight Bob Sapp yeah and his prime is like you know fuck out of here because when Minotauro got fucking piledrive yep he was like no no no that's an injury you keep for the rest of your life yeah Charles neck is still fucked up to this day it doesn't make any sense like you sure there's guys that you can fight but Bob Sapp was one of the first guys that explode on the scene that had a lot of athleticism 375 with ABS yeah James Reed 75 I think you know were sent clean clean as a whistle dude when I met him like if you stand next to him you just go wait wait wait wait what in the fuck are you what are you what is this new type of human being yeah he's so big have you ever talked to him yeah yeah I've talked to him yeah hey good Zaki Kazakh I was on a bus ride from somewhere in Tokyo - Saitama Arena and it was like an hour and twenty minutes he talked the whole interesting career right yeah he was a enormous superstar in Japan yeah normos like it's hard for us to understand like they were selling dolls of him and posters and he was huge but then he ran afoul with k1 remember there was this event where they didn't have a contract for him he was supposed to fight and he's like where's the contract you know like you will give you the contract after the fight he's like no no I need a contract I need I need to know what the fuck is happening here and then he walked out and when he walked out they decided they were gonna ruin him yeah it was that night it was they they were at the venue he's like I'm still willing to fight just give me the contract they never gave him the contract yeah he was telling me that story the whole time I was there how's that I would imagine yeah some I get the vibe that it is a little bit you know I don't think much has changed that's a Power Move you know to let you know know after the fight we'll give you the contract like what are you talk ya know he's and he still he's still like force and he's still fighting still looking like sissy grant for a minute 20 yeah gets tagged with a little one that's a wrap he swings your swings until things get weird no he told he straight out homies like no I tell them it's 60 grand and I give you a minute 20 at a minute 21 I'm going down I straight up and that was one of the conversations on the bus 21 I'm going down that is so crazy I'm gonna take more damage when I got his orbital broken by cro cop remember like one of his eyes looks weird yeah I just got like one eye that's open really wide it's cuz a cro cop which is crazy like cro cop was like 220 yeah you know and fuckin hit him so hard with straight left he fractured his eye socket sap was literally more than hundred pounds bigger than him it's correct was uh was that with kick boxing gloves on yeah yeah just gotta fit it in the right hole that's all it is I think it was kickboxing I think it was kickboxing yeah as I recall it was because I don't think he took him down I think it was a kickboxing fight well he beat her nesto who's twice yeah which is crazy and who's had him really hurt Doug shots to the body fucked his legs over didn't couldn't put any switching his stance I got dropped by Lake he cited a couple but one or two times Layne got back up I was like that was before he decided the 121 was the limited well that was when he was 89% steroids no look his body was so big and so ridiculous it just rocked up when he fought Minotauro I remember Eddie Bravo and I were watching it and he they were like they show minitor already and they turned to Bob Sapp you like Jesus his head was here and that his neck started right where his head crests yeah like his neck went all the way to the edge of his shoulders like that is the biggest human being I've ever seen in my life he goes like just from his ear to his shoulders were cartoonish it was like the the big boss and a Mike Tyson punch-out you know yeah video game he was so big and when he picked up Minotauro and pile drives almost like oh my god I know kill him yeah it could kill him everyone and we're all thinking like you're not allowed to do that and they're like in Japan they're like yeah stomps hey tics they don't give a fuck have you ever been there to call you've been there gonna fight you see how that the crowds changed if I do the crowds change for the UFC a little bit they're kind of more cheery but they're still very quiet you know in between transitions you hear everything it's weird because you hear the coaches you hear less got left leg left leg get through pass through pass through you hear like the fighter can hear the opponent can hear is very strange never been to our gym because it's not quiet at all okay well we're training it smart guys are like coach knee to a fuck a guy get up get up don't let him fucking take you they're getting on each other but over there it's so funny my first fight over there and pride they'd switch my opponent like six times I showed up and then finally the original guy was supposed to fight it was a maraca see he'll help the end ready to fight again he just shows up to the weigh-in it's just jack tension yeah I said so I had to fight him who was it I want to say his name was - Suki Suki they call him the Amazon real good jujitsu guy phenomenal Jitsu guy and he swung for an arm on me like in a minute I'm fucking almost god I was like belly down trying to escape but had had that fight been in any other organization I'll probably have lost because I could hear crazy Bob and Dave Camarillo yelling to me hey push the feet off the face cuz my arm was fully extended he was belly down I was belly down and I'm like and it was I could hear my elbows clunk and I could just feel you know you know muscle kind of stretching and carrying a little bit yeah and I just started pushing and I could hear them crystal clear get the feet off your face get the feet off your face Dave Camarillo was like in such like can't Blues happen you almost sort of walking back to the fuck in back to the locker room thinking that I was gonna tap because I was trying to reach for the feet and he's yelling put the foot put to get the feet off your face well I was able to push and wiggle it out and when I wiggled it out I swung around for the e bar in the perfect position I was able to at the knee bar and the fight ended like that it's like wow a minute twenty minutes like that so but it was one of those you know one of those things that they do in Japan where the cultures are so different over there it's really good someone would pass the guard everyone would cheer yeah yeah cool but it's a kana is a little weird when you're you know you guys are squared up and you're bouncing around you can hear yeah I'd rather hear the crowd it's funny I wonder if you get used to that and then if you go to fight in the UFC is must be overwhelming for Japanese guys that are used to fighting over there with that total quiet and they come to Vegas it's like just bleed guys like you they're walking out you're gonna die yeah you know this it's crazy it's not over there what a wild fucking sport it's so it's such a crazy sport when you just think about the evolution of it I mean you you started your career you mean you really are a pioneer but you started your career like you're like a second wave guy you're like there was the first wave where no one knew what the fuck was going on and then there was a second wave work I was world complete martial artists that had a specialty background yours being initially wrestling yeah and then you see the third wave guys the guys have been like essentially training mixed martial arts since they were children you know and that's like what we're working Donald yeah and max all the way as well and some of these other guys and when when you see it now and you compare it to like what the UFC was when you first started watching and first started competing it's gotta blow you away yeah you know it does it blows me away because look I I was actually fortunate enough and before I started trying with Frank Shamrock and he was kind of like that first guy konna he was first way yeah I mean like uh Marco who oz was caught on the first wave guy I would say he was probably the first right but the first I felt like the first guy with the big notoriety the guy was Frank Shamrock the guy they kind of like boosted up to there and um he was decent on the list on the feet wasn't great good submissions you know but great he elevated the cardio the he became he was like that first guy that's you need to be in tip-top shape there's no more barstool guys win these fights anymore right and he made sure that was clear him and Tito we're kind of like you're not just gonna get off a barstool and coming here and fucking beat me well he changed Tito's whole game and yes well not just in that game after I don't know but after he lost to Frank he went up and trained with Frank so Frank could teach him how to get in shape and be like he be as in good a shape as he as Frank was for their fight so moving forward Tito Frank was always thinking about himself at that time and I don't know if much has changed but he basically just said like hey I want to make sure you're not beat for a long time because it continues to make me look good so he made sure that Tito understood how conditioning worked and he just trained him in his regimen how these things and that's the story that I did Frank learned from healing from Javier Mendez in Marie Smith okay Maurice yeah Maurice had phenomenal cardio and Maurice also trained Bob Sapp - yes yeah that's that's a such an interesting time where things shifted and guys started to figure out the overall puzzle of mixed martial arts in that sense Frank Shamrock really was like one of the first really complete guys many armed Bart Kevin Jackson yep the first round in the UFC Japan and I can tell you yeah and now in that conversation with he had with Xavier Mendes like men xavier goes this guy's really tough you got to do this you got to do that he's like he's like he's got to take me down with teach me now I'm on armbar sure shit same thing he's like you know and they always put their hands on the mat they always do this they always do that Frank just had this knack at that time he was so driven and whatever it was that he was doing it didn't matter I kid you not there was moments where I was training with him and was to the point where he didn't care he literally just rolled over threw up on the mat went back to training like it never happened okay guys the scoot away from it a little bit just kept rolling like there was never away from the throw from the throw up yeah it up no he didn't even clean it up wait around was waited till around was done we all scoot it all over train some more came back over and he wiped it off the mat because that's distracting it's distracting it's distracting but at the time it was the focus of like hey I'm not done with my round let me finish getting this in I'm out of shape sure but you know I'm not gonna get in shape if I keep quitting to stop and do this and pick this up online right you know um I don't know I think this I like seeing how the sports evolve I like I feel like we have I think in combat sports from 170 down we're phenomenal from 185 to like 205 even like the talent needs to be questioned a little bit sure there's talented guys don't get me wrong but I think the best athletes in our sport are from 170 down and just because they seem to be the most well I mean look Jon Jones is an anomaly okay he's it's one of those guys just like like he's like his brothers I mean a phenomenal athlete he's a phenomenal athlete fantastic gene pool yeah and say you know um so you have guys like him you know and you have other guys that don't look the part but are the part Gegard Mousasi same thing you don't look the part you see him you're like yeah you know phaidor Mellon ACO yep yeah but guess what fucking will you surprised the rampage right ah no not at all no he still got crazy hand speed it's that's that's the one thing that Frank Mir when I talked to him after he's like I thought I could hit him as I did I grazed him a little bit I thought I rocked him he's like and then he just he'd knocked him out going backwards yeah you know uh the power is still there nothing to go we all know that the speed is still there that's what's crazy the speed he's not as durable as used at all but you can't be you know I mean what is he 42 43 years old I mean it but the thing is is it's still no matter what it's he's fun to watch fight oh yeah man I enjoyed the rampage fight I just thought rampage press add when I saw rampage was so heavy yeah and I was like there's no way he could have trained really hard it doesn't help you to be that fat well he was training with uh TJ Dillashaw his guy the guys out of lab yeah he's I mean there was blood yes I'll kill Evita I was to have pictures of him doing the bike in his garage and I mean I don't know if it was just a photo op but maybe he only did a couple times I don't know but look there's there's a ton of guys in you know NRA in Bellator and the the guys I would love to see doesn't have to be for title fights because we were talking about cross promotion it doesn't gotta be title fights let's not let's not ruin champions let's put together fights it like if we did think about think about this a year-end show every year where we pick you know what you kind of let the fans pick are you are you know you have you let's say you have a board so you have a board of people that a year-end show we do and we say hey we'd like to see this guy fight this guy I would love to see Volken Oskie and Patricio I would love to see Lima versus Guzman but that they're both champions so let's have somebody else fight let's see Stephen Thompson an MVP yeah let's have this conversation look it doesn't need to be champions there's no there's nothing to lose or risk other than the fans getting to see the best fights that fans want to see that's the one thing I've always given credit to Coker about is like let's see these fights happen the problem is I think the UFC feels like you would benefit Bellator but it wouldn't benefit the UFC cuz the UFC could make many fights for wonderboy let me let me just make an argument to that there's the one fight with Conor McGregor and Mayweather this is like other guys I don't know if you ever heard of miss cosplay Miller ok so there's these two guys they got together for one fight right and that fight did what numbers crazy number nah MacEwan umbers but that was a freak show right because you got a guy Floyd Mayweather is a greatest boxer of all time right undefeated 49 I know going into that fight it's a crazy situation yeah and Conor's never fought in boxing ever zero professional boxing fights against the greatest fighter ever and you make this gigantic promotion where it's not gonna hurt car because it's not really his sport I mean it's it's a different animal joven animal Joe the biggest pay-per-view right now for MMA is what could be banned Connor cracked 2.4 million yeah that would be that will like the original the the wreath of the fight to make that would probably be the biggest rematch as well okay so that but I I don't know how much it would be the biggest rematch only because he Connor lost and he lost pretty convincingly yeah cowboy like that I bet you could sell it no I'm not saying you couldn't sell it I'm just simply saying it may not do 2.4 it may do that or it may do a little bit less people have already seen it they've already seen it wasn't close nice they may not buy it they now if Connor was to go and fight somebody else and have a dominant performance against someone like a Justin gay Qi and get him out of there or against Oman yes then you make that fight no do more numbers but not off of the 40 seconds we just saw maybe you know and I'm not trying to tell what um what Stephen a saying but we didn't see enough to believe that people can fight we saw a domination yeah and it's not enough to say that he could stop khabees wrestling yeah that's the only concern people were going to talk about this you know but what I'm what I was trying to get out was the conversation with pay-per-views is you do a year end fighter once a year fight or let's just say one will say well I'll say once a year it's easy to and you take the fights that fans want to see your you have a board member of groups from each promotion that said look let's put this fight in this fight together not our champions and I'll bet you that that one card does double or triple what then the best pay-per-view ever has done I don't think so I think so if you said if you say that much I think you can I think you Karen I care I don't think people care that much you don't think so I think the buzz and I also think the marketing dollars behind each promotion to help push it they'll make it bigger than corner and khabib than anything I don't think you can I don't think you can make it bigger what makes a fight bigger is someone who already has a cult of personality behind them right Kabhi brodie has this insane following first of all the the Muslim world's bothering the first Muslim fighters ever to win a world title he's also just this phenomenal freak athlete who fucking malls everybody and you know this unstoppable force against this irresistible object and then Connors this Inc enigmatic person who's just so charismatic and everybody wants to see him fight and he's got lightning in his left hand he's got a history of starching people like Josie Aldo and Chad Mendes and you look at any like what is going to happen when these two fight but you don't have that you look I want to see like I say guys like Douglas Lima but how much is the general public the casual fan want to see that I don't think there's that much of a following I mean how many what is Douglas Leamas Instagram how many followers does he have on his Instagram you look at khabib and Connor yeah Connors are like 50 million or something could she get something similar okay so my take is like is this is you take someone like islam makhachev who trains with could be nonstop he's a fucking seen the 260,000 for one of the best fighters on the planet earth yep show but if you take a guy like that follow bitch give him 161 so if you if you if you match guys if you match guys like you say Islam versus Chandler if you match guys like you know the these other you match some of the gay Guard ver because there was a lot of talk as gay gar was winning when he left the UFC came over to beli Chris Weidman when Chris WOD was on top of his game so you take guys like gay guard you match them against you know somebody over in the UFC and you're in you're taking these these top guys MVP and Stephen Thompson I think a stacked card like that be given given the results from when we're talking about Japan when they do their year-end show is the number two in all of Japan for that for their TV viewer ships so it's some astronomical amount of numbers I wouldn't a Matt I would imagine it'd be bigger than what Connor and could be did I still don't think so I don't think the US I think it would be I think it would I'm glad you're not a promoter well here's the thing though is you're not taking incineration if we use Mighty Mouse and we use Eddie Alvarez we use the guy Timothy now you can there's there's marketing dollars behind one there's marketing dollars behind Bellator the horizon you can't make someone famous no but you can also but you hit to all those different markets but they are gonna promotes a person is famous yes you can promote it make a giant thing but when there not famous to make them famous for a promotion to make the promotion larger it's not gonna happen the biggest fucking pay-per-view they could ever do with Mighty Mouse was inadequate no one cares yeah for whatever reason the casual fan didn't care Timothy nasty who can they're gonna carry way less yeah way less I'm throwing out names that we're talking about standards like yeah look like I mean it's just one of those things the the for the hardcore fan if everyone was like you or I yeah it would be 100% of the world would buy the ticket I mean it would be something that everybody would want to buy the pay-per-view but just I don't care that much about how successful it would be what I care about would it be good for the sport and would people like you or I who are hardcore fans would we want to see that the answer is yes a hundred percent I mean I do want to see pitbull versus Vulcan offski or versus max Holloway I you know I I do want to see Lima versus Camaro lucemon I do want to see these kind of these kind of fights but in the UFC's position like man 170 so goddamn crazy as it is yeah what do you do with Maz Vidal what do you do with Conor now right what do you do with Coby when he comes back from his jaw healing up I mean do they did they set up a rematch for that fight because that was a phenomenal fight between him and his mom yeah and boy did that fucking get everybody hyped up and paid attention there's so many big fights as it is tyron woodley he's gonna fight Leon Edwards that to me is the point man that's a dangerous fight for both guys he woods my boy Leon is he's phenomenal I've carried him I've trained with wood they're both extremely fast mm-hmm both very good and then now the evolution of Leon Edwards is grappling at least with his wrestling when he did the Gunnar Nelson was just nasty and I was like oh wow oh wow we just decided to up our game all the stunts yeah very impressive he's a dark horse in that division you know yes he's one of the people are not paying attention to touch and you know speaking of dark horses you got Calvin cater at 1:45 he's the fucking Dark Horse at 1:45 yeah he was putting it on as a beat in that third round I was like holy shit man out if this is a fourth and fifth round he might stop him he's that fucking good you have guys like zabita that I for me I feel like they're doing they do well they do well they're doing good they almost have to fall they all start to believe the hype a little bit and they're like he took some time like maybe he does not didn't go back to folks in and training hard I've done that a couple times career like I'm gonna walk through this guy not a big deal cuz you don't know about that person but after cater starts llamas how the fuck do you think that he put llamas as lights out yeah you can also say though that like a llama citizen what lamas wasn't what he was when I was making this title run you don't know me know maybe but you're still doing really well you know I think it's just a it's a case of massive amounts of talent in that division yes and I trying to figure out who goes where and what goes where yeah you know and I mean you could say that about thirty five as well like thirty-five is a crazy town stacked place too yeah I mean like you're like so eight forty go back to go back in 45 is we got this kid named Adam boards dudes which is a monster and so flying these Enoch pika-pika out with and he's one of Henry hoops guys can he did it he did it again before that so he's got two flying knee knockouts in Bellator and all the buzz around Henry hooves place is that some of the 55 pounders don't want to spar with him and train with him because he's fuckin good he's good he's balling he's lanky and is extremely good I've seen videos of him training and I've seen videos of him fighting and ya see him fight live I haven't seen him fight live yet but this weekend but how old is he he's like 20 20 s I think he's 26 I think he's 26 yeah so he's you know entering his prime yeah I'm sure I feel like the prime is 26 to 32 like that's you're 31 32 somewhere in there like when I was training and I felt like I was unstoppable was that 27 to 32 age 26 26 hurt the fucking that's my job though he's phenomenal um also to people out the guy that's fighting a Patricio Pedro vile who fight who trains an SPG with car knows he someone's fucking really good as well I just look at these guys and uh Adam Weishaupt like Dave I saw he's another guy that's like he's such a technician just doesn't Lee doesn't fight the part because people want to see high-flying Viney knockouts like a divorce does but he's super technical really good the 45 pound division is stacked and they wants your heavyweight champion now Bader oh that's right yeah he's a duel champ yeah so he's 25 why I felt for some reason I felt like he relinquished one of the titles but no that's not the case no he's yeah he's - phaidor I was like holy shit quick man those guys it actually looks better he's everybody needs to stay there I don't know why he's supposed to be fighting coming up um we haven't announced a fight yet I don't believe he's fighting coming up and so I he's fined at 2:05 he was like 240 walking around yeah walking like why why would you yeah yeah I said you not only do you you're faster you're a better wrestler than all these guys and look I got a lot of respect for steep and him and steep bear friends but I think wrestling wise and fight wise he has a good chance to beat steep a only because of his ability with his wrestling his cardio and his pace the speed and everything I think he'd get in on him well his striking got so much better and so smooth and you know he just got better in the pocket you know after like particularly to lyoto machida lost that was a you know a big thing because he came charging in Machida brought him in and clipped him with a counter shot and put him away you know there was there were some moments where you're like man maybe Bader his time has passed and then all sudden he has this resurgence and starts doing better and better and then goes on to become in Bellator like a fucking demon well you got to remember that fighting is a confidence thing as you win one fight you win another and you was another it becomes getting lean defending the 205 pound light heavyweight title in April yeah well I want to see it I don't know what the name of what he's fighting no if we announce it yet though who was who was there frame who is he looking for I didn't see one yeah I stare for him at heavyweight so you've got off in Congo yeah you got check I don't know if him and hid there I can do the rematch with that because I remember those like a weird eye poke slash like nose and right thumb in the nose kind of weird things so check got out and I don't know what the deal was so I'm you got Minich off Minik off was the former champion who was there before and he had the flu I want to say he lost to check Congo because he had the flu when he fought so then but then he's he's someone that right now is I mean he's funny who's his only loss then he that's what Chuck got checked the the title shot so the two of them menikoff is someone that scares me with Bader because size-wise he's bigger than Bader he's fat he's got that kind of like Samba background and he's good he's doesn't seem like it seems like it's really hard to get top talent at heavyweight top talent heavyweight there's always been the in the UFC at least it's always been the most shallow pool yeah I feel that way in 185 if you look at like even boxing 185 is one of the most gutted weight classes there are occasionally you get the 205 guys mean like I said John Jones you know is an anomaly you get those type of guys that come in but I also think that now if the money's gotten better you're gonna see start seeing athletes that woulda went to football on baseball and basketball they're gonna stop doing that and saying hey these guys are making this much money let me try and go over there now when they're seeing million-dollar paydays and organizations like the PFL you're like fuck I can make a million dollars like shit you know and not it's it's just I think you're gonna start seeing some of those athletes that maybe a benchwarmer in the NFL or maybe a benchwarmer and in baseball or like having to go through the the d-league process or like man fuck this I'm gonna go make money over there look at Greg Hardy mm-hmm you know coming over and uh you know and having good performances in such a long road though man it is just getting into fighting and then trying to go professional with skills you've acquired from football and basketball did not mean you're an athlete you're great athlete and fast and strong but boy there's so many variables that come into play when you're fighting yeah but you also don't have covered you got to look at it though as well is that if you go to the if you're an organization like the UFC's done Greg Hardy some favors you know they haven't given them right top top guys you know and so when that happens because he has a name and they're gonna be groomed then why not well they gave him a tough fight in volkoff's yes they did that was a tough fight yes it was and I was really impressed with him in that fight because Volkov used to be Bellator champion yeah top of the food chain heavyweight big long tall guy difficult to fuck with you know it's like he's he knocked out for Bri silver doom yeah every champion so like Volkov is very skillful yeah awkward it's hell man so tall and long yeah he's it's one of those stars like you have to learn to get past the push kick in the long jab and all those things and once you do you rock right into the knees dude that Derrick Lewis ko was so bananas when Derek Lewis knocked him out I was like that is crazy afterwards it took his shorts off good waste my balls oh shit this is a national treasure he is a national treasure and he has the best fucking Instagram in the game fucking money after that happened I went to his Instagram the next morning it jumped up by like almost a million dollars like I was like Joe out here making everyone famous Jesus but it was it was heat but it's funny I was following him before that and I loved all the things he published man it's so good he's hilarious he's Alerus and anytime something fucked up goes down in the world there's a video of it yeah it's on Derek I think I think he I don't know if he put there was something he posted the other day I was fucking hilarious he's mad he's awesome man man I always love at the end with someone like Falls for stories lands on their head and if the Eddy's first quote is they're okay though myself the guy's fucking dead oh so they're gonna do Francis and gah no and Rosen strike that is it crazy yeah that is I don't um I wasn't impressed with Rosen strike though I'm he's got big power he's got the power well I was impressed with his durability and Alistar and his patience and the fact he landed that haymaker right hook with like what 15 seconds ago or something nasty oh my god that was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen in all my years yeah people try to relate that shit Lawler's cut and I was like long as cut was like he had a sliver what that was face exploded that was not that that happened with one punch like that is bananas yeah and what-what was crazy about it was that it actually happened where his mouthpiece was and not for that type of power to land and split your mouth like that your mouthpiece is supposed to stop those they ass yeah and it didn't so that was gross it was nasty just put on that for him to be honest I was just surprised how he was walking through everything Alistar was hitting with yeah I mean holsters a fucking killer I was outside of like the cut I have no sympathy for him he's married to like a model really dude you're married to a model like whatever dude healed up so fast you see him gas lead healed yeah and there was like no swelling either I'm like what are you made out of yeah well also you got to look at that guy he's been knocked out like 30 times or something crazy like how is and hear him talk he sounds perfect it's nuts probably cuz he's in love with a bottle his model girlfriend I don't know man it's crazy he's he cracks me up no kazaaam oh there's some things I can't say all that with him listen you know he's a he's a good guy who's over in Japan a couple times when we had fought and he was there on the same card and man he was jacked at that time yeah that's me fuck Todd Duffee yeah those days yes I was on that call shit yeah I was on that car the Brock Lesnar fights the perfect example that's ubering at its finest when he fought Brock Lesnar so that cut yeah that's crazy that's like a couple weeks later yeah yeah I mean it swelled up we fucked up for a couple days you gotta imagine he probably got a little bit of plastic surgery done to it as well for them to come a little skin graft what do they do I don't think they skin grafted I think they just stitched the fucking shit out of it they stitch it inside yet stitch it outside and if you look at that that's gonna heal real good man yeah that's that's still pretty fresh I had a very similar one I was wrestling it a K and I take a double I doubled a this guy and I'm he hit the ground first and when his head bounced up and hit me in the mouth I wasn't wearing a mouthpiece so my tooth my tooth came all they threw him in front of my lip and it didn't look that bad but it looked nasty it was asked about your mouth heals quick too yeah weird yeah I would imagine to defend often against infections yeah just you know what I mean you got to wonder how many more flights a guy like Alistair can endure I mean how many times can a guy get stopped you look at all the times he got stopped in pride in k1 and then the UFC I mean has he's had some the fucking justy in Ghana won got Lester Cano hit him with the back of his head on his spine yeah it was nasty back of it I was so back I thought he died it's like this guy's gone Rosen strike and in Ghana is gonna be a very fascinating fight because Rosen strike is a you know he's a real high level kickboxer an excellent Lloyd Ty's leg kicks and I'm wondering if we're gonna see more of that in the in Ghana fight since in Ghana was so boxing heavy and power heavy but in Ghana the differences in Ghana hits you once yeah he hits guys once it just changes your whole life I think I think guys are gonna I'm surprised we haven't seen more guys go to the well with the calf kick hmm like in the heavyweight division I haven't seen it a whole lot but June it was hitting and gone and with it a couple times early in there yeah I feel like I feel like junior though is a guy that he needs to evolve because he has the miles on him yes I mean he hasn't been the same guy since Cain he said that Cain fight no he's been good at moments but he's also been bad you know but second fight with Kane then the third fight with came real good man yeah and so he just hasn't been the same but he's evolving I think with this what the smaller guys are doing to exploit the heavier guys that just don't move as much and right I think I feel like that calf kick has changed the game well the very first time I ever saw that thing being used was Maz with all mm-hmm and Maz Woodall used that against government Lindos I think he put toms shirt use it before that but he swept Gill off his feet probably three or four times in that fight and I was thinking to myself wow there's something to this Benson Henderson was the first guy I ever saw do it God Benson was throwing a lot of those back in the day too many kicks yeah but it's really interesting how much more effective it is now like you seen guys take one or two shots the lower calf and then their legs starting to give out and it shuts your nerves down which it was so weird about it yeah cuz that happened to Chandler when he fought on premise that's a Brent yeah and so and everyone's like oh it's nothing they'll be are I'm like no no it doesn't move anymore how about so who doe when he fought mine yes the second fight I was surprised he was able to get back though - it was nice about that was he was able to get it back and he had I think Mighty Mouse went to it a couple more times it maybe would have had a different effect it could have been the end of the fight yeah it's a it's crazy that these moments happen where something changes in the sport everybody goes oh let's do that and then a lot of people start doing it like when Anderson knocked out Vitor with that front kick to the face yes and everybody's like oh yeah you go through that shit to the face yeah and then you saw a lot of it you saw a lot of guys winning that way which is funny because when you when you take MMA and you and people need to remember what it stands for and people for the longest time like all it's just restless to Muay Thai it wasn't you know like okay we'll do little bit of boxing you know and some wrestling they never went outside that box and then guys like Stephen Thompson and Machida came in you know now you see MVP but when you see these guys they're bringing in a different dynamic that works for them now granted they've been doing it their whole life so you're not gonna be able to adapt everything that they do you can still a couple little things from them you know I don't know if you recall but I was like the first guy that did that little I used to use my heel to your thigh in the clinch against the fence I did it to Yves Edwards and he's like you're such an ass because I couldn't walk for a week you know cuz I was just healing him boom boom boom and that fight was only in the first round ya know and so you have things like that and then BJ Penn said with Matt Serra Matt Serra kept punching him right in the hip bone he's like and I kid you not man Vijay's like for almost two weeks I couldn't walk there I had a like limp because he had fucked up my hip Wow so little things make a big difference I wonder you know when they got rid of that we're from the guard remember those kicks to the to the kidney to the kidneys they got rid of those I don't know if they're back now or not I don't know why they got rid of those why is it okay to kick you in the head yeah but it's also interesting that like the back of the head like the back of the head is illegal but when you roundhouse kick a guy in the head a lot of times you're hitting your foot wraps around the back of the head but it's not illegal well explain this one to me John Jones has a loss yeah it's just one of those thing you're just think of yourself this is so stupid like John explained it on the podcast yes does the fucking commissioners thought that that's how you break bricks and you can't do that to a person yep and he basically just said like and then Laureus Lorenzo had said you know John he wanted the fight for it and John goes look let's just leave that one alone as long as we can still do it from the guard we can still do it from any other angle if it has a little bit of an angle this way in a little bit of a that's what's great like when I do my when I do my podcast Wood Wood Big John McCarthy there's things that I don't know like he people don't realize fighters don't know a lot about the rules we think we do right but let me just touch I don't like to admit cuz John you know I don't like to admit John's right a lot you know like but there's a lot of things I don't know about the actual rules and I fought for years man Joe Abbott was fighting for almost 22 year 23 years also there are rules of morphed a little yes what do you think about the new unified rules like the differences between a downed opponent and things you can do that you couldn't do before but it's not but they're not are they yearly finally unified how they does it Nevada only except they have a modified version of it Nevada says you're still a downed opponent if you have one hand down see for me I feel like look for me I've always thought that um you should be the head when you're on the ground yeah like if I stuff your takedown I should be only your head right there on all fours right it doesn't matter especially if you're not against the cage yeah like against the cage is the only argument against it because I can't move he's stuck that's the only thing that gets you here okay I grip it then get out of there yeah get out of there you gotta move it's just going to create more action more excitement to the fight that's the one thing that I liked about Strikeforce when we were fighting for Strikeforce was that we didn't allow elbows on the ground and people like him I the reason I didn't like him is it just you get at the time it's Sean Sherk was the champ and it was like there wasn't a lot of movement it was like here and he was so small as like bam bam cut guys and the fight was stopped there was risk I'll bloody and for the actual fan at home watching the fight not all fans like to watch blood right you know and so it's like I want to see a good fight I want to see guys getting starched and knocked out right but I want to see a good fight and so I felt like with when they went triforce didn't have elbows you posture up it creates more space creates more space let's just do guy do his moves as well as try to get back to the feet you know or I can back out and try to go be ground pound there's a lot of things that you can love it for variation why would you like it knees on the ground but not elbows cuz you got cuz I think they don't like that stop by a cut yeah I'm gonna see how two cuts if someone's in a north-south position your knee and someone in the face they'll be out let me knock yeah that'd be different than a cut yeah I want to see guys like I said I want to see I want to see guys I want see fights end where I want to see them and by a knockout I mean that would like to use everything yeah I think knees to the ground but also elbows I think everything on it yeah I just think that especially the knee to the ground like you shouldn't be okay that you shoot a takedown and then you're safe yeah from in one cuz you're on all fours that seems crazy to me if you're not safe it should be that the wrestlers forced to roll to their back to avoid the knee to get the fuck away it doesn't make any sense that you in the center of the Octagon you wouldn't be able to hold on and knee someone in the head look I'm a John Fitch one of my best friends okay um but to watch how he fought Rory MacDonald like for the fan sake it's not a fun fight to watch like you grab the leg and the guys like pushes out limp legs out and then you chase them on your knee your hands and knees and you're fishing for the legs it's just not a fun fight and also - it makes it makes us look like doing what the fuck we're doing right you know and it's like I do John you're way better than that but at the time you also don't want to stand with Roy McDonald and that all changes if you allow knees to the ground yes it does position the whole exchange changes yep you're gonna see them start sprawling knee in the head spawn and then the other thing is well look if if the wrestler is a good obviously there are a lot of good rustlers in the sport but let's just say the knee misses and he's able to grab the leg now he can get the takedown so there's benefits on both sides the guy knees and it lands the guy getting knocked out but if he needs any misses and I grab the leg and I Drive into you and take you down now I'm on top fucking you up so there's different ways of looking at it like when you sprawl you want to get your hips back get your legs back so when that happens that you've taken yourself out of the equation of really engaging in action yeah once you try to knee me in the head now you're engaging back into the action where I can grab you and take you down dude I don't even think there should be a cage how about that I think that's the problem giant basketball court sized matted area do you remember there was those like kumite style fights where they had the mats that were kind of camera he had that and then I cut somebody else tried doing it as well with the world combat league with Chuck Norris right and then the what they call it the fucking Meyerowitz the guy who started the UFC tomorrow it's a well yeah what is it something pits you but you have a fucking weird name he came up with some weird name for the pit hey like way rules like some pit fighting championships it was curved yeah the whole thing was curved like that I mean like I don't know cuz like some guys kind of run a lot as it is like he's kind of you know like this boss that oh that's right boss Rutan's has an interesting thing have you seen this no world karate combat league whatever the fuck it's called what is it called karate combat yeah just called karate combat yeah they have like these karate fights and they fight inside this area but they have this elevated outside hmm but this is just stand up right isn't it I believe so yeah but with it's interesting too because there weren't pants but they're throwing low kicks and shit and they have black belts on like it's like all right there this is that this looks like it's somewhere in LA I don't know there the boss is still doing commentary on that they're morphing that changing it they're trying to evolve it but it's like them streets actually that one is yeah yeah okay why not just do more time where's your what's your take on the bare-knuckle boy I thought it was a great fucking idea until I watch Chris leaving when Chris Leben came back and his face was busted up I was like whoa that is a big cut Chris Leben luckily he got hit with an axe yeah I think he causes a lot of cuts man I think I break a lot of hands too yeah it's gonna definitely break a lot of hands um it depends if you like having vaginas on your forehead you know that's kind of what the look you're going for the look there it's also like a way where you you see guys who really should be done then you get a couple more fights in there yeah and they're paying pretty well from what I understand is it what's good I mean like for some of the guys that were there like I said they're trying to supplement the income they were making before but if they can take half and still be and still make money for fights that don't go as long or the lumbars doing it yeah I mean if gonzaga did it right against bigfoot and you know skies yeah me and lead-ins doing it to call meyers and what no Dakota Cochrane rather Dakota Meyer sorry Dakota UFC vet Thiago Alves inks new contract with bare-knuckle fire yeah I just I don't I think it's good but I here's the thing is it the guys they don't know the rules the rules are you can grab the head clinch and dirty box you can punch the body they just they're taking Emma Mayen kicker and you're taking MMA guys though and making them in they don't they're not they're not shaping their style around the bare-knuckle rules that they have yeah you can clinch and grab the head and control and uppercut you know and and those kind of things and if they did that I think it'd be more of a real likes bare-knuckle kind of gypsy style box well Dan Henderson is gonna do it oh god yeah dan Henderson sign up for it really I was just with Dan in in Hawaii for the belt or show there and I didn't say anything about it we were also at karaoke of three in the morning so how many different bare-knuckle organizations are there there's at least two right I think there's two yeah see if you find the Dan Henderson fight that they've if he's definitely going through with that but I'm pretty sure they were getting him maybe maybe they're trying to get him to fight Lombard but they have Lombard they have him Gonzaga I don't know if he's gonna keep doing it Chris Leben who else something night right and then they fight again Jason Knights face was falling off his last fight to the same thing what they look like honestly when I see pitch when they're gonna all look like if you pull up a picture of hockey players before they were masked that's what they're gonna look like yeah and it's not it's not attractive it's not attractive and I'm just thinking to myself no teeth like you know sure you got mouthpieces but are you wearing a are you wearing a dual a top and bottom mouthpiece and like it just depends man no I don't for me once I realized that wasn't gonna be the best and I couldn't win a title you just gotta go I for me I just had to go on now I'm not knocking the people that they want to keep doing it because I want to make money if you want to do it to make money just you know do it I'm out in like this is your this is your gig man this is your opportunity to make as much money as you possibly can I just for me I just knew I felt like my whole career I was one of the best guys in my division and I just wanted I didn't if I couldn't be the best and I didn't want to do it anymore yeah well and that makes sense I mean I appreciate your intelligence and your recognizing you know the landscape some guys they just want to keep going and also it's hard when you don't have paid it's you've managed to figure out a way to keep income coming in through a bunch of different venue yeah some guys don't figure that out and when they get stuck and then they have to make a desperate ploy majore well if you have a family you have to think about what's after you know and you got to find ways to you know and you also got to have someone that sits there with you tastes carrot like you know is willing to like be with you through it all not just through you when you were making all the money you know and that's that's another thing I think a lot of a lot of fighters attach themselves to the wrong spouse you know and oh yeah and going you know are they late they want to live that lifestyle at the time whether it's beach parties our pool parties in Vegas or whatever it is but when that's done or when that's when that when you're not the selfie King anymore with all the fans at the pool parties what happens when you're actually calling to try and make reservations to get a table versus them calling you and saying hey we have a table here for you at the pool things change man and like you have to remember that and so when that change is what are you gonna do after that right and it's not gonna always be glamorous you just kind of yeah I think he's gotta come to reality that life there's is there's a ton of life after fighting and if this is the one the all sports yeah your only let's just say you play no not all of us are fucking Tom Brady plates here for 55 you know but it's nuts but you have you have a whole nother life after if you let see you live to be 80 yes you have a whole new life like do they like it's just the fucking beginning I was listening to Gary Vee what's a no check yeah and for everyone this said even for moments for myself I was like man at 40 years old what are you gonna do like really get yourself into like yeah I'm gonna become a cop on firefighters it's like but it's just a fucking beginning like you you just just the beginning I mean I've got really good at fighting in a couple years you can be really good at something else in one or two years yes you know and doesn't just fucking make a ton of money yeah it's almost like the organisation should maybe have some sort of seminars for fighters to try to give them some sort of advice or give them some framework and think about about how to pursue your life after fighting yeah I I've talked to jail about this a couple times I said man with Brendan nah you know it would chill you guys those two guys I felt like people can say what they want about Brendan in jail but what they've done is they've done things to benefit themselves in a very positive light yeah and I love and I love being around people like that because even in just a casual conversation you you can learn a lot from them you know and I have had this college even with Big John like when he left being a ref to become an ALICE and and it's just like all the excuse me all the stories that I've heard from him you know arm you know while doing our show it's just it's so much knowledge that he has from the sport period from the way it was started the way he got brought into it to the fights and he's called and how it all went down and and and I know those two probably two sides to every story but it's like at least there's you get to hear certain parts of what happened throughout the sport and I love I love hearing I love absorbing all that you know and it's it's great to to be to be surrounded by people like that yeah I just it would be nice if there was like a clear path that fighters could take me and then again it is nice at Bellator and the UFC are using fighters for analyst roles and things yeah but yeah fighters have to approach it like there's this a whole new world that you're entering into approach it the same way you approach fighting throw your everything into it if you want to be successful it's funny you say that because I've worked with a lot of people doing the analyst stuff and guys are gonna show up sometimes me like yeah I know what I'm doing yeah and yeah and it's like you gotta you got to be a student of the game you really do you know I that's what DC really excels yep DC's awesome at that you know he took Dominick Cruz you know Dominick Cruz is awesome at that they excel you have to so like with DC you brought up DC what Dee has is he has a guy that does research for him on the back side and Bellator does that they have a guy for us as well and he gets us all this stuff for the prelim fighters but you got to read it all yeah yeah you got to know who these guys are you've got to talk about them you got to be educating when you you talk to them you gotta remember you're trying to make it about them not about you that's one to is you're trying to make them the most dynamic them the best fighter that's ever stopped in the cage even though they're on the prelims of the prelims doesn't matter that guy is the future champion you know so you you have to find ways to highlight all the things that they do well and make them out to be like the they are the best and they potentially could be the best just not found yet when did you start doing your podcast so I did it started doing about three years ago but I didn't start with John till about six months ago oh you did it up just by yourself yeah so I had me and there was another guy his name was Sammy the two of us had did one called Sammy in the punk and I was doing that with him and then um I started doing one with John and then Sammy and I kind of Sammy was basically doing some stuff with his wife and family and stuff so we just kind of decided to part ways and I started working sort of filming more with John and when you guys first started did you always do it you said you're doing it through FaceTime right so with John yeah so I FaceTime John in and we talked through FaceTime and then we had a pull-up you film it through yes yep that's crazy yeah so much so much better than have you seen how they do it Jamie is so much better than Skype we did one with Edward Snowden we did it through Google Hangouts huh and there's a weird delay like they talk and then there's just weird delay and no you don't want to talk over them so it's awkward like person to person is the best yeah you're right there you see each other but face times fucking pretty close no it was there's no delay we John just calls in and then we record it through um I believe we have like a an app or a sling it's cutting it's called slingshot or something he was halfway across the world - that's true allegedly we don't even know correct he might have been next door we don't know where is Ryan your bathroom yeah so we just faced time a min and then uh my producer Colin podcast Dave so he does um he basically just like he screenshots it and just saves it and then John also does on his son he sends in the video and then we record the audio and then John records audio somebody just sink he sinks up the audio to match is that's cool so we do both so there is no delay oh that's an excellent that's excellent it's nice to have a producer I gotta tell you I tried I tried doing like the first ten shows no producer the the visuals of the Snowden podcast had no delay well why are you recording it there was yeah yeah yeah yeah shout out to Jamie I was gonna say I was telling him before you walked in I said hey don't be surprised if I turn to you just because I want to be one of those other like some of the other guests that just turn and go hey Jamie pull this up it's a fun thing to say yeah he goes he goes yeah but you know what there's moments to do it though they just never do it at the right time it's like dude I did a legion of skanks podcast and me and Tony Hinchcliffe and the Legion of skanks guys and Jamie wasn't there and like there's some shit I was trying to look up I was like hey find out that's true I'm like fuck where's Jamie and then those guys like how do you google it just wasn't the same it's not it I swear I've tried a couple when podcast Dave wasn't there and Big John and I were trying to film I was trying to set everything up and like we're all these cords going was good but I just and then so i FaceTime him and he's like walking me through how to set it all up and and then the fucking audio didn't record and we film for two hours I just told I told Dale I was like hey I was like I'm not fucking ever filming again without you like when you said you had to do the play-by-play yes you were like yeah I guess you told me you're like I'm never doing this fucking thing again you guys are yeah that's a would the way you guys have it set up it's very nice I like it a lot yeah he's in net he's right outside of Nashville or Knoxville I believe um so he's over there he moved out there now he moved out of Vegas and lives over there he's in Tennessee yeah he's in Tennessee went from Simi Valley he was telling me how much he loves Vegas no he loves it there he lives right on a fucking lake man but what made him moved to tennis his wife it's live I mean they found a beautiful ranch I want to say his daughter I think is out there now or live so and she was in the military and she's out there but he's a man I mean he's been an amazing man he's he's an amazing great guy I mean you want to talk about pioneer he was there from the fucking jump so that's the thing when him and I is so funny because my last fight was getting patrique II and I got drop of the head but John was reffing mm-hmm and um he wasn't in the right he wasn't the right position to see it so then I got hit right after that got locked out so he I basically went to but California's have led Commission and was trying to argue it was no contest that you know they said it was a punch and it was a headbutt that anyways so I'm just grilling John and in the in the process of you know fighting this do they have John on speakerphone and I'm like I'm telling John did you see it John do this Donnelly he's like texting me Josh I'm on your side man but I stop yelling at me right now in front of everybody and I was giving it to him then he we both started working for Bellator and I gotta tell you man we hit it off we hit it off and it's just one of those things we would find ourselves you know at the bar having a drink after or before the show or after the show or during the week of the fight and it was like you know 8 o'clock 9 o'clock and the next you know it's 2:00 in the morning it's just the two of us everyone else is gone and we're just talking about fights man just talking about guys we'd like to see fight guys that did fight and how the fight went and and just everything talked about the beginning of UFC talking about how he roughed certain fights in Japan and just everything and just like it's nice I enjoy being around people that that have sort of like a walking book of knowledge so it's basically organic you guys were just doing this all the time anybody like fuck man we should record this yeah let's do it and then you know he used to have a podcast and so his podcast had like 100 or 150 thousand subscribers and I guess he had like a something he said something on it one day and I guess Dana told him hey you gotta get rid of the podcast or we can't use you really and so he just he said fuck he fought it a little bit and then they got back on him and he just had it he deleted it done I'm like ooh get rid of the podcast fuck yeah I was like man and that was yeah so that's gotta that's got that stopped well that's another argument to go to Bellator right yeah I mean we've been doing it now so I was at about eight seven thousand one when I started doing it with him six months ago and now we're pushing 16,000 subscribers not a lot but kind of surprised Coby Covington doesn't have a podcast right yeah how the fuck does he not but if it's your stick do you want to live that stick on air didn't all asleep iike manju Dice Clay mmm you know or maybe he gets even more popular yeah I mean look he's fucking good at it man Kobe's goddamn good at it let's be real him first no I do not know fucking nice guy is he smart shit nice guy works like a demon he's I mean you don't have that kind of fucking cardio if you're lazy I watched I watched his one with Tommy Lauren cuz Tommy Lauren actually reached out to me she was not joining me but on the show this week and then this whole thing with the impeachment thing she's like I can't meet Candace Owens no I had not met her you know but it was Tommy Lauren he did a podcast with I thought he did a podcast with Candice Owens ah no he didn't tell me Lauren oh yeah I did one with Tommy Lauren was talking about when he talks about his whole persona how he created this persona and everything no they were she was asking time Lauren I was asking about um was it Tampa was it Tommy Lauren I think you do more than one podcast no I don't know was a pot he was like I'm a show like a TV yeah I think she did like a 30 minute hour-long whatever with him but she was mainly asking about Trump like what do you like about I'm gonna support about him what he this buddy that it wasn't a whole lot of a persona talk going on do those people who love Trump they love when someone else loves and right now I mean if he do is to start a podcast this would be the time for him to do it I mean that's kind of his shtick right now you know no you know who else could have a podcast Maz Vidale you know he's got to get the gold medallion just fucking lay back you know to see if I was the man who made the fucking calls I know they want to do him versus kabhi versus Connor but could be Maz Vidal versus Connor the hospital versus Connor would be fucking giant when when they had all the fighters and they put a camera on him at the event when they put that camera on Maz with all the pop from the audience was fucking bonkers yeah he got the biggest pop of the night I don't doubt it I don't doubt it all he's a superstar right now what people don't realize when he fought when he fought KJ Noons in in Strikeforce it was like a coming-out party for him he made KJ look like he had no idea what the fuck he was doing on the feet I mean you look at the after pictures of KJ Noons his face was he looked like the Elephant Man and he fucked the mom fucked him up and just that moment on he just progressed it got better sure he had some ups and downs but he never turns down fights I should have never fought Demian Maia like that's not like if you're a stand-up guy with wrestling takedown defense he probably shouldn't have fought him he should be like not only you know you don't to fight that guy you know and he didn't he fought the guy good fight you know he just didn't get the win and but then he just fucking terror man just know Terry he's he's always been good always the way cut I think killed him a little bit when he was trying to get down to 55 Diaz a big guy yeah him and Connor is the fight to make if I'm at home I haven't seen enough of Connor to show that he belongs in a cage with khabib yet but him and caught him in Moscow doll if he starches or beets Mazel all you can't you can't that be the next fight would be could be even the real question if he start yeah if he wants to make it to 55 again it's you know some guys especially when they get into their 30s they just do better when they're not cutting as much weight and Connor's of thick dude you know he's probably walking around a buck 85 or something like that and for him to get down to 70s not that hard for him to get down to 55 is a long laborious process yet Davis said that he only walks around 170 really yeah he said he said by the time II you know by the time he fights tonight I was watching some of the presser so he's like he's like he probably won 67 I'm 95 and I stand next to Conor he does not look 170 yeah he looks thick yeah he looks thick I think he he looked he looked like he cut to make 172 when he was when he got on a scale he was wearing you know a bunch of different layers you know it was shit yeah whose standard shit wouldn't someone's cutting it wasn't like a guy just shows up remember when Eve used to weigh in and bring a fucking cheeseburger yeah yeah yeah Eve didn't really cut now you know there's a lot of guys like Frankie Edgar perfect example yeah when he was a 55-pound champ he didn't cut shit now he was eating yeah you know when Frank Shamrock fought Tito Ortiz he weighed him with quarters in his pocket yeah you know I was like I guess the the Commission said like you ask to be within ten pounds so Frank had to put quarters in this pocket so he could fight Tito otherwise the Commission was gonna allow it and that's fun so that was hilarious no but there's a lot there's been a lot of guys that you know that just don't feel the need to cut weight you know he's got his huh when they go up you know a lot of times guys just have better performances yeah khabib 'he's had some serious problems making 55 yeah he has III honestly believe I don't think he will I would like to see the fight to me these are my dream fights is I would like to see Patricio and Volkov Volcom ASCII or Patricio and max I would love to see that I see that fighter I would love to see GSP and khabib woo not to me is the fight the biggest fight I think that that blows everything away that's a huge fight you know Maz with all and Conner a huge fight ya know I like these are fights that I like you know Lima against P and Conor GSP and Conor as well that where's the thing that fight would have should have been made before he lost it could be I'm surprised they didn't do that yeah I'm so surprised you know here's the other thing though is it it kinda I think is hindering and I think you brought me up on listen before because I had heard through a lot of people in the UFC that they were talking in negotiating trying to think about ways to bring in 165 yes and you have too many tweeners and what's this why do we have a 15 pound gap for the 55 with all the talent that is there preach let's do it right let's do it man let's do 55 65 75 move those guys are 75 some of those guys like us c'mon could use a little bit of that yeah you know it's so big you know and then you'll have guys like I don't know how big Colby is but kobito maybe 65 or Colby 275 he'd do 75 you know he's a big guy limas normos do norm enormous what does he walk around that gotta be 202 to maybe 205 yeah he's a fine fellow he's a big guy and no fat none no no no I saw a picture he's in he's in somewhere in Island right now but he just looks shredded right now I'm like he's not even fight camp what is next for him I think they're waiting to see what's gonna go on um their idea from what I understand they're not gonna do the MVP rematch right away MVPs gonna have to fight someone of Signet offs and nichkhun yeah he got some shit for his last opponent right yeah but look you have to his last two opponents the guy that he fought in Japan it was a last-minute replacement because Benson Henderson got hurt so when Ben got taken off the card against Chandler Japan was like look we need somebody else to step up you know we need another talented guy on there because now you're supplementing him with somebody else Benson we need another big-name so they brought in MVP and fought you know um one of the Japanese guys and that he stepped up on short notice to take that fight I tip my hat to him and he still made him look bad knock to finish the mouth yeah the other fight that a couple fights before that look these guys are asking for but stylist and and AH stylistically but um his fight in Italy that guy Lily know was London that that guy that guy was a last-minute replacement also and that guy was thirteen and one right so but he's just so awkward his Styles so difficult to deal with you know hands down low and that karate blitz style did you ever see when he fought Raymond Daniels in point fighting no I did not I saw him fight alfie davis that was a good fight too but that there's something to that point fighting style yeah that really can apply to MMA if they learn all the other stuff because that ability to blitz to jump in and jump out and not get hit and there's a lot of those guys that are fuckin masters at that that's my next dream fight I see those guys fight MMA yeah like you have Raymond Daniels and you have a VP I mean I don't know if Raymond Daniels is even interested in them an MMA I don't know if he does any he's fighting this weekend Raymond LA he's fighting there you see fought mm-hm I'm gonna call on you right now help my calling you right now buddy he was on against p.m. for one of the best knockouts last year in history in MMA yeah I did a 920 spin came back through with a punch and dropped the guy called if I even know if that was MMA that was him I called the fighting was in Birmingham that 9:20 spinning punch block yeah that was kick box no that was in he dropped him with a side kick the guy got up he jumped spin spun like I don't know some astronomical mile times when I see him fight my stupid brain immediately goes kickboxing yeah how many MMA fights is yet I want to see he's got two he's got yeah he's got two this will be his third so like Joe shilling has decided to abandon the kick box aspect and move see that the only thing that bothers me with that is areas one one and oh yes yeah January 25th 2005 in Inglewood next week yeah he's on the dollar card with cyborg that's not even next week that's this Saturday Oh beautiful and who's he fighting Jason King okay that's cool so but oldest Raymond now I wanna say he's 42 40 huh though 39 I left down he's just decided to at this point get into MMA live and on the feet good fucking luck good luck even getting close to that guy you got a weird stuff as always sorry it's my phone going off that was you he's got a weird style you know that the point fighting style and then the successful transition from point fighting to kickboxing you know I mean he was a phenomenal kickboxer and then for go from kickboxing to MMA it's very interesting yeah I think when guys I feel like they've they've hit the top at whatever they're doing and there's no there's nowhere else to go let's go wherever we can to make as much money as we can he's always had a relationship with Scott Coker that's the other thing a lot of what you see from the guys like Gegard came back to Coker cyborgs coming back to Coker I went back you know there's a lot of guys that had fought another in Strikeforce when they were relatively new there was a lot of talk that you know if Kane ever left that he was gonna potentially go back to he was gonna go to Coker as well you know I was able to leave yeah because he'd had his first fight in strike was in Strikeforce and he had a relationship with them but when Kane says his back's all fucked up and I'm sure it is but then you see him do the Lucha Libre jumps out scissors this guy's head and does fucking flips like hey how are you doing which is super impressive for a guy who's 245 250 right I sort of god I'd never thought I could see him I've never thought I'd see him jump that high well he was impressive love that shit because if he can do those moves that means he's been working on this he's one of those guys that his athleticism is just overlooked all the time because of the way he looks his physical bodies like favorites yeah exactly but you got you have to admit fader is probably one of the most athletic heavyweights I've seen and the same thing with Kane people don't underestimate them because of their body style yeah it's funny it's like show muscles versus go muscles it's but with Kane like his fucking endurance was terrifying his endurance for a heavyweight just didn't even make sense I don't know if there's some truth behind this but they were talking about how guys that are normally barrel-chested their lungs ooh your lungs what they normally have a lot more cardio and it seemed to be like most of the guys that I had seen like they have extremely good cardio look at Keith charting and same thing remember him and then um you know Kane and I just I've seen guys with big barrel chest that have good think about Giotto sandals dos Santos yeah look at him he's got really good cardio for someone who that pays him and came Fatih that's insane and anyway it's insane if Kane didn't have that type of pace I mean it would have been it could've been a different fight it would have been a different fight but Cain's pace just was superhuman it didn't make sense he and but it's also like those guys that have that kind of pace or never one shot knockout artist you know you notice that like those guys they could put that pay this it's like that's one of the more interesting things about the sport there's all these trade-offs it's like you want to have that super one-shot knockout power well then you're not gonna be able to do it very often you know you blow your gas out it's like having a big v8 engine you stomp on the gas it drains that tank it's true yeah like you see it though with with uh like explosive guys right like Connor sure does it seemed like in the five round fights he struggles a little bit like in that fourth and fifth round it's not the same pace he had him once too and sometimes in two three in the third round he comes out hot yeah I mean maybe that will all go away if he stays at 170 yeah and you're fighting guys that are 205 you're fighting guys like yeah I mean like he's extremely taxed really good but I mean like and I've I've kind of on the on the Brent in ways that like to me I'm a con or not rider man I think I like what he's done in the sport um I just I don't see him beating khabib and I've had this conversation with Brennan a lot as like ever I don't see him ever like ever and I'm nice Brendan think well here's Brandon used to give me this whole spiel cuz I was on I was on his show below the belt as well and we had this conversation right before the fight happened and he goes on he's like oh if he fights the way he fought against Alec quinta and this and I'm like it's completely different you're trying to shoot for could be to shoot on Alec winter who's like five seven you know it's a different game than Shannon somebody who's really wrestler yeah and a good wrestler yeah he's got some pop in his hands yeah you know and he knows and he knew what the fight that he knew that could be was going to try to take him down Kabir's me and people gotta remember during that week Kabhi went through five or six opponents remember which would be pedestals be somebody else will be like it went through all these people that's all the way myself where they pulled him off the wake up that's right yeah me knows literally last minute and so when all of that happens you're up the same fighter you were when you showed up in Vegas or wherever the fight was supposed to be thinking you're gonna fight this person and so I get I cut him a little slack in that fight and then fighting someone like I like wit to who's a fucking Savage that guy like he's so good people and never never never gets the credit he deserved absolutely savage and and just a gamer and so when you have to shoot on someone I don't know how tall he is at five seven five eight you know but it's a lot harder to get low on someone like that and get the takedown on him so when I was telling Brennan like he's if he stands with them he's gonna get knocked out well who did the dropping in that fight you know it was could be if everybody did the dropping because when you make someone fear your takedown that much your natural reaction is to drop your hands real quick to try to get the under hooks he threw that right hand like a fastball - yeah a whip and so what he and that's in all the years I've trained with him he's just learned like what he does he drops in dips his head and comes back over with the overhand left or the overhand right and it finds its mark he sees it before he throws it and he most guys will just throw blindly he dips his head comes back up and he sees his shot and then he throws it it's different and majority of the time it lands and I've been on the other end of that shit'll quite a bit can't vlog his daddy but listen brother we just did three hours can you believe that walk in the park cuz I just fucking flew by fucking dollar tell people how to get ahold of your podcast with Big John it's called weighing in it's called weighing in yeah and we're on pot we're on YouTube Spotify
