he was on something I don't know what happened like I was sitting down so he's just a passenger yeah and I was I didn't know if he's a sky marshal but he ordered a Dewar's in the beginning and he just slammed it neaten so I'm like this guy's not a scar my sky marshal this guy's boozing it up so he just goes to me he's like just sitting there and he just says I he goes hey you are you afraid to fly oh and I'm like what he goes are you afraid to flag oh no I'm not afraid to fly he goes he's you sure cuz you know it's okay you can tell me if you are immediately I'm not gonna this guy what you mean

fitting and looking around I was like nah man I go I'm cool he's like I was you like to fly I'm like when I'm up here cuz you know I bump myself up going on back there I don't like it and then he goes he's alright you know but you know you can tell me if you're afraid to fly so now I'm just like dude I'm not afraid to fly so and he's staring at me and I put my hand like this to show that it wasn't shaking I go I'm not nervous alright thanks for asking and then he goes well anybody can do that and I'm just like out Jesus Christ and I just said look dude I'm drinking water you're drinking Dewar's okay because that wasn't doers right I'm just like I fucked this guy so I'm sitting there you saw him ordering huh you saw him order doers I was sooner he said let me get a doors and she brought it over neat and he threw it back like he was drinking baby milk right what's impressive this guy's old-school starting off good right so then there's like five minutes of silence more passengers are getting on and then the guy goes hey you know I'm sorry man I just just got off on the wrong foot there right he goes my name is so-and-so what's your name that's me like what my name is and I was thinking of saying something like Steve you know now or some SIL I wish Lenny Clark I wish I said some silly name you know but I didn't think of when I just went it's bill and he goes how go he goes out why wait going to Indianapolis bill he started doing this shit and I just look at the guy and I go I'm like yeah I don't have to answer your questions whoa I don't he has no fucking authority you're not a sky marshal you're drinking booze you're an asshole what do you want are you afraid to fly go fuck yourself leave me alone right so then he goes like right now now I am concerned okay I am concerned okay why are you going to Indianapolis bill right he says this right and they close the doors and that they're doing all this stuff and I just I just start like I joked on my podcast I just started smirking like Ryan Gosling you know he does that little mono Lisa smile you just got a smile and I'm just sitting there shaking my head the guy right and I'm literally taking out my eye pillow I wear like a mask just to say I'm so not worried about anything that you're gonna fucking dude all this passive-aggressive shit this to piss this guy off and he's got why you going to Indianapolis bill and I just just kept I didn't say anything to him I just kept laughs and just kept shaking my head and was taxiing down and he goes dude because because I fucking do this for a fucking living such fffff and all this stuff the lady in front turns around starts looking at what taxing down the thing because you don't answer my questions right now I'm gonna hit that call button I will hit that call button I will stop this plane and you will be fucking arrested like saying all this stuff and I'm just looking at him smiling shaking my head like go ahead and push it dude let's see where the fuck this goes hilarious what happens does the pilot come out right there's a police car pull up to the plane over fucking clue so he goes to push it he can't find it it was kind of a weird place and he finally finds it he hit the button I'm like holy fuck II at the button this is hilarious and I'm just sitting there he goes now you wait you fucking wait bla bla I'm just sitting there smiling shaking my head at him like dude I don't care I don't get you you're not you have no fucking authority you're not gonna hit me you're not gonna do anything you're on fucking something right but I'm not getting that dude if that guy had a vibe like he was gonna punch me I would've been up in the in the ass but he didn't he just had like that like a kid throwing a temper tantrum he wanted like this you must seem like he wanted to be an Army Ranger but he didn't quite make it or what he was like what'd he look like he was like a wiry dudes in good shape you know why are we dude why him like that dude who shot that Trayvon Martin kid who wasn't really a cop yeah but he wanted to be a cop so he took it to the next level when it's a sacred night I could squash the whole thing and just been like look I'm a comedian going to Indianapolis if you'd like to come out to the show I could have done that but I'm a dick and I hate I hate fucking I hate authority and this guy doesn't have any so fuck him so I just laughed now he pushes the button so then the stewardess comes over and she goes yeah what's the problem he goes this guy is a flight risk I am not comfortable flying with him but bah bah bah bah bah and I was surprised how few people were looking around people just kind of sitting there and this guy was wigging out and I'm just sitting there and then that the stewardess was like I did anybody else see any behavior and the lady was sitting in front of him pointed at him and said yeah he was berating any point and she pointed me he was berating him and I'm just like perfect so I'm literally putting my fucking eye mash down as I'm talking to her just going hey I'm just a guy trying to go in Indianapolis this guy he's drinking Dewar's and he's dropping the f-bomb then I'm thinking fuck I said bomb you know I consider problems it wasn't a problem and this guy's just doing this thing where he wants to win he wants some sort of recognition of what whatever the fuck he thinks he is the plane still moving no at this point it fucking stopped it pulled over I forgot that part it pulled over and stopped dude it's a fucking red-eye okay it stops another stewardess comes over he goes what's the problem and he goes through the whole fucking thing and then it's like basically the captain at this point is going do I really have to come back there it's like really the red-eye fucking flight my last flight of the day is to fly combat missions you know fucking boring this is to fly this fucking bus I don't deal with this bullshit do I really have to come back there and then they finally asked him they said hey are you gonna be comfortable flying with this guy and he I think they acknowledged that he had some sort of something there so because you know what know yet it's okay it's gonna be okay but whatever right they had some sort of something they like some sort of power that like they checked with him like you're gonna stand down sir like whatever fucking spy he thought he was so now we get back in line and we're taxing and as we're going down the runway I got my eye thing on and I'm just sitting there and he's yapping in my ear you think this is fucking over you think this is fucking over on this point I'm laughing I'm holding my stomach and I'm fucking laughing and it's driving him nuts and I'm having a fucking ball with this guy and he goes you know my dad's the CEO is some fucking cum in Indianapolis and he starts saying that he's gonna have me fuckin arrested when I land and he starts describing the view I was gonna see from the jail like some law Order episode oh you're gonna get a picture this yeah do you take a photo no oh how could you not should have been filming video this whole entire time well yeah that would be amazing you cuz I can't you can't you just be in the moment and not turn into a film crew just know because that story's even better the universe gave me this fucking moment right I'm telling the story I don't I don't you know so he fucking uh so then I got my thanks down then he finally he's going yeah he oh you love the view from the jail you can see Lucas Oil Field and blah blah blah and all this shit and then he Monica soil yeah that's what a Colts play tell me like this this view dude it was such such hacky interrogation then he finally said uh he goes you know what I'm glad I'm glad you know what I fucking hope you do something I fucking hope you do something were up there and I'm fucking Birds there was nothing that you do and I'm sitting there with a blindfold on laughing at him it was driving him fucking nuts it was great so then five minutes of silence ten minutes of silence goes by and I'm finally thinking that maybe this shit's over or is he just sitting there staring at the side of my head and then all of a sudden I just hear right as I'm starting to nod off I just hear why are you going to Indianapolis bill I just laugh so do my adrenaline was fuckin going I was just like wow they're gonna stop the plane this is fucking intense man it's crazy what's going to happen and I'm totally innocent so I got to kind of watch it happen so then I couldn't sleep so I was sitting there with that stupid mask off like a half an hour and then files just like I fucking I got to take it off and I got a deal with this guy and I take it off and I look over he's just he's just passed out head hang in this fucking you know special ops guy you know you should lately passed out you should fucking waylay him with a huge haymaker right in the face and then immediately pretend you're asleep no now cuz someone would someone would have seen that so I sleep now you know what I did was I immediately started pounding waters because I didn't have to go to the bathroom and I wanted to get up on the plane just to see if he was going to fucking wig out again makes him sort of see you've made yourself go to the bathroom I started slamming water so he would have water again now I have to go to full of fucking bathroom like you can't believe in this fucking guy's passed out he's now I held it for the last hour he didn't wake up until we landed and then we we pulled up to the terminal and I got out and I stood up and he wouldn't look at me and I'm thinking I probably slept it off and I was feeling fucking weird hopefully and the lady in front of me got up and she just goes she smiled and she said hey and I just said and I go that was that was an interesting one and then he had the pillow like this Joe he had it behind here in some weird position in some sort of like alpha-male way he tried to get some sort of tough thing the last word he took the pillow out and he threw it down behind but between his legs and he like grunted he went like like he threw a pillow down that was it that was my trip to Indianapolis oh and then I worked at a theater and Elmo was there
