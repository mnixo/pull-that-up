yeah to one Kevin Lee what's up man what smiling always happy yeah yeah you know guy give you some thanks for even for doing it before the fight happened I had kind of already had in my mind I'm like okay it's been a year since we last kind of did this and it was right after the barbozza fight and I was like okay imma imma get through the fight and then imma do this the result wasn't exactly what I wanted you know I mean and it made me hesitant about doing it but I was like this is the story you know and this is as I said kind of like was upset at myself for a few days eventually I just kind of got over and I'm like you know what I said I was gonna do it before I'm not about to be no sorry-ass loser and yeah well like I said I love you whether you win and lose I'm just you know it's it's a giant part of the game yeah half the game is losing yeah someone has to win someone has to lose if you watch a fight someone's losing yeah it's a draw and I figured it's it's all about how you approach it you know how you take it into the next fight and really when you look at it I mean it sucks it really does and I hate it like any like it's something that boils up inside of me like I go over I replayed a fight a million times in my head and actually hate losing and I hate that feeling but it's just the reality and it's like it's just real life and it just realized nothing you can do it there's nothing to do once it's over the only thing you can do is learn and grow exactly and the guy you fought as a stud and he thought fought ha fail dos Anjos he's a fucking legitimate world champion fighter yeah when when I was approached with the fight and kind of start really diving into it and really looking and I'm like I always like a really big challenge and that one was definitely one you know he had already had a lot of fights that went 5 rounds he had fought he's fought pretty much everybody you know tomorrow huisman was his last fight kobe covington efo could be he had already fought like a lot of top top guys and for five rounds so and I know what type of challenge it was it's just I hope myself at a high esteem so I was like you know I'm I'm just ready to do it you know I mean you yeah that the fight itself was was good but either way I'm a learn from it and grow from an in I still got a whole long long road ahead of me so you do have a long road ahead of you but you know as we were talking about that long road could sneak up on you real quick and before you know it you know you're 37 years old trying to figure out if you still want to fight yeah that's that's how it happens to guys I've seen it happen to guys yes I I feel like if you approach a smart you know what I mean you can still get done which is what I'm trying to do right I kind of already knew that I needed to make some changes and do some things different even before this fight and before my last one too but you know I just like okay I'm gonna just get through this one and then I'll do it and now I'm gonna get through this one then I'll do it but you know that's kind of a big wake-up call to just like alright it's time to get outside of the comfort zone and kind of do something different and and kind of do what I already know I got to do what did you think was gonna happen in the fight and what was surprising I didn't think they would be able to keep the the pace for sure but what surprised me was how smart he was and how he beat me tactically more than anything is you know when I was going he wasn't doing you know any kind of he controlled the pace better than I thought he was going through you know I thought once I set that pace that he was gonna be right there with me but then as it got going I started to realize oh he's not really expending much energy he's kind of just letting me burn out my energy and in in then he took his moment when when I made the last mistake and really went to boil down to it I lost one position at the end there where I went for a takedown and you know nine times out of ten when I go and Club back the guy hits his knees but he just stayed on his feet I stepped out and when I hit my knees it's like lost that position and against a guy like that so dangerous a black belt and is a is so good I knew one slip-up was gonna be all the need and I think he knew that too and he was just kind of waiting buying his time and hoping that I slip up it seemed like you expended a lot of energy early on and it seemed like by the time he got the submission you were fairly tired yeah I mean follow she always used to tell me this and it was always uh there's tired and can and tired and can't you know it's a fight it's you're gonna be tired right uh but I'd still do think I had my legs underneath me and still could it's just I could have played it better tactically I could have had had you know more time when I wasn't just going going is like you said especially in that first round if I would had a little bit better experience maybe or something I you know I don't know I'll figure that out but I could have played it a little smarter like he did are you do you have a person that's giving you strategy or are you sort of making your strategy up on the fly that's one of the things that that's kind of the main thing that I'm Robert faultless was that guy for me yeah until he passed and and then I kind of just picked up the ball and you know I understand fighting but yeah it's mostly me doing the strategy and right now that that's where I'm in the limbo of trying to find somebody who already has that experience and has already been there and done it to tell me a little bit of strategy yeah I think it's so critical man I really do and we had this conversation over the phone about it I think that a young fighter with a lot of potential like yourself there's a reason why fighters of trainers there's a reason why fighters have head coaches history it's not because they want to give up all their money yeah it's because it helps and you you can delegate those that that thought process to a master someone who's a master of martial arts who understands position to understand strategies seen guys tired seen guys good seen you in the gym seen you grind understands your skillset understands how you are when you come in perfect understands how you are when you come in tired you know so that that is just giant and having someone who understands you psychologically as well and and also having someone that you respect and that you want to impress all those things are huge yes it's it's a big one especially like you said being able to talk to you too and in being able to understand you I think that's what Rob did really well yes and any kind of so good he kind of like reeled me in a little bit like I'm the type I'm just kind of go go go and I can't think higher to myself then maybe even I am but that's just hi you so that's how you have confidence yeah so but he was the type to kind of reel me in and he used to even tell me like hey you don't gotta get hit so much or you know I'll stand in front of a guy and just like especially when I was younger he was a little even worse and you know cuz that's just hobby filling right but you know he was the kind of the type to to reel me in more than anything it's not like he would tell me one specific techniques or or it was even about his style or anything like that it was just a way that he was able to to kind of get through to me and kind of make me understand what it is that I'm trying to do yeah and you guys you guys hatch is a good relationship to he was such a good guy man such a good dude I mean just just losing him I mean it was devastating for the whole mixed martial arts world but losing him for you had to be a real just a giant change in your career yeah it's a witch fight what did he die before he died right after the Tony fight which is a whole another piece of it you know I know he had a whole lot of things going on early in his life especially you know with his family and when we went to his his memorial and people were kind of explaining you know what it's like growing up in a he grew up Jehovah Witness so he's like you explaining what it's like to grow up like that and you know to try and get away from that and having your family disown you and how like that can I understand I understand the importance of family so I can get that but then even I'm like man you know they would tell us he we were more so keeping him alive longer than anything so I'm like man if I would have won that fight with Tony is like fuck what he should would he still be here you know I mean those are the type of like like did I do it to myself almost but I already know I'm already at the point where I kind of got over it a little bit and I kind of understand that I'm not gonna be able to replace them by any means but I am gonna have to get that person who can still speak to me in that same light you know the only way that I'm gonna make it right is to win that title and do it for him you know he ki kind of saw that from me and he was kind of the one to give me that confidence to say because he's already coached multiple UFC champions so when he told me that that he could see me being a champ that really like I was like oh okay like I didn't really like I kind of got it a little bit but I didn't really know it until like he gave me that kind of confidence right um so the only thing that's gonna make it right is to go out there and win that title and that's that's if I got it no matter what I got to do I'm not stopping till I do it are you 100% committed to 170 now yeah I think so I think it's I think it's I think it's right uh-huh look are you about 190 now right yeah just about I'm about 185 186 which is normally what I would be about getting ready for a 55-pound fight too and so when I stepped into the cage I was lighter going into this fight to know was for some of my my 55 pound fights really yeah I walked in about 181 um and like for the 25 I was 184 so you know that Tony fight was a mess because of the staff right like yes you guys have a decision where you had to make whether you know you're gonna pull out of the fight yeah I mean I tried my best to keep it from everybody so and I kind of succeeded in it I mean really the only what something over it at the weigh-ins right yeah put a make up I had that suzy the girl she she did it for me but you know that really just made the the weight cut and my body much worse I mean I don't really look at the fighting it and say that Tony's a dog and I kind of give that to him you know I kind of I learned a lot about myself from from that fight even and then fights after that I've had a lot of tough weight cuts going into him so I don't really uh I really put too much that first round no man before you got tired you had a mounted that was a it was a big first round for you yeah yeah but that was one of the fights where I if I would have listened to Rob in that fight I would already be the champion and then everything would look different you know I would already fought McGregor by now and then the whole sport would it look different I think but I didn't listen to him and I ain't what did he tell you that you didn't listen to he tried to tell me to calm down like when you see me like walk out for that fight right I was on I wouldn't even like go until I was on twelve I was on twelve from the morning that I woke up until you know the until the fight ended and that adrenalin pumping that I mean I I never felt like that since I probably don't I don't really want to feel like that either I was when I stepped into the arena that night you know we get there about two hours before the fight actually is going on I was ready to fight and when I was warming up I was ready to fight I was fighting people in the back there was no warm-up there was no warm-up I was who I was fighting no how how much did that staff fuck with you I think it put me into a state of fight-or-flight because you were compromised four days before you know not even just that that you know the day of the fight me in that state for four days before where it made the weight cut so horrible like because my body is just trying to hold on to everything and trying to you know when I woke up that morning I was about 162 I woke up at 5 a.m. Wayne's or at 9 a.m. I have to be 155 so I've got 7 pounds to cut which is ok you know it's not too bad cut about 9 pounds of the day before I'm a little dehydrated you know I'm a little already worn but as the weight cut was going you know we got till about 8 o'clock and I had only cut a pound and a half so I still 161 and a half something at 8 o'clock weigh-ins are at 9 o'clock to the point where we got to do something so they start to put me in the bathtub just because we do most of our cuts in the bath you know when you when you're in a high humidity you you're gonna cut more water weight or you're gonna sweat more and water is obviously 100 percent humidity so they start throwing boiling hot water because we couldn't get the water hot enough to make me sweat more is Christ so we just taking kettles of hot water and just pouring it on me and you know doctors are in and now there's twin 12 people in and out of the the the hotel room to make sure I'm okay and make sure that I could cut the weight and I was just as such a like an adrenaline fucking like on 10 I'm like just get out you know I'm screaming at everybody I literally I was in the tub I was crying like my but to me I was like there's no way I'm not making this weight and six pounds in about an hour maybe two hours cuz I weighed in about nine o'clock or so or I mean uh about 9:30 10:00 or so the six pounds in two hours this it was brutal but I think that just kept me as such a such a 10 on my adrenaline I never really understood how to bring it back down you know and Rob would try and talk to me and try and tell me like hey calm down like you know take a few deep breaths like yeah yeah I'm breather whatever I'm when I wasn't listening to it so mmm now when did you know you had staff the Sunday the Sunday of the fire yeah she's on the other so you had a whole week thing about her almost yeah I mean I think about it like that as yeah we just noticed I noticed like a little oh uh just a bump in ink and it got like really big and I thought a spider head bit me or something um and you know it first first Sunday I just kind of you know I didn't think about it I wasn't trained in that day so it was nothing when I went in on Monday Dooley was actually the one doing Cooper my my striking coach he was the one that kind of noticed it and he was like hey is that all right and you know and then Rob when he took a look at it he was like oh yeah that's best staff for sure and you know I just kind of what do you do when that happens if you can't if you don't you decided not to take antibiotics yeah yeah so what do you do I roughed it I was like roughed it you didn't put anything topical on it or was here it was there a scratch that got infected or cut I honestly have no idea when it just when I woke up on Sunday it just was sticking out of my chest till about but right here and it I thought it was a spider bite or something you know I had never really had staff like that before I knew guys who had it especially through college wrestling those rooms are just so dirty and filthy that I've seen other people with it but it didn't look like that you know I mean you normally look like a yeah you know you have open wound or something and then that'll get yellow and pussy and disgusting but this was underneath my skin so it was not like an open wound or anything right um when I talked to doctors they said it was just on the the layer muscle I guess or something it's kind of sticking out from it um at the time I didn't really know what that meant like he said it was deaf and I was like okay you know like I still feel good like I can still move around like we hit pads that day I still felt good you know I can I was like I'm showing up the fight you know I anything on it or there's no so for six days you just trained and did everything with that staff it that was kind of like the last thing on my mind even know I was there to fight when I when I when I signed the contract I I'm showing up to the fight like I haven't pulled out of a fight yet right when I say I'm gonna do something I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and do it regardless if my leg was halfway falling off it's like I still got another one you know I still got five more toes on the other leg so right but looking back on it now are you happy that you made the decision that you made oh yeah was it smart but you know you would have done it again tomorrow yeah no doubt no doubt I mean first world title fight you know do you do anything to prevent staff to use like defense soap or anything like yeah ever since you actually hooked me up with with those guys a defense oh thank God you did that yeah they've been great so great I got the guy yeah yeah Socko they're also so now I just take way more preventive wins yeah yeah I haven't had anything flare up on me since I take probiotics here and there here and there a good way to prevent that as well it also helps prevent ringworm I try my best to eat as many natural foods and especially like a lot of yogurts and Kieffer's one of them cool so you know I try and stay on top of it and at least I not no flare-up has been happiness since you know I shower every time make sure like I'm on top of that make sure I bring my soap in a shower because you don't want that again it's mostly the the you know yeah the fight didn't go my way or whatever but it was about three or four weeks after that fight where I was just random I was wrecked oh she's no worse shape ever and when they when I got on those antibiotics I just fucking kills people leaves done kills people it was terrible people that ignore staff I want to scream at them like listen man you could die this it seems like you just got an infection but that shit get systemic it gets in your bloodstream and you could fucking die one of my friend Brian Collins friend's wife died and he went over the house and she was like you know some people get crazy with holistic stuff oh she's just gonna try natural healing and he's like get her to a fucking doctor he's like her gums were bleeding she says yeah I did it gotten systemic and she wound up dying geez oh man from stuff I've had it twice and the first time I had it I could when I got on the antibiotics first of all the antibiotics yeah the fact that Luke Rockhold won the fucking title against Chris Weidman while he was on antibiotic shows you what a stud that guy yes yeah cuz that shit kicks your ass he had he had staff when he fought Weidman yeah he was wrecked no bodies mess you up bad I've done him once for like a sore throat or something uh earlier a couple years ago and it just wrecked me bad so I knew like going in to have finals like I'd rather have the staff than the antibiotics before I've had antibodies I know what they gonna do to me so I was thinking that when you fought and afterwards talking about it I think you probably made the right move to not do antibiotics but I don't know I'm not a doctor but I was thinking that that it just weakens you so much you know it's just you you live and learn from these things I think you know and it's just part of the journey and before I would have liked that where I wanted everything to be perfect or I wanted everything to kind of be the way I saw it you know especially like starting out the career like everybody wants to be Floyd and when you do you know and it's just you know you're not getting touched and it's just easy but then when you take a look back at that and you don't see like how many amateur fights Floyd had you know he's got his dad who fought he's got his uncles and his whole family been fight you know so he's learned from all their mistakes and all their losses and everything to where it's like I'm the first one of my family to even ever think about this so you gonna bump your head here and there and it's a comparison is the thief of joy yes you can't you can't do that you got to just think about being the best all right by people but comparing yourself to their path and everybody's got a different path everyone's got different genetics right some people are just better at certain things some people are some people struggle with certain aspects of the sport I mean that's it's everyone's got their own individual challenge and it's one of the things that's so interesting about it it's watching people adapt and grow yeah and so you're in that stage right now right you're still young you're still top contender he's still one of the best fighters in the division you just have to kind of figure out what you're gonna do and how you're gonna do it mm-hm so what are you thinking right now so I'm leaving straight from here I'll go to Phoenix for about a week and work with a John John crouch great yeah love that guy yeah he's great I'm standing even seeing like the way his coaches started I've never worked with him before but we have a mutual kind of respect I fought a couple of his guys before and so he's definitely some masters he's one of the guys I want to pick his brain and I kind of want to go to a couple different places and just see how they are you know I'm going from there to Colorado and work with Trevor Whitman excellent um and then go right to Montreal and work with what's up that's what's up I like three though they're all three amazing great minds yes um as I go to each place I'm gonna kind of see what I like and what I don't like about each one you know and see how they see how everything is there you know the life and you know yeah what training partners in all these other things because that's just as important too so absolutely yeah I think also a shock to the system is important like moving going to a new camp going to a new environment because you want you want to shine yeah and also and you realize like men everything's on the line here like you've literally uprooted your life move to some new place and it makes you be more dedicated it makes you realize you can't just fuck off here like this is this is the real world your real world-class fighter and your you're on your path to attempt to become a world champion and this is the best way to do it I think it's so critical for fighters to make decisions and make changes and make moves when they know that they they have a missing piece of the puzzle in other the map they're missing a master coach or they're missing a you know a great wrestling coach or a great striking cook whatever whatever the fuck it is a great environment with world-class fighters whatever it is have you talked to Jacksons have you talked to those guys I haven't but you know I know a Brandon Gibson down there and I've been wanting to work with him for a long time yeah I I might you know I don't I don't know this is this this little trip is gonna take up six weeks at a time and then I figure when I get back to Vegas and kind of regroup and be able to make some decisions from there on on what's gonna happen I haven't done something like this until I since I moved to Vegas in the first place where I just kind of packed up my car and just start driving west and you know was sleeping out on my corner before that I was still in Detroit oh right from Detroit right to Vegas yeah yeah I was still in college when I got the show you know that was like the time where I'm like I don't know which way my life is gonna go you know I thought I had got done with the fight with al Iaquinta my debut and after that I was like I got to make some changes I just didn't know what hmm and that was just as scary a time as now you know even though now like I ain't sleeping on my car you know I mean I and I eat whatever I can't I get you some nice I can go to restaurants and you know but it still kind of feels the same you know it's still that same it's scary you know I know like because I don't necessarily know what its gonna look like but I never let that stop me either so what about American Top Team you thought about that all I have I mean I know a lot of guys that moved down to Florida you know the problem Florida's it's too nice yeah yeah like so many crazy freaks down there but you know people people say the same thing about Vegas to know you know when I moved to Vegas I think Dana had did an interview or something maybe like a month after I moved there and he was saying how hard it is for a fighter to make it from Vegas and even at the time I was like you know it's really nothing to me like I don't really I trying to stay focused you know I mean I got to keep a bigger bigger picture in my head I don't really let this shit get to me too much so if I do move down to Florida I don't think i'ma just be on the beach kind of setback I see some guys do it you know I've seen guys move down there and just get caught up in that lifestyle of sitting back it's just it seems to me that Vegas if you stay away from the strip you'd be alright yeah but Miami's the whole strip yeah it's everything it's all of Miami and that's the attitude down there everybody just party's mad yeah yeah it's everybody else - it's a big influence you know well Harris from the what is this a production inside with a fighter's life is that what it is anatomy anatomy of a fighter he was just tell me about he just went down there and he was thinking about moving there until he spent like four days there like a fuck out of here I can't live here this is crazy people are crazy he said you should need a passport I'm like that's what I'm saying it's like a different world it's a different country they're up it's a party country down there yeah I've only been once to Miami I've got a cousin a litter and I mean I went out with the intention of partying but I was like I mean obviously look good owner tomorrow whose mom lives there you can be a champion out of there Robbie Lawler's from there you can be a champion out there it's one of the best gyms in the world but it's in terms of distractions there's the hard part for for places like that is I'm missing that mind do you know what I mean they got a lot of great fighters down there and they got a lot of a feel like the training and in in the atmosphere and you know the training partners and everything could be great but I'm missing that that that great mind and you know you know Mike Brown I've met Mike if you come in and there's a guy there's a speck but we haven't really like yeah the conversation with him have a conversation with him - I mean if you want to really decide what clicks with you better I'm a big fan of Mike Brown and obviously Ricardo laborious fantastic jiu-jitsu coach and you know and I'm just a whole fan of the whole organization you know when the way they put it together you know yeah I mean it could be uh it may be something that I might look at you know it may be towards the end of the summer something that kind of already this trip set and planned so I'm just like I'm about to pull the trigger on it and see where they take me beautiful I'm very glad that you're doing that they you've making changes and and and trying to see you know where the right spot is for you yeah I mean immediately after the fight is like when it when it doesn't go your way or the way that you you necessarily see it is it's discouraging it's all hell you know you're like fuck I don't know if I'm doing the right thing I don't know if I'm seeing right you know before the fight in the locker room and this doesn't happen very often but I just I felt like I was seeing certain things and and and I don't necessarily I'm not a religious guy like that or anything and I don't really like believing I don't necessarily know what but when certain things started to click for me like when you're on your way to work and you just like you're hitting every green light and then like you know somebody comes up to you they're gonna say something you know what they gonna say and then you got the the time for the perfect answer it was kind of like that type of feeling that I was having so I just felt like everything was like coming together right and my confidence was like boosting up so much before going you know I think the warm-up was perfect the weight cut was pretty you know it really wasn't a weight cut it is everything was perfect going into the fight so then when it didn't go my way that's like it was discouraging a little bit you know I mean I was like fuck I didn't know what I necessarily was doing wrong or or if I was on the right path you know but which leads you to think that you need a coach yeah I need somebody smarter than me everybody smarter than you that's not you like they could see you in a way that you can't see your friends are always smarter than you yeah hey man you gotta stop doing that really yeah man you fucking up like really oh shit that's life man that's life I mean it's so important to have people around you that understand you and know you yeah it's if you don't have and then also someone that you really trust and appreciate as a coach so gigantic man yeah I think and especially for fighting because fighting is such a personal thing to me you know it's not like that's why I never really worked with any of the guys at the UFC P I like they've got everything there and they've got you know in even the coaches are great you know but it's like I need that I need to be able to trust you with my life like that's really what it is yes like no one's died inside the Octagon yet but not gonna work it not gonna well yeah this is a nice table that means I'll shit we've had a lot of crazy fights you know so when I get up get ready to do it I go into it with that expectation you know if you're the one you don't care how many people have it right right I doing it you know you're it's hundred percent for you the chances yeah so I need to be able to trust every I need to trust you with my life almost you know and uh you know it's it's hard to find that though the reason why I recommended for us a hobby is first of all he's one of the smartest guys I've ever talked to for us is it fucking genius legitimate genius knows everything about MMA I mean there's not a stone unturned and he coached GSP and I feel like your style and GSP style are very similar and that you both are very good wrestlers and you're both very good at mixing up the wrestling and the striking where you don't see anything you don't know what's coming and you're both you don't both don't have any weaknesses you have an awesome submission game GSP has an awesome submission game you have great wrestling great striking it's very similar and I think that his experience and coaching one of the greatest of all time in Georges st. Pierre would would lend would just slide right into coaching someone like you I really believe that yeah I think for rock as I'm getting closer to it you know I'll know more when I when I get there but that's the last stop yes opponent is the best stop and kind of the longest of it - yeah I had already thought that if I was a young man and I was thinking about fighting I think I'd moved to Montreal yeah I think he's got a special mind mm-hmm I do you know and I and it's not to take away from any of the brilliant coaches I mean I think you could be a world champion with Duke Rufus who's also brilliant guy and an amazing coach I mean there's no bad stop for you but there's just something about you and for us a hobby that I just feel like yeah when I met him uh and I said next time we had dinner together as soon as I sat down next to him he told me everything I did wrong in a Tony fight like right out the gate I was like bingo right yeah I mean he's but he's genius sharp he's smart yeah so yeah I mean but then again Whitman I've worked with Whitman too and Whitman is really experienced dude you know he's coached so many people he's seen so many different styles and done it himself a lot too so you know I love about Whitman when just engage he flatlines people Whitman acts like nothing even happened yeah it's like he knew it was gonna happen it's crazy like everybody's jumping and cheering at Whitman like yep I think it's cuz he's seen so many he may have been on the the other side of that to where you know it's your guy getting knocked out - so sure you know it's like you said it's two people going in there somebody's got to lose so he's been around the game long enough to where he understands the other side of it - that's you know you ain't gonna go crazy and yeah you know yeah because that guy's got a family that guy's got people that he's trying to take care of he's got every other motivation that you got to you know yeah yeah really yeah um I think the also the culture shock and moving to Montreal would be good for it - yeah I mean maybe uh I've been I spent some time it's cold as fuck oh my god I've been my January it's like outside you get that thick fog coming out of your mouth that's why I'm going to do ya know in June but look good for you man I think it's good for you I feel like that that cold might it might be something to that you know the best wrestlers and everything are always from the Midwest and from that cold and you know why they developed character yeah I think it is some today you know a hundred percent there's not the soft ass people out here in town by all my friends from Boston they come out of California people are fuckin soft out here yeah you know if the shovel snow and have to worry about freezing to death you know if your car breaks down in Boston you ten miles from your house you might freeze to death yeah that's real that's real you better keep a blanket in that bitch yeah yeah you have tough and sleeping bag on a candle you know and I think it gives you like different different morals and different like yes different character to you you know you you you you value things a little bit differently so in that cold you know Detroit does the same way that's like seven months out the year you spend in that time indoors and in noodles like your family and everything because yes you ain't gonna be inside with some fucking of Schmo from down the street you don't wanna you know right to count on each other to when it gets fucking cold yeah because everybody's in this together yeah it early literally yeah it's fucking cold we go okay it's also like a a vulnerability to nature that just forces you to accept your place in the universe like you are you are vulnerable you're very vulnerable in California your wife could kick you out you're like fuck you boo child sleep on the lawn you can go sleep on the lawn you have to worry about nothing you know you'd be fine January you could sleep on the lawn with a good jacket on in California it is gorgeous too you could just getting a car just drive down to the beach and yeah exactly yeah to me I think is paradise but but then you talk to people who they've spent their whole life here and they don't see it that way so many people from Brazil I mean how badass are people from Brazil and that's fucking paradise - yeah but in ruff-ruff paradise it's a little different down in Brazil you know I think a lot crime yeah I get them Brazilians a lot of respect they they you know some of them they really uh they come about and nothing you know and literally out of nothing you know and to build that respect around a community and stuff I give it to him I do as well and you know you got to give it up to them for creating Brazilian Jujitsu I mean they they essentially revolutionize jiu-jitsu yeah I mean the the the Gracie family is the most important family in the history of martial arts and what they did with Brazil and Brazilian jiu-jitsu and how Brazilian jiu-jitsu evolved in that country you know just they took to it like a duck to water man yeah I wonder what it is about a Brazil that that was like the one place to test it you know I think if they if that count my ADA had gone anywhere else if he had landed in and talk to some other dude somewhere I think they got lucky they found a Leo Gracie and Carlos Gracie and they found some dudes who were just straight-up warriors and they taught those guys and those guys were I mean a Leo Gracie just really him and Carlos just thought it through and then we're willing to test it in real competition against people much larger than them the fact that Elio was a small man he wasn't a large framed man is the reason why Brazilian jiu-jitsu became so effective because Elio had to fight off of his back he had a tire out bigger guys first they had to develop the the concept of cooking your opponent you know all that wasn't in Japanese jiu-jitsu yeah it wasn't in judo judo is a beautiful elegant martial arts with fantastic technique and powerful moves but it wasn't Brazilian jiu-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu is largely a part of this one dynamic incredible family if you look at that family all the fucking champions hoist hor Ian Hickson yeah you know I mean come on man crazy and now Krone yeah I mean Jesus Christ what a fucking family man hen's oh yeah yeah I'm high in I mean just just Gracie after Gracie junetta you saw Gracie like oh no killers just straight killers yeah I mean the game has changed a little bit assistance but don't forget Carlson Gracie - the game has changed a little bit since then but but it has been because of mi sure it's it evolved in that area and sprung out and of course you know obviously there's you know Muay Thai from Thailand Dutch kickboxing American wrestling there's so many different factors Russian wrestling so many different factors that come into what we now call mixed martial arts today but man I just keep thinking that if it wasn't for that one family who the fuck knows because the part of what made the ultimate fighters so spectacular or the Ultimate Fighting Championship rather in the first two ones was heisst gracie being this guy who's not this physically terrifying guy like it was Mark Coleman if Mark calls me butterfly muscle 260 five muscles up his neck straight up to the top of his head his neck would just like come off of his shoulders here he was huge if he won you'd be like yeah that make sense yeah when hoist one everybody was like shit I gotta learn jujitsu yeah look that guy choke that do that with his legs yeah like I remember people at home we're going what the fuck is this that's what makes fighting so great cuz you never know what's gonna what's gonna happen in in real fight you know true true I mean even in boxing - you know you see some some crazy shit like Anthony Joshua just yeah but you know you but I think in MMA it's it's it's even more just because there's so many different options and I have an opponent from a good source that Anthony Joshua got dropped in sparring the week of the fight Wow and he got hurt real bad the week of the fight and that he was very tentative coming into that fight and very vulnerable wouldn't make sense you could kind of see it on a little bit you know with first round when you when you even walking out you know you can kind of see his his look and and it's a little glazing it's a little uh out of it you know I figured that it was just coming over to America for the first time and you know being in in in New York and it's a lot of that's a lot of pressure and a lot of you know especially when you talk about Deontay Wilder like knocking the dude into it's like the next century like the week before did you see that video that I posted on Instagram from that duty doesn't animation no no how oh my god there's two amazing ones pull up first of all pull up the Deontay Wilder one because he has the the fucking glove from the Avengers and he hits this dude great rod rig rod did yeah yeah yeah yeah yes credible yeah he's crazy that guy's animation his graphics are amazing but he did one for Deonte and then he did an even more hilarious one for Andy Ruiz yeah oh my god I didn't see that anyway I did see the one with the arte oh you saw I did see it they're yours okay so what up pull up the Ruiz one then yes so you can see when he when he drops Joshua watch this shit it's hilarious man the guy's so good give him some volume - can we do that or was it the soundtrack - you think we'll get in trouble for that yeah no volume all right no volume just play the video watch this so you see even the way when you're looking at Joshua after the Faculty of this and then it his body his body is still there but his spirit roller bag go through the airport his spirit has got Tweety birds floating around his head why Anthony Josh was still on the ground his spirit gets into a plane and flies away he did that the next day the day after the fight that was out people are getting crazy what they can do yeah it makes you jealous a little bit like I know right you know wish I even had that kind of create a process yeah I think it through a let alone like go through with it you know I know he crazy that guy's a master though his ability to do is the Deontay Wilder one they hold yeah I mean that is crazy and then when Deonte moves away with the eyes glowing he has the craziest power i've ever seen in the heavyweight division yeah he's so weird it's so weird his power you know when he fought Tyson Fury way 209 yeah really 209 Wow crazy Wow yeah he wasn't trying to be light either he just that's just what he wound up weighing you know I think he's one of those guys I could find your chin like certain guys like have a weird kind of you know he's kind of gangly anyway but he can they punchers are coming from ha yeah those he's got the power and everything too but it's more than power it's like yeah he's fine any a chin in there and he's got chin finding intellij yeah yeah that hold secret missile you know the fact that he dropped Tyson Fury like that in the 12th round of a fight where he was kind of getting out boxer than dropping him once but the way he hit him in that 12th round I was like god damn he knocked him out in the 12th round I look at that and I'm like to not get discouraged you know what I mean like that's some serious belief in in the type of power that you got after 12 rounds you ain't landed the shot right and you can still kind of stir it up and in the 12th it's as a fighter I kind of look it down like like that's a lot of you got to get it to him like get it off to him it's like he's got crazy endurance too that's the other thing he must have a phenomenal work ethic because he's never tired and he carries that power deep into the 12th round a lot of times guys that hit real hard like that after you get past six seven rounds they start to fade especially in the heavyweight division but Deonte moves just as fast hits just as hard in the 12th as he does in the first it might be something to keep it keeping his weight to like that like you say he's only 209 pounds who's heavier this fight for the Dominic Brasil fight apparently he was it was quite a bit heavier how much have you anything he was 230 or something that's a lot of weight yeah super d-wade would what Deontay Wilder weighed in for Dominic Brazil I think I think that I was kind of shocked that he was somewhere in the two dirties which is like a normal heavy way to 2223 oh okay still a little bit of weight but I see someone's 218 remember when he was in the prime I wasn't even to 220 yeah so I mean I think it's uh it's definitely something today you know maybe uh that's just what their natural weight is you know at rights as I'm getting a little bit more deeper into the game it might be some test wanna think I'm gonna stay at 170 mm even from now I think you've you show up healthier and it's it's just if you got that experience if you've already been fighting a lot of heavyweights like he has it's not like a 265 pound dude is gonna shock them you know what I mean or a 240 or well it's also because there's no wrestling yeah yeah yeah that's it's a big factor in it um yeah I think it's a giant factor yeah but then again look at Cain Velasquez when Cain was at his prime he was about 240 and you know when he fought Brock Lesnar and Brock Lesnar was quite a bit bigger than him but it didn't matter I mean Cain fought a lot of guys who are bigger than them yeah the wrestling is is probably the biggest reason I think a lot of us cut weight in MMA for sure I mean that's that's where that's where you can feel the most weight to you know whenever I was going against uh the santoses it's like I didn't necessarily feel he was any stronger than me or any stronger than any fifty five pounder that I have fought before but when it went in I kind of have impressed or whatever and I could kind of feel the the the the weight of that you know all my back and and just carrying it um and it makes you expend more energy to you know I think like one it's like fighting with a 15-pound vest on yeah exactly yeah wait when the fight was over he that's the first thing he said that means like yeah I knew coming up to 170 just being a first fight that he was gonna get tired do me no good he's got something phenomenal cardio though and also he was coming off the othman fighting awesome on out worked him yeah so he was probably like extra geared up and it was mods bigger than me too you know and so he had already felt that yeah and he's fought for the title that one seven he's got a lot of fights at 170 already so he's already felt that that weight has also gone through Nickerson's strength and conditioning routines you know he was I don't know if he's still working with Nick curse on but Nick curse on was a Marvin of each disciple and just fun they do a lot of crazy box jumps and plyometrics ever seen him on Instagram don't go to speed of sport on Instagram I know he did a lot of work with Aaron Pico before Pico went to calivita he was doing work with him he's done a lot of work with a lot of pro fighters did I think he worked with Joe Schilling he's worked with a lot of guys but wild strength and conditioning shit a lot of plyos a lot of box jumps and a lot of crazy shit where you you know that that a calf raise bar and they they'll do that but with your feet like kick it up and down and up and down like you see I would see what you got there Jamie this is just some of the shit that he has people do is this dos Anjos yeah so he was was I wonder if he was training with him for this fight but it's a lot of this type of shit and it's a lot of explosive plyometric shit and his idea is that when you're in a fight see this thing like they're doing a lot of stuff with that thing and they'll do it laying on their back with their feet as well but it's all this just explosive bouncing stuff and I mean his philosophy he doesn't ever have those guys lift weights like traditional lifting weights it's all like plyos box jumps exploding jumping over hurdles that kind of shit intense intense stuff but is that's the stuff that got BJ Penn into the best shape of his life when PJ Penn fought Sean Sherk when PJ Penn fought Diego Sanchez when he was at the top of the food chain BJ was work with Marinovich s and he was doing all this crazy cardio workout which was like the missing link in BJ's Arsenal because before BJ's this incredibly talented guy but then he just didn't have the same kind of work ethic and cardio and he just gave himself to Marinovich and there's like I had do tell me what to do and mostly what they were doing was strength and conditioning and they were saying basically BJ already knows how to fight and the real key was to get his gas tank is fucking thick and fat as possible just give him this giant ass gas tank and give him this capacity to work that's just unprecedented to him and then everything else he already knows how to do yeah so everything else just do it light but don't compromise on the strength and conditioning workouts because that's the most important aspect of this board and it's a very it's a very controversial discussion well what's most important yeah I think you need balance with it all you know so - but I used the Cal Vedas methods for this one and came down and see him a couple times in in Orange County what stuff did he have you do that dudes a fucking he's a man animals yeah his workouts are brutal his ideas are more he takes you to exhaustion and then we do stuff like that like the explosive stuff in a different types of movements and you know it kind of making sure that your legs are still underneath you but he puts you on a bike and hit that bike workout this it's like a 30-minute three minutes like keeping a hard hard pace on on like a very very high level and you know he's got you strapped up with all these monitors and everything to kind of make sure that you actually hit in your redline and then the workout starts so it's about like a three hour workout and it's raining it's brutal it's like three hours yes yes it's a you you see some things going through workout like that you know I mean like you go to a like a dark dark play in it I went through a couple of them getting ready for that fight when faced with here in Pico yes yeah that's his garage though as where we do the workout nummy it's brutal he took a lot of shit after TJ tested positive for EPO what shit I can see why the good there's someone I was like shit you know like uh you know each his own and all that but you know I don't put that on Sam it's like you know I can't yeah I mean teachers a grown man he's gonna do what he's gonna do I don't even know if he know yeah yeah and speaking with him and everything he had no idea is just as blindsided which is you know kind of that's unfortunate for him too because everybody was really paying attention to how how scientifically it was designing and engineering these workouts yeah and people were really excited about it so there was a you know a bit of a back step for him as well yeah he uh he's a smart smart dude you know I think he's a math teacher over it at Cal State or something like that yep I mean genius of a deal you said and talked to him and like he's gonna tell you exactly why he's running you through these these certain things so you know we picked up on his philosophies going into this one and I you know even though I was tired during the fight it's it's a fight you're gonna be tired I still have my legs underneath me and still could go you know so hey I don't know I think I think was more tactically than anything if I'm going back on it but you know you think it's more in the way you approach the pacing and way he approached like as far as like the strategy of how to face dos Anjos yeah what did you think was gonna happen when you went into the fight I was gonna break up just cuz I wanted to fight like you know I think the fight before that with uh with Al I hated the way that fight went I hated the way I showed up for it and I and I left way too much reserved and the worst feeling for me like I don't really hate losing I really do but I don't really get hung up on the results that much I hate not performing and not your potential so if you feel like you perform to your potential and someone does better then you're like okay there's a lesson yeah I can learn from that and grow from it but when it's a fight and I get done with it win loser or whatever and I still got a little bit in me and I still like you know you walk back to the doctor and I'm still ready to fight and I still feel that enemy I hate that feeling more anything so I wanted to make sure that I didn't get this one from this one you know in and I haven't really had a fight in the UFC yet that is hit kind of where I want it to be you know like I haven't given people have watched me grow up in the sport I feel like but ain't really seen like a good fight out of me yet so that's kind of what I was looking for and what I was after is just dos Santos was smart about it in in in world champion so but you know yeah I mean he's been around the block man his money and he's in a precarious situation himself right because he get dominated by the champ in his last fight and you know I mean what do you do from there I mean he beats you and but where is he it's not like people are clamoring for him to fight for the title again the good thing is at 170 is so many good fights to be a like even for me as so many you know I got asked her and you got yeah Maz with all that he's getting ready to fight you gotta lose men you got kymaro you got Pettis and Diaz is back and you know so many good fights I mean there's gonna be a great fight form I'm pretty sure I mean I don't know what yeah no I'm pretty sure as well I mean it's goddamn both divisions between 55 and 70 or stacked you were pushing for a 65 yeah yeah I think it's a great idea I still am kinda - they just don't want to listen yeah nobody I think change 70 to 75 change 65 55 45 35 it's makes sense ten pounds makes sense but these arbitrary what I think there should be a 95 - how about that that one I can see a little bit just because of how shallow 205 was getting but now you got so many great fighters at 205 even and you're starting to see that body type that that's coming through you know the Johnnie Walker know that the kid that just fought the last last weekend and knocked out Manuel yeah how do you say at home you know kid he just knocked out Jimmy Manawa but he's kind of got that similar frame - as John jonesing in you know you starting to see more of those guys so how do you say his name yeah man oh we're retired just show it to me I'll spell it Alexander Rockets sure raikage right all right guys yeah wreckage I think it's rocket yeah yeah he's a fucking beast man that step in left high kick was beautiful brutal but now they're getting so many guys that they might be able to build a 95-pound at one point but they could do 65 right right here now and it would be you know one of the best yeah yeah that's almost like there's too many guys at 55 and 70 yeah and I think that and then also like look at the women's flyweight division the women's for the women's women's flyweight division now of course with shift chenko is gonna fight Jessica this weekend but if you go back to the women's strawweight division strawweight division when Yoanna was champion everyone's like well there's no one there who's gonna fight her and now it's stacked it's stacked you got Tatiana Suarez yeah Jessica and ROG you just just beat it beat thug rose you know you've got you know you so many fighters it's like it's a world-class division it seemed like he got better too when they added 125 yes I mean it got it got even more because now you see in like the people who wouldn't get Shawn before now they're getting shot he's like oh like y'all got some serious talent and I know and I and I felt like at 55 you got so many guys that's underneath top 25 that could could shine through you know if you just give them the the space it it also allows for for guys to like max Holloway to go up at 55 and be able to compete mm-hmm and his I feel like that's more of his natural weight too you know is is a lot big for the way he lost to Dustin Poirier a lot of people saying you know he just doesn't have the same power at 55 that he had at 45 I just don't think he had the experience yet you know I don't like 55 yeah he that was his first fight at 55 so you know and Dustin's already had a lot of them where even if they had both fought at 45 before Dustin's already been there so he it was it's not gonna be a shock to him you know any kind of guy just give credit to dust and how fucking good is that - yeah a lot of people forgot yeah yeah the way he was rolling with punches is just barely slipping him his power yeah once he's moved up to 55 I mean he was torturing himself to get to 45 he's a great example of a success story of a guy who stopped cutting much weight but he's big now he's having a hard time making 55 yeah he's growing into the weight class which max will do the same you know max is a big dude like so I think if you if you let him compete against guys that are more his sausage eventually the next time that they fought I think it would look a little bit different and what do you think could be versus Dustin looks like because that's what they're setting up that's the next fight in Abu Dhabi I don't know I I really don't know I'd like to say right yeah before the max fight I would have for sure been like a beam she's gonna blow him out the water he's just gonna take him down she's gonna be too big but I just really wasn't trying to take him down the way could be well it's a difference it's a different fighter yeah but but the way does his footwork was looking and then that's what makes you think about it because you know Kabir's kind of a one track one train ma you know he's gonna come right at you you know he's gonna do - yeah but what if Dustin not even necessarily can can out wrestle him it's just it's way easier to play defense on wrestling than offense and if you've got great footwork like that - to keep a your back off the fence might be a long night if we could be who knows the fight it's a good fight so find Dustin's got that serious power yeah it's a good Dustin can hurt you yeah zag yep you know southpaw I think that's gonna play a big factor in it you know it's a little harder to get in on a lot of those shots um the real key is can he stop the takedown and can he defend himself on the ground because with so many guys could be gets a hold of them and then they developed that thousand-yard stare whether like what in the fuck is happening you know it's like when I mean especially I'm sure you remember early in your career when you would go with a guy who's just way bigger than you're way stronger than you and you just go oh I can't do shit yeah yeah yeah I can't do shit thing I'm just sort of surviving here yeah I mean I still try and put myself in a situation not roll with Robert Drysdale or something like I'm lucky just to I'm just counting how many times I rode with Vinny Magalhaes and I'm like I'm just trying my best not to get submitted yeah I'm at the point where now he you only go submit me one or two times you know before it was like 10 like it was like as many times wanted to but you know like okay if I slowly pick at this and I was so shocked he didn't win that pfl thing I was so shocked I thought he was gonna win it for sure yeah yeah his striking has come so far you know it's one of us that you know it's the game yep it's the game the game yeah what can you do it's a fucking crazy sport it really is the craziest sport that's ever existed you never know even as an athlete like you you can do everything to prepare right and you feel like all the chips and like everything's in your corner and like I mean I guess it's like life it's like you think everything is just right but sometimes it's not yeah should have what can you do pick it up it yeah try it again like a madman well you just have to accept that this is what you've chosen you know and this is part of what comes with it it's just chaos I think you just got to be crazy I think you gotta be a little like out of your fucking mother but I mean I see other people in other professions and what they do and I'm like he's a little crazy too you know I mean you know out of his mind to do what he doing so maybe it's just what you just beat me you know you also at least you have the freedom to not be stuck in a fucking office yeah you have an exciting life as crazy and chaotic as it is lease is exciting I'll take exciting every day off over boring and it lets me be me you know what I mean like that walking out for a fighter or just it just even just getting ready for the like a week of and you know doing media and stuff like that and and just it lets me like really express myself so in a way that I never really got to as a kid or anything before that where that gives me like a little bit of peace and it gives me like I really don't give a fuck about nobody else or or what they doing or what they got going on and it lets me like just be me and just flow it in and just and just have fun before I would never really let myself do that you know I would kind of always be guarded and I would kind of always be like like on edge and just not just be myself and fighting has let me let me let it out you know and not because it's so crazy because it's a wild change because what you're doing is so dynamic that you could just be the full you yeah and I think everybody is is different too you know everybody fights different so so it's not one is better than the other you know it's not like it's like you just got to be if you be yourself then you're gonna do better you know what I mean even even in the media and stuff like that or however you want to approach is like if you be yourself I kind of figured it out like you just be me and just enjoy it right then it's then it's better yeah as opposed to like you know when you target you know microphone in front of you they're like when you uh you know you're stuck in an office or however it is or you stop doing something that you feel like you should do or people want you to do then you start like living like that almost and I kind of have felt myself get there before I started fighting it's like trying to live up to other people's expectations or you know and fighting that's just like you so the master of your own destiny yeah yeah in a lot of ways yeah and that's the best thing about it yeah fuck the wind fuck the laws of money is fun that's kind of what I did do it was fun but it is it's giving me a lot of else to my life you know I write so do you watch many fights outside of all though yeah everyday outside of MMA yeah yeah like jiu-jitsu or more time I watch all uh Jiu Jitsu in it when it's really getting going you know I was gonna try and come out here a day before and try SeaWorld's you know it depends but yeah I try yeah it's um it's interesting when you see how good people are at those individual disciplines you know that's uh it's one of the more interesting aspects about MMA is that you really can't be the best in the world at everything and you're gonna have because it's such a complex reward certainly can't but you right though I think a lot of a lot of these other sports and stuff they've had so many years just to figure out what works and what don't work they've really refined the the process you know enemy huh like you see some of these high high level boxers and it's like they've had you know you talk about somebody like Floyd he's had his dad fight and his uncle fight before him to where he's like refined the the process so much yeah it's damn near perfect you know I mean we haven't got to that point yet never man know it's gonna be a while knows not even cuz I don't know if we'll ever get there because it seems like it's because it's a combination of so many different disciplines it's you just it doesn't seem like you're ever gonna see the a guy who is world-class Muay Thai and world-class jujitsu and world-class wrestling all in one fighter it just doesn't seem like that's really possible I think you can get it in a couple more generations don't think so it may be like four more generations some like that like because this is it like I look at the kids now that are coming up and they don't have the same like preconceptions that that even I had coming up and you know like where when if you boxing your boxing this way and you know this is the right thing to do this is the wrong thing to do you know or you taken you've taken so many things and you're not really you're kind of stuck on it you know what I mean and I feel like each generation is getting a little bit better a little bit better I look at like some of the things that kids do now I'm like fuck like I want to like wish I could be that free and just kind of have that that creative process to do it you know it's gonna happen eventually I think yeah with little kids are starting off like a little amateur fights we were like 10 years old and shit yeah so then I think about his kid you know and what's it gonna look like and then okay then what's his kid gonna look like to where you will get somebody who is who is just perfect whatever they do that's a good point because it really is a big factor that Floyd had his dad who was a world-class fighter Sugar Ray Leonard and his uncle Roger was the black mamba Roger Mayweather was the fucking man back in the eighties you known to see those two guys training him that is gigantic grown up in that environment always been around boxing and they could tell them what to do and what not to do even when you get to that certain level you know it's like it's you don't know what you don't know until it's too late almost but you know he had people that he really respected like his I mean you your uncle in you and your pops they're gonna be the first people that you respect and you got it listen to him yeah so I think it played a huge factor that people don't really look at I think so too and it's also seeing their mistakes that other fighters have made when you're growing up in the gym you seen guys that's spar too hard or seeing guys that get hit too much or seeing guys to take the wrong fight so thin guys don't fight smart defensively you know one of the things that people forget is that Floyd went through a big transition of his own if you go back to the early parts of his career and you watch when he was pretty boy floyd yeah he was a much more aggressive fighter and he would put himself in danger much more and then when he became money Mayweather like as got later and later in his life he just got so much more brilliant defensively and then he became the guy that you see shutting out Canelo Alvarez stopping all these guys just just shutting everything down he just became this defensive wizard to the point where you'd see world-class fighters like Sugar Shane Mosley who did tag him but other than that didn't really know once he once he recovered he didn't really know what to do with Floyd boy just had the answers to his style he had figured him out yeah and I even see a lot of people because I go by his gym from time to time you know it's and I see like a lot of people that are coming up in boxing who just wanna right out the gate be what Floyd is now you know I mean be on the ropes and and be able to slip punches and you know and but they forget like the time when he beat the fuck out of our Toro Gotti you know today you know and was no defense to it he just came out was throwing hands like they forget all the like amateur fights that he had before that that he's won and loss and you know he just had a different style of fighting so it's it takes time to get to that that that level you know I mean certainly Toro gotta fight was brutal brutal yeah yeah he's a monster I give him a lot of respect I do you know I mean not a lot of people do but they're crazy the man's just being him well he talks a lot of shit but you got to separate that from what he does yeah I mean when you watch him fight the guy is defensively spectacular yeah he knows exactly when you watch the Canela fight I've watched eikenella fight at least three times and when you watch him stand in front of Canelo Canelo throws a left he's over right he's over here pop take that jab with you yeah oh and Canelo is like just with him yeah there's throwing punches you can see this - look in his face like god damn man I'm in here with a master yeah this is a master boxer and I'm learning a lesson here you know the good thing is you know he learned that lesson the right way and now look good yeah yeah Canelo's a monster dude any monster defensively you know you see some of his defense now and even me like I look at his head more like god damn you know he's against Danny Jacobs just a little while ago like his head movement is just on point that was a great fight because Danny Jacobs is a fucking killer yeah and I was pulling for Jacobs but I had to I had to give it to Canelo I'm like he really took what he learned from Floyd and yeah you know sometimes you need that you know that it's even like how you said me and Georgia are kind of similar mm-hmm I tried to pick a fight with the man like like I wanted to fight him just because going into I was like hey win lose or draw I'm gonna learn something from this month boy he gonna know he was in a fight um i'ma show up i'ma give him everything I got but I knew just for the future I'm like that would a fight like that is just gonna propel you it's just gonna get better you know you I think he's gonna want to find could be probably I think solidly that's what I think I think if Dustin Poirier if could be beats Dustin Poirier khabib is gonna lobby for a fight with George yeah that's what I think and they fight to make beats George I think he's gonna retire that's what I think I think khabib only has a few more fights left in them I don't think he I don't think he necessarily wants to fight for a long time I think you're right he's undefeated he smashes everybody yeah you know and I think he'll go down as one of the greatest it ever did it if he beats George if he beats George George George in there I mean if he could even get George in there I mean fuck knows how that if that could ever play out yeah I mean I want that date one of but we'll see how that whole thing it also for the USC it wouldn't be for a title which is a problem apparently with when they when they have a problem with like cell and pay-per-views one of the big problems is and this is why look everybody else why do they have any room tiles the reason why they have interim titles cuz people see that title and they fuckin they click that pay-per-view when they might not that's real it makes it's a big factor in any place into the you know your mindset as a fighter too yeah and so George would have to come back I mean someone would who was 60 or they go to 165 you know you know just say yeah latina said on the ready to do this is did that doesn't mean that much because Dan has also said that women would never fight in the UFC but Dana said on record there won't be a 165 while he's working there we hear oh I got here oh I don't like that thinking I hear oh no but you know I don't have more weight classes yeah get it you can make the khabib in George fight and it'd be nothing every time and and George wants that fight to you know even just to say hi I mean you cool motherfucker but George even more so I tried to pick a fight would of it like you know for real and he called me and we talked for like over an hour he's like he's like explain it to me is like listen I listen I cannot fight you right now gymnastic I can't do the the exit listen I can only do it if I talk to him recently if I haven't talked to him recently it goes away I forget it but he told me he is a great fighter but he wanted I am a better fighter than him I feel like there's risk of a war you know I mean sure I'm the type I just like taking a big risk you know more than anything but George is where you hope you are ten years from now George is 36 years old sure right is he 36 or 37 he said he's in that range was 36 37 years old you know he did it all yet at all yeah you know he's now he's in the position where he's just trying to get them oh yeah see he got much time ya know I feel and and even when he was explaining to me like I was like man I really can't hate you for this like you know you kept it like as straightest yes please like you know it's just too much wrist and you know it's like for what sorry it like I get it bro make your money look I go hey called you know hey you know I tried still and and I think he got it too he was like you know I get with he's a brilliant guy i when you this see and talk to him and you're just the way he breaks down life to what he's thinking about life he's thinking about it very smart very smart that's why when he won the time is like yeah I'm good I feel like you take it take that title I beat Michael Bisping and I'm gonna just ride off in the sunset here for a little bit and hold in a holding pattern I'm waiting for the next big one to come around the next big challenge I feel it I mean there's so much more to life to you know I mean that's so big like even for me like I'm done it's only one part of me you know I mean it's the best part I think personally I feel like but you know there's still so much more that I want to do and accomplish and it's done the biggest problem with fighters though is that fighting is so crazy and so wild and spectacular in the highs and the lows finding whatever it is when you say there's so much more to life finding that so much more life is so difficult for so many fighters yeah and I think it's keeping your brain - yeah that might be the you know I don't know I ain't nowhere close to that point is to start thinking about it but I'm like but it's hard to know when you're at that point right right right till it's too late also fighters are like the reason why you think you could beat everybody in the world is the same thing that's gonna get you fucked when you think that you could still go again mmm you know I mean that's what got Chuck Liddell in trouble when he fought Tito Ortiz most of us that were watched on the outside like please don't fight him please don't fight anybody yeah when Chuck's talking about fighting John Jones like oh good lord please don't do that because he's like you know I think I can get back in there with John Jones like yes like Chuck yeah is why he became Chuck Liddell in the first place because he's get that unstoppable belief in himself but there needs to be balance yeah there needs to be balance yeah you can do anything you even that is horseshit anybody that is horseshit you know this there's certain people that will fuck you up yeah yeah yeah you got to be smart smart yes but I do think you can still do things that you don't necessarily even know that you can do you know like I look at it now I'm like man I never thought that I would truly be like a professional fighter and be able to live and support my family off this so I'm like you know 20 years from now how did that look I have no idea what what it might look like I have no idea what else I could possibly do you could do anything that I further absolutely believe that it's just whether or not you dedicate yourself to it the same way you dedicate yourself to find right right yeah I think anybody that can be a professional fighter at the highest level that is an incredible juggling act of mind and body and discipline and technique and knowledge and understanding of the past and recognizing traps and and an intuition knowing when to strike knowing when to back off know when to push knowing when to coast it's just that's a mad fucking race I mean what you're doing when you're fighting is the most chaotic thing in all of sport and if you could succeed at that at the highest level I really believe you can do anything I really believe that and I think it takes a lot of I think it takes a lot more brain power than people kind of give it credit for and I think that's a big reason why you see guys on the decline too you know and I think it's something that not a lot of people look at you know you kind of see it and you're like all this guy's just out of his athletic prime or he's out of you know he's out of shape or whatever but really when you look at me like they don't be that much more worn physically you know maybe certain guys go through like certain injuries and get surgeries and stuff and it's just not as strong as it was when they were 25 right I get that but I feel like fighting in particular it's it's so much more thinking power and you got to be quick and maybe it's like the damage that they're taking tunes into the actual brain like they aren't processing information the same way not only is it physical but it's like it only takes one slip-up at the top level for a guy to catch you so you know if you if you if your brain just that that synapse ain't working perfectly right it's like that's lights out all right and everybody looks at it's like oh well you just out of shape you just gonna know it and stuff like that but it might be something like you know you're taking brain damage in there you know yes yes and I think there's something that happens to fighters when they lose that belief that they can be the baddest motherfucker in the world and that does happen when some fighters they get a few losses and then they settle into that journeyman's position and you know that's what gustafson just said when he retired he said I don't want to be a journeyman you know that journeyman position is a weird position because you know you you want to get in shape to win to beat this guy but you kind of know that you'll never be the man yeah yeah you know like say if you're a guy who's in that 205 pound division and you just keep losing and then you see John Jones yeah who's the greatest of all time just fucking everybody up and you know you can't beat him so your training even when you're hitting the bag and running and all that stuff you know Jon Jones fucked you up twice and you know he you can't beat him you know you can't beat him that keeps a lot of guys from having the same enthusiasm and passion that they had when they were 22 and they thought they could take on the world and they pictured themselves on the cover of fighters only magazine the greatest of all time you know everybody has these ideas of who they can be but when that idea has been shattered and now you're just a really good fighter some fighters just lose their enthusiasm for the game and then there's Diego Sanchez it doesn't seem to give a fuck about any of that it's just their direct people you know what he's going backwards in his classic words but but I think it's because he focuses on himself you know I mean he don't it diego's out of his mind for sure for sure but maybe maybe he's into his mind you know I mean maybe he's just so like focused on himself and you know even if you can't you know if you're looking at John and you like man I ain't never gonna catch up to that level I'm just not gonna beat it right then then yeah that can really like you said like start to really like discourage you a lot but then if you're just like okay I'm better than today than I was yesterday and you know my jabs like a little it's not as straight as it could be so let me just work on that and just pick the next thing and just keep constantly going to that I feel like that's what real champions doing are necessarily look at you know the the other person and Diego you know even if he ain't got the belt he's still in his head like that's maybe high thinking I don't know you had to talk to him he seemed like a crazy dude there's all different kinds of crazy right ya know I mean when when I saw Diego Maul Mickey gall I was like damn look at this guy yeah yeah he just have lost no no enthusiasm zero zero loss and enthusiasm after all these years of fighting you got to realize that guy won The Ultimate Fighter season 1 in 2005 we are now here I was at 9th grade 14 years weren't even in high school yet Jesus 2005 is crazy crazy he beat Kenny Florian in the finals Kenny's long since retired you think all the people he beat long since retired it gives it you gives you hope a little bit you know I mean like know when somebody else has done it so it can be done I think he's just you know into his own head and just like is constantly getting better and that's really what the game is about anyway never when he's to walk to the Octagon screaming yes yes yes yes yes I would love it he's so fucking crazy in the best way yeah yeah that's way he's not his mom he's still one of my favorite guys to watch yeah for sure for sure I mean there's a couple guys like that that kind of keep that that same longevity so you know you got a look at the the past and kind of learn from other people's mistakes and you know see okay why how was this guy thinking like that you know when you when you look across this and he like he really didn't want to be a journeyman I'd already lost it at two guys holding the title mm-hmm so you you look at things like man you kind of comparing yourself to to them a little bit too much you know like yeah you fought them and the result wasn't what you want it but it's like okay that's that's just the game is too good I think it's also he lives in Switzerland or Sweden sorry yeah it's fucking beautiful up there you've probably said baggy probably hunts and you know has a little life and everything so you like man what about doing this shit huh yeah you know I'm about to go back out in front of my whole country and fight another person like come on the last time before the first time we fought in front of his whole country was when he got knocked out by Rumble yeah yeah yeah rompers the dude where I look back at guys that kind of left the sport and I was like I get it he's been fighting for a long time he was wrestling before that he didn't want to do it anymore I get it he'll come back but this I don't know about it now man but the selfish part of me wanted to see Rumble get it together and fight for a title yeah again me not just fight when he fought DC but he gonna have to do it a heavyweight now fucked up Arlovski and heavy weight before the PFL was the PFL when it was that what was it called where a series of lighting yeah did he's a murderous striker murderous you know in the heavyweight division is actually a very good division for rumble if you really think about it with his speed and power first of all he hits so fucking hard it doesn't matter if someone's a heavyweight light heavyweight it doesn't matter the way he clips people it's like I mean there's a lot of good fights I will watch him in yeah him if Francis would people oh my goodness the type of a guys like like for instance another one like he can just find your chin you know and it's like I've moved around with him a couple times and you know you moved around with Francis I'd do some wild shit bro yeah gentle move around with like little kids sometimes he yeah he's he's like a gentle giant you know I mean most guys that you kind of see like that you you kind of you kind of realize like oh you know you big as teddy now if you signed up it say I can beat you right yes you see it a different side of them but we were targeting the oldest in the world but if he decided to go into pro boxing instead of MMA when he first started out he could be a world champion right now absolutely and like I say just moving around with him he's got like these weird ways of like this the punch just comes in as such an odd angle but it's like clean and it's like oh damn like okay I see what you're doing you know and I mean like I see what it is I mean that's all he's why I'm moving around with a guy is to triumph see what he get out a little yeah yeah but there's certain things you just can't teach a person and he's kind of got that you know he's got that that killer instant heat sinking missile you can't teach that no matter how much you want to hit pads or whatever like sometimes you it's in the it's in there you know he's a fascinating story too because after he lost a steep a you know I think he was absolutely convinced he was gonna knock steep a out and be the world champ and he thought it was unbeatable steep a just shattered his confidence and then he had that crazy fight with Derek where he was just like super attentive didn't even pull the trigger just like honey and he admitted he said I carried the fear of my last fight into the cage with me and then he came out and starched Curtis blades you know and then he came out and starched Cain after that like okay he's back yeah I think it took him took him some time to kind of get it back yeah yeah to understand what what it is and what's going on you know and to learn from it too you know I he's so strong willed and you know any and he's like gotta kind of got a different culture to you know coming from Africa in Paris and everything so we talked to him at me he's super smart dude super smart but he's kind of like me a little bit where it can be hard to get through that get through the head you know I mean like I mean I admit it you know a little stubborn sometimes and I think he is too a little bit so it can be hard for lessons to really sink in right but I feel like now like he he's one of those guys where yeah you can see it's like coming together for is he doing his camps in France no no he's been over in Vegas so he did one his camps yeah he did his lads Curtis blades yeah yeah fine yeah I'm not sure where he's doing his next camp or anything I don't know I was doing a lot of it the Performance Institute right yeah yeah yeah is he getting good wrestling cuz that's the really the thing that was exposed in the steep a fight it comes over to a to extreme and you know he'll wrestle with us a lot you know it's the problem is just heavy weights you know it's not a lot of the bigger dudes and he's intimidating too so when I when I sit back and I'll be watching them move around with certain guys like you can tell like they'd be scared you know I mean when he's on the other side of the cage yeah yeah outside the cage he scares me Russell would have a couple of times is I really don't really give a fuck but he's just so big it's hard for others like I've tried to get it you know I do my thing sure I'm a strong guy I home oh well it's the heavyweight division is very interesting right now because I think a lot of people are sleeping on steep a and I know dc-dc clocked him and knocked him out in that first fight but I think steep a is gonna want to come back to the second fight with a vengeance man and I mean he was the most successful heavyweight champion of all time and he loses the fight loses his title can't get anyone to pay attention him all everyone's talking about Brock Lesnar DC's gotta fight but he's like Brock Lester doesn't even fight he's doing fucking WWE what is this shit he goes I am the most successful of all time I'm the only guy to defend the title four times I lose one fight to a fantastic fighter and I can't get a fucking rematch like what is this about and then finally there's no one left in the division who else has he got yes gotta fight him yeah that I mean that played out perfect for him you know and I'm so glad to see it - like steep a is one of the coolest dudes and no so cool in a world bro and it's like what more do you have to do you know I mean like sometimes I get sick of just the way things are like I don't blame it on the UFC I don't blame it on on anything it's just sometimes it's just the way things are it's just the way people are to where like they they want to see like you add the food they want to see that controversy and they want they want to see that negativity all the time yeah it's like mass is it's like I do like steep a if steep a can't get a look he's like a firefighter like legitimately saving lives on a daily basis while like training to death and then a world champion at it it's like man if I do like that can't get no love no stand a chance bro but you know I'm happy to see if these are always gonna work out the way they supposed to work out you know what I mean I guess but I just felt like the marketing of him could have been so much better that was my feeling on that it's like how do you miss out on this hero yeah I mean super exciting I think it's just American culture maybe because you see like one Fc doesn't necessarily be the same way you know and they're still doing great I mean time will tell how great they really do but but their way of marking and a guy and promoting them and everything is just so much different mm-hmm it's like does that work in America is the problem is that people only want to see what they want to see like even about me you know like people see me kind of hit chiesa at the press conference and then that's all they really know about me so that's all they really you know they think that's me or more and they they even read wrong it to that type of situation and they just think that that's how you is bliss did you ever talk to cancer after your fight with him cool he cool he he's finished it was the choke no I think he's just mad away the whole situation exhaust the choke I mean it's almost like no he would have been better off if you went to sleep yeah but he ain't no yeah I mean he even said is that yeah I mean I'm he's mad that the fight went down the way you know younger getting around but but he's more mad still that I hit him it's well it's the problem was it was so locked in yeah stop it right there like let him go out let him tap or go out yeah but but but thing is it's it's defend yourself you know chop a choke you don't stop a choke if the guys awake you don't stop a choke that's true actually I mean there's been a couple situations where where you know that'll kind of happen and the guy will stop defending himself and the ref will will stop it and the refs do tell you they're like they're like if you stop defending yourself then you know you would out what else is there to do I mean yeah they he could just let me choke him out and have been a little easier but for us as competitors we kind of know you know I think he just was more upset it didn't know as well yeah Ethan goes way in and then not the way but look people even wrong into that into that kind of situation like I'm a cool dude like I I mean I mean I don't mean to say like that but I'm I'm always gonna give respect to everybody you know that's just the way I can tell until you kind of diminish that respect for me then then you know I'm gonna give it to you so right I was talking a little bit to him you know I'm now kind of you know I'm up there I'm having fun it's my first big press conference like I'm having fun at it but the minute that he got up and in ran across towards me it's like there's this dividing line almost it's like it shows you step over that you in my space now it's two cones okay yeah I'm gonna hit you play like that's just the way I you know you also you're in a defensive position like you have to hit them almost yeah yeah once someone comes at you this is a fight yeah it's a fight I mean I I that's just the way I grew up you know is any time in these parties some somebody is gonna you know invade your space like you're not gonna wait you guys could rematch sometime at 170 it's very possible a lot of the fights well he was another guy that had a real hard time making that way he's a big fella yeah yeah I mean they roll back on them and for me it's like I've always just wanted a fair fight so you know we can win at whatever you know it's it's even with me and dos Anjos I was saying you know let's weigh in at 165 and just kind of shutting hand he didn't want to do it but I'm like I just want a fair fight out at a deal you know it's whatever you want to weigh in we can shake hands to fight it what to weigh in at 165 just to show that this weight class is a viable weight class I tried to anyone do it yeah he said I don't make agreements with my opponents and I was like come on you know like this is our problem in the first place this is why I ain't no Union or nothing you know I mean like everybody's like against each other like come on bro we fightin anyway what do you know about the idea of a union I mean I think it's I think it's inevitable you know I think so yeah I think eventually it's it's gonna happen how would it happen I think it's once the UFC the UC is gonna change a little bit I feel like it's it's just the same way that I'm kind of looking at the way that Facebook has been doing stuff in all these other companies like these large private companies but they're they're so big and it's it's like the UFC is a sports organization you know I mean but it's so big now to where like it's I mean it's damn near our sport is I guess it's damn near public you know so I think once that kind of changes and people like once they open up the books and like people really start to pay attention to it then maybe somebody on the outside who's way smarter than any one of us or you know cuz we're if we're fighting we ain't really worried about the the legalities of it and you know I'm just signing a contract I don't really give a fuck but once somebody who's smarter kind of takes a look at it and see what's going on and how it is then then they're gonna start up something I mean they they have to I wonder it's kind of think it would take some sort of crazy lawsuit I would imagine but I think that fighters are individuals and then that they they think of themselves and then if like if you say I'm gonna join the yeah but that's I'm saying if you say hey I'm gonna join the union you know I'm gonna sit out until you guys meet the demands of the Union and they go that's great Cole be covering concerns gonna take your place now he's gonna fight for the title and then you're like what the fuck yeah and then you call Dana hey man I changed my mind out Union I'm with you guys and that's how it goes yeah I mean yeah yeah it but it's kind of a shame on our part almost it's like it's the same way is is I said let's meet at 165 it's like we already don't have a lot of leverage but like we you know yeah there's only so many things that we could even do I understand dos Anjos so he's like fuck we're gonna fight anyway I want to cut that extra five pounds you now I didn't do it either I'm like I'm already you know you've already fought it 170 I'm already taking a loss here I'm like I'm not gonna you know you know give you too many advantages here but but do you have seed that you feel like they treat you well yeah they'd like you obviously you mean that you're in their good graces yeah honestly I had no real like complaints about it you know is its I know what I'm I'm signing a line you know I mean I know what I'm signing up for in in any time I do and I say I'm gonna do something I'm always gonna make sure I hold up my in and I'm gonna do it and it's afforded me so much to where my life is so much different than I thought it would be like I I truly thought that that everything would just look different you know and I've provided a better life for my family like my my mom my dad and my brothers like well my realm one brother at least but you know it's just afforded me so much that any like negatives on it like I can't really it's just like grievances almost yeah I know I understand I understand what you saying have you ever been approached by other organizations before getting into the UFC yeah I mean maybe a little bit here and there but you know like when you see guys like sage Northcutt go over to one Fc and Eddie Alvarez and Mighty Mouse Johnson I mean it's it's all good for the sport in general you know I think even the UFC sees that like competition is always good you know it's just it's just building even more and bigger and better and it's really the sport that we looking after so if you're I mean I'm been in a contract with UC for a long while now but uh you know if another organization was to ever you never know what though you know I never know how things are going like what if Bellator really blows up and no change the name I mean no I name is a goddamn anchor door I mean I got a bowling ball metal bowling ball around your neck yeah kind of I mean I don't know for me I'm getting that UFC is where it's at and you don't want it to be too many organizations either you know what I mean run then it's like WBC WBA with so yeah I'm fine it's like it that's why well that's I don't want to be a part of that you know it's kind of a problem now I mean with Douglas Lima Douglas Leeman is world-class fighter but you know Rory MacDonald's world-class fighter these guys are world champion caliber Rory MacDonald could absolutely be a world champion in the UFC maybe be tyron woodley yeah yeah I mean I think I want to be a part of keeping it all together to you know I mean I'm not gonna be selfish and be like oh well one's gonna pay me way more money so I'm gonna go over there and do that like I'm a huge fan of the sport in general too so I want to see the sport do good in having us all under one roof definitely does help it's also being a UFC champion just fucking means more way more it just means way more and I do it yeah you find out a guy's a Bellator champion you like congratulations yeah yeah I find out a guy's UFC champion like oh yeah yeah yeah that's a different level and I would even want to keep that integrity about it you know and just for myself you know I mean to you know just just to know that that's what you did you say I'm gonna do it I that's what you did I think there's a wake up call then when guys are going over and fighting in these other organizations they're realizing now like man they are world-class fighters that you don't know about over in one Fc in particular like Timothy knots you can the guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez that motherfucker's world class classifies everywhere yep everywhere you gotta treat everybody with the same you know different world yes it's different but it's still like dudes a knock you out oh yeah the world now I'm saying that like you go over these other organizations it's not a cakewalk yeah they're they're just as hard and just as dangerous as UFC fighters you know when sage fought you saw the the sage result that Cosmo Alexandria guy that he fought like that guy's a beast man yeah and I'm all for taking big risk I really am and trying to take the biggest hardest fight that you can but somebody like that was like so somebody should have probably gotten a sage here it was like hey listen like this dudes a legit world champion kickboxer you know I just fought Nicky whole ski you know that's a huge level of of experience that you talk about coming from fighting somebody like Zack audible to you no psychic that's a huge job you know it's the Grand Canyon with a scooter yeah yes yes it's just sometimes the biggest risk ain't necessarily like the smartness either you know yeah you can legit get hurt in this sport like it's it's a sport but it's real life too like you can legit get hurt you can lose your life so yes you know I agree and also particularly cuz sage is not a Pressler yeah you know so he's gonna stand stand up with this dude with four ounce gloves on and had never fought in a ring before I don't at least I don't think mmm I mean I don't know but when you watch that fight and you see the way he was moving it's like he didn't expect that punch to come he didn't expect him to be able to cut them off like then when you look at a ring I mean it's it's it's a it's a hundred and eighty degrees right there so you only have one way to move never move that way you know yes that's a really good point actually I didn't even consider that whoever is you know his coaches should have been like listen like we need to work our way up there you know I mean yeah or I think they might have had a false misconception of going over to one and one treat and I'm real good and they're gonna give you a good fight so you know I think I want to build you I think one is signing guys to be like we got some legit talent over here we gonna sign you you go make you money but uh you'll have to earn that money yeah I mean it's not like they threw them right to the top champions either it's like they threw them to a world-class fighter that they look they've got world-class town and they really do and so does Bellator now you know I feel like Douglass Lima is as good as any 170 pounder in the world we just knocked out Michael venom page like holy shit brutal - holy shit K guard Mousasi is absolutely one of the best hundred and eighty-five pounders in the world yeah you know I mean he's as world-class as they get yeah and there's so much talent like you do need to keep it all under one umbrella don't you know it's better for the sports yeah is in this better photos fighters to you know like I'm a competitor so I'm gonna compete against the best of the best I don't want like a bunch of you know like where's boxing where you know you can't make two fights happen and because of this promoter doesn't work with this promoter and and you got to go through three four years of and in the whole time a guy like Joshua was kind of sitting back and like man I don't know I I don't get to fight these guys so I really don't know how good I am or something yeah where to stay just like let's just go out there and compete and the later chips out and wherever they fall is where they gon fall you only get to be able to do that if everything is under one roof yeah I'm really an enthusiastic and hopeful about this ESPN deal too because I think that's gonna expose a lot more people to the sport because there's so many people that are just casual sports fans that always have the the TV on ESPN I mean that is America's Network for sports and they're good too they're good like working with them for this last fight and yeah you getting ready to do the build up and everything it's just seeing the way that they do certain things there's like there's no fat on it you know there's no like there's no lag there's no delays there's no you know it's just everybody's just on another game like they're real professional that is so beautiful yeah I think I love hearing that yeah I think it's gonna be big but I've been very impressed with their promotion to the way they promote things where they put things together even the way they handle social media it's a notch up and you can tell like that they they're just have so much experience in sports I mean they're forever right I mean they're the leaders forever it's beautiful I think you know social media is gonna probably be the last little little leg up that because the our sport is living and died on it yeah almost yeah and that's gonna be like I've been shying away from it I don't really fuck with it like that no more just because I don't think it's right you know I mean I think eventually it's gonna change and it's gonna get to be way better and then once that happens like then the sport really like shouldn't what do you mean like in what way what do you don't you think is right about it I just don't like you know I I haven't been getting on it lately just because for me it was like I started noticing that it was changing my outlook on things like it was like I was almost doing stuff for the purpose of putting it on social media or I wasn't like enjoying in my life as much I was moreso worried about like how it was gonna look or you know what in use this and I was always constantly like scheming and plotting and it's just I didn't think it was healthy and I and then I started to see the effect that it was having on other people too and in or just people around me and and in general was like I was noticing it was terrible for my little brother and I think it's terrible for kids in general and it just made it to where everything was so you only got to see little glimpses of things you know what I mean people take the perfect picture in a perfect location and all this so that's just what you see and you only got to see the the the shine and the glitz and the glamor and stuff so when it when a young kid is looking at that he's like and he's gonna see thousands of likes on it too you know and that's what everybody likes so yeah it it just almost make you feel like man that's what I should be you know I mean and when you're not that then it can give you such a dangerous outlook on yourself to where you'll do something stupid to beat it to where I feel like it's gonna change it's gonna be different how so what do you think's gonna happen a couple weeks ago I saw that they were talking about you know taking away the likes you're gonna see it people would jump off buildings i bra I would love that though I would get back on it I'd be on Instagram full fledge they said they were thinking about taking away the number of followers - so you couldn't see yeah how many followers other people have I don't see why not I don't see why you need to see it I don't see why you know I guess I don't didn't know how ridiculous it is when the one went like sometimes like I'll see someone like which kills me was when I look in like the search area and there's some girl doing squats and a thong and I was like let me see how many light follows she has 18 million yeah but but my thing is what good does that do you know he's not happy because it's so crazy but even even I think you know it's huge in fighting and stuff but you know I look on it and like certain people have like millions of followers in this enough but does that necessarily translate to anything tangible you know I mean anything real it's like I don't necessarily know I don't know what the I don't know if anybody's done any studies and like really looked at that to see but I don't necessarily think it does and I don't really think it matters I think the only thing it does is like playing it in your own head where you like you know always get so many likes or you post something you like oh man I get this many likes and stuff it's like it does it doesn't matter you know I guess for the the only way I can see it mattering is for the algorithms you know we would like to see what other people like right so that makes sense but we don't necessarily have to see that right you know I mean if if like what ray rod is doing his videos love them I'm gonna look at him whether they got a hundred likes or they got a hundred thousand you know I'm gonna follow him whether he's got a million followers or a hundred followers do you know what I mean no I think that's probably the way it should be more because that seems more like real life yeah I get what you're saying um but in this day and age everybody wants to they want to know oh this is the number one show on like Netflix is an interesting thing because you never know what the fuck Netflix ratings are you have no idea if you watch like say Ozark or something like that no one has any idea other than Netflix Netflix knows they don't tell you shit like when I do comedy specials on Netflix they go we love it thank you but here's the it don't stop me from watching it that's true you know I mean if anything it makes it a little better you know I mean like alright I think so at least cuz because now you got your own little thing that you that you kind of get into I don't really like following the crowd that much maybe that's what the way I'm thinking about it but you know it don't stop me from watching it I wonder if they actually do that I wonder if they do do that if engagement will go down I'm sure Netflix at Netflix is model I'm pretty sure that algorithm is is showing like okay this is getting this many likes let's put this on the front page so more people are gonna click on it mm-hmm that makes sense I mean you don't necessarily have to see how many people watch it well the Netflix does it also for negotiation purposes sure like say when I do especially I know my last special got more views than my first special but I don't know how many I got they don't tell you shit they say we're very happy we're very very happy tell me how many people were watching we can't tell you that well I come again tell me they're laughing we're very happy tell me how many people well if it makes you feel better you see is doing that now ESP la you don't know how many pay-per-views that's good well that's the promise not many yeah the first one they did was less than a hundred thousand yeah that's not good when you consider that you know that was a giant fight you know max Holloway Dustin Poirier big-ass fucking fight a hundred thousand not even a hundred thousand bars but that takes away from our value as fighters you know I mean cuz that's what I'm saying you don't truly get to see it that's also because of streaming because this transition to ESPN plus it's gonna take a while before everybody realizes 100% this is the only way you're gonna get the pay-per-view it's only gonna watch the fights you gotta get the app yeah that's a great app tickles all the time I have it on I have Apple TV at home so I watch it on that it's seamless I like it yeah I mean me too but then again up I'm a just I'm a follow on wherever he goes but the zone is the same way too like I watched the Joshua Ruiz fight I watched that on the zone and that's fucking excellence the same thing yeah I mean in the numbers from from stuff like that it's like that's what I mean I think eventually is gonna change the way we really got to see the true numbers it's gonna have to because I wonder because when you when you see like Canelo Alvarez make 25 million or wherever he did in his last fight and then you hear he's only got you know 800,000 subscribers that signed up for the song but then you look at it there's only 800,000 subscribers on his own that's what I heard no that is true Google how many subscribers doesdoes own have da ZN i was calling it daisen forever there was no no manage to zone like well you need a fucking oh and an e yeah but then you look I mean I don't know Jamie probably pull-ups a number but then when you when you look at like on the same night alpha cowboy which is a way better fight to an amazing fine great fight but you know ESPN I don't know how many numbers you know they don't say the numbers of subscribers but it's got to be comparable right but that was a free fight you didn't have to see the thing is about ESPN plus you get free fights and then you get pay per views so the cowboy versus out Iaquinta fight was a great fight but it was free so if you got that app you just watched the fight but I think there's onus same way you don't you know at the bottom you just pay per month yes yes but the UFC for pay-per-view is not so when you get a pay-per-view fight you have to pay so that's a little weird right like maybe I make it a little more money make it 10 bucks a month and give everybody everything that was a what did WWE did yeah it was a huge success they probably figured that it took a while it was rocky remodelers oh 4 million 4 million subscribers to disown that makes sense it's restful if they had from their vice president of north america said that my TV show yeah subscribers and north american subscribers i don't that doesn't matter right it's internet doesn't matter but four million people maybe you're right and this guy's full of shit no I think it's not that's totally right I think yeah that's totally right but it limits your ability to negotiate right because you don't know like with DIRECTV like a DIRECTV says there's seven hundred thousand pay-per-view buys you know big hit everybody's happy you get a piece of that like oh boy we got this much money coming in like what how are they doing deals now for paper you I don't know I don't know ain't gonna be negotiation yet well you know do they take after your fight do they give you a window of time before you they contact you and hit you up with another fight like how does that work knowing me I wanted to get back in there in August but you know what's up Jim I'm now reading that they were publicly saying that one point more than 1.2 million people watched worldwide Canelo's last fight hmm so that's the way that's way less well that's not that many because it's free right once you have the zone that's free which is interesting that the UFC has a different model of that only thing I mean is tonello gets 25 million and then you know Alec cowboy get about a hundred grand apiece so it's like you know where's the value in this going on and then it's not even Canelo I think like three fights down you know on them on the cart like that guy got like a hundred grand I even know was not even really yeah I mean well first out Canelo Galaga six hundred million dollars you know something insane right I didn't they just signed Tyson Fury to something similar like that with the SPN he got a some crazy similar deal as well and Anthony Joshua with disowned it's another crazy deal it's all weird right now right everybody's trying to figure out what the future is and they're banking on streaming which i think is the correct bet yeah i mean it's it's changing everything is at least to everything i think it's gonna gonna change it's just it's just taking a little bit of time before it all we surprised right at a cowboy and I like Quinta we surprised that result no no not really the way uh I'm surprised what that long you know I mean I thought a the only way cowboy are the only way I was gonna win is if he would have knocked him out early it's just the kicks would have been too much and it was like I think that first left switch kick that he threw and kind of caught out on top of the head a little bit I think that yeah oops now I wasn't necessarily surprised he Cowboys been on this game for she's been on this team you know later which brings up this weekend yeah Tony Ferguson yeah how boys your own holy shit fight oh I'm so excited about that fight I see it going to Tony though really yeah you know I at first I didn't I thought that Cowboys just just to to on his point um Coppola Steinman might be a little bit better so you know and Tony does get hit so you know that's something to look at but I think Tony's just unorthodox movement and in the way he throws punches and moves his head at the same time it's throwing punches cowboy likes to kind of leave his head up there and in maybe get hit to the body or something so Tony's relentless yeah yeah that motherfucker never gets tired and he keeps us on rebounder yeah yes yes it's a three-round because it's the third fight below the main event so the main event is pseudo Marlon more ice which is another fucking phenomenal fight yeah yeah Martha's got a lot of power oh he's got everything yeah that's a big 135 or - that dudes jacked that's a big that's a that's like a big risk going up for sudo I think you know and you know he's such a champ though he'd been at at the top of multiple sports for so long that he's got so much experience he he's gonna know how to handle it right but yeah that's good fight it's it's better than that people are giving it credit for for sure yeah he just wants to be champ champ you know - champ champs he wants number three well there's three champ champs I'm sorry because can we call this something else Amanda Nunez yeah can we call this something else for you know because it's too many of them knives like DC became Jeff Jeff I got excited but then when you defend the belt you know for two or three times are you are you champ champ then you know I mean this one the title twice and defended it should be champ champ then but when you win two divisions you are champ champ we stop fucking around heavenly you can't take away Amanda Nunez his champ champ she decides to never fight a featherweight again she is champ champ yeah alright straight-up murderer you alright but you know how wish we call this um do you know rumbles not fighting but yeah fight if you want to keep your knees like Rick Jones is no goddamn joke Craig Jones is a heel hook and motherfucker he is actually yeah Craig Jones is at the top of the food chain in the submission grappling where old but he's not as big as Rumble but I don't think anybody's drug testing but that means in that drug testing Rumble so who know I don't even know if they have to weigh in I don't think they're gonna weigh it they're calling it like David versus Goliath match so I don't know yet the weight 50 pound wonder what rumbles gonna weigh cuz Craig Jones has been grappling I wonder what I want to say he's probably around to 15 to 20 long guy he's not not incredibly ripped but this submission grappling world is very strange because there's no real drug testing to speak of and everybody kind of knows that everybody's kind of juiced up you know Brazil from Australia yeah but I don't know I don't think it comes that much into playing and grappling you know it's so much technique and leverage above if it comes and you play it helps you track the train much longer so much harder especially with noogie probably does you know I think in in noogie well I think it works with key to it's just look it's physical it's a physical thing you get two guys one guys on juice one guy doesn't the guy who's on juice has some sort of an advantage if they're both technically similar but that's a tough fight from Rumble in that Craig is used to being on the bottom and he's used to fighting with with inside control of the legs like I don't know what kind of rumble would kind of leg lock game rumble has it's almond suckers oh yeah the crazy thing is Dennis home and went for a fucking heel hook care and Craig Jones is like nope yeah not a good idea yeah I feel like that's gonna be the next little evolution that you see in MMA it's like leg locks yeah I've really like started to incorporate it a little bit into into my game yeah it's it's a especially against wrestlers like I would be a little worried if I was a in Robins corner for that because wrestlers are a little more susceptible to leg locks machine so I feel like that's gonna be like the next little level that you you have to understand the system and I don't I'm not a leglock I heart yeah I see the transitions but if I was on the mat with them I wouldn't be a step ahead I wouldn't be able to like know where they're going and I would have to react as it's happening which is a giant disadvantage and I don't know what Rumble knows I know he was a great wrestler and but rumbles big thing was never submitting people's fucking people up standing up yeah I mean I think the best way is just to try and disengage from them and just not let them have your legs it's just that's easier said than done look with all that with Greg don't these just the thing with those guys is when you're rolling with someone who is that high level with submissions you are reacting and they know how you're going to react and they're anticipating your reaction and they have a counter to your reaction and you're always one step behind so you can explode and explode explode and eventually you get a little tired then who hoop and you know Hickson used to talk about that it's like they can't keep the rhythm that's what I always say they can't keep the rhythm like this is because they just keep going they keep attacking and you just can explode and explode and show everybody how athletic you are but after a while that shit wears out and then next thing you know you're wrapped up in something yeah and I think they see more guys like you you know I mean they see more guys that are just trying to to you know they see a lot of wrestlers and a lot of guys just try those same kind of defenses and where you not seeing that many guys that are good at late locks like that especially to the point where now they're starting to understand it way more technically then you know like Paul haar is style of just like grab your foot just trying to like squeeze the shit off some good technique but if what were complexes like you know Eddie coming sir yeah yeah I don't mean Pajaro said general I just mean that style of doing you know some guys you just see like they just grab your foot and just twist it the way it ain't supposed to go but you know when you look at a guy like Donna here style and he's breaking it down like a mad scientist he's like you know there's literally gonna be no way that you're gonna get out of those different levels of it you know you've seen that with Garrett Onan now and I mean yeah yeah Garrett tone was fighting over in one he just submitted the shit out of somebody with an inside deal it has he fought against yeah just fought real recently in scala a week ago oh wow Garrett Owens he's gonna be a world champion I really believe that yeah I seen as uh his first like to maybe well he's undefeated he's for know now okay and it's just the way he's winning - he's fucking people up and he's super dedicated and he's just real smart and when he's got with a guy like Danaher in his corner Danaher is another guy and he's also by the way you know he's locked up It's A Wrap for us a hobby they're all like in cahoots together they train together but Donna has got a special brain he really does here's a special understanding of submissions yeah I want to talk to that guy yeah sure get on down New York yeah yeah he's type of dude I said I thought six hours but I was like because he seems like he's got that you know systematic way of breaking stuff down yeah kind of like that because it takes the guesswork out of it uh-huh I mean it takes the what if he does this oh well then he's got an answer for it when he does this he's got an answer yeah you know that's why I feel like I'm kind of missing it Mike well unnecessarily that my game but yeah I think that would be a great addition to anybody's game yes to Train down there and understand what that guys doing or I mean there's a there's quite a few different systems now and then like you got like Craig Jones who's coming like I said from Australia he's got he's got a very similar system to it's just everybody's got different approaches to it but what Danaher did and that hen's Oh Gracie team did is they just kind of like proof of concept like just let everybody know hey like you're missing out on a giant chunk of this thing and a giant chunk of this thing is all the variables that come into play when guys are trying to rip each other's knees apart yeah yeah it kind of goes back to even like you know those individual sports are so ahead of ours right you know like what we were talking about earlier when you're seeing world-class jiu-jitsu fighters or world-class Muay Thai fighter and they're just better at that thing the other guys who do everything yeah so I mean a couple years ago you saw more like jiu-jitsu go into back attacks and you know arm bars were like really big in it and now you then they kind of went through like the leg lock era and I feel like we kind of stuck on the back attack kind of our bar and eventually we'll move over to being able to pull off leg locks because now you see in a lot of jiu-jitsu guys kind of get away from leg lock and starting to under the defense they're starting to catch up a little bit I think it to go to Worlds to see it but you know I'm I always like to stay one step ahead of it and see where it's going you know and yeah what's on the other side it's interesting in the world they were weighing the fighters before they got onto the mat that's how you weighed in yeah you had to make weight with your Gyan at the side of the mat and then you drink some water and then go roll so they're trying to discourage any and alway cutting that works if you're not getting hit you know I mean uh when you talk about like those punching each other some guys are still gonna cut weight and that's too big of a risk to take care of yeah dangerous yeah very very dangerous yeah your brain is you know and this was even an idea that that I had kind of had was like I wonder why nobody creates some type of fluid-filled a headgear of some sort you know what I mean like when you think about like your brain like your brains surrounded by that blood that fluid and that's really what what's protecting it you know more so than even like the thickness of your skull or anything so when you put in you know I I get why they like boxing amateur boxing is starting to take away the headgear because they're saying is making it more dangerous it's really only helping the guy who's punching you you know when you punch somebody with a headgear you can go play full blast so it's also their head snaps more because there's weight on the net it's it's it's actually making it worse you know where if you had something that was fluid-filled kind of recreating the the inside of your hit then that would absorb and shake the the water you know like almost like those are those water bags you know yeah when you hit those like you can feel like it's a little it absorbs the the impact a little bit different yeah I just wonder I mean I don't probably not a good idea like maybe if you bus it and you got water fucking flow it everywhere zone that's a big deal but I think you're right that makes sense if they could design it correctly you out a way to disperse the impact matter yeah that's a good idea yeah yeah I mean I don't know I they they should just do some serious testing on now I don't know why I'm part of the Cleveland Clinic over in in in Vegas they they've got this study going on for a couple years where they take you in and they they run you through an MRI scan and they do all these different type of tests on you on a lot on the computer like testing your reaction skills testing your balance testing all the you know different parts of your brain it's been a couple years now I think I've been part of them for like four years I go in twice a year to get it done but that just seems like it's gonna take so long or you really notice anything and when you do that do they tell you your results based on how you were six months ago yeah they give me that I actually just expert MRI scans cuz they tell you and they're just like yeah no you're fine like you know like your results are big because it's kind of the same test that you're takin over and over and over again huh so you just kind of match them up to how you did last time and you know if you scored a 98 on the last one you scored a 98 on this one it's like okay that's cool you know yeah you've you find but to me I asked them for the actual MRI scans I don't know how to read an MRI like that right but you know cuz I want to see like even them it's got to be deeper than that it's got to be deeper than 2+2 and you know all this shit like it's gotta be something more to it like they should just do a study where they take a ballistic hit and hit it no bunch of times see what's happenin to the brain of it yeah right right left Francis punch it yeah like I want to know you know I think and I think fans like wanna know that you don't want to give your brain to this shit right you know it's like and then you could do stuff where you put something over put a header on it see if it makes it worse put it like say it water hit gear you think you're ever gonna get to a point where they'll have a study that they can like a test like that I could do in a fighter and they'll say hey man you can't fight anymore yeah free shuttles they really don't have that right now which is why they let Chuck Liddell fight ta Ortiz right yeah I think uh just like em are like an MRI you know like a couple years ago no you wouldn't be able to get the same type of imaging and now when you see like some of the stuff that they're really coming out with medically I think that's gonna advance so much more to where you're gonna really be able to see like the individual neurons and inside on you guys see like okay you're breaking up these these parts of your brain that we couldn't see before you know you can't see what an x-ray you couldn't see it with a 1-hour MRI a lot of times they can't see until the autopsy right right so hopefully as technology improves and as we get better on that front like then we can just start to take some of that that technology and use it for what we doing you know yeah well Kevin Lee it's been a blast let's do it again six months let me know what here a year will be a year a year a little thank you brother appreciate you man Kevin Lee ladies and gentlemen [Applause] [Music] [Music]
