hello freak bitches and some something that's like I came in here and remember I got gotten sick yeah and uh and I had to postpone on you mm-hmm and anyways went to a hospital down and uh up in Valencia I think and they had thrown me in a room for three hours and they were thinking about getting hazmat suits out and all this stuff because I thought you might have had a bola because you came back from Africa right yeah right right after the bullet crisis what dude I had been back for like two months or something or maybe even close to three and yeah they were going all crazy and stuff and this is just a stat that that I liked it some that grips my heart so that's why I want to say it now but um I mean I I think I looked it up right before I got in in here and it was around 11,000 people that Ebola took took out 11,000 people that's a ton it's a ton it's a brutal crisis but I just remember the uproar that that in the fear like the outcry that happened publicly all over the United States and only a couple people got it here yeah and then and then still that's terrible but whenever I compare that 11,000 people total in this a bola crisis and then the stat for children and this is on water fors website and stuff and in on ours and dude it's what I want to fight and let people know because there should be a real public outcry an uproar that five thousand kids five thousand kids under the age of five years old die every single day every single day because of dirty water because of water and borne disease because waterborne illness that's a legit stat from like UNICEF or one of those like legit places five down five thousand a day it's like it fluctuates from like four thousand seven hundred or something to five thousand a day and like for me man I've I've I've held two of those children you know I've I've I've dug the grave I've had blisters on my hands I've had a little dude named Andy buh is blood on my hands and like like bro it it's it wrecks me and like that's why I'm so passionate about this thing and like I come back in like I get it a bull is terrible and we need to knock it out because it can take out so many people but why why are people not like why don't they have their eyes open their ears open their heart open to hearing about 5,000 kids dying every day up in to the funeral of five other kids I've seen the grave of nine or ten others besides that like an these are just among the pygmies I've been to the I've seen the funerals going on of their oppressors like the the slave masters in the muck Paulo the non pygmies that surround them their kids are dying in the dirty water and it's not I don't I don't mean to go crazy but no it's not crazy at all it's and that that statistic is crazy five thousand a day a day and they're under five years old so I mean I don't know how many with the six seven eight nine year olds you know I've been to the funerals of those kids we are very strange about what we have what we focus our attention on and the Ebola thing is just something that was over here because we were worried about it coming over here we're doing the problem over here we we're it's so convenient for people to not look at impoverished third-world countries people that are just they've always been in this sort of state of poverty so we just sort of accept them at being like that we don't think that they necessarily that they have to live the way we live or have access to clean water and medicals which is telling me think about it we worry about Cecil the lion yeah you know outraged about Cecil the lion where everybody's going nuts and freaking out yeah I mean look poaching terrible it's awful so the animals are beautiful it's an you know I get it but the the way we reacted to that to know your statistic to know that what you just said the five thousand little kids die every day from dirty water and people aren't freaking out about that I think it's like every 20 seconds who attacks pokemons people they're like the most adorable nicest people in the world but yet look at that you said do you not like the word world well like world is that hey say world how do you say it wor LD w Bonnie put the ARB or the it rolls off the tongue easier then go in world world world world world how do you say it world no no you don't say it like that it's a world how do you say it world no

program was apparently never really effective and the scientists that were behind the Star Wars program a fuckload of them died like by suicide by murder and there's a giant list of them and it's one of the most fascinating conspiracies in modern time you find it ok these guys that knew the people that knew the scientists the engineers dead I think almost all of them they all died like murdered suicide and like very very suspicious I did like a number like you know they did like a percentage like what are the odds that all those people were murdered and flirted a billion to one yeah well they knew they all knew that it was bullshit yeah the Star Wars program they had spent millions untold billions of dollars to develop this completely ineffective system to shoot missiles at us guy was never proven to work ever and those scientists are all dead as food here goes dead scientists there's the list Marconi scientists mystery in the 1980s over two dozen science graduates and experts working on the Marconi or a Plessy how do you say that Plessy PL SEC 1 plus SS s why defense systems died in mysterious circumstances most appearing to be suicides the mo D denied these scientists had been involved in the classified Star Wars projects and at the dead were in any way connected but look at how these guys died look at this guy computer programmer Keith Bowden scientists and at Essex University engaged in work for Marconi blah blah blah circumstances death fatal car crash with vehicle went off out of control across a dual carriageway and plunged into a disused railway along these maintained even drinking with family and friends denied the allegation so what the fuck was it where where's the autopsy it's a coroner reported an accident here's another one latern Lieutenant Colonel Anthony godly expertise head of work study union at the Royal College of military science circumstance of death disappeared mysteriously without explanation presumed dead okay that's expertise radar designer and droughts man draftsman I guess as draftsman droughts Minh with Marconi circumstance of death death by shotgun blast at home coroner's verdict suicide Jonathan Wallace 29 expertise digital communications expert who had worked at GE C and a British Telecom secret Research Centre at the blah blah blah yep exactly died the result of falling from a hotel room in West Africa while working for British Telecom he'd expressed fears that his life was in danger coroner's verdict open and he just goes on and on and on look out look you see house he's scrolling look how as Jamie scrolling look at the upper right-hand corner look how fucking long this list is like scroll down to the bottom of this list so you can see how many people are on us look at this there's a lot of people that were attached to the Star Wars program all of them in the late 80s and the early 90s dead is fuck
