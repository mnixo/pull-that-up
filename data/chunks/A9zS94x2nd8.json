hello freak bitches the cold is my only master the cold is my only teacher and the breathing Pony say you altered your breathing patterns like what do you mean exactly like when I went in at a certain point I knew how to be you know very relaxed going in then let it kill a cold impact go within and then begin breathing deeper and then a certain dance between the cold and tabria breath it begins to start up begins to charge your body and after 25 breaths like that very conscious in the cold the cold is a force and it has his impact and you go along with the cold and what it does in the figure on the physiology and you use your breathing now I know what happens physiological but then those days was all by feeling and what does happen physiologically you become fully charged the the carbon dioxide goes out to get begins to roam freely throughout the body and fills up every cell and pH levels go up now when you say you altered your breathing we went you're showing me here is just breathing in and breathing out like what is split specifically different about that and normal breathing there the way I used it well it was like after 25 breaths it was so fully charged I could stay like five to seven minutes under the ice every time very controlled that means that there is not only a whole lot of oxygen inside the body in the but the pH levels go up now this later on I began to understand by signs by by thinking about it and then a deducting and all that I I saw that that we are able to tap into the brainstem the adran we showed lying in bed people producing more adrenaline now I know how to show to people just in a couple of days that means every listener right now is able to do that so we have proven this scientifically and it showed that people lying in bed were able to produce more adrenaline than somebody in fear going for its first bunker jump a bungee jump and when but you're still I'm still confused as to how you're doing anything differently other than deep breathing you're taking a deep breathe in and deep breath out now we re tempt from breathing after exhalation we tent we stop breathing after exhalation lunch breathe in like what show me the method like if if you if you go with me 30 times okay let go Oh fully in once again fully and letting go right on boolean but letting go not fully out just letting you but fully and once again I want to get come on though hesitate give it it's about changing the chemistry right now in your body so I'm everything it you become lightheaded and at a certain point you so fully charged and pH levels go to a very high level you are able to stay without air in the long four minutes just keep on that feeling is understanding go on and deeply yet letting go deeply and letting go deeply in letting go ten times more deeply in letting go deeply in letting go I'm gonna time it letting go deeply there you go give it fully take him in letting go take a man letting go take a man letting go no hesitation I do this with Overeem as well and he feels wonderful take a man fully letting go okay five times more deeply and letting go deeply at letting go deeply in let it go two times more letting go and stop just stop witness without air in the lungs you are able to stay much more than normally than normally why because we change your chemistry carbon dioxide went out Oh to end up filled up all the cells and pH levels go up then we are able to tap into the central nervous system and at the end we get the brainstem and that's the plays of the pineal gland hypothalamus pituitary gland and the pineal gland makes the secretion of adrenaline in dangerous situations normally we do not get into it because of of our shallow breathing but this is the way to get into the the most primitive part the reptilian brain without many difficulties and fend off bacteria getting better into the endocrine systems we'll talk about it later you're past the one 110 in minutes and you still on that shows that the capacity to fill yourself up with oxygen is a lot more than we normally use and as we do not use it we are not making a use of the full capacity of our physiology now we found out we got a different layers and we never use it and this is the way to learn to use it to tap in and bang into the primitive brain into the endocrines immune systems the way nature has meant it to be everybody is able to do 145 and this is only round one if it would do like three rounds you would go to three minutes four minutes without air without training it only shows the capacity to store up oxygen inside we never use that you're doing great and si is doing already two to five almost to ten whenever you feel the urge to breathe you don't need to force is only learning how to ox energize the body in all the cells you going great man nice you're haha feel good huh yeah yeah yeah that's okay two thirty uh yeah when you feel the urge to breathe you breathe in fully and keep it for 10-15 seconds then that's one rock boolean and keep it and now will you press your belly the neck and then the head now you are able to tap into the brainstem and yeah that's him if we would do it in again you would you know sorry got very lightheaded is it something in that breathing the breathing is yeah sure so what explain to people at home what I'm doing is I'm breathing in all the ways as deeply as I can but I'm not breathing out all the way yeah I'm just breathing out a little bit and then I'm breathing in more I'm just breathing out a little bit I'm breathing in more and breathing out a little bit yes and if you breathe breathing completely you get all the oxygen possible inside if you just let it go then you get it to where the exchange of the gases happen and this is the way best to ox energize the body so it's a different way to get into the chemistry of the body and we we have shown this
