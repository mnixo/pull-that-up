the Joe Rogan experience that's not good for well no it's terrible for you it's and what it is is it's a game and like the office is a game yeah and there's very specific rules where this it when the game starts in the beginning of the day there's a boss and suddenly this person is just like you has authority over you and can control basically controls your life and the food for your kids and so you have to speak in a certain language dictated by the corporation that's this terrible fucking game that people forget is a game and they begin to think oh no this is the way you're supposed to act this is real life and that's when you get like that be of a song did you ever see that be a vase on the Bank of America song do you ever see that and it's like somebody filmed this corporate announcement of a merger between B of a and another Bank and it's a guy saying to you choose one this song that he wrote about Bank of America and it is what it will make your eyeballs roll back into your head with such existential horror it's seeing this brainwashed drone who's obviously spent like a week writing the lyrics to this song and is passionately oh my god passionately singing the lyrics to how great Bank of America is as a corporation I think we should be able to play this on the part I believe it was a corporate video that was made by Bank of America right that was sent out to his employees know if somebody had a camera out during this like moment where some kiss-ass you know how to play guitar everybody in the audience is clearly like they seem uncomfortable to me they're just like oh fuck you know what it reminds me of it reminds me of a cult it's like a cult the feeling there is that of a people who've gotten absorbed into a cult that's the only way to put it it's like they believe crazy shit that is only even known by a relatively small group of people and it's their entire lives thanking the Bank of America way the way that we do business he's singing about the way they do business and it's kind of obscure banking terms and this really really when I hear it sounds fucking awesome this could be found on YouTube under Bank of America sings u2's one I just want to say before you press play I'm looking forward to this almost as much so I'm looking forward to the new Conan currently it's so impressed with your results to date and they've listened to the plans being described today and continue to be excited about what's going to be the card business today and beyond and that is Jim Dubois who is the consumer market exec for the Manhattan market we thought why we listen all this nonsense who is a long-winded fellow well song together for you we've missed those guys names which is probably for the best we don't want to diss them well this is real go fullscreen it is even better Oh No now that we're the same two great companies come together now MB and ASB of a No and this one bank one car one name that's no no no one spirit we can't the share it leaving your salt -
