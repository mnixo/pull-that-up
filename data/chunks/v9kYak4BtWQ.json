the girag and experience what's hard for people to grasp is that you don't know what's next that's hard it's scary it freaks people out so they seek they seek help pills booze bullshit bad relationships and drama at work and all this nonsense you're just filling up your stupid head with just distract yourself from this ultimate fascinating existence that we find ourselves in where we kill we have no idea what's coming next we don't know what's going on right now anywhere except what's right in front of us and even then the wheels of perception they eat and flow depending on what chemicals you've induced into your body or they're not a smoke to join or ate a mushroom or you know there's a lot going on here it's not just as simple as this flat consciousness that we all agree upon because I'm not entirely sure that other people have the same experience that I do when I look at like some country music and I look at like some TV shows and I looked at some music country music a lot of pop music I actually probably liked more country music now than I even like hot music we spent some good times in a country yeah I'm a big white Yocum fan I like my dog's name Johnny Cash and I like cut some country music but there's some really stupid shit out there why is it is it because they're dumber than me or they see in a different reality is reality just like your nose like your nose is a nose my nose nose but if my nose was on your face I'd be like what did you do different you did something different and if you put your nose on my face you be like do some go on your nose looks different or something it would be we both have a nose it's very recognizable neither one are distinct there's there's nothing you know like we don't flatten boxers noses or anything they're both pretty normal but I know my nose and I know your nose and I know your nose is in my nose how do I know that that's not like reality that reality like with what other people see they're seeing it through a filter that makes things that suck come in at come out there bit a better shape they have it has a better smell to it things that seem stupid to you to them it all just fits right into this neuron and this this look this ability to interact with light accepts this shape better than that shit for some strange with orange it's always been my favorite color are you seeing the same color I am because orange looks stupid how do you like orange yeah I want an orange car you fucking weirdo yeah wish you know what I mean it's like what why would you like orange is it is it is it a taste thing or is it a taste thing and your world is different than mine I think what you're mentioning is really one of the key lessons that does mention is pot smoking nonsense that's what I mean well I was just yelling when I was on that when I did my my last ayahuasca trip in Peru and I had the vision of the eagle and that was the secret that he basically gave me is up flying along with this condor eagle and the eagle says to me you know you want to know how to see better you see through everybody else's eyes and the message there was that everybody has their own perception and to really understand what you're going through what they're going through and seeing you have to see what they see through their lens of perception and if you can do that you know all a lot of this hate and a lot of this anger goes away what you feel instead can be maybe pity button I feel bad for this human look at the way the world appears to them look at the way you know that person is so quick to anger so quick to hate when really you know they could look at the same situation with love and feel happiness and so it shifts your kind of opinion on things but no doubt about it we look at things a different way and the recent studies on epigenetics will show that you know things you can change the way things appear probably not only on a mental level but probably a genetic level based on your epigenetic manipulation of belief you know and in what you see and I think you know Bruce Lipton's doing a lot of good research in that and that's a really exciting field but you know just because you have a certain lens of perception doesn't mean that that can't change with your choices and with your belief yeah and that that change would help you we want to we want to hang on to the way we are so badly we don't want to admit that we were wrong if we met wherever wrong then we have this reevaluation of the value of self because the value of self is very important and one of the important things a lot of people have is that they're right they want to be right like a lot of you times you get an argument with someone and it a certain point that you're like why are we even why am I upset about this like I have nothing to do with this lizard that lives in fucking the Komodo Islands I have nothing to do with them but you're insisting that it lives all over the place and I'm telling you it only lives there and it fucking zoos and like why is this even why is this upsetting what is it about this what's really going on here people um we develop patterns you know in attachments no in attachments - you're attached to the persona of the guy who's right about random facts you know so when you're attached to that and it gets challenged you identify with it that's part of you so it's actually threatening a piece of you which triggers the kind of fear mechanism is it's fascinating we talked to someone and you mean I I would never say that I'm absolutely free of that I'm not free of any human emotion norsu but I'm pretty good at controlling that impulse and I'm also pretty good at not being attached to ideas until I've like really extremely vetted them out and also vetted out the opposing idea but I've had conversations with people where they say something me like I had a conversation with this kid where he was talking about psychedelic mushrooms and he disagreed that he was like very adamant very smart kid very young probably like maybe 20 and he was talking to me about how you know I disagree with terence mckenna's stoned mushroom theory he goes I think it's too simplistic and it ignores the fact that there's so many different strange things that are uber complex all throughout the universe you know why why should we assume that human beings got this way because of one compound and I was like you're right fuck do I know why I don't know nothing about and he was like he goes okay I can respect that I go yeah I mean what did I do the research am i I don't know I think it's a good idea I think the idea is sound because I think the chimps obviously they think and mushrooms make me think in a completely unique way and I think that if a chimp ate mushrooms you'll probably affect the way Thanks I mean just seems to make sense - no doubt I mean you can see it I mean you look at you look at the pictures of the dolphins who were just doing the fucking the puffer fish toxin they're going to the surface and looking at their reflection you know at that at that point that has to be changing some of the usual usual pattern is probably fine fresh fine fish let's find fish although its place are fuck let's a flower let's find fish more fun and then all the sudden they stop all that and it quiets they say wow look at me I'm a fucking dolphin and then and then it's a different pathway that opens up and that's what happened in these monkeys too at a certain point or humanoids or whatever what stage they were on a certain point they're like whoo yeah
