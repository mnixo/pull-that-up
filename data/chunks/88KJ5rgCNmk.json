hello freak bitches when did the start when did the trigger warnings when to the safe spaces when did all this emerge well it has its roots in the student radicalism of the 1960's especially the far-left radicalism it really popped up in the 1990s in the early 90s when I was teaching in the US at that point and which universe I taught at Harvard from 93 to 98 and there was a fair push for political correctness especially in the early part of the 90s but but it got pushed back down and disappeared and went underground it went on the ground is more accurate and then it's just come back with a vengeance in the last five years and I think it's partly because we have all these radical left political activist departments at the universities women's studies being at the top of the of the list that have done nothing for the last 30 years to even longer than that now it's almost 40 years 30 years let's say have done nothing but produce a never-ending stream of ideological he minded counter civilization political activists and that's all subsidized by by tuition and by the public purse and that's another thing we really got to ask ourselves is why the hell are we subsidizing revolution why are we doing that it's crazy and it's dangerous it's dangerous what so what exactly is going on with women's studies that you believe is fostering revolution well you go on their websites and read read what they say I mean first of all for the for the women's studies types and this is a what would you call it false anthropology there's this idea that way back when there was a feminist paradise and that would be like noble savage mode of living where everything was egalitarian and and women dominated it was a matriarchal culture that was put forward by a UCLA anthropologist named Gambia Tess I can never pronounce her name property but I think I got it and then that was overthrown by patriarchal institutions start essentially starting at about the time say of the of Judaism and that was all overthrown and ever since then we've lived in an oppressive patriarchy and now that's what our culture is it's an oppressive patriarchy so they're pointing to one unsuccessful society that they believed existed or did not exist no it didn't exist there's no evidence for whatsoever it's it's it's complicated but it's the it's the telling of a kind of psychological myth as if it was history whoa and and and anyway so so the basic claim is that Western civilization is a brutish patriarchy and that whatever positive things it might have managed to accomplish were all accomplished as a consequence of oppression and and and theft and that the appropriate thing to do is to restructure it from the bottom up and they mean that they mean that they mean every single bloody concept and you can marry that with modern post-modernism and throw in a nice dash of Marxism and you have the the ideological and motivated grounds for social revolution and just go online and look at a dozen Women's Studies websites just read them you can see what they say they produce political activists and their goal is to restructure the patriarchy well what's the patriarchy well the patriarchy is Western civilization and what is restructure mean that's easy it means tear it down and destroy it why because it's a brutish system that's predicated on nothing but oppression it's nothing but a tyranny and in the eyes of the of the radical women studies types heterosexuality that's a tyranny capitalism that's a tyranny democracy well that doesn't even exist and even if it did it would be a tyranny everything's a tyranny and so you can ask these and and what would they replace it with they replace it with their own ideological utopia well we've already had a hundred years of that we saw what happened oh well that doesn't matter that wasn't real Marxism that's what the bloody Marxists always say that wasn't real Marxism it's like oh how many millions of people have to die before you're convinced that it's real Marxism and I know what they mean by that - they mean hey if I was the Marxist dictator things would have gone a lot better it's like ah you should think again sunshine if you are the Marxist dictator things wouldn't have gone a lot better so and if you're the sort of person that thinks that if you would have been control things would have gone a lot better then you're exactly the sort of person who should never be in control so and it's resentment it's horrible resentment you know that's an important point because I think this is something that you said that I absolutely agree with it I think a lot of this thinking and the way people are behaving it seems based on revenge it seems based on revenge for awkward upbringing social uncomfortable uncomfortability it seems like there's something about the way they view the world where they want to get back at people that have literally done them no wrong it's resentment for the burden of being it's deeper it's deeper I mean human being human existence is characterized by a fair bit of suffering you know we're limited creatures and life is very hard everyone dies everyone you love is going to die most of the things you do all of the things you do will eventually fail you know suffering is a certainty and it's very easy for people to become resentful about about being about existence you know these kids who shoot up high schools and and and these mass shooters they're they're the perfect examples of people who run on nothing but resentment they're out to kill the innocent because that's the best marker of that's the best way of showing just how much contempt they have for existence itself why punish the guilty they deserve to be punished it's a lot more malevolent and and and and and vengeful to punish the innocent it's like people are motivated to a great degree by resentment of being and a huge chunk of that is manifested in got to the dark side of the ideological possession so I get to decide who my enemies are and then I get to go after them and I can go after them for every single thing that's ever been done to me that isn't good and well a lot of that's just built into the structure of existence then they group up they exhibit confirmation bias they all form some sort of a groupthink and then they act accordingly and this is what you've been warning against and this is where I completely agree with you and that's why I think the subject is so important and I love the way you've outlined all the steps and the problems with Marxism and ideologies in general that we are dealing with this these are the beginning steps of it and people who look at it now they say it's social change social justice it's not it's not it's not that's right it's not and we're this is not going to improve things implementing these policies will make things worse they've made things worse every single place they've ever been implemented and often they've made things so much worse that you actually can't imagine it and people don't do the reading I've done the reading I've done the reading I know how bad things can get they can get so bad that no matter how bad you think they are you're not even in the bloody ballpark well it's just so strange that these sort of courses and these sort of ideologies are thriving in universities and it's really disconcerting to someone who has children you know that your children are gonna go there in the country schools you know I think I think that wow I think guy is teaching Harvard just says send them to trade school the universities I think the universities I think you can make a reasonable case that the universities do more harm than good now I hate to say that you
