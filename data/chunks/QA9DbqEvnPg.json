three two one boom and we're live what's happening all right and I am just stoked to be here I'm stoked to have you here man it's a pleasure to meet you I love your show thank you it's fun it's a fun fucking car show it really is man it is I tell people I might be the smartest guy in the world I figured out how to drink beer and play the cars gay for him yeah but it's like it's a fun show it's like you not taking yourself too seriously having a good time you know you're buying and selling awesome cars well yeah for sure it's uh it was a dream of mine to get it done it took 8 years to get it sold but here we are now did it really yeah I started this I started pitching the show in 2004 we didn't start till 2008 our 2012 what were you doing before that before television our before gas monkey yeah I kinda had two stages in life I was a firefighter police officer a medic before I was old enough to drink I mean I'm talking 19 years old carrying a gun probably not the smartest thing to let me do and then I let you ever grow when you're 19 I had a badge I was a cop literally I was a police officer and so by the time I was 20 I was it's also a firefighter and so I did that for a while and then moved into printing and advertising and then sold that and got into this so was it just like something you just always into cars and that's what led you to the show you know how would I tell the story diplomatically realistically I was watching the shows that were on TV at the time I'm always been a car nut and a motorcycle guy and what have you and I realized one night that my kids are never in the room watching it and my wife's not in the room watching it you know and the shows that were on were a little bit too much bravado and and I'm a tough guy and you know so I dug it and all my buddies dug it but the wives and stuff and I was like Kylie they're missing a big chunk of the market here if you could tone down that part of it a little bit and still have a cool brand and still be a cool guy you know and get the moms and the kids in the room hopefully it's a lot more successful and so that's that was kind of where the idea came from and I just went out and started it that's interesting so the mark getting side of you kicked in uh-huh so the marketing side of you went I think there's another way to do this yeah I mean I'm still a tattooed guy with some jewelry but you know I got a pitbull I got a poodle on a leash not a pitbull on a chain well the show it doesn't seem compromised that's what's interesting about it because it seems like a kind of a guy show I never thought about that why well the way I approached it was just like when I was a kid and my dad had a garage it not a you know not open for public garage but he had place that we kept his car and the neighbors would come over and they'd tinkerin they drink beer and that's what car guys to do so we kind of took that approach of that's what gas monkey does we just drink some beer and play some cars and goof around it's just like Saturday afternoon but all week long did you have any of a background in automobile knowledge did you know like how to fix things or did you yeah I've never really been the full fabricator you know I understand everything how it works but I'm probably more of a business guy so I was able to go out and hire good guys to do the fabricating stuff and we've got a great team but I did have the car knowledge and I and I had you know I had the eyeball for what was good and keeping up with what was gonna be happening and things like that and that's kind of my strong suit is saying okay Porsches are fixed to be popular so we're gonna get into 356s or Broncos like the one you drove it is you know or what have you and I'm keep my eye on the market that's interested so you're but you still do keep your eye on the market I saw that 68 that you have outside the 68 Chevelle yeah 68 68 convertible goddamn that's a nice car it's a good it's probably the best one I've ever seen I mean from an original standpoint yeah it's mint I mean it's got a little scuff saw it's it's driven you know but it's it's in perfect condition it doesn't have any dents or anything wrong with it it's literally a little old lady from Pasadena I mean the lady bought it brand new and she passed away a couple years ago and I bought it from her grandson wow what a cliche 50 mm original miles and never been wrecked old lady from Pasadena is a cliche I know right it was technically Pomona but you know saved Wow yeah that car those I mean I've said this on the show a million times I'm a giant fan of like the time period of 1965 to somewhere around like 71 they fell apart yeah you know like you still get a 71 Challenger 71 Barracuda is still pretty sweet for sure but then you get into like 72 73 they had to start putting the big bumpers aren't there with didn't you got the gas crunch and then got four cylinders and it was a bad time in the late 70s for sure it was a bad time but it's a good time now it's a really interesting really interesting time now for muscle cars it's the race is so crazy that they're putting out street-legal cars you could buy from a dealer with 700-plus horsepower and almost every dealer has one now oh yeah for sure I mean I've got a demon myself that's great horse but it's fucking crazy you know the new gt500 is out that's gonna have over 700 horsepower you know you have the the Camaro l what is it one le it's that no what was it LT one one le no what what the fuck is the niche something like the L 1 1 le Co that's a zero one one le which is 650 horsepower and then the new zr1 that's 750 horsepower this is preposterous oh it's it's uh I think it could be a little dangerous you know what everybody out there thinking I could drive a 700 horsepower car because it's it's completely different than you know a normal one well did you see the video of the guy from one of the head guys at GM who took it on track like one of the first days they were released in the car and he spun out on the first turn slammed into the wall well I can't say much I've wrecked a brand new Hellcat the other day racing it would work digitally oh no I went to Woodward Dream Cruise that they had a little celebrity matchup and I was racing and just lost didn't hit the wall took out the whole side of the car were you on a track or we want a strip it was a street track that they had right there on Woodward Avenue so they put up the blocks and you take off yikes yeah yeah those uh those Hellcats are beautiful but they're not they're not that great at cornering that's still a giant cause a big car yeah Mustang and Camaro gonna do better in the corners yeah the hell can have so much front there's so much out in front I mean it really does remind you more than any of those other cars though of those 1970 cars you know really has that that shape is more I kind of like if you look at a 1969 Camaro and then you look at a 2019 Camaro you like uh I don't see it that's not the same thing but a challenger really does look like that old car well kim Timken disc has killed it I mean that was his whole passion project the whole time he was running dodge and he just absolutely nailed it yeah I know they did they made a great-looking modern muscle car the other ones are just great-looking cars I mean they they are still muscle cars but they don't really think you don't really think about the old days when you see him now they've tried but they didn't get it as good as Dodge now you guys make some fucking great builds too you know you guys have done some really sweet custom builds like you were telling me outside that the longest you do a build for is 25 days we've got it down to about 25 from 32 ish when we started so when you see a car on the show if it's a single episode then we built that car in 25 26 days that's crazy start to finish paint interior everything how do you do it so quick a lot of planning and we've learned over seven years now and 130 of them that you know we've just got our process in and the crew that I have at the shop now is unbelievably phenomenal and there's only six guys doing it there's six guys that do it 25 days we're done that's insane but what about like if you're gonna do a custom suspension or you know aren't more Morrison chassis or something that it just takes some planning so literally what we do is we build the car three times this is what I tell everybody will say okay we're gonna build this 68 Chevelle and so we decide how we're going to build it what kind of parts we're gonna use what kind of suspension wheels motor we we put all that down on paper and then if it works mathematically for the project we want to do then I go find the car then when I find the car we order every single part and we don't start that car until every single thing that was on that list is in-house has been checked and we're ready to go so now all we've got is actual fabrication time and human error and we're ready to go still seems like such a short amount of time and all the builds that I've seen take seven months nine months a year it's just the shops are set up differently it may be one or two guys or maybe they've got kind of you know assembly programs going on or what have you but we get in there like you'll love the one we're building right now we're building a 77 international scout and started with a really nice one orange white stripes plaid interior I mean the whole ball of wax whack the the chassis out from under it put in a full Chris Austin chassis works chassis with only two wheel drive and it's all 2018 Hellcat 8-speed automatic Jesus in it and slammed on the ground but it's still removable top and was a great California truck I've guarantee that oh wow so you made so you lowered it yeah we're coming the hell Scout oh wow that's pretty badass it's gonna be wicked car yeah those Hellcat jassi's Jonathan Ward the same guy who's doing this is who did my Bronco the icon they're doing that with one of the I think it's a super bird and one of the one of those iconic Mopars yep from the late 60s early 70s they're doing a full Hellcat chassis and the whole deal with that oh really they're yeah yeah what company was the first one to really get stupid with these cars I guess it was kind of Corvette with the zr1 with horsepower figures yeah for sure Corvette stepped out there with the zr1 and started cranking it up everybody was caught in production yet you had the resurgence of Shelby yeah there it is there's Jonathan Ward's oh wow look at that thing that's good-looking that is like literally like trying to have a block like a city block on wheels they take around a corner look how long that content a kiss yeah that's gonna be a fresh car yeah badass he does some awesome shit over there too he's doing some well he's doing one I don't think he can talk about I think he's keeping it under wraps but he's got a bunch of cool shit yeah for sure he's you ever been there I have not right down the street I know go visit afterwards we might I don't think I'm gonna fly when's your flight I don't know okay got a couple of Martin hold notice I said they'd say I got a couple art hold because I don't think I make enough money for a plane yet got to talk to disco on that well your private planes that we were saying yeah I don't I mean we're all scrambling for something yeah that's the ultimate scramble the private jet money but that is just so much fucking money that's that seemed it is a little ridiculous yeah but I'd like to have a tricked-out one gas monkey on it little monkey on the tail yeah with a keg in it somewhere oh yeah for sure now when you do these shows and you bargain people down and then they watch the show do people ever get pissed I've had a few and in the first first few years they were just excited you know that we were gonna be doing something with the car and there's always an element of sentiment to it you know it was their dad's or right was their moms or grandma's or whatever and they want to see it go to a good home so you got several different kind of people they don't want you to not do anything if you're gonna fix it up we want to see it you know all kinds of things like that but nowadays it's it's a little more harder for me to get a decent deal because don't even know the success of the show and I show up and they're like I didn't say ten thousand I said thirteen yeah yeah yeah well I would imagine when people see what you sell them for after you fix them up then they get a little upset yeah they can but I mean they don't understand the amount of work and time and money that we put into it most of the cars that we're building on the show now we're putting at least a hundred grand in and sometimes as much as 300 really you know I mean what building everything we're building now this is when the new season comes out in June people gonna be amazed you know we're building this kind of stuff Wow and it's wicked cool are you doing that in 25 days yeah fuck man just put the other good plan and execute it well must be like a thing now because the show that people want to get a gas monkey bill car they do but how would I say this diplomatically if it weren't for employees vendors and customers business would be great we we we don't do a lot for the the customer until we've built it for ourselves and then we sell it to them but as far as coming in off the street we just like building what we want to build honing our skills and then we find a buyer every once in a while I'll have God come in and go look I can this is what I want but I can I won't call you I won't come in there with a new steering wheel you know mmm like it gets that's why a lot of times cars do take seven months or a year because the guy that's having its built is in there every other weekend Oh No maybe we move this over here and paint it purple yeah I get it ya know it does seem like he'll be way better just build it how you like it and then sell it well yeah I mean it's still a business decision I'm trying to build it to where I think it's gonna do the most you know the most money at the end of the day and stay true with what's going on as far as that particular car and what's going on in the marketplace and technology and what-have-you and we do get a lot of calls where people come in okay I want that exact same thing you know and so we'll build another one well sometimes you you do buy cars and then just sell them without doing anything to it right yeah that's what we call our B stories you know we'll buy something bring it in maybe just put some wheels on it or whatever but usually it's just clean it up get it run and sell somebody else to dream because not everybody can afford a fully built car right and or they want to do it themselves so we get them a good project I don't think people realize how much money is involved in a fully built car ridiculous yeah like have you ever seen those rev ology Mustangs I was looking at those last night it's pretty intensive build really really interesting stuff this guy take it's it's essentially not really a Mustang I mean it's kind of licensed by Ford it looks exactly like a Mustang and I was all Mustang parts but he's got everything new it's just brand new like a brand new you know SUV take the kids to soccer yeah except really fast and fun to drive in 1966 you know 65 66 like he's got a GT 350 that's a it's not really a 66 GT 350 every part of it though all the fenders everything's all newly fabricated it's dead we're gonna do that this season to where I'm gonna build a car back to original like a 60 I'm excited do my Stanger forgettable Camaro but if there's this guy's cars to me come the fuck on that is yeah beautiful well we're gonna build one that never existed look how pretty that goddamn thing is he's killing it I want to see what one of those things is like in real life he's even got push-button start you know its senses when you're near the the car so it'll unlock for you but it's the just it seems like it's super high quality build to the look how fucking pretty that is well the trick is is how much work goes into it because yes they do make these parts aftermarket and what-have-you but a lot of times that's not the best stuff in the world so you end up fabricating that and massaging it in and making all the gaps right and whatnot so you can't just expect that you're gonna buy a set a new you know a new front end fenders and hood and everything gonna work out perfect you're gonna always have to massage it and get it right well I've been paying attention to this guy for a while and essentially what he's been doing is honing the process over the last few years and he's got a company now that makes I think it's called Dyna Corp that makes all the pardons they make everything in terms of like the body's body stands yeah and you know he's got his whole process down but you know when you watch him drive the cars it seems like he's I mean it sounds perfect like everything inside of it seems like completely locked down no squeaks or rattles it's really like a modern car for sure and there's a lot of shops that do an amazing job at doing that stuff that's what I like what I don't like I mean I like the way they look if I look like an old like a 67 gt500 I like the way they look but if you try to hit the brakes on one of those things or if you try to make a turn with those old tires like everything's fucking that skinny and you know the balance is all wonky yeah 1967 car balance we get a lot of that I've built a few cars for like copper for contests mm-hmm and somebody will win in this car and and then they're like it's this is horrible you know I'm like that's because it's a stock 65 but yeah you know and what have you because you know if you don't realize what you're by and then yeah I can be a disappointing process yeah those old cars man mean we've come a long way it's it's pretty amazing if you go back from you know a 1970 car to a 2019 car and you drive it and you hit the brakes and you do all the numbers like stopping 60 to zero and handling I mean the cars of today are pretty ridiculous it is absolutely amazing the technology it's out and the fact that we can use that technology so much easier I mean you can build these kind of cars or anything you dream up because you can literally do it right here with your you know your Google in your pocket yeah okay I want to do this this and what have you so it ends up being the cars that we're putting out are definitely just like a brand-new car yeah but it's a really interesting time to for resto mods you know because so many people are into that now they realized that they liked the looks of those old cars but they're not really into the way they drove correct everybody's about comfort and bluetooth and you know all that kind of stuff so I'm not really that way I'm a 32 Ford nut and I kind of like cars the way that they more or less came out I mean I'm offered maybe some disc brakes or safety or whatever but I like the squeaking and having to learn how to drive it and figure it out the character of it yeah yeah no transmissions exactly yeah how much longer before the manuals dead I think it's already got the nails in the coffin seems like it but then you know like American cars they'll come out with cars like the GT 350 you can't even get it with an automatic fuck off yeah they won't even sell it to you yeah and they're gonna hold on with that as long as they can but you know you bring competition cars Porsche Ferrari Lambo Mercedes that you know it's you can't get a man manual Wow everybody wants that Nurburgring time you know I want that super fast Nurburgring time and unless you have a double clutch transmission unless you have paddle shifts you're gonna miss a second here a second there and then people are gonna look at it when they it's so ridiculous that people look look at those times yeah because the average Joe it and going out there and doing that I mean the modern cars mean like the zl1 that we were talking about earlier I think they're down to the 1le I think is down to seven minute and real low seconds Nurburgring time which is fucking crazy that's faster than a gt3 RS from a couple of years ago they're sure for a $60,000 car that you could buy at a Chevy dealership yeah probably close to 80 but yeah is it yeah I think it's like 78 okay yeah but they're loaded but nominal car it's bits I agree that that Corvette and probably the demon or two cars that are the most bang for the buck I mean just get it and go the zl1 and/or the zr1 rather is almost too stupid it's almost too ridiculous it's like if you're a regular person and you buy that and you try to take it somewhere - for you to understand the limits of the grip how much gas you can apply for you to have an educated foot yeah for sure I mean I know they first started making those how it was it seven or eight years ago maybe a little longer I had a client help me getting one he brought it back the next day scared to death because I just saw it I'm never driving because that is just stupid yeah I saw a picture one the other day in my Google news feed that someone had bought and wrecked the next day oh yes master I was just reading today somebody sent me a link did you see the episode where we built the f40 look at that fucking car it's fucking weird Lord I'm doing something with that right now that I can't I guess I can imagine everything you see there the styling the the carbon-fiber points the the lift in the front and everything that we all of it but we're doing it with a 72 Riviera boat tail what yeah it's gonna be frickin sick we've already chopped the top brought it down so that it doesn't have that clam mouth and looking you know windshield and so we're taking all of a bunch of our styling cues in art and definitely all of our driving components ideology and we're cramming it into a 72 really how is that fit huh how's that gonna fit um well we're not taking the chassis and putting it over there we're making our own right and we've worked with Chris Austin on it also for use in that transmission that in its suspension independent rear I got a video your faggot fine it's in the 72 Riviera like a million pounds how much does this thing weigh it's a lot but we're clearing all of that out we're working with speed core and we're doing a lot of tops gonna be carbon fiber and so will the hood honk and maybe even the full front clip speed core did a nasty 1970 Mustang for Robert Downey jr. that I just saw online the other day yeah with a supercharged coyote engine in it like a weird color - like a beige like a weird kind of yellowish funky see I like the funky color do you the crazier the better yeah laughs I just love it like our cars gonna be like a weird muted grey with with red and chrome and carbon I mean we're getting pretty crazy with it we're about halfway through so it's a 72 boattail Riviera CV and fun one of those I'm trying to picture that I have I had a Riviere when I was in high school hmm no I didn't have a Skylark so yeah here you go whoa that's a stock one but then it'll turn into the look at that we just started changing yeah so that's a you know a few people have built them into hot rods but Wow if you stay on that video it'll just feed to where it what its gonna look like when it's done oh I see what you did so you have oh wow that's crazy it's gonna be nuts it'll probably be at SEMA this year in bare metal whoa that's a beautiful car don't have wagon wheels on it like that stupid thing though yeah I'm not a fan of those those uh that was the thing for a while that's gonna be free that's pretty badass yeah you don't see those net you never see that car like that's a rare car now we found a one owner with zero hit zero rust I mean the metal on is perfect what are those Australian cars that were in a madman's now whoa damn that is gonna look pretty nasty it's gonna be slammed like that and it's gotta be nasty too we're probably gonna bring him in for around 1,300 horsepower what we're building that one just for sheer shits and giggles of her phone because nobody does that well somebody's gonna want it for sure I hope they have a lot that's like a money pit right now yeah how much does something like that cost to build 350 Wow yeah to build and then how much would you like to make what you want to try to I always try to make at least 20% I mean it's kind of a goal right but uh that's reasonable yeah especially considering all the creative time and putting it together and yeah we do everything in-house I mean it's set for interior we're doing every single thing in the house now I mean we've come a long way since the beginning when you have that kind of horsepower what kind of rubber you're gonna have on that thing Oh it'll have 15 inches on each side all right it'll have I think we went with twenty fours and 22s and super super wide Wow yeah you kind of have to write and even then it's probably gonna spin out everywhere now because we're using all the technology we're using the independent suspension we're using all the sensors all the the stuff that's in that brand-new vet so we're exacting control as well Wow how do you adapt that over to an old car like that you just go through the systems we've got a guy working for us now that helped us run our standalone Hellcat that they said couldn't be done when we were built the shark cat and so he just gets the whole thing and starts eliminating sensors or bad inger you know and we end up with all the same technology so the sensors understand when a wheel spinning and then they compensate with brakes or horsepower brakes you know though you know get your stupid the stupid light you know you can't do that so we'll be able to turn it all on and off just like a brand-new car Oh so will you have different modes like a race mode Street mode like that yeah but what a lot of people try to do that I can't stand is they'll take the something with that idea no okay I'm just gonna pull the body off and cram this under there and weld it together and hope it works and we make everything adapt to the old car still work though the way it's supposed to in a brand new car yeah I've seen you know there's there's a guy online that has on Instagram gt500 super SWAT he took an old gt500 body and put it on gt500 from a modern chassis and piece it together like that but I was always thinking with it with a setup like that you probably can't have airbags right you can't there's actually ways to add it into there but you get into the narratives yeah you get into the geometry and the direction of the airbag so beautiful that looks oh yeah but you don't want to play with the R&D of trying to put an airbag into something like that unless you really really know what you're doing because you don't you know refraction of an inch off of being where it needs to be that airbag could do more damage than good it it's weird though because you're dealing with a totally different sized body too so I wonder how he's doing this it's easy it doesn't sound easy but it is is it really have you done that before we haven't but I understand the process and really it's just cut massage move in move out you know because there's a company called mag motors you ever heard of them I don't think I have go to mag motors dot-com they have what they're doing is they're putting a carbon-fiber body on a modern gt500 but they're using a 67 like Eleanor body but they're making it out of carbon fiber so it's that one's gross go to the silver one that white one looks just to hate the body so you really know overplayed how dare you it's just - it's just been done so many times but who cares it's amazing yeah go - yeah that's those are the images but go to get it get it from the side so you get a better look at it that's a fucking beautiful car see to me it's it's weird it looks like it's it's a little too high and it looks like they're worried like I don't know anything about them but to me looking at it's like you need to get it down a little bit you know get a little more actually to get a deeper dish on the wheel well I think what they're doing is trying to use all the geometry yes of the modern car correct so you end up with something looks like it could go four-wheeling a little bit right yeah it's not it's definitely not slammed yeah in terms of looks right yes I mean I'm sure the car runs and drives and performs unbelievably mm-hmm but it's missing a little to me it's missing awesome you know that company classic recreations no I don't think so they do they're doing similar cars like that too but they're doing it you know from the ground up there's a lot of people doing it because it's with technology coming the way that it has it's it's not as hard to do as it used to be mm-hmm it's still too laborious task don't get me wrong but you know you can make all those systems work anything see a guy like you that's a car guy you look at an Eleanor and you look at it like it's played but a person who doesn't see them all the time was not in a car industry you when the last time you saw one of those fucking things on the street shit Jackson there was like five of them for sale that's the thing if you go there but like in fusion Motorsports there Dera down the street here they make they're the only licensed dealers they have some deal with the woman who was the she was the wife of the guy who wrote gone in 60 seconds or / - something like that and so they make C go to fusion Ellen or they make some pretty sick ones but you think there's a played-out personally yeah I'm just not an Elinor car fan I just that is fucking beautiful why do you hate America Richard I do not love that it's just there's hundreds if not thousands of them out there you must hate America no way and I love the most things I've got three of them I sell up including a real 68 Shelby but is it the shape or the color scheme it is the shape I mean to me it's it's such a popular car in the movie that you know too many people did it and now everybody's doing it and you know it's what have you yeah but I mean how many of them are out there in comparison to like say a modern zr1 this problem this gun really as many do you think so oh yeah really yeah there's different companies making tons of them all car people say that they say two cars they think are played out 69 Camaros and these things like everybody does a 69 Camaro and everybody does Elinor yeah and the Dukes Hazzard car oh yeah same thing yeah you know now a badass 69 charger don't get me wrong but painted orange with a flag on top let's play it out you can't do that anymore that flag it's fucking unknown grad is for sure you believe they pulled that show off the air yes cuz the flag that shows off the I thought it showed on like some weird obscure cable Jay pulled it off a TV land that's really up TV land I've wrote a whole thing about it on Instagram how ridiculous it was yeah I don't know if I agree with that I mean it's like trying to erase history or whatever yeah yeah well you live in Dallas though it's a little easier to get by with a confederate flag and towels oh yeah we don't have a bunch of matcha cheese drinkers and what-have-you like we do out here come on yeah yeah I I you know living in Dallas I have to do my business with the people out here in LA and it's you know I'm getting off work before they've had their two chai lattes and walk their dog and showed up to the office like come on guys get up and get to work it's there now get accused of like have you been drinking I'm like yeah it's 7:30 in the night here I've been off for two and a half hours people get upset at you if you've been drinking you know what I'm trying to conduct some of the business calls that we do in the evenings because they haven't gotten to work yet and they asked you if you've actually been drinking sometimes really well sure because they know you from the show but we I'm talking about my agents manager that works and whatever I'm like yeah cuz I've been off since 5 o'clock guys most people have a couple beers and sit around the shop well most people there yeah yeah it's a different world out here so a little bit of a culture shock it is I don't I don't know I mean I like it it's okay but I think if I was gonna move gas-monkey anywhere it would probably be Scottsdale Scottsdale is nice it's freaking cool it's about a million degrees in the summer though you ever get there but it's a dry heat so the sauna it's fucking preposterous we went out so I was in the it was in Phoenix last July and we went outside we just stood there for a second go this is this is ridiculous we should get used to this because this is with global warming's gonna be like in LA in just a few years yeah you guys are gonna either be on fire from the from the volcanoes or global warming or every our sliding into the ocean but I really like Scottsdale fun fact next week they have me planned in the Scottsdale Open and the waste management open there in the celebrity pro-am oh yeah do you golf I absolutely suck at it yeah horribly I've been a member of the same Country Club for about 19 years I probably played about 50 rounds of golf in my life they've got me playing in the pro-am the celebrity thing and and I'm like what we've ever gets teamed up with me is in big trouble you're gonna tighten up before you go you're gonna take some lessons or anything no way man I'm sweet because because the way I look at it is all I'm gonna do then it's like be pissed off that I can't do what the guy told me to do right gonna get much better and then it's like what I tell them on but on top of that is I'm like okay you think you're so good at golf cuz you can shoot 72 you know or whatever well mathematically this is an eighteen shot game right you can figure it out mathematical yeah I mean if you had some insane ability well yeah but you don't have to have insane ability to figure out the mathematics of it so because it's an eighteen shot game guys yeah but no one's ever done that mm-hmm so how is it an eighteen shot game just massive bill Knight is a one punch fight well no it's more like saying that because more fights are one punch fights than ever a golf game is an eighteen shot golf game I'm seeing mathematically propulsion direction in right etcetera and so forth you can get that ball from that spot to that hole every time it's possible with enough power right yeah let's put it in what have you but that's literally like saying every fight is a one-shot fight no way why because a lot of fights are one-shot fights but there's never been a 18-hole game that's played with 18 shots but there are hole in ones so I can use a sea of them it's never happened that was true the human race I think the most they've ever done in an actual real journalist - someone's done - I think somebody bow I'd have to look it up but uh yeah so one shot fight that probably be you fighting me you just hit me and I'd go down there's been quite a few in that I've called one punch in the beginning of the fight BAM someone gets hit and they go down it three or four in the history the Duane Ludwig like six seconds first first punch he threw that probably mean we already talked about working out so yeah you know go down pretty quick I can't believe you've never worked out ever in your life I really have it I mean and just thinking about starting more like just cardio and stuff I've turned fifty in two months so stars puffiness you know I am a little bit it's a weird number right it's a weird number plus I look at my dad and and you know he's 23 years old than me and and I'm like God I got 20 years left holy shit yeah well working out definitely holds off the Grim Reaper a little bit oh yeah keeps your body working better but it takes effort you gotta be willing to do it well like I said I just hope things work out just hire a hot trainer hire a check that's gonna you you'll be motivated or embarrassed you'll be embarrassed looking at me cuz what is wrong with you she would have chicken lifts more than you yeah well I'm sure there's a lot of oh there's a lot of them there's a lot of them around the block yeah well right around the corner is a giant fucking bodybuilding gym for chicks hmm for guys for everybody I mean it's just savages I don't know I I like an athletic build on a girl but I don't know if I wanted to have giant muscles and mmm yeah there's a point I wanted to take bigger crunches than me right yeah there's a there's a point where it gets creepy there's like yeah roll over I'm holding her from behind a little spoon and I'm like oh is that you Joe like veins right like veiny forearms on chicks like something about some about like veiny chest like a girl with a veiny veiny pecs yeah no it's a mistake they're not supposed to have pecs anyway suppose that boobs yeah but they have boobs combined with packs that's where it gets real weird when they have fake boobs but they also have tech muscles now and you can feel the muscles underneath the fake boobs yeah like this don't like water balloon that's floating on top of a sinew yeah just get a little too crazy now that's one thing I do like about California you know the the Southern California little blonde with all the tattoos and you know a little bikini on the beach what have you take out those in Texas though not as many they don't yeah we got them but not as many I mean I'm on Instagram too much this seems like every girl from Texas on Instagram has tattoos all over the place yeah but that's you know there's 20 of them not oh right right yeah out here this thousands there everywhere go to like Venice Beach it's hard to find a girl doesn't have a tattoo that's unique these days that's a real rebel yeah a girl with no piercings and no tattoos it's either rebel or boring yeah probably both she's rebelling against being exciting yes I think the girl bodybuilder though what happens is like people get into something and they forget how weird it is for everybody else so as they get deeper and deeper into it they just want to excel at it and they want to lift more weights and you know they're trying to put more on the squat rack or their deadlift in their neck gets big and it and and I had a girl that worked for it for a long time that was real into she was like this I don't know what competition she does but it was body sculpting and stuff it this girls over there measuring florets of broccoli are to scale yeah that's that's when they fucked up one oh yeah oh yeah once they start measuring their food and Counting their macros like settle down once you're in some gigantic competition cheers Cheers sir yeah yeah fix them break out some tequila for you in a minute break it out man we have cups oh yeah you brought cups to this this guy comes prepared oh you have gas monkey tequila get the fuck out of here you got your own tequila dude can I get a gas monkey t-shirt you have one I brought you all I fucking love that logo get up what went on right now I don't give a fuck look at that whoo whatever look at that Jamie huh palace yeah you guys have like the whole apparel line do we have everything I mean we've got tools we've got a soft bath mat the other day at like HomeGoods or something and I'm like I don't remember approving that is it for sure yours it's a licensed product well that's part of the thing right you guys came up with a cool logo yeah and the monkeys you know he's that lovable character that's also a pain in the ass and kind of in there messing stuff up all the time but you can't shoot him cuz he's just that's what he does yeah and what happened so we did the gas monkey cinnamon tequila this is uh it's cinnamon yeah it's a hundred percent blue agave just swirled with a little bit of cinnamon and nice my kids got a soccer game after this I'm gonna be fucked up good times well salud good way to get through the game yeah for sure mmm that's actually good it's good stuff don't tell Ron white but I think your tequila's better he'll get mad really mad at me he loves tequila we came up with this because you know this is the only tequila ever finds is made in America really because you have to do Jalisco you know real blue ghave tequila is always at your mango from Elise Co you get around that I ship it in and tankers and then I do it here so we're switching built our distributors right are just distillers right now and will be made in Texas so you can't grow it in America you can't grow the agave in America you could but a real tequila just like champagne in France you know a real tequila is always from Jalisco area hmm and what have you how where does that it's like Burgundy right yeah he's from Roberto Berto exactly a part of France but I didn't know that's funny I didn't I guess I guess I kind of knew that I didn't think about that that's weird like this stuff can make anywhere we're literally sold out right now yeah I took you to the troops we went and did a deal with the PX exchanges on all the bases in the world and they wiped me out Wow and so we're we're having to make him right now but completely sold out everywhere that's fuckin great I had to borrow a couple bottles from somebody that was hoarding them though that monkey with the tongue hanging out do you have that on the outside of your garage do you get a bunch of looky-loos if I know where you guys are oh we do it on purpose we've got a little spot where people come by and see the cars we got a building there and then we've got a Merck shop and inside the merch shop you can go in the back and there's like a party area where you can have a I don't sell beer or alcohol but you know gas monkey energy drink or water and it'll be like you're in the experience and Wow so you let people just come on down and say hi ya know I mean everybody can come by there's probably we're on earth cam right now I'll pull up earth cam gas monkey we can see how many people are there do you get stalked by weirdos because of the TV show oh yeah you know what really freaking sucks in Texas this is no bullshit I didn't find this out until we got stars what really sucks um somebody comes on my property they're weird and I got a telling to leave you know where they're aggressive or whatever and I get the hell off the property get out of here beat it for the next 24 hours I'm responsible for them if they like if they believe and get run over at the corner or whatever because I made them leave I forced them from the property they're my responsibility what it fucking sucks so if a guy shows up drunk and you say hey man you gotta get the fuck out of here and the guy leaves and gets in a car accident he could say hey they made me leave Wow yeah you know so the drunk ones I'll put them in an uber but I'm talking about just the crazy ones you know we've got a homeless problem in Dallas it's starting to get to be about as big as you guys are having here and they'll wonder on your property and we're like hey you got to beat it and then if they go down the street gets hit yeah you're responsible for their medical bills can be it's a stupid frickin law on a plant hospitality what's I don't because I don't sell alcohol but it's because I'm a business and I've made them leave they came to see me and I made them leave they didn't leave on their own accord so we have to call the cops to get them to carry those people out that's so weird I went to Jay Leno's Garage and he's telling me that uh you know Jay Leno's Garage is not Jalen's garage it's Jay Leno's 11 garages oh I know I've been there I know so it's pretty crazy I mean I knew that guy was a car nut but I didn't know the magnitude until you go and you see these eleven warehouse buildings just full full cars he's got a real problem no he's got a great problem he's got a great problem I'm only up to two buildings I needed to start adding buildings how many cars do you personally own it's hard to answer because I own gas monkey and so we have inventory I tell everybody I usually keep between 50 and 60 cars that are yours that are sort of for sale you know so there's some things along yes man I need that car anyway there's about ten that I won't sell period what won't you so I won't sell my Thomas Crown Affair Mustang my Shelby what is that here 68 you could probably find a picture of that on the net but it's a it's a remake of the one they used in Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Bronson when he's on the island and it's got all the I never saw it it's all lifted on being ever seen a Pierce Bronson movie dude Thomas Crown Affair is a remake of another Thomas Crown Affair movie and the Mustangs just wicked cool so I had a client a friend of mine had me build it for him good friend and I wanted the car of course I couldn't afford it then we didn't even have the TV show yet and so I built in this perfect rendition 68 Shelby convertible Mustang we have good riches on it raised it all up I mean it's perfect California Cruiser and then when I got the show I called him up and I go hey can I borrow the car buddy because I want stuff sitting around the shop that that I built I don't want other people's stuff here oh yeah man just send the truck down to pick it up this is three years later I send the truck down it gets back the car's got 42 miles on it it's been sitting there doing nothing in his garage he's down in New Orleans so it's got some of that haze and shit from the salt air and back the gasses there it is gasps it's bad wow that is really hot it looks like you're going for wheeling in that fucking thing what is going on with the tire on the trunk that's the spare I know but that's an odd placement that's just how it was in the movie really yeah Wow and godly am i fat there or what is that you I don't know I don't know that's not the one I you somebody met that's that's another guy's car some fucking it's just not quite right mine is more absolutely perfect to the movie that's somebody else's rendition of it but anyways I call my buddy I go let me borrow the car etc kids say with 42 miles on it after three years it doesn't run the gas is bad carburetors all fucked off and of course I call about go you're a really shitty car owner I said this thing is freakin bad as it looked what you've done to it well he has a considerable amount of money so the next day the title shows up in the mail and he goes you're right I'm a shitty car owner cheers Jesus Christ it helps to have a close friends that have a lot of cash well you must like obviously like you too yeah we're real difference is easy he's a bad motherfucker well I want to see what it actually looks like without the fat guy driving no disrespect fat guy yeah because I could see where you know if you don't work out at all how do you stay thin cuz you're a thin guy I guess metabolism I do eat right I don't eat fast food but you drive I don't do sodas I haven't done sodas or anything like that in two decades but how often you drink every day doesn't that cancel out all the no sodas I don't know I mean maybe says it doesn't have as much sugar but I think you must have like a beer drinkers metabolism you just you know how to do it yeah it's it takes a lot of practice to get it to this point your body's ready I'm ready for a fuck to do it's like a marathon runner like everybody can't run you know fucking 15 miles a day but someone who runs 50 miles a day can do it yeah there's that's one thing was just monotonous to me running my my wife's a runner and I'm like that's just silly like why do you want to get out and go run 20 miles I don't run 20 miles but I run hills I run four fours the most I run but I run like pre steep hills there's your car is that it the one up that's the same fat guy right there Jamie I know it's there's a couple versions of it and a lot of websites are Pumbaa drops down to the one right below that where you cursor out there is that's the real one is that one right there yeah that's the it's not zero and yeah there's a nice car it's so much fun I got a banging stupid sound system in it so you know the rebar the whole deal it'd be a great car to cruise around in California what kind of engines you put in that thing just typical small-block it's a GT 350 so it's got a small block 302 and what have you it's it's pretty fun time it gets a lot of heads and then we were talking about cars I wouldn't say I got that I got a 52 Fleetline that was the first car we ever built as gas monkey garage what does a Fleetline I don't even know what that is it's a you can type in 52 Fleetline gas monkey it's a the fastback version of of at 52 Chevy it kind of has the sloped back some people call it a torpedo back look at that thing yeah not that one the picture on the far corner yeah that's us and it's all patinaed out and kind of you know low so you kept it like that yeah that was the original body we chopped it though and it's got people love that like the original patina doubt body like icon does that they call them derelict that's a good picture of a car yeah yeah yeah yeah derelict yeah and then we got a what else we have I got a my first Ferrari I ever bought I won't sell that as far as the first one I ever bought for me what is it 599 GTB 2009 oh that's a nice car super good car and you know then I had a couple other fries but I'd probably sell those but that one first one yeah I just probably never will and just because it's like a benchmark like you I'm a big proponent and believer in forcing yourself you know and so yourself it to want more to do more to give yourself motivation a lot of people just save and save and save and I'm more like okay I'm gonna do something that I probably shouldn't do right now so that I don't know I work hard to make sure I don't give it up I'm with you yeah that's me I talk my friends into that shit I talked my friend Tony into buying a Corvette when he can't afford it yeah talk my friend Brendan about a gt3 RS yeah so it's the same thing I mean I bought the car when I probably shouldn't but the show was going and I was like this will make me wear car though so ya know it sits in the corner when I'm doing it I get up in the morning I look at it I got it I got to make sure that I can afford that so let's go do it dude I believe in that wholeheartedly and people say you're ridiculous and I go yeah exactly well when I was young I was a when I first got into printing and advertising a shit I could barely make rent I think I was buying my suits at you know a resale shop but I would go to Neiman's and look around and you know and and think about what I was gonna buy it just putting the motivation in my head you know I guess there's a big movement now with making your imagination board or whatever well those people are assholes yeah my shit just wanted real in your head that I got that vision board yeah I get it if you're 20 and you're doing that you don't know any better yeah my vision boards you know the old poster the rock band with Leidner you know it looks like a great mission yeah that's the real vision board I yeah I'm a big believer in doing this is what I say to someone who can buy if you can actually buy a Ferrari I'm like listen man if you don't who will if you're a 18 year old kid and you got no money and you said man find enough buyer to buy a Ferrari oh god I'd be so happy I'd buy that thing well you should do it if you can yeah I can you should do it and is it is it too much money yeah it's definitely too much money that's part of the whole part point of the whole thing correct yeah it's it's actually I use it more as motivation yes I know can't I afford this and if you if tariffs have no you go well then I'm going to I'm going to afford it yeah figure it out exactly I feel that way about everything so do I that's been my mantra forever it's people like oh you know you got lucky you did this I work my fucking ass off my whole life yeah well you definitely got lucky didn't get hit by a meteor you got lucky for a lot of things well yeah yeah lucky you didn't get home invaded you got a lot a lot of luck yeah out of luck but I'll tell you your your your past guest mr. Eli must there he can't ruin it for us because now we actually have a possibility of getting in a car wreck in space yeah you could get in a car wreck in space because that cars just floating around out there what if that car slams into a fucking alien spaceship that's coming to save us and Elon must just frivolously shot that fucking thing into orbit he did he just shot it up there and they'd let him with a robot sitting in the front seat you know we were joking around about like what if that guy in the front seat is actually a guy who fucked his wife and he decided to kill that guy and stick him in a fucking spacesuit shoot him in orbit see I don't get that why do you want to be mad at the guy if he does that you got to be mad at your wife I agree I'm with you on that I'm with you on that so could it be I wouldn't be mad if I came home and Adu was banging my wife I would listen bro you gotta go depends on what he looks like - I mean if he's like Aquaman I feel to her I tell her I get it yeah sometimes you got to do that yeah but exactly yeah oh we're going again we're going again bro this doesn't this devil sneak up on you again snuck up on since the eighties it's so good though it is good it's smooth I like the cinnamon too yeah yeah yeah and it's a party drink for a real tequila enthusiast though is that like sacrilege is that like an electric Mustang oh yeah but that's what the monkey is always done yeah you know it's like playing the golf thing I decided to launch gas monkey golf apparel why and so I'll be wearing my golf shirt out there and it's it's pretty crazy it's got a skull and all kinds of crap or whatever but uh well I'm pushing the envelope as the monkey is our tagline is snapping tease and filling holes now when you bring that to the Country Club do people say sir that attire is unforgiveable here oh yeah for sure I've been thrown Country Club plenty of time really and I've bought a lot of golf carts because I've crashed them because I thought was fun and that thrown out of your own Country Club a bunch of times really what just raise it to myself you know I'm the it almost like the old Ronnie day Germany peace you know it's like sir you can't do that in here it's like ah I'm gonna do it twice Caddyshack all-time exactly yeah now what did they say to you just you know they usually just take me home cuz you know live on the course so they'll drive me down there so you you have a house on the course I did it I live downtown in Dallas now but the worst one was I decided to drive my Harley home on the golf course 195s nah I stayed to the cart path I'm not a complete asshole but I did driving home about 1:30 or 2:00 in the morning in my house is probably the farthest house from the clubhouse and that thing is freaking loud when you're in that you know this trench of a golf course right the cops were waiting on me when I got on my hands but thank God they were in the cops I was like you can't do anything I'm going inside fake golf course cops yeah yeah you know the community cops community cops that's adorable I had a good one for you actually got arrested at this country club well at my house for I wouldn't say arrested cuz they lit up let me go but they did come cuff me and put me away the we're coming home from a Christmas Extravaganza which I do with my buddies every year right before Christmas we get a big garden pile in and we go Christmas shopping for our families and what have you coming up I'm loaded I supposedly threw a burrito from like Taco Bell or something and hit the guard so there's four three or four my buddies we get to my house we pig out on shitty Taco Bell food you know until everybody passes out and the next thing I know the cops lights are are banging on the door get out here I'm I come to the door gonna tell you I you know you know after you've been drinking you do a bunch of my food you're fucking gone and so long story short they said well you're gonna be arrested for assault if you look at and say you're sorry to this guy assault with a burrito correct right and by the and so if you charge a man with a salt because he throws a burrito at you you should you should turn in your card but it we watch the tape it was not like throwing that it's not like I've barreled him with a baseball right here I like chunked it to him to eat but he didn't see it coming and so I like slapped even fell down so they they cuffed me they take me down to the guardhouse yeah they put me the cop car cuff a cop no these are real it's a real cop yeah he filed a report and this is how stupid it gets shame I fit I'm so freakin loaded right and I get there and the burritos still on the ground like it's evidence or some shit and they're telling me I gotta apologize to this guy and all I can focus on is there's a perfectly good fuckin burrito right here I'm gonna eat this burrito so sit down and literally start eating the burrito oh god you're like please just tell me you're sorry so you go back home okay okay so I tell him I'm sorry I'm still eating a burrito and they just left me there like a mile from my house at the guard shack do you see the guy since then oh gosh now I was like dude that was perfectly I mean back this was in the days before the sprinters we're so popular so it was like a stretch limo which is you know you just really don't ride it anymore and I was like that's a hell of a shot I came out of the back window 120 inches up to the front hit the guy square the fucking chest I should get a medal for that assault that's kind of might be a plus in here assault with a burrito is probably the first time we've had that in here and you're a little podcast room I definitely think it's the first time it seems like you just be able to say hey I just threw it to you because I was drunk I thought you were hungry that's really what it was there's well I mean you can hear it on the video going hey and it was pretty ridiculous the guy got his man card you ain't for sure yeah what someone calls assault like how dare you some people get beaten to a pulp and you called a Taco Bell burrito flying your way that thing cost a dollar ninety-nine dude and it's barely meat we were going over like how much of like there's a ruling on how much meat it actually has to be where you can call it a beef burrito but there's fillers in that shit like what is the filler it was like silicone or something like that but it's something ridiculous like 30 four percent of it is not actually meat well that's why I mean that was ten years ago yeah I just don't eat fast 80 percent for the Internet yeah it just they could pretend it's me well the cool thing Taco Bell now starting to open all their ones up with bars inside there why yes well that's good for business you know get people more drunks I don't care what the food tastes exactly get them all tanked up feed them some burritos and send them on their way I haven't eaten Taco Bell in decades it's been since then you know it's wow I've some real legit Matt because we're in LA you're in Texas but there's legit Mexican places near you I'm sure oh yeah but like there's legit taquerias here where you know you go in there Mexican soap operas are playing nobody speaks seeing no jealous you got a point to shit and say thing you gotta roll your R's lengua language quesadilla yeah you gotta speak the lingo see I can't do the linguist stuff that that's the tongue right yeah I can't shit don't ever have it know I'm tried everything I mean man you gotta try elk tongue tacos I just why for they're fucking delicious so good it's it's the most one of the most tender meats you could ever have like the most tender pot roast ever really it's amazing if I never get a chance there's a place right here on Canoga like maybe a few miles away from here how good is that place Jamie when I come to California I'm not trying to get some elk tongue I promise you well elk tongue is in the freezer but the cow tongue is what they have out here yeah count that elk tongue is mine but uh language Cassidy is you know you know fuck about lengua taco now and I don't do the whatever that milk drink is what do they call it horchata yeah now what's hot is rough cuz you know there's no fucking safety standards with that no one knows what's in there yeah it's like really shitty eggnog and eggnog is shitty it's at least six percent cheese - for sure right depending on who's working there yeah and how disgruntled yeah do you do cardio sada yeah yeah yeah yeah I've got a I've got a couple of bars and restaurants down in Texas and so we sell a lot of tex-mex fusion tex-mex is a different kind of flavor it's a thing yeah like people that don't know what queso is you know like queso in Texas it's like a staple correct yeah out here no one knows the fuck queso is you say I wanna get some queso and chips like what the fuck are you talking Danny Trejo's does yeah okay so but I feel like a real good legit at Lotus and I would the corn with on the mayonnaise and the sour cream in there yeah I could get down on some of that for sure Texas is a different fucking country it really is well where I'm at now in Dallas literally I can go to the corner gas station and there's a lady there just saw in the the corn off the cob and the Styrofoam cup and squirts all the crap in there and yeah I can make myself sick on that stuff yeah yeah this I wonder what Tex why tex-mex is so much different because there's no California Mac's right but tex-mex is a y'all would never allow that word to be said anyway California max what doesn't we probably just pissed off 72,000 people that's just a regular podcast behind he said California max try ordering lat is Mexico asshole we stole it we stole it from the Mexicans exactly yeah what do you think about this wall bullshit open it up pull it all those poor people in here give them jobs I don't give a fuck tax it yeah III mean I don't want criminals I don't want criminals coming through how about we filter out gang members and criminals just I wish there was a way to tell there was a way that say there's not I wish there was a way to tell whether someone's a piece of shit in a criminal I wish there was and or someone's just poor because there's a lot of like for sure both sides are right this is how I look in it for sure the people that don't want criminals coming in here or right for sure the people that want border control to keep out gang members and drug dealers and evil people they're right 100% look I'm I'm a fucking American taxpayer I have a family I fucking salute right I I believe in the law I believe in all those things but also my grandparents were immigrants all of them everybody that I that is related to me came over from Europe they all came over from Italy and Ireland all of them they all came over because their life sucked they want a better place if someone walks here from Guatemala they don't walk here because they're lazy yeah they walk here because they want a better life this America is made for it so I say little man I say let him into but I wish there was a better way to screen out the cunts if there was a better way to screen out the real shitty human beings to stop that would be that would be ideal we need a cunt screener a cunt screener is the way to go tag that right doesn't exist right now if any of my people are listening make sure you buy that diet that's the whole thing that all these fucking government workers aren't getting paid right now because of a wall oh Jesus and there's a billionaire you know Donald you believe in the wall that much take 5 billion out of your fucking account shove those shekels towards the billion less do you have anything they say he's got three but it's all paper I think right it's Alex's like smug ones and zeroes it's like his hair but you know what we elected him so we gotta deal with it yeah yeah and in our case he was the better choice oh he was a better choice of this is why he's the better choice to realize that our system is completely hosed like that this guy could get in there and build that wall lock her up and everybody's like check it's it's it's a good it's a good example of how our system is the best best system in the world for sure this whole experiment and self-government is the best on the planet Earth but without a doubt but this guy it's not his fault that is who he is but he exploited it he showed everybody yeah he showed everybody the holes in this fucking bumpy system I know but it's he's a reality storm and gonna be President one day you could you and me that's right that's the ticket if Logan Rawlings ticket we we could win and I'm not bullshitting you know we could win I could do that dude they did some fucking Vegas odds and they found out that I have better chances of winning than a lot of people that would be freaking rad yeah there's like a whole like list of people who I had better I want to see you're just like throwing them out I got this but you know I mean no one's gonna yeah the most fun in that I'm having right this second is not even in this room so I'm managing my PR person her back there is great waiting on me to fuck up on talking about policy I don't have one of those I don't know my manager is awesome and my PR person is non-existent so let's get round three going let's

heartbeat chorus mine I bought my dad was actually mad they said my parents told me that I couldn't get it because they said they couldn't afford the insurance and everything and they didn't know I was always hustling and doing stuff and what have you so I just showed up in at home one day with it and they were like we told you I said I paid cash and I paid for a years where the insurance up front my dad's like where the fuck did you get that money because how much money you got so take him to a room I show you my shoebox and he's like which is that's more than I make what were you doing to make that money oh dude I was I was a hustler back then selling car stereos out of my truck you know something anything anybody would buy raking leaves mowing yards I mean that's kind of a geeky kid at the time a little bit on the small side so I had a lot of free time I wasn't exactly banging the cheerleaders or anything so I knew I just always kind of was a hustler I wanted to make some money and how to respect that he did he did he was he was actually very impressed he's like shy because he was we don't have that much in our family bank account Wow you know and I was like well that you know and but my dad was is a phenomenal dude worked three years you talk about a good dad you know your dad and so my but a good I mean my mom left when I was two ditched my dad with me at two and my sister at six or so and you know there's the seventies so you would think that uh had to be like that I'm gonna smoke this weed and drive away but instead he buckled down got got two jobs and worked he worked two jobs pretty much my whole life and provided for us and we didn't definitely didn't have much but we had a roof that we had food and shoe he's still in contact with your mom now they're not really you know but my mom she lives down in Florida I'm sure she's whatever she is but yeah she's a little too much for me yeah the exact opposite story oh yeah yeah my mom left my dad when I was five and I haven't even spoken a word my dad when I talked from seven years old on no kid yeah well I've actually I've kept up with my mom and we talked about every two or three years they reminds me of why I don't talk to her anymore so you know good well I'm sure if I met my dad would be the same thing because I have a stepdad he's a great guy I got real lucky yeah I had a stepmom and it didn't turn out super great but she did teach me a little bit about math and you know how to how to run books cuz she was basically a thief at least learned from the exponent one stepmom that's right until I moved out of until I was out of high school yeah then my dad went on to marry like a series of super ly freaking just effed-up individuals he just started running through and I was like dad sorry any of them yeah and about people to get married like five six seven times I respect that this is what I respect I respect people that keep fucking swinging yeah even though you go down and the fifth you know you get back up and you go down the six to go down the seventh they're just like still party you know my dad was like that it was like come on out I'm getting married you know he had one wife that one time I get there for like family Christmas on neither Christmas Eve or whatever it's like going to the dad's house with the young kids and what-have-you and we get there and she's all doped up on and you know whatever pills were popular at the time and she's like hey come on yeah before throat when she's crawling around the floor and trying to take off her clothes the whole family sit there like what the hell is this dad and so now he's uh he's in an Alzheimer's home but but uh yeah that's the part about that scary about turning 50 but he's like in there nail in all these chicks he's like making out with some girl with a nasal cannula and carrying her oxygen bottle and he's convinced that they've been married for a few I have a bit of my act about the outbreak of STDs and zhang's it's out of control viagra oh it's not only just that these people I mean I mean my dad has really advanced Alzheimer's and he knows that he misses his Mustang I took all his bicycles away and I need to get laid that's it I mean and he's in there just running around we got called my sister and I take care of my dad in that manner and so we get called to the home almost like being called the principal's office as a parent and they're like your dad's literally in here fucking everybody [Laughter] literally had the feeling of getting jinked in there to the to the principal's office like your kids fuck up your dad's fucking but you have to be proud what is here what are you here that's my point that's what I say about him in my acts like come on man how do you want these people died out what they're hard to stop with they're playing bingo yeah yeah have a good time just don't let them hurt each other we'll see I mean that I'm in the healthcare business also home health care and you are so I know yeah I've got a lot of different ventures but but what do you in how are you in the home health care business home health care with with my wife we 16 17 years maybe longer so in the state of Texas it's probably the second or third largest home health care but I'm talking a real home health care like you got to get shots you got to get therapy you got it these are our ends that are going in they're not so you go in to bathe grandma but what is your business you so you you hire a bunch of nurses to take care of the litter at home yeah it's prescribed like through Medicare or insurance or whatever to where maybe somebody gets a knee or a shoulder replacement or maybe it's a you know injury or cancer or what have you and so it's a very rewarding business we probably have 3,000 to 3,500 3,018 time that's all the state of Texas that's a man and so it's it's it's a fun business to be and that you're really getting help people but at the same time to see that there's crazy these guys are they're getting after it you go into the nursing home and it's like dan do the 78 year old twos had more ass than I had last week yeah why not why not my thought is why not well I bought my dad you know he's got his room that's kind of like an apartment or whatever and I bought him stripper sheets all right not stripper sheets but a twister twister sheets with the Hobbit red and blue and I hung a board thing up behind his bed I'm like dad if you're getting after you might as well have fun I mean fuck bingo or freaking whatever so when because he has Alzheimer's does he remember when he did so after it I think it said he's just so focused on his he was kind of what would you call him a a constant if it was my dad got some serious-ass my whole life as a teenager I was like goddamn it my dad's like banging everything well yes when your wife leaves you with kids when you're young you just realized okay forget about this long-term shit yeah let's just enjoy the moment yeah but I mean my dad was straight up product of the 60s and 70s you know so he he like put dyes hair blonde in his eyebrows blonde and shit walk around looking like Matthew McConaughey from Dazed and Confused all right all right all right driving his Mustang you know he pick me up from school what kind of one-sided yeah back then it was like a 72 fastback you know red and black with a four-speed and he'd be hammering it and I'm like you know five six years old just I'd fall on the floor because nobody wore a freaking seatbelt back then right and his idea after-school care was the skating rink because he'd near that thing he'd be open till 9:00 so drop us off I'm at the skating rink eating in 99-cent corndog meal and he'd come pick us up usually around 10:00 or 11:00 with some irate skating rink owner sitting there pissed off he was a badass up is a bad I still I mean he's nailing chicks in a freaking nursing home come on [Laughter] it's so weird when you become an adult isn't it oh yeah you know when you think about oh oh round four no we got a drink what for maybe we're all accessor Raymond Rawlings Raymond Miller Rawlings baddest motherfucker that ever lived salut for sure I mean I'll guarantee we got more ass than you and I did this all week I believe it he's freaking probably banging one right now yeah it's like hey what's that noise the back sounds like my son plus the the goal is like or the bonus rather is that they can't get pregnant you got that yeah I mean it's over yeah well I mean that's that's not happening but you can't still get some diseases yes and they do yes they do but the thing is where they get in them well somebody has and then the next thing you know all hundred people in that building have done it right but did they have it already or they getting it from the building now they had it already they had it already so you dealing with herpes are you dealing with like the real weird ones like syphilis and gonorrhea and shit there's syphilis and gonorrhea is like hey you got to treat this where are you getting this oh no it's it's it's prevalent it's everything right but the question is like are they getting it from outside sources maybe maybe I mean who knows yet that unfortunately they just had the baby you know that's been invalid for 20-something years that's crazy somebody doctor 2007-2011 chlamydia infections amongst Americans 65 and over increased by 31% and syphilis by 52% yeah but that the problem with that is 52% right okay let's say there's a hundred cases and then the next year there's a hundred and fifty all right that's 52 percent no that's not big tens of that hundred millions yeah my dad's probably and they're going come on baby I'm gonna buy some chlamydia though I don't like the percent because if there's there's four people and then the next year there's six that's 50% increase I'm saying I don't like numbers like that because you could make oh my god it's an epidemic I want I want I want numbers like human beings yeah well I'm sure it's out there on the web but like I said my dad's probably thinks chlamydia is a flower he's given he's giving this girl I'm gonna get you some chlamydia and we're gonna have a good time yeah there's no condoms in nursing homes you know we got worse 3,000 reported cases of chlamydia among people 45 and older okay but I'm 45 and older that's normal 45 and older people are walking around meeting new people in thei 43,000 seems like a very low number super low that's what I'm saying that's why I don't like these percentage numbers gonorrhea had C from doing this podcast all these years I understand when people can make things seem greater than they really are go back to that James do you have your AARP card someone set one to us to me an ordinary to the the comedy store but I think that was some asshole put down the sounds well yeah primary and secondary syphilis 5650 cases were reported in this age group it was 45 the thing about 45 and older is 45 year old people in 2019 it's not like 45 year old people in the 60s a little these animals are out there fucking hitting the gym and doing squats and flying a tile and they're probably getting it from the sweat on the gym bitch they could get staff yeah I know a lady who almost died from staff from the gym she ignored she had some weird rash on her leg and no one told her that it was a staph infection and she she went into shock and had fucking seizures geez some staff and she's 36 37 she's fucking she's my wife's friend that's crazy art shit yeah I want that dark dark staff from a gym I don't know what that's why I don't go to gym I'd sweat tiller by no staff you got getting it you go to go to the gym dress like a superhero you gotta work tights [Laughter] zero there spray and all that all the chemicals everywhere yeah like - guns - spray guns in each hand of alcohol Shh everything no I like the spray gun with alcohol but it's one lives Aquila and one did do some fucking chin-ups one of the mouths yeah I've got staph twice from jiu-jitsu oh yeah yeah ringworm three times at least staff twice and they'd be wearing once it's rough ringworms okay but ringworm is basically athlete's foot nose yeah more or less yeah you know you piss on your feet to make athlete's foot go away yes yeah girls go what cuz girls can't aim with their piss no the kid I can help him girl mom this new padded I'm just coming up with this gas monkey funnel remember the fundal thing that that they came up with this you know yeah there is a thing that girls can use they stuff in there that they can pee standing up I just think that's probably not very sanitary well urine is not really unsanitary it's not really that bad it's not not a dangerous thing pooping it's not like Sheldon shower maybe they haven't well I wouldn't be scared of it not scared of piss their coat miss Rogan this is dope H illegit oh this is the thing about jiu-jitsu you're so used to dudes sweating on you like cuz you're always like yeah my sweating like there was one time this is one time that I was I was rolling with a friend of mine and he got on top of me mounted me and he was sweating in my fucking face like his chest sweat was dripping in my face and we were laughing about it I was like dude what the fuck you're sweating in my mouth basically this is starting to get weird well it's just part of like learning how to kill people and deal with the reality of training we run for Texas we just use guns no that's not true there's a lot of jujitsu schools in tech I'm looking up stats on the STD thing for older people and this has an article I found that only 5% of adults are using Medicare to take the STD test so I could be like suck it up I was in Vietnam yeah come on it's just a rash yeah I mean the thing is like who's trying to stop these people why stop those people they're gonna die let them get ass drop them I'd be going in there and passing out all kinds of Lube and toys and what after yeah meth no I wouldn't do that why not I don't know man try it if you're gonna try math you try when you 90 yeah that's an easy way out well it's not even a way out it's just a way forward well no I we gave these ladies and my family weed for the first time when they turn 88 years old they're never done anything to begin some brownies Wow and we told don't don't eat all the brownies at once just eat a little bit wait an hour like I feel Beauvoir they're like well we're trying it we don't feel anything I don't feel anything we don't feel anything next thing you know it's like only an hour later and they've hit the whole pan now they think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread like just bring brownies yeah yeah Thanksgiving dinner yeah just bring brownies bring brownies and they just like melt with the universe wheat is tricky in Texas though right yeah it's not legal yet it's gonna be right here I got that Elon Musk trouble weed what is that this is a this is what's called a blunt to back on the outside in marijuana on the inside Aniruddha car dropped Tesla stock six percent one day oh my my manager and PR person out there are just literally shitting their pants right now but it's legal what's legal here right yeah there you go mmm I believe in the law it's 100% legal it is a hundred percent who's the dude that Oh Mike Tyson just brought you some of his weed is that how it comes this is the box of death and life right here well Mike Tyson's box of death in life yeah look at that this is how hard Mike Tyson rolls look at the size of these fucking joints he gave me I know the camera's not gonna be able to follow me but I'll be right back ladies and gentlemen look at this shit look at the fucking size oh that's just insane that's dude that's you bro I can't take that I can't take it with you on the plane how do I get on the plane then you just think thinking you'll appear in the seat four seats that's the key I would recommend anything more to mats enough for me yeah he gave me these joints that would make you think about people he fingered in high school and want to fund my Facebook and apologize this is just what is that that's a goddamn cigar of marijuana that's outrageous Mike Tyson has a whole ranch he has a putting this new one he has this uh Tyson ranch he's growing marijuana and he's gonna have a like a resort destination where he's gonna have like fitness class is it like tiptoe through the tulips exactly he's um he's got a place down in Palm Beach where it was it Palm Springs Palm Springs Palm Springs Palm Beaches in Florida Palm Springs California out in the desert they're developing this enormous property where they're gonna grow weed and they're also gonna have this huge place where people can go and have this resort like a weed amusement park yeah literally they're gonna have concerts there like Coachella type events what do they call it the push fest or some shit they're not fucking around the people people behind it have deep pockets and they're going hard because what what people have seen in Colorado and people are starting to see in Washington State now in California is this enormous amount of money involved in marijuana like crazy ridiculous silly profit if you're doing it and you're taxing it and you're doing it responsibly that's the way I look at it it's no different than go to the store to buy a beer you asshole can buy too much beer and do something stupid we've had four shots in an hour on a radio show yeah but I have a driver I have a driver that's good I'm gonna do it responsibly that's right I mean Onan Onan addict I lend company in bars and restaurants you kind of have to yeah it takes the fun out of it because I'm a driver I'm a car guy everything else but yeah but be responsible always be responsible and you know the thing is also if you're a person who likes fun like wait what are you trying to stop fun like if someone's to smoke a little weed have a little tequila drink a couple of beers you should as long as people are being responsible yeah I don't see a drastic difference between alcohol or marijuana as long as you're obeying the laws being responsible I'll pay any taxes yes all right 100% agree I also talked about it this way imagine if all the people in the world were you me and Jamie and if Jamie had decided that he he thought that we criminals and we're not allowed to drink alcohol anymore Jamie's getting installed prohibition in our small community he'll be ridiculous maybe like fuck you man well that's literally like the government telling you you can't do mushrooms or the government telling you you can't smoke weed like it's just a grown man telling other grown men they can't based on what it's not based on what we voted on like if people really knew the information involved in like the safety of marijuana there's a freak you out yeah of course it does does it make you paranoid yeah 100% but does alcohol make you an asshole fuck yes it does oh yeah but do I think that everybody should have all of it CBS rejects soon based on the benefits of medical marijuana well in their defense there's probably a bunch of people our stockholders and there's a lot of decisions that are made that are made by lawyers I just want it just before people get angry about something that CBS decides to do you have to understand the CBS is responsible for the employment of untold thousands of human beings they're gonna have Bud Light ads right next to this they will or whatever yeah they will they will but blood lad blood light ads are not gonna affect anyone's bottom line I don't agree yeah yeah I don't agree but I just want people to understand that part of the problem is that the business aspect of this has not been fully established once it's fully established CBS and all these people are gonna realize it isn't any different than Bud Light it's not any different than anything you can get fucked up on Bud Light if you just drink 20 of them you can have fucked up you could walk into trees what you do it on you know cough medicine or what else anything I mean how many pharmaceutical drugs can you get fucked up on and do we deny that some people have like serious injuries benefit greatly from pain pills no they definitely do the thing about it all all is you got to be honest and let people form their own opinions and part of being honest about about these things is telling them the pros and the cons everything is a pro and a con including hold people banging it out in nursing homes I'm getting chlamydia you know it's not good that the the pro in the car is my dad's a pro banging old ladies a nursing home but the con is he's probably got some stuff on his little wiener down there pass into biological footballs but he's not getting pregnant yeah he's not getting pregnant no one's getting pregnant and listen folks people get colds they get the flu all sorts of weird things happens when people Corral around other people what are we supposed to live like John Travolta and the boy in the plastic bubble and fucking lock ourselves and hermetically sealed chambers and never touch each other again get the fuck out of here that's true just take your penicillin get it off that's what Napoleon did walk it off Gladys yes I think I think you might have given him a thing or two just hit the massingill you'll be good I wonder I wonder who's delivering these venereal diseases it's like that would be fascinating if we found it was like primarily women it was like 78% of women are the original source of the venereal disease well they pulled the Apple down right I don't believe that happened I think there was a bitch-ass man who blamed it on the chick when I heard that Adam and Eve story I was like yeah right maybe Adam was a bitch maybe he blamed it on Eve and he wrote he was the guy who could write so he wrote things down cuz I gave her your blood and do shit oh listen listen he probably ate the Apple first I probably gave it to Eve you know history's went written by the winners this is correct and a lot of women just they let that shit go just like let him talk yeah write down then I ate the Apple fuck you and he's like fuck you yep Adam and Eve I don't see Adam and Eve having that New York accent where they held and get it New York was it there yet I feel like Adam and Eve would talk like British people because any time they have a movie where people talk like old-timey whether it's gladiate or whatever everyone talks with an English accent you ever notice that like if we have to write if we have to there's like the suspension of disbelief like we don't know Latin they're talking Latin who the fuck knows that sounded like right so when when you watching some old-ass movie about people talking lat speak English but they'll speak it with an English accent right they'll only speak proper they always have some weird old-timey way whatever watch the movie otherwise right but you're right but why is that because it's got to make a watchable that's why they ruin stories what two English people is that played out like Eleanor's are played out to him do you know absolutely like two English people they hear that accent every day that's a normal accent but to us it's like oh this is like an old-timey language by Russell Crowe talking like he's from fucking London this is bullshit yeah it is I got a friend of mine big Chris and he likes to say well we invented the English language and now I can't he fucked it up yeah you guys made it so that people don't understand it that's stupid that's not smart we made it better we really did Matt rebuttal to me was oh yeah well somebody from your town still trying to be a rapper in their defense though they will always say to you like yeah but listen you guys respect our language more than you respect yours and it's true like American English is not as respectable as English English because that's why they use those English people to sell like late-night mops and shit right honey did they do fucking nonstick frying pans it's always some man with a proper accent look at this I can just fry these eggs and they slide right onto the plate I'm gonna throw a bag of nickels in there and scratch it up nope not a scratch if that was a guy from Jersey that was selling you that you'd be like look at this asshole trying to lie to me about his bullshit frying pan right and his fuckin shitty mop but something about like English accents get us for sure they have a better they have a more respectable version of our language but our sounds better you could say it easier I understand it they understand us we don't always understand that that was literally just on a phone call with a lady in Europe before I got in here and I couldn't understand a word she was saying the thing is though here's where I'm wrong here's where I'm wrong they understand each other they fucking they'll tell start I was in Belfast Northern Ireland which is you might as well be in the canteen scene in Star Wars these motherfuckers they barely speak English they speak English for sure they understand each other a hundred percent but to me I was talking this guy and he was drunk out of his fucking mind we were drinking dark beer just me and this dude this is like early 2003 early UFC FC in Dublin on all I remember this guys had how to fight any man he was hammered how difficult or am a showman right now he said to him he was making perfect sense all I caught was I'll fight any man this motherfucker might have said that a hundred times I just kept buying drinks hammered with me and some dude from with Belfast we understood like 20 percent of what each others was saying you got to use the the translate thing on your phone it wouldn't work I had fight any man Oh what is this quarter you're saying who you want skip to kill this guy's selling ever to fight me you need to say me you'll be skipping is to kill to the hospital if he put knowledge in a pesticide to see to you I can I'm finished with if you come out and fight video pauses now imagine being hammered post UFC event trying to mingle what the locals were drinking dark beer and whiskey there's maybe 30 people around me that are yelling like that and I'm talking this dude so all the people around me who are you like a drunk no one knew no one knew would anybody next to him saying everybody's loud and hammered and this guy is fucked up and he's telling me this how to fight any man and like okay you go fight him we've we've pulled up this video before that exact guy an old video a long time ago what is this one this is really old you talking about this Oh me tell me about this guy that's hilarious [Laughter] on the background did you hear it yeah oh there's a dam I had a beard back then that's the same guy that's hilarious now that's like pikey language right the first video I pulled up to study was from I think I typed in Belfast or something but here's the thing here's where I'm wrong they fucking understand each other a hundred percent they understand every word they say so wrong I just I'm just not in that environment what you got it and you'll get it it's got a flavor though they have a flavor that we don't have right it's a dark old-world flavor hey listen mate that's a fucking dude who just came over on a boat and he's shooting arrows at people they kept that same language and they're always looking a fight how to fucking fight I'm Reggie I'm sure you get a bunch of that shit I'm a pretty friendly guy so most most of that stuff I don't get the guys that I get are people that want to be like professional fighters okay and they want to just talk about it a little bit they're always very friendly you'd be amazed like people that aspire to be professional fighters are some of the nicest fucking human beings you're ever gonna run across because they've they've figured out their own ego through competition to the point where they're not really they're not they're not worried about like putting out an image they know who they are correct and they're like real friendly like some of the nicest people that I've ever met ever or professional fighters that's a weird thing for fuel to hear but I think that for men there's something about trial through combat and just just just being understanding like what what it's like to overcome like insurmountable obstacles for the average person just make some kamar there's a different kind of human they're more chill they are my hot my hairdresser for 15 years been cutting my hair you probably don't have this problem yes he's a he's a bald haired and he's a fighter and you trust him I wouldn't use over there were those muscles of shit like hacking away with my head I'm like this is not really trustworthy at all yeah there was a video that someone showed me was it you did you show me Jamie some of the the the I didn't even ask you what it was first the that's how drunk we are someone took a phone it had a sound like a hair cutter and and they read it by people's head yeah like they run away and people freaked out on them there's nothing wrong with that they've running up the back of a girl's head it's good practical joke but I mean it'd be way better with a real razor so mean it would be but that's a that's a big deal for people can be cutting off their hair yeah I've always wanted to shave my head at least once in life and I never have it just get a crew-cut you're beautiful man No thank you perfect shaved head you get a nice thick head of hair yeah I know but you know contractor crap they tell you got to keep the same style man continuity really which I kind of call continuity because it's like do these people really believe I just did this in an hour or was it over the course of a few days it's okay well I always tell them like what what do y'all think as an as producers or networks and whatever how bad I think the American public is I mean how unintelligent that you have to do a scene where I just walked in your door and sat down here and put on my headphones and then they flip - you know me over somewhere else going yeah so I walked in the door and put on my headphones it's so insane and it's like it's like the recipe it's like you happen to tell them everything you do and then I set up for the shot and I have to walk out the door they're like well the audience won't know where you came from it's my fucking shop I'm here what do you mean how do you they do or they won't have any idea that we so confused it's insane and I've tried so hard to change the recipe a little bit I understand you have to do certain things but why do you have to tell the audience what they just saw period yeah really not stupid if you make them stupid you can make them stupid you'd never challenge them ever I think that as a society we might be on our way to that what what was that show idiotic yeah because I argued all the time I love my show and I love what we do but I'm like why do I gotta come out of the door put my headphones on and then go so I got there and I put my headphones on was unbelievable especially after I came through the door oh I'm so fucking stupid but they've always done it that way and I think of it it the same way I think about CBS and their medical marijuana ads there's like a bunch of people that are just trying to protect jobs they're just like we're gonna make it easier easier for people to know you can't have anything left to chance with the kind of filter numbers well they think it's such a bad thing that they can't show that commercial but at the same time we're selling boxes they say this will kill you yeah exactly and people are buying them yeah why do you think they still break up shows with commercials wouldn't it be more effective if they didn't do that it's just a monetization problem I'm sure but I think you could get a little more bang for your buck by having this episode bias so insane yes a hundred percent not only that I think they instead of having like two or three ads every you know five minutes or whatever they make it do how about you just have a couple of product placements correct show and have them cost more exactly yeah well you put in the then you got to put it into the recipe so some guy like us it's car guys that are watching the show and holy shit he just bought that Porsche and then it goes commercial looks like I'm getting a beer and I'm gonna sit back down on the couch and in the next five minutes it's been going so I went to LA and I bought a Porsche exactly and the only reason we have to do is you imagine the people are coming in you know from these brakes they just jump it in in the middle of it a night they might be doing that how about make them figure it out correct figure it out bitch well figure behind it they need to get rid of the Nielsen hole bullshit I mean real they're still counting cable boxes and and are they even counting cable boxes and I did anything to have a Nielsen box right so it's not even like a exact there's only like a few thousand or whatever and then they decide what the rating is and it's like are you kidding me because I'll see you my ratings and I'm like I don't know it was more than that so I own a social media company I'm like oh yeah I wonder how they do really know and whether they just accept the fact that even if they don't know the real numbers at least they have a reliable percentage that everyone can agree on the problem is everyone agrees on it they'll set their advertising rates based on that agreement yeah more or less but the the real ideology of it is we have the access because all these devices and everything else to have the real number right like the real real number but everyone have to give it up right like Verizon would have to give it up and then I want to give it to each other and they want to say yeah I think they just need to remap the program and so they can really see how many people there are because right now in the industry people think the viewers are way down and I actually tend to disagree I think they're up just the way that we count them are bad it's definitely not good because I've never been counted never fucking filled out a nielsen thing I've never used the Nielsen box I don't know anybody who has I need to do I yeah I met I meant one boy who'd once it said that his brother was like can you find a picture of a Nielsen box exist like you know that DirecTV has some numbers right they must have some salted oh hell yeah they got numbers down to the way why wouldn't they know even if they're not using it as some sort of a rating system that affects the ratings of a television show you would think that they would want to know how effective their product is if you can measure that why wouldn't you measure that and they've just never changed it they really do need to though it'd be way cool if they did I would be weird be weird if she found out what everybody was watching what if like Keeping Up with the Kardashians like a billion people in episode most of the world is going what the fuck yeah exactly I'm actually the world is still it looks at him because what the fuck yeah but what if most of the work what if you know more like what do you think is like the the biggest disparity has got to be it's got to be satellite and cable right because they don't they're not allowed to measure those the mobile phone thing like mobile phones are they say Netflix like specials like comedy specials they said 40 something percent of people Plus watch them on their phones yeah I mean I've started to watch everything on my iPad my phone I don't really watch TV anymore I watched the UFC on my phone on ESPN Plus I was like wow this is crazy I'm watching live fights on my phone with like a regular connection not not Wi-Fi this is a weird time yeah and remember when we were younger we spent you know thousands of dollars for the giant TV you in the box yeah it had the projectors well the thing about the phone is this kind of selfish it's like personal look if you're watching a movie on your phone that's just you watching that movie yeah yeah you can't like sit next to your wife and watch a movie on your phone no one's gonna deal with that even if you're on a plane that would suck exactly but watching a fight on the phone is like it's way less interesting than watch it on the big screen but you could take it everywhere so eventually they're gonna get that into some large thing like a hologram or some shit that's what I or augmented reality it's not going to be wrong too much longer before they're doing all the AI yeah augmented reality I think is really what's what's interesting to me well it Netflix doing something with that right now that want to know they have out where you can pick the different endings oh yeah yeah sure black mirror show yeah yeah go back to that article Newark is the same an example of one I was gonna say like that so the TVs are there have been known to they would like screen they watch what's on your screen and send that data back to a database based off of like everything that's currently live on TV the same thing happens with audio streams right and Shazam or like there's a couple different companies that do that so they sell your data yeah then so then they'll sell that back to advertisers sort of like the same way what's happening with some of these apps that's how that that's how people found out that companies are tracking you because third-party companies that are selling that data once they have it because they don't they don't need it for everything see the problem with specific piece the problem with this kind of shit with people is that that's not what the agreement was the agreement wasn't that you tell people I'm watching the agreement was I buy a TV from you that was the agreement like when you say oh we're gonna sell the data from the people that are watching your TV like okay well yeah but your cable yeah guarantee is buried in your cable deal yeah we could keep it as a South Park have a bid on that host humancentipad thing when the Terms of Service like no one's reading it but you're agreeing to becoming I haven't seen that episode Joe could be coming everyone good thing so what how's it go I'm sorry like just just agreeing to the terms of service like you don't know what you're doing and like the joke on that was that your agreements you become okay centipede I never saw human centipede either well yeah yeah they're gonna get us in weird ways but they're just trying to find out who's watching what the thing is like should your TV be able to just watch you just be able to like have a line on what you're watching because I know people now that just use Netflix and they don't have anything they'd have an internet connection that's hooked up to their television television connects to netflix automatically it's like one of the native apps yeah but if you're connected to the internet you're getting watched you know is what most people would say I'm so paranoid about it I have a little piece of duct tape on my camera on my iPad good move yeah good move I don't need that on there but the thing is it's like yeah but why you selling data what's the buyer yeah but why are you allowed to just collect data from people it's pretty much in the contract you sign I guess it literally there should be two prices this should be one where you're allowed to collect data you can collect data from me but it cost like 50 bucks more a year and the other one where you know you can't collect my data I have to pay a little bit more money that's like that's kind of happening there are like apps you can use that'll track how many how much you're walking in exchange for letting them letting you turn on that they'll give you stuff right out like whatever you know if it's useful you I don't know what are you talking about like if you walked by McDonald's they can serve you up with McDonald's ad first for sure oh shit yeah well that's the ultimate goal right it's to figure out where you are and target you with something yeah yeah so my friend Adam Greentree was on here and we were talking about he lives in Australia and he lives he got he travels like deep into the outback where it takes her three days to drive in and I said everybody has Toyota trucks because those fucking things never break they don't they don't and so he gets ads all of a sudden out of nowhere on a phone every time he goes to a website that says Toyota trucks he's like what the fuck he goes I didn't Google it doesn't cut cookies well it's it's kind of called cookies but it's not something that came from a search it's something that came from something in his phone is listening we we said the word Toyota trucks it registered it and it added it to his queue of his so many men I just said Katya listening so many messages from people that brought the other day what are the signs messages like you guys mentioned do they think it's real say X and like they started getting served ads for that like I said I just said comitia try to buy stock it's like he's got so much chlamydia we're gonna sell him all the penicillin but it would be smartest my assistant just said just bought stock in Clemente Streeter calm we actually gas monkey actually owns cuts greener calm now well yeah that's a border the border walls of fucking tough questions so it is a certain amount of people are just gonna be Maddie you fucking cooks once go over then suck all those mercs can Dirk's shut about that some people are gonna get they're gonna get there they're gonna get angry I might go down and chasing Latino ladies for sure it's uh you know such a hot hot fucking topic but that's that's also you know if you open yourself up to comments well somebody brought one up the other day that was a you know a general discussion question and it said you know why don't we just do DNA let's say here born we take your fingerprints we take everything else we check y'all out won't we just do the DNA and I get the privacy part of it for later on but at the same time you're solving a lot of problems was very beginning okay this person just came out of here and they've done nothing right so now if they ever do anything we know they're to go shoot him in the back of the head well we certainly could do that but we would have to place a gigantic priority getting the very best people in law enforcement you would have to eliminate all shithead you'd have to pay those cops way more and treat them with the respect that they deserve as people that literally are protecting you from violent criminals that was what I know yeah I mean I'm a huge supporter of cops I've been around cops most of my life because of martial arts I know a lot of cops and this is a weird issue with people where they they fuck the police know if you're saying fuck the police you might as well say fuck the humans if someone does something bad if someone does something bad to someone we don't say fuck all humans if someone bird or someone we say fuck that guy and then you start breaking it down to whatever group you're not a part of so it's a fuck that ex generation guy fuck that Lebanese guy or whatever nationality he is fuck that straight guy or fucker if he's gay and he killed somebody fuck that gay guy but it's just humans we're all individuals no matter what it is well no matter what we're talking about and as soon as you start breaking everybody down into groups like oh fuck these people you can't do that with everybody there just because of what's that and then it just becomes a fight everybody it's you can't do that you can't do that we're all fucking in this thing together correct god damn we're drunk right probably too drunk when I drunk yet you only had one here that weed that's all I needed so I'm probably gonna be in trouble for that did they give you a hard time about that who knows I'm going it's legal in California where I'm at so it's legal exactly you know if you got a man I mean how many people used to go down to Mexico to watch the you know whatever or do whatever I'm a legalist I'm amazed that people are still bringing in weed from Mexico that shows me of a real lack of American ingenuity that's outrageous well the Canadians can screen or com currently redirect you to this podcast [Laughter] the Internet is undefeated I gotta give a shout-out to my people they said that that's amazing people did that that quickly yes you got some rocks automatically directed to cut speeders I hope Discovery Channel doesn't get hit with a wave of protests what channel you want discovery yeah I just discovered that they have a giant Network though right like they have like how many different channels are on the Discovery Network channels I think is like 80 or 90 that's great it might be more than that that's crazy I mean they have some channels that I've never even heard of like you know the brick wall channel or I have no idea just insane stuff they divide it all down I think there needs to be a little consolidation in the market yeah well you know it's everybody loved Top Gear right like Top Gear's like probably like one of the greatest car shows of all time I never really watched it how dare you how dare you Richard Rawlings but it's uh is it dead now or is it well they've the grand what is the grand tour or something like that something like on Amazon Amazon picked it up but having watched a single episode the new one but the old one was the shit and part of it that was fun was that you know those guys were kind of nuts yeah exactly yeah that's what we do you know gas monkey we kind of lose we have fun with light stuff on fire break it whatever yeah and there was some violence what's the what's his name the head guy Clark's and was it Jeremy's every Clark's got into lunchtime producer right Oh trust me I yeah I don't know if that producer deserved it or not I've had to reserve myself quite a few times people get crazy you know you're putting a show together it's a lot of work you know especially you know those guys the producers the camera guys the sound guys the people that are sitting in the discovery offices and alright they have jobs yeah this is my life I'm putting on every single day you know and so not only do I have my whole life on it and in it but then I have to deal with filming it and I've tried to explain it to him because they don't care the to a point if the show does well or bad cuz there will be another Richard down the road right right yeah there's a lot of high volume approach when it comes to those like kind of like cave shows you know they just try to bang out as many as they can high-volume you know and they have a formula that they try to follow and they have a lot of like setup scenarios where people get in trouble for things where they're not really getting in trouble so it's all set up in advance you know they feel it's almost scripted right a lot of reality shows some of them can't be you just know that you support the fifth shot how dare you I think it's but I think it's that they I was telling myself this morning should cut back on drinking I tell myself that every morning but it's so Wow because I've known as the guy that likes to drink some cold miller lights and hang out in the garage so even though my own you know my own bars and restaurants and stuff and they'll come in I'm buying you a beer and I'm like sir you really don't have to I own the place oh I'm buying it I'm like you really don't have to like not buying it I'm like ring him up Sally yeah Wow makes people feel good if you like buying people shit like that that's a beautiful thing about booze people like buying people a drink let me buy you a drink all right it's like a nice gesture exactly don't buy people sandwiches right they buy people drinks oh I'm down for a pizza sandwich anything any time I'm gonna buy you an herbal tea no one's ever said that yeah I know well we're gonna California I'm sure they're saying it right now they probably say would you like matcha or just the regular herbs or like people probably said that just try to appear spiritual I'd like to buy you an herbal tea yes did you see with Bitcoin and herbal tea I had a girl asked me that just the other day she goes your aura seems different mm-my interesting I don't get that lady at all she goes well I see you every year here barrett-jackson and you just you're you're you're glow is different mmm I was different mmm I'm still using the same Tom Ford Axe body spray thing because we're the things they say to people to fuck with them are you gaining weight gaining weight Richard hmm your auras different yeah you look so thin are you is your diet okay how's your diet okay it's great what's your auras different trying to figure out what's wrong you're not happy are you not happy oh I'm perfectly happy what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong with you you ready to crack fucking big they're just they're just joking you that's come on I know you're scared exactly yeah they're tricking you trick me into revealing some shit your auras off Richard something's wrong with your aura you should probably be able to punch people that say that we should definitely go hey fuck off auras aren't real bitch you need to draw the aura show me what the watch you get you gotta have some science behind this the whole ideology of fuck off is my thing so the gas monkey ring yeah I don't need says fuck off I'm shaking your hand you should always be able to say fuck off if you can't say fuck off but you have to be judicious right you have to say fuck off when fuck off is appropriate but you have to also salute people when they're not full of shit yeah yeah you say you're definitely not the person I'm telling the fuck off your art you're a good dude you're alright man you gotta have positive and negative like someone is telling you they're reading they're all your auras okay you might be able to I mean I don't know what the fuck you're seeing I barely know what I'm saying I have no idea if what I'm seeing is really even remotely similar to what you're seeing I'm just assuming there you go it's just a guess like well like some people like weird fucking cars right like some people are really into certain cars you go I don't get it yeah like a Pinto hatchback or something some people are really into those there were some groups some people really into like gross looking shit yeah I know what they're seeing maybe they're seeing something different than me well it's just probably a combination of their childhood their upbringing what I have you but isn't like is it possible they're like personal taste is a lot like sprinting speed like not everybody is going to be Carl Lewis right not everybody is going to be some who's another fast guy who's stainable Hussein Bolt is the fastest ever that's supposed to be he's the fastest ever not everybody can do that so isn't it possible that that would also apply to taste but there's there's people out there that really get what's wrong with your fucking shitty taste yeah there's other people out there that likes Fox Body Mustangs nearly in the Fox body I think it's the best looking car of all time it's the best ever I just left barrett-jackson and you see something roll across the stage and you're just like yeah why didn't the hell did somebody find that I don't get it and they're over there clapping they're all happy ordering drinks for their friends look I just bought an 81 yeah thunderbird turbo a Mustang 5.0 like Vanilla Ice had in this video we're we're gonna say just waters they're bad my body sold when it Bears car it's not the worst car in the world but if you had to compare what is that like 87 88 like what was that car what year was that the van we'll ask our 89 who's 89 okay that 5.0 Mustang 5.0 he was 80 he had a drop top down so his locks can flow didn't he something like that yeah you know he grew up just up the street from where I grew up I met him a UFC I believe I believe he was very nice there it is BAM my my friend Kevin Chaisson had one of those but he didn't have a convertible rolling him alive oh we were like fucking 20 years old that car back in the day was the shit if you had one of those cars you were fucking here it was fast it was it was also like it was a the car to have had like 230 horsepower really probably no I wonder it might not have had any more but it was good because we were all stupid and we didn't know how to drive anyway but those cars were that at that time for whatever reason like whatever was wrong with people that was a good-looking car but if you looked at that car could be act like a 69 Mach one like get the fuck out oh yeah how did you do this go to a 69 Mach one that's all this car at black 1969 Mach one absolutely best car ever it's one of them I mean there's some arguments out there of one of the but it's it's in the fucking race for sure it's in the top three go live black 69 Mach one get off that's a restomod piece of shit fight a real one it's true it's true that is a rest of my but the shape is in order the one down there the big 50 70 I was in the seventh yeah here I got out for headlights on the six right there's the missing side lights 71 Mach one was what Keanu Reeves had well that's what she wished right now yes you know he had a Chevelle after they stole his fucking Mustang Killingsworth dude they did the ultimatum okay they killed his dog and they stole his Mustang there you go you got a let's be here to kill some Russians so yeah I actually did some promo for that show was pretty good that fucking movie here's what's there it is there's a John wick Mustang there it is the guy was talking to when rust in Russian about his must fuck that's a good car the show was great because the kid was just a total fuck-up oh I was like what do I do with this yeah Jack killed my kid or kill this dude and then he came with what I said we were talking about your Chevelle your 68 Chevelle I go between 68 69 in those 1970s sometimes I look at those seventies in a row goddamn that's a perfect car they look a little tougher it's a mad man's car look at that one whoa I need one look at that goddamn thing that Mach 169 we're gonna build one on the show hopefully this year that's a fucking beautiful car yeah 69 Mach 1 and the boss 429 I need to get into building some of these movie cars because I've seen some of them up close and there there's shit go to classic recreations boss 429 go to this you need to see this he made this murdered-out 1969 boss and it is look at that day how dare you now that's perfect whoo that's perfect Christ look at that goddamn car yeah everyone runs that right now give me a call on my heart shit that's pretty awesome that's about as America as an eagle killing a terrorist exactly right look at that fucking car man don't go away from that picture Jamie go back to that picture good lord mighty good did there's not a better looking car there's just different nothing's better looking than that doesn't exist I don't give a fuck what anybody says there's nothing better looking than that car it's just different I agree we've had a few boss 429 s through the shop but definitely not a modern one like that there's a grad gang of evil cars from that day but there's not a better looking one do people just I mean the the manufacturers were just trying to one-up each other kind of just the the Wild West of automobile and like I'm gonna go out to you know I'll do you and I wish you know we're sort of in that again right now Yeah right you know Dodge and Chevy and Ford are kind of doing the same thing right now they are and it's also elevated everybody's interior game which keep that out there don't you take that down that's like shutting down porn what's wrong everybody's interior games stepped up too because it used to be like the Germans that Japanese had much higher build quality with the interiors but Corvette has had to step up its game considerably like the new Corvettes a very nice interior Tony Hinchcliffe has one stand-up comedian extraordinaire 20 inch cliff he's got a Grand Sport which a lot of people think is the best of the because it's not too overpowered still got the wide body but I look at the interior go this is a nice interior man it's not like it used to be it used to be the cars fastest fuck its but this season there's nothing in it you have a two spoke steering wheel that when you can absolutely bend it you know those cars were terrible I just noticed are these fake clouds in the air yeah they are is these lights that used to have clear covers and instead we get this thing from octo lights and they're a company that makes it's it's like a photograph of clouds that you can see through so that we put it over the the top of the light it's did Octomom start that like told lights no lights in here not eight well in the old place we had them there were stars but the news place the lights these are LED lights are just not as bright so we had to change it to clouds that's the new roles with the star oh you have yeah I've got a wraith and it's got the shooting star every once in a while really yeah so a lot of people don't know that the star pattern that they put in the headliner in the car is the exact star pattern from I guess the original factory or whatever oh wow and unbelievable you're riding along you got stars and above you that's freaking rad yeah my neighbor has one of those the cars epic it's not ready ready - doors get the four-door but you get in and you go this car is preposterous it's so quiet it's like you're barely connected to the outside world ready there you go stealing those suicide doors look at the fucking ceiling man you're barely connected to the world barely you barely pay attention oh I jump in there and my poodle Fifi jumps in I got a standard black poodle this you know a big big girl and she jumps in there and just like rides around look at the people didn't they develop poodles for some specific hunting reason yeah they were hunters yeah like people think of poodles they think of poodles is like like a rich person's to Beverly Hills dog the bel-air poodles yeah they were bred as hunters and whatever as a matter of fact mine I call her Fifi is her name and she brought a rabbit in one night she comes to bed I'm laying there and I'm like what is she messing with so I reached down in the dark and pull up this rabbit like what the frak and but they soft mouth them they were there it's in their genes they don't kill them they bring them to you the master as a shine of respect a show of respect plus they don't kill it so she brought a live rabbit in a man who like I've rabbit must have been having a tough day oh dude but it went off we're all freaking possum on you just laid there and I carried it out put it down dude run away obviously about ten minutes is what it took it to come out of frozen state I mean it just got ate by a poodle and brought into bed with me it probably felt like as long as it's alive just just go with this just just go limp and hope you're just a toy just hope it happens yeah that's the good thing he's got our own Instagram she's doing well she's always showing off domestic dogs right like they don't need to eat they don't need to kill you to eat so they're only there only grabbing you so rabbits probably just keep it together and he'll just eventually get bored exactly doesn't really want to eat you what is that it's a poodle what's 1649 how about in 1649 they already fucked dogs up to that point cuz all dogs come from wolves that's what one of the there's B be right there think one of the biggest looks like one of the weirdest stories that came out of genetics is understanding that all dogs came from wolves they didn't think that I think I'm pretty sure they thought that all dogs were like a combination of a bunch of different things like wild dogs and different things that eventually became like a mastiff or something but now they realize no every single dog from a chihuahua to a Great Dane comes from a wolf yeah but I mean there's some dogs that what do you do with him I mean he's got a 150 pound Mastiff that just lays there slobbers I had 140 pound Mastiff he lived to be 13 years old he was awesome it's a great dog now they're great dogs but this is the air and they're smart they're smart and they're big and I don't like take I don't I don't mind I mean especially here in California you got to pick up the dogs crap but you know you don't I don't want to pick up a crap that's bigger than mine in Texas you find dogs you just shoot it now you got to pick it up it's it's it's everywhere there's people walking along and that just cracks me up I'm like I'm gonna follow this giant animal around and pick up its shit that's the leash your worries the real problem is it doesn't understand how big it is and it knocks people downstairs and say that you got to be real careful you have steep stairs and a big dog you have to really train that motherfucker correctly you gotta let him know hey you can't jump on the four-year-old at the top stair you fucking dummy but he's a dog he just loves you they love you get him you know big dogs like my friend Johnny Cash was my dog he's and my friend Joe sold him to me and he was a trainer of dogs for movies and shit like okay you know the movie The Incredible Hulk with the one with Eric Bana when Nick Nolte plays his dad and Nick catches the bad guy and he's like a scientist and he sticks the Hulk serum into these dogs and he turns these dogs these big giant hulking Mastiffs well the original dog was actually my friend's dog and he was a trainer of these dogs and he brought him to fear and on fear factor these doctor just laying around like super chill like that's that's the cartoon dog but there was like a real dog before that his name the dog was he's a Regency Mastiff and his name was curly so anyway this guy he developed these he raised these dogs and made him to the he read them to this place where they just had no aggression no aggression to dogs no aggression of people like this dog was like a Hulk just a giant mass muscle but you can come up to it anybody can come up to him pet it little kids were petting it and he was like gently kissing their face he was the sweetheart of sweethearts what a place we run in there we got more people out there I'm good but anyway he's a big dog but he's a super sweetheart it's all about like breeders like how they breed up yeah yeah for sure what kind of dogs do you have just Fifi the poodle standard poodle how much does Fifi weigh probably sixty it's a reasonable shit you're cleaning up a reasonable handful I know yeah several times a day it's like if you have like an English Mastiff no you got it you don't have the one bag you got two bags got a hunk of shit then you've got to figure out how to roll this one and roll this you got a pot roast of shit that comes out of that animals asshole every few hours it's insane yeah that's it those those poor fellas and gals don't live very long though unfortunately that's what's sad those really big dogs like eight nine years they're done mine lived to be thirteen which is extraordinary that's pretty old but he was hurt and I have other joints let me walk yeah I would have to carry him to his food and then carry him back outside so we can go to the bathroom it was bad the trials and tribulations of big dogs their nest on the JRE you can tune in on a cont screen or car might be one of the greatest things has ever happened in the history show is cont screener calmed trending yet for sure for sure and people are gonna be mad at us why did you have to use a derogatory term for months fuck China when I come a big dick screener these guys are dicks they're assholes dicks and assholes and yet you chose cunt well we we were thinking about manhole but it's the same yeah Australia has the proper use of the word cunt and there's too much reverence to that word in America people get confused about it in Australia they just throw that bitch around like it's a beach ball oh yeah they did concert I've had some Australians on my show yeah that's like even if you know for EM protects I'm like holy shit he's fucking the cunts he's he's a good cunt that's my favorite yeah it's a good con he's a good con and they meet that like you might as well be replacing the word cunt for dude cuz it's all about intent to them it's basically saying hey he's good dude he's a good dude and they're saying he's good con they're yeah it's not bad gotta have a set of these not steal those this is a plasti sell their company that

be what we should all Spri it or be we should all aspire to be Keanu Reeves or you might have some really crazy secrets no that is the nice it seems like everybody runs into him you know like I'm sure there's some people that ran into you where they caught you the wrong way and they're all went sideways for a little bit no not really I mean but no fucking Keanu Reeves hey got it going on but the point what I was gonna get to is one of the things that those movies did was they they elevated the profile of those muscle cars because shit'll saw that movie and they went this guy for this something about him I know he's murdering people I know he's the best at murdering people I know he killed three guys in a bar with a pencil I know that but look how fucking cool he looks he's good he's got the dopest suits he's killing people he's not killing people in an under armour rash guard okay he's killing people in the dopest suits he's stabbing people in the neck and he's driving a 70 Chevelle SS but the trick is unlike your for mentioned and loved Eleanor it wasn't plasticized it was a real freakin muscle car did that shit hanging all over it an extra side pipes you're right you're right but you're also wrong because Eleanor look at that god damn it I've gotta kill somebody I'm doing it just like that god come on gets out of a sheep he's got cragger's on it a Chevelle SS from 1970 with cragars its torque press look how I can torque for this yeah look how good he looks with at Creager style that that's a classic whitewall tire I mean come on man or white litter tire raised white letter come on that's class I know you can get your own now you can get your name on it you could do anything there's up gas there's a time that sells like stickers monkey tires I should but in their vocation you can actually order stickers now that that are the rubber letters that fuse themselves into the rubber on your tire so you end up with a white letter like that and you put anything on there Wow like Joe Rogan sure so I'm gonna send you and me photos of their car in 1970 Chevelle rolling around with cunt screener now the company that does it's gonna send assets for our car I don't think they'll let you in the golf course with that shit after the burrito incident I guarantee you they'll make it on small little golf cart tires too I need a set of time for a 10-inch wheel idea smaller font please try to fix this electric golf cart that's a long I've got a golf cart I Drive in my neighborhood that's insane it's a polaris like four seater with the little truck bed

with this thing I Drive through people's yards you know I'm a great neighbor because I'm really fun and if I do absolutely fuck something up I will definitely pay for it but at the same time they're like okay does it have to have 32,000 speakers on it and a 50-inch television screen white wall tires don't exist what happened to what they do but the only exists on classic cars oh yeah you're not going to see them or anything new that they the lettered tires are starting to get more popular with brand new ones but the white wall remember the four or five inch white wall all right I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna talk to you about a polarizing shoo yeah ready I'm ready raw well Portia's I have no idea what you're talking about you know we're talking about no those wide-body weird japanese-style body kits they put on old Porsches is it like Liberty walk shitter giant white ass bodies are a you got it I don't know anything about here is our au h wel t how the fuck do you not know about this because I can't afford collecting foreigners but no these are old cars these are not the most expensive cars no that's an old accordion bumper that's been smoothed out and so it's like 78 79 but you see the bolt on bumpers or the excuse me the bolt on fender flares I like that here in the front yeah well this there's a gentleman out of Japan and he does all of these raw welt cars by hand and go to him what is the guy's name so I could give the guy his props but that dude right there with the I love RW t-shirt on he's his name as a curette nakai and he all raw welt cars he does himself so he'll fly out from Japan he sauces your fucking fenders off it puts these flares on the front and the rear there's some amazing videos of him because he's a real character he's changed smoking cigarettes the entire time and he's like measuring this shit he does it all by hand he lays the the caulking around the edge but yeah weather sealing that's the guy right there I'm going out on a limb then I'm gonna invite him to come to Texas and do my Wraith because I didn't Porsche well I've I've been considering doing a wide body on my wraith just for the hell of it and I would let him come to it if he would be interested in it that would be amazing episode but if you wanted to just do what he does and and and you know get a Porsche like that's kind of his style but he takes these things and makes them fucking cartoonish wide fuck that just cracks me up you're dealing with like 20 inch tires that's freaking super cuts they're outstanding my deal with gas monkey like you say okay well I could actually tell you yeah we can do that but I'm like right this guy's no or bring his as in let's have some fun let's watch his talent I got it I got a I got a situational sense right there that's what I need Rutledge from Top Gear you know Rutledge wood I know the name his nice guy super nice guys been on this podcast before he's doing one of those cars and he's doing it with an LS swap so instead of using an air-cooled engine we already did it oh you already did that yeah good move why is it so prohibitive oh I don't know it's it's Porsche people you know the size the Seinfeld's of the worlds and God bless you Seinfeld they're like oh it's not original pure guts we did a 996 like a 2000 2001 convertible and did the LS swap and we finished that in 2000 late 2016 and I had a brand new 2017 911 Turbo S in the signal green and if I didn't mess with the buttons if I didn't turn off all the stuff I could not get it away from that car till about 140 miles an hour well couldn't get away well look at this thing sure yeah that's ours this is it look at that who is Lord oh we win freaking ball headlights - so you 99 6 he went with the 997 headlight yup that car was so yeah with 911 gt3 the front with it where the bumper is the open vents oh my good god was freaking great Gary really tearing it up that's beautiful where is it friend of mine owns it and I told him I said you can buy the car but if you ever sell it you got to ask me first dude fuck him I know right if I came from Tony Tony you suck you have that car the thing about those it's so weird that you're not allowed to do that but but like you look at that Woods that was three years ago man oh my goodness there's not again alright put that right next to the Mustang Mach 1 it's not better it's just different yeah there's both fucking incredible they both have the same reaction like that car which is a 2001 that looks like a 0 or a 1 yeah that car the way it's modified the way it's put together it is so fucking pretty if you had that that's 69 Mach one there just a ditz as different tastes it's a different feel but that's a fucking amazing car and maybe in the future you might look at that one even better when you consider the performance that's my other car a tuner we built down there the 280z the green one oh yeah I always wanted a 240 but that's a 280 with 13,000 original miles and we went nuts with that and did the whole Lexus swap as 22 J's one like letter tires oh yeah bringing him back that car was cool knit I sold it to a customer no bullshit for a pretty amazing amount of money for a 280z and it was being shipped and the truck burned to the fucking ground yeah what happened there knows but the whole trailer burned to the ground well you know how there's been these fires out here do you know about how Californians had some pretty crazy fires there's a guy up street that are really nice 3-series BMW burnt to the ground it's still sitting there I took pictures of it I put it on my Instagram oh you need to call me here's what I think we do cuz there have been some really amazing cars that have burned with the fires that have in this past year the panels are still good though don't don't worry about the panel's we take them I need to make you this for in here this conference table you take it and that's that's from okay so you take the real special car that burned down you blow everything out you clear coat it so it doesn't stink and what have you we put a glass top on it and you have a conference table called burning up the competition you know or whatever but I think I think some of those really expensive burned-out cars would make really cool conference tables yeah good art projects yeah for your background you got lucky bitch just having in a big black baby me you got lucky bitch you weren't in the wrong place the wrong time yeah I'm a big fan of those e46 m3 s those 2000 ish I do not know I don't know nine guys I mean it oh there you go dude I'm an American custom silver 46m 3ci he was saying so many numbers I was worried you were baiting me to see if I'd like that yeah those are cool there was no e46 m3 e46 is like it's a super well-balanced 50/50 balance car from like two thousand to three and many people think it's like the gold standard for m3s because m3s there's something that happened to em threes and right now I like the fact that an m3 became an m4 like stay right there don't move m3 but still a car that's a fucking good looking car because an m4 is a totally different thing than an m3 it's beautiful and it's amazing like an m4 from BMWs a an amazing driver like if you want to drive that car every day you'll be super pleased the performance is unprecedented in the M world and most of the car world the only things that are faster like fucking GTRs and Corvettes that are zr1 0:06 is a shit but it's different because an m3 was really light it was really light and uncomplicated there wasn't any traction control or if there was it was minimal mostly it was just anti-lock brakes and it was you know three thousand pound car and it has 333 horsepower and is perfectly balanced for the right amount of thrust the right amount of like grip with the tires because they weren't the widest tires but they were wide enough there's a little bit of fender flare that made them wider than the standard 3-series and it's just a perfect understated looking car when you look at that e46 m3 you look at that car like that sudden that's a fucking good neutral zone like they nailed it cool if anybody has one of those I'm dying you can reach me here to cast lucky duck sold it right well what we do is we buy like 10 or 20 of them and then we sell one at auction for like 15 times what they normally bring in then we sell the rest them but look at that car that's pretty damn good it's a good car you want there's a balance to that car it's not like a Ferrari 488 or some shit like that where it's so outrageous everybody go everybody like gets light now see you got me there because I don't like rear engines oh you don't not in the Ferrari type stuff because to me you know if you've got a front-engine b12 you're a connoisseur look at that if you've got one behind you oh then you just got a contract of some sort and you might not have that car next week look at that car alright do you own one no I think I need to buy a cool I need a e46 m3 in my life look at that that's what it might be it's perfectly understated and yet flashy it's like a balance so what's the value on that right now cuz I'm serious I don't watch that kind of car they're not crazy they're not crazy because I think people overlook them they overlook them for more extravagant like 92 m3s which is like the v8 years so if you could buy one what would you pay for one right now I mean just a nice California one no rust I have brain damage so I've critical just thinking to see I don't know off I'd have to call my buddy Dennis on something like that because I just don't know those kind of cars there's something about that car that's very appealing because it's a balance issue it's not like there's something about the Mach 1 that's like holy shit you know like America fuck yeah so here's what here's what we do we put it out to the the people listening bring us a nice one owner low mile m3 that hasn't been racked out yeah even 6e 46 P 46 m3 that it hasn't been racked out and I'll bid against you and we'll see who gets it I had two em threes in a row at least two em threes in a row from BMW for the v8 years because it was so good it was my daily driver it was so good after I would get out of it I was like this car is everything I like it's understated and yet it's wicked it's got v8 power but yet it's not preposterous like the wheels don't break loose every time you hit the gas it has a double clutch transmission so it's good in traffic and it also has a whale because it's got this high revving v8 and so many things that I liked I got some of them in a row so they're gonna send this one on the old interwebs and the way I got you I got a pretty good reach I think I can get a hold of BMW know I can get a hold of people that owned one in their garage right now that are probably at their Golf Club so we'll just bid against each other so you gets it I don't know what there were how about I let you get it not buy a different one I'm not stupid bro how about we do this let's buy two of them and race I'm not good at racing straight line round lines don't care I don't care who gets there first I just like driving yeah don't bullshit nope my real I don't King racing but I really don't care if you get there first all i care is about going sideways and correcting and hitting the turn at the proper apex and stomping on the gas and knowing when to brake and knowing when to like dig in if you get ahead of me I don't give a fuck I really don't I'm just trying to have fun because I'm not a professional racer neither am i if that's all I wanted to do if I was Danica Patrick then that's what I'd be into but I'm not and I don't I really just like driving cars yeah me too I'm not a racer at all if you and I drove I would let you win cuz I'd like you oh yeah I'd let you win cuz I like you so we're just gonna be sitting at the starting line look at look at 2001 846 m3 I don't want to convertible yeah I think that if you're gonna try to drive a car then you don't want to convert well I have one converter part I have a 1965 it would want to find that hey let's find one on there and I'll buy right now look all the guy I know guys selling one of those what do you got one did 8500 look at that 46 6-speed low miles 13,000 you can't even buy a 69 Mach 1 for anywhere near that not even near that that's a good car - I love that car stereo he's covered I'm a fan I'm a fan I just think that there's some years there Street Palace Burtis super close okay if he could be here in the next 20 minutes before we get it done or how not that close it's basically a long beach second hour fuck it's a long time term here is like 4 hours 3 yeah 3 p.m. it's 4 hours yeah it was sad that what do they got long beach not just lost we dog the Queen the Queen Elizabeth whatever the Queen Mary the Queen Mary yeah there's a laugh factory down there in Long Beach there's a lot of things in Long Beach see I've always wanted to try a comedy really I I just you want to try tonight no ok I'm not exactly prepared if I can make it happen I just don't know how I mean I I know that it's a I mean it's a very rigid process and you have to really refine and I've looked at it I've studied it and I'm like I think I could probably just let me do it I think you'd do it a hundred percent no bullshit you 100% can be a comedian I need to go to comedian school does not doesn't exist oh really yeah this is what you got to do you got to make friends with professional comedians we'll be honest with you okay like there's a like what one of the beautiful things about comedy is that it's very much a brother ship and a sister for sure I've seen it yeah there's a brotherhood and sisterhood that exists with comedies where we there's no institutions even though it's like one of the favorite things of people people love to laugh it's one of the rare things it gives you a very specific reaction like if you go to see a movie and it's like a rock movie like you mangy or something it's fun sometimes it's funny sometimes it's exciting but it's a bunch of shit going on you go to see stand-up you go to see Kevin Hart do stand-up you you're going there cuz Kevin Hart is drug dealer okay that drug is laughter yeah I'm here to hit you with some fucking high level gigantic arena laughter and you gotta walk out of there going holy shit that was fun yeah whoo like he gave you some drugs oh no III think I might try it one day a new it was shot there like an open mic go out there go hey I'm I'm Richard from cunt screener calm there's a lot of places Addison improv good spot yeah Addison and props great it's a great spot not only that not only is that great right next door is the Kobe steak house yes and you can get all the chop-chop and if you get hammered you can go to that piano bar that piano bar still there piano bar still there but the right next to Kobe is the Memphis it's a lounge Memphis lounge and that's always good time mm-hmm I've met a few of my wives there I worked there many times that's a fun place to work I used to love to do that circuit what I would do is cap city in Austin and I would do the improv well the when did there is an improvident Addison but there's another improv to write that I haven't done is that in Fort Worth I think so I think there's one like 40 minutes away yeah it's like Fort Worth yeah yeah yeah and then there was a laugh stop in Houston and that was the run yeah we'll see Dallas you need to run you need to gas monkey live I hold about 2,000 some people like what is it you have a concert place yeah dude I graduated high school in 87 somebody told me two things one you're gonna build a car that Hot Wheels is gonna make and two you're gonna have motley crew at your bar I'm like no way that's incredible yeah so is this the place that you were building on your show yeah yeah you have a two thousand seat place there yeah I think we're 22 is that place now what's really bitchin about this is uh the the stage is solid concrete it's not raised so the reverb in the end the sound that we get out of there even the guys from crew when they played it was a deal with dodge and me and them and BA they were supposed to come in and play like 41 minutes or something and they played for like an hour and a half and we're like we hadn't played anything like this in decades in the sound it's fuckin and that it's so cool dude you're like an uber businessman you just dip your toes and everything I called myself an entreprenuer cuz I've always put my hands in the shit like so yeah I mean you own a rep you got a restaurant bar you make music we're doing energy drink gas monkey energy is he yelling it we're in every 7-eleven in the US what's with the gas monkey energy it's a Saturday energy drink it's powered with all kinds of B vitamins and with shit where our sugar we use real honey you know it's a better deal all the way around wow you get it from slave bees yeah well I didn't know there was any other kind crack the whip in the Box B I had a bit about that about how you're a vegan one of the most crazy things about being a vegan is you can't eat honey did you honey it's like probably the oldest you know substance for nutrition in the world it's one of them it's definitely the top million but that these bees are not like your slaves you can't just force them to make honey J again stick over the box they don't care they don't they don't even know what's going on do you think there's any honey bee trafficking going on yes for sure and it's awful it needs to stop and it's mostly by white people obviously I was leaving LA the other day and there's lady had like 24 eggs and they were scanning well you never know carry some ones they make fake eggs they do and you could put drugs in that fake egg no yeah yeah it really is look if you're a drug deal and you're making millions dollars of cocaine an egg of coke imagine how fucking how valuable an egg filled with coke would be yeah like a rocket coke that big take a guess Jamie how about like a ostrich egg ostrich egg full of coke yeah a good goose egg I haven't done anything like that and sits on a really really small job Oh ostrich egg filled with coke Google that don't be scared it probably comes up that's the problem like you're sitting there thinking with your buddy or shit like I just thought I'm really cool googling like fuck it's probably someone like getting arrested for having it up their ass did you see that CIA spy kit where they had to stick it up their ass fugitive ostrich farm fraudster Martin Evans extradited to is that guy having an ostrich egg uh possess is that what used to anis Berg he was doing drug dealing with ostriches how did he get the drugs in the ostrich through is it would be beak not nostrils like well they have nostrils still weird now I knew a guy you know you you know I've done a lot of the world rallies and the gumball 3000 yeah the bull runs and all this so one guy appeared on the scene for a few years and it was kind of weird he was like the everybody went in there and he was kind of not really competing but he had all these expensive cars turns out that that's all he's been doing for four or five years was shipping these cars from town to town on regular shipping trucks full of drugs who's gonna search a Lamborghini murciélago right they just assume he's there for the Gumball Rally yeah meanwhile he's a dope dealer exactly now that guy I think he's in the jail now one of the things about cars right is that cars the men's baser instincts respond to cars you know something about like like a Lamborghini is something about those cars it's like look you want a kind of slightly slightly escape from society's constraints oh yeah but I'm gonna I'm not a fan with those cars I'm I do it with the old cars yeah I like the old shit I mean I had some news that only Murcielago is either it's just some can see on oh well there's some weird so wide and big craziness can't see can't get in and out I mean it's so um rich too you know there's that every now and then on Sunset and for the comedy story see he's got wah-wah-wah-wah little flying by the Comedy Store and the cars are like five fucking miles wide each cars they're super wide yeah and you always know the asshole that doesn't know what he's doing because he's pushing in the collection yeah but there's no catch there's no clutch well not anymore he's neutral in doing it exist these guys that drive around and they're like crap you know look at me now like dude just Travis brake a car who did we get the satisfaction Washington stall out anymore though like someone who doesn't know how to do I stalled out my Bronco and I was like everybody around me that was looking at this car that got jealous that's for you feel better about yourself yeah fucking fuck everybody had a way to extra three seconds and they're all like you fucking loser now this is a pretty badass Bronco it's about at Spago but you ever been to La Cienega Boulevard right when they hit sunset uh-huh that's a steep ass he'll come around dudes a manual stall out of that motherfucker yeah we started the gumball 3000 there one time oh really we started on that hill you had to clear that light just to go do things screwed up all the time that's a good move yeah they should have never mowed down the House of Blues though well the hell here's the thing I agree with you a hundred percent but yeah yeah yeah I'm not scared round number what is this six um the thing about the House of Blues that was badass though when it went away so I looped my friend yes sir a new friend so you're gonna teach me comedy mmm a hundred percent help you up um when it was down when they tore it down from The Comedy Store you could see a cross and you see all the beautiful lights like the lights in the Hollywood Hills I had a buddy of mine who bought a house in off of Doheny which is like way above the hill you'd go to his backyard you would look out the lights he'd be like this doesn't even seem real it's like a Blade Runner like most people see the lights when you're down in them but when you're above Hollywood or I'm looking down it's one of the most spectacular views in all of history it's way better than any New York City of you because you have a view top look at that that's what you see yep and I'm telling you man this is dog shit compared to my friend Larry's house you'd look out there you'd look at that and you go holy shit that's incredible it was mesmerizing the image was stunning that's real a couple people that have houses up there I know Dane Cook's got a crazy house up there like a lot of guys have houses up there that look down like I always wanted to meet him he's a rad dude yeah he's at the comic store all the time well he's what was that show he did my best friend's girl or whatever I think it was a movie yeah maybe that is probably one of the better maybe out there it's pretty fucking hilarious what's your all time favorite movie if you have if there's one one move you smokey the bandit everytime and if I had to get in death and think about it I might go with stroker ace where the hmm the giant I think the smoke tower fell he goes right under it because these guys were doing their own stunts that shit was real that one's CGI and they were doing it what was that one movie with the girl her name was Domino he was a detective called Domino that was it called Domino I don't remember who's that what it's called yeah you know like the was it called Domino during Cannonball Run when they drove the car into the pool oh yeah the NASCAR looking thing yeah they did that because they were fucking drunk they were loaded and they were partying and the cameras just happened to be rolling that and that wasn't planned it wasn't part of the script they did it because I thought was funny was it called Sharky's machine that's right Sharky's machine goddamn what years at 81 I was 14 years old I remember watching this movie on TV I was like god damn I wish I was Burt Reynolds and the woman who was like his girlfriend oh my god she was so hot look at her warmer days genetics that's when they yeah their leg warmers back then and then no one had an ass didn't even figure out asses when they figure out that sir mix-a-lot ladies and gentlemen why people were in the days we didn't even know what a ass was sir mix-a-lot came along and changed the game he came along with baby got back yes wait wait wait oh my god that is better it was like everybody just got smelling salts under the nose yeah then the Kardashians fucked it up for all of us everybody

greatest drama movies absolutely of all time I actually have a picture when I was filming with Burton's house somewhere in my phone I'll never find it but I was in his memorabilia room which also doubled as his weight room and just there's stuff everywhere and I was texting the way I was dealing with the problem and somebody snapped a picture of it and the deliverance canoe is like laying up
