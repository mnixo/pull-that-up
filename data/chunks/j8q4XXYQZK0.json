hello freak bitches but marijuana stays in your system because it's fat soluble wait longer like seven weeks whereas with coke it's like a couple fucking day I didn't tell you my marijuana story when I came home from a dance club one night it's right after this before I start doing comedy living in Malden Grenada Highlands up on the hill there those nice oh yeah I come home from the palace by ballast and Saugus yes we lived like a half a mile from it okay I come on my buddies all went out I come home shit-faced is a thing of tomato sauce you know it's like 1:00 in the morning I'm starving III make spaghetti I eat enough for like five people okay I wake up like an hour later and my ears are ringing and the rooms going like this I started fucking puke and violently I hit my buddies come in I'm in the bathroom I hear them going to the kitchen they go he ate all the fuck they made Rasta pasta and they they ate this much of it they they said they ached like you know a tiny amount they were fucked up all night and this is a guy who I only get high at that point a couple times in my life and that now my roommates talking to me right he's right where you are he's like five feet away but it sounds like he's yelling from a mile away I was tripping on the fucking they were gonna take me over they should take me to the hospital not fuckin pukin I'm swearing at him and and and honest about it was a week later I remember watching the Super Bowl and still being fucked up I don't because it's so much like you just said when you and when you ingest it orally its way stronger and and and it literally is in my system for I don't know how long I mean you know you can look it up but I and this is for someone who didn't I didn't smoke a lot of weed that's crazy a week later oh and least a week no at least I'm probably being conservative with that because it's tasing if you saw how much I ate you know if you saw how much tomato sauce such a greaseball and and they were like they were fucked up all night was like this much and they were like oh no you making those fingers like a hockey puck yeah yeah forget I'm not on TV yeah but yeah about a half the size of a hockey Bay and I was sitting there like you know and my ears were ringing and and and they would like I said my roommates like that close to me and it sound like going down a hallway it's interesting because when as we talk about this and we've talked a lot about the damage guys because we've gone through all the various techniques you know after you had you know discussion with Brendan Schaub a lot of people came out and they start saying hey should we feel bad for talking about this sport and I and I've heard that conversation again you know at what point should we feel guilty for watching guys we know our aging fighters and you know you could do the same thing with football you could certainly do the same thing in the military whether there's a lot of traumatic brain injuries taking place the military as well one thing that that I think people forget and that I think people need to understand it's it's not to excuse anything or take away from the conversation it's it's a little bit of a mitigation the the men and women who do sports like this if you take it away from them they're gonna find it elsewhere mm-hmm I mean it's it's a need you know for a guy like me had I not found mixed martial arts I was going to find something there's like this drive inside us to do something extreme that makes people raise their eyebrows and say are you sure you want it you really are going to do that they have that that desire and and it's just a personality trait I mean if if mixed martial arts didn't exist I mean look at cowboy Cerrone the things he does to fill that hole in his life and you're gonna get a lot of guys that's why guys don't wanna retire it's just part of who they are we all know the risks we all know everything we're up against we still signed the contract and so it's important to remind him that if you know for people that are anti-this and anti-that you know we're gonna do something like that anyways we're gonna find something else to do and at some point we've got to be accountable for own actions well there's a wide variety of human beings is always gonna be sedentary people that sit in their couch is gonna be people who want to fucking rock climb with no ropes my friend already went back to the flip phone he already goes no Ari Shaffir coccoon stand-up comedian he didn't his iPhone and went to a flip phone well he does all of his social media stuff either on a computer or not he doesn't check his Twitter on his phone is he's like I was getting too wrapped up and like I would be talking to someone that asleep last night on like literally that my iPhone hit my forehead three times and I finally gave up because I was like what the fuck am I going to post yeah the concussion you know I'm like I'm looking I don't think it's spelled correctly and it's probably like you know a bunch of weird wingding characters I was gonna say there's there's something about iPhones that drag people in right there's something about like being able to look at videos and you're interacting with your phone yeah the interaction that you get with those old cars the feel that you get the addiction that you get to getting in those things it's very different than the new cars and is there and I wanted to ask you this because you're the expert on it don't know the agoraphobic is there like a point where it crosses this line and it's not the same experience anymore and was there like a sweet spot in the production of cars where they're a spot where all the technological advances and all the advances of suspension although they may allow you to get around a racetrack a little bit quicker especially with like PDK transmissions with dual clutches working at the same time they do allow you to get places faster but is it is it missing all the stuff that gets people excited about cars I mean cuz I know that driving an automatic car is fun it is satisfying but I also know it's not as satisfying as shifting your own gears as the field that you're gonna get from a car like yours and I think that that's something that's missing I think ultimately moving forward the manual may become a lost art because you look at kids growing up today that don't know how to drive manual cars so their point of reference is completely different you know I most of us here I think learn driving a manual car and everything he said is perfectly true that it's the interaction between man and machine which gets you down the road differently in a manual than what it does in a new car you
