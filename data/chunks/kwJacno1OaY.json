the Joe Rogan experience it's uh it gets real tricky when someone just denies the rights of citizens then someone who's empowered denies their rights because what are you then if you're in power and you're denying their rights as soon as you step in and deny people due process deny people lawyers to deny people why would you ever want to do that it's a real question so when things get passed like the National Defense Authorization Act allows the government to indefinitely detain American civilians and they don't have to do anything they're not required to notify your family they're not required to arrest you they're not required to you don't you know you can't you don't have to get a lawyer they can just lock you up when you see shit like that does that drive you crazy oh yeah well and people always say to me they say well you know why are you defending the terrorists and what you try to explain to people who's without the due process there's no confirmation that this is a terrorist the only way you know it's a terrorist is when some court somewhere determines upon looking at the evidence that this person is a terrorist once you can kill somebody on the suspicion of being a terrorist well we're all under suspicion Vica terrorists under the certain conditions that someone wants to deem a mistaken identity situation you know or any look I mean how many guys are named Omar or Mohammed or you know I mean well how about in this Dormer case the the cops shot up two different cars that was wrong because perfect example perfect exam you the the idea that the government should have special powers that regular human beings don't that's crazy well they have that now I mean I think I already do because your government sure to take it to the next level and decide you're gonna deny the rights of people that you feel are guilty well who are you and how do I know that you're infallible and how do I know that this isn't corruption how do I know this isn't a personal grudge it's not like you're dealing with an organization that has a spotless record over the past you know 200 years where they're the most ethical human beings to ever exist and people from other countries come to them for know we've caught them along about a million different oh you had we had committee hearings which you cannot even imagine which shows you how much things have changed in the 1970s we had the church committee hearings and the pike committee hearings where the government actually on television exposed everything the CIA had been doing since the end of the Second World War the assassinations and all this kind of stuff the crown jewels are what the CIA used to call those secrets that were exposed on television by congressional and senatorial committees it just shows you what happens when there's no oversight and if stuff is too secret to have oversight over you're asking for trouble there's too many ways human beings can justify going beyond the rules and there's always a good reason and you hear it today I mean the waterboarding thing is a perfect example we prosecuted people at Nuremberg for having an attitude that we have now which is hey if they're terrorists and you can save lives by torturing people isn't that an ethical dilemma where it's worth torturing some guy who knows bad anyway in order to save lives I mean if you could have prevented the two towers from falling down by waterboarding a couple of bad guys isn't that worth it and that those ethical dilemmas lead you off into the weeds really quickly and history shows that over and over again it's it's very doubtful that it's helping either it's very doubtful that you're really getting that kind of key information from people by throwing water down their mouth you know I'd I just I don't I don't know if torturing people gets them to tell the truth gets it to tell you anything you want well there's an old line about would you and I wish I could quote it at like that's a wonderful line going back hundreds of years where somebody says would you abrogate the laws in order to get the devil and the other guy says no I would I would stick to the laws because if you abrogate the laws to get to the devil you take away the only thing that protects yourself eventually and that's what this is people say well it's okay to go after this to get to terrorists what makes you think one that it'll stay with terrorists and to that what a terrorist is that definition won't change the Bush administration was calling these people that would light you know car dealerships on fire in the middle of the night when there was no one there eco-terrorists you're gonna drone those people right what are you gonna do exactly where does the line get drawn and who gets to decide antifungal coffee proponents that might get a little hyped up and those motherfuckers I've drawn those people I mean dude this whole fucking Pope thing to me it crazy crazy and hilarious that we even pay attention to what that clown is doing how is that even making the news there's some weird fucking group of people who do like the most bizarre ceremonies I don't think tient sanctioned by governments and mass media no one calls it a cult the guys wearing a fucking wizard outfit with a fish head hat it's if you tried to do that today and tried to say I am adorned of God he has brought to me this information he shouldn't you set up a shop they would think you were a fucking loon but because of the fact that it's been around for a long time this guy has a direct lineage we're supposed to take it seriously we're supposed to take it seriously and we're supposed to fucking ignore all the shit Catholicism did well how about this shit he did he released a priest that had molested 200 deaf boys 200 he let him go ha he let him do this my god I'm into psychiatric instead of bringing in and getting him prosecuted they brought him in for psychiatric treatment and this guy went on to they went to another parish even molested more boys I mean it's fucking craziness he did that time and time again he took people away from being prosecuted and sent him to psychiatric care and and they're free they're free to go yeah they're free and they're walking around the street some of them are in these huge religious retreat places that they have beautiful grounds and these guys are just wandering around taking care of for the rest of their lives in the trauma list there's a place like that up by where I live yeah there yes so right so that's happening and they don't pay taxes they don't pay fucking taxes that is fucking crazy all that shit is crazy the idea that they should be able to make golden buildings and not pay taxes but sure you have your fucking mind can you fucking imagine that's a business it's a business it's a fucking business you not know you don't talk directly directly for God it's 2013 stop stop your bullshit you're not telling the truth you don't know that much I don't believe you I think you are very charismatic and there's a lot of people that want to believe you and they'll go along with it but you're talking crazy God's not talking to you stupid no you're an asshole you're an asshole and you taking their money and we got to make sure that the this stops with our generation we got to make sure that future generations don't they don't have a a gigantic religious leader someone who tells them based on some nutty shit that was written thousands of years ago by people who drew on animal skins but also ate spreads that the way that looks with Catholicism is just one version of the problem the other problem is the guy who calls you know there's like in the way there's a pope there's also a dude who calls himself the president but instead of representing some phantasmal force called god he says i represent the will of the people yet he doesn't really represent the will of the people it doesn't seem like that when he goes till when when when they do the polls and they fight as it turns out you know and I'm not just the president of course the government as a whole the president doesn't have to talat Aryan power but I don't think that the president really represents the will of the people and I don't think Congress represents the will of the people and I don't think Senate represents the will of the people anymore than the Pope represents the will of God and I think it's this met this imaginary thing that we're supposed to believe in because it makes us feel more comfortable as though these people are really enacting the will of the people I think the will of the people is a that we want peace we want to be able to like we do want security we want education but we don't want fucking war Russia with Iran we don't want fucking war with Iran Iraq how the fuck you say we don't want it nobody wants war and if there is it's a small faction of people sweaty red-faced cocksuckers did you guys I was gonna bring this up yesterday did you guys hear about this guy who got arrested with a hundred bags of heroin up his ass no hundred bags 100 bags it was a traffic stop this is asshole he miserable you have

guy didn't do anything wrong yeah then they pulled him over he just looked weird he was tweaking out on his own something was going on with him and he was pulled over I mean the routine traffic stop but they they detected a smell of marijuana and that's where they that's where they got him and they brought him in because they smelled marijuana that's it and you have a hundred bags of heroin up his ass and you can't put a hundred bags of heroin up your ass while the cops are going from their car to your car you can't do that so he was driving around yeah what those packed up is what an idiot why would you drive around and smoke weed with a hundred packs of heroin in your ass well I think he's just one of those guys babies like how like Russian chicks would put Benoit balls and their pussy to tighten up their muster fuck muscle babies dude was just like exercising his ass story are fish maybe he didn't trust his roommates like man if I leave this 100 bag of heroin later well these

better stuff this up my ass hmm can't fit on your bags let's see five six Wow am I really gonna get 94 more bucks dr. Steven Greer if you don't know dr. Greer is there's a thing that a lot of people are aware of that came out suppose 20 2011 the disclosure project was it man 2001 2000 was that I say 11 I met one I meant right around September 11th that's where the 11 came from my head 2001 it was huge in the Internet a huge point of controversy and a topic of conversation it was you on stage introducing this disclosure project explaining how much information and you had access to about alien spacecrafts visiting earth and how many distinguished high-ranking military people and that was where it got shocking agreed with you and yeah one of the interesting thing when after we put this briefing together for Clinton and you know Laurance Rockefeller I put the concept together the best available evidence and all these cases and then Laurance Rockefeller hosted Bill and Hillary Clinton at the Rockefeller ranch and it had me out there shortly before that and mr. Rockefeller was the white hat in the family who wanted to end the secrecy unlike some of his family and and he so he said to me one night I was out on his porch on a deck in the Grand Tetons at the jy ranch and and he said we really need you to hurry up and do this and I said oh Lawrence I'm just a doctor in North Carolina I'm working in an ER you know he says no no you have to do it I said no Lawrence you you have to get these guys to do he says they will never do it and I said Lawrence for God's sakes you're old you're rich in your rockefeller he says no he says the implications of this are so vast and so profound that no aspect of life will be unchanged when it comes out I said yes Lawrence that's quite secret and then he said to me well that means those folks aren't going to do it and then you know before that as shortly after that and I had this mean with the CIA director and and and one of the president's friends came to my house and this was a very disturbing story I'm sitting at the table with my little four kids four daughters and this man who's very close friends with the president the Clinton it says to me well you know they're very supportive of what you've recommended in this white paper I said great pieces button they're not gonna do it I said why not he says they're convinced that if the president steps into this too hard he'll end up like Jack Kennedy and I started laughing thinking what a load of nonsense and he stopped me he says no they're serious I said well don't say this in front of the kids so we went to the library in my house after dinner and I said what are you talking about Kevin and he said they really think this is too dangerous I said well what am I supposed to do one of my chopped liver and he looked at me and he says yeah you're expendable so I have always viewed myself as the kind of the throwaway guy and all of this while it's they these guys you know the folks who have enormous political power and corporate power even the ones who support this very avidly and there's a lot of them they don't want to stick their necks out but I'm confused okay why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill Clinton came out and said that we may have evidence that there might be some intelligent life out there in the world you know it's like the REM song it's the end of the world as we know it because if that if that happens when that happens people would panic no no no no the public isn't going to panic over this unless this couch in a stupid way well the public definitely will panic if the president comes out and says there's UFOs and then he gets whacked hmm that would lead to panic yeah but there's a bigger problem if the president doesn't have control access over these projects he didn't want to talk about it because then it shows the fact that our democracy has been sidelined as Eisenhower warned us the girag an experience you
