oh here we go good hello Jimmy hi Joe what's going on Bobby good to see ya good to see you well we were just talking about the the air force admitting that their pilots had seen UFOs and you were telling me you interviewed one of those pilots I interviewed commander flavor and he was saying that this the chocolate has been my favorite it's with an R free forever flavor okay he was taught that mean he was one of the guys that actually went to what is the word they do when they scramble and go to try to figure out what the fuck something is but they they monitored this thing they saw it with their eyes they saw it with their equipment it was actively jamming the radar whatever this thing was it shaped like a tic-tac and it moved so fast you couldn't track it with the human eye they said it went from I think they said some some impossible number like 60,000 feet down at 200 feet in less than a second like whatever you could track you know a radar as a blip blip blip blip they don't know how fast it actually went they just know it went this insane distance in less than a second less than a radar jump thank you it would it would dated had observed them in that area without his knowledge like other Air Force pilots had observed them and then had you know brought it up the top of the food chain but it wasn't something that got distributed to everybody until he saw it when he saw he was like what in the fuck am I looking at here and they're like we have we've been seeing these things and this thing with no active propulsion system that you could recognize there was nothing around no fire coming out of it nothing around and it would just just disappear just take off at insane race to speed and actively jamming the radar so when I covered this on my show I said now I've heard reports that pilots see this stuff all the time but they never confirmed it and my question was why now why would the Air Force be confirming that they saw UFOs nagas again like they've been there's been reports that pilots have seen this stuff forever I'm not saying it didn't happen I'm saying why are they it happen now and then of course you see in this last defense budget they put in money for space for mmm I think the money for the space force though isn't that because China is able to whatever they can do to make sure we want to spend more money that's what they'll do they we saw UFO hey Chyna Hey look over there we got to spend more money that's what's flavor I guarantee you isn't in that no no I guarantee no no they're just now but before they would say that's not true they're there for us we'll go we don't acknowledge that and now they're gonna acknowledge it right you're probably right it's probably something to that that it's just about budgets and I just I want it I don't want to be that cynical when it comes to something like that really that's cynical I want to think come on that's not cynical that nothing plus to it is you're right but it's also cynical it's the only reason why they're telling us is because of how it's it's both things yeah okay I it is to point I mean look it's a hundred percent is well how they do it if they need some sort of justification for expanding their reach or expanding their budget they come up with some threat well this is this joke is just what I keep telling people and no one seems to think this is a big deal but you know the Democrats and the mainstream news have spent the last three years telling everybody that Trump is a Manchurian Candidate he's a traitor to our country and working under the behest of Vladimir Putin and while they're impeaching him they're voting to give them an extra 131 billion dollars to go bomb anybody he wants and if he's bombing at the behest of Vladimir Putin why would you give an extra 131 billion dollars now let me tell you how much 131 billion dollars is Joe please do well 20 million dollars would adding homelessness and homelessness yeah is that real though that's that's that's the way to get to that in a moment but that's let's just say it's 20 let's just say it's 20 billion a year a year not just once but every year you'd have to spend 20 billion okay guess what they're spending an extra 131 billion since Trump took office every year going forward on bomb 131 billion each so everybody's at college 110 billion we'd have no homeless people yes if they took that money and put it towards it that's a lot so somebody told me the difference between a million and a billion so I read this so the I don't know maybe you want a fact check I'm not full of shit again but so like a million seconds would be like eleven days but a billion seconds is like 33 years yeah something like that I'm not sure if that but it's close yeah so that's a hundred and thirty 1 billion dollars could do a lot of good things you know we could have our military budget and still we'd still be spending most more than any other country now why do you think that they would do that why do you think while they're impeaching him they would also approve this incredible budget increase for military because they're owned right by the military-industrial complex that's why because they you know that's the defense secretaries could just came right from Raytheon right the guy before it was Secretary of State came right from Exxon I mean come on that that's the beauty of Trump is like you'd have to figure it out they asked him the other day about you know his criticisms of how he's handling he goes you know where where they said I didn't pull out of Syria and I did but I left troops for the oil they're just there to guard the oil and it's like he just says it so which a proves he's the funniest president we've ever had oh for sure oh no doubt no doubt no doubt I thought George Bush was funny this guy he's intentionally and unintentionally the funniest president you've ever had like the other day he was doing a signing last so in 2019 was the hundred sentence 100-year anniversary the centennial anniversary of women getting the right to vote women's suffrage so he was signing a thing commemorating it the hundred year they're gonna have a coin and as he said he goes you know I heard they been working on getting this done for a long time I wonder why it finally happened now because it's Centennial is now dummy you can tell why didn't a hundred years happen faster and he's sitting around going well we get stuff done that's why it happened and they're all look at him like okay mr. president but he Street faces it it's hilarious do you think he's on speed and somebody oh well so when he did that one video with a drawer with the drawer opens actually a photo was a photo when he was eating that talk all right that's it I love Hispanics remember that it was after he said some rude shit about Mexicans say does this taco bowl thing say that with Trump Tower is the best taco bowls I love a spam yes and the drawer was open and you saw he had that stuff from England or whatever right the super red super powerful pseudo F adrene which is essentially a type of speed well it's I like him on speed better than the other guy I like the speedy speedy Trump he's entertaining well sometimes it wears off though and you see him slurring as well he really doesn't even try to finish words sometimes try but he have a hard time with words I was the one word him and George Bush both osa brontÃ« they both sovereign was that one David Pakman put a video up it showed all the different times that Trump has struggled to talk but there's one that's really disturbing because it's obvious he's under some sort of sedative or he's coming down from some speed and he's barely staying awake while he's talking it's like if you were calling if you called me at 3 o'clock in the morning and I just worked 24 hours in a row and you like hey man what are you doing literally like really but you never seen no I haven't seen it no see if he could find it because it's it's really bonkers because when you hear I'm talking like oh my god like this and there was no discussion of this it's not like he came out later and said hey guys I had a bad night last night somebody slipped me a Mickey it was a real issue well his whole thing is he's a teetotaler right Trump does nonsense is it yeah the the pseudo ever dream oh but then it turns out he's doing you know pharmaceuticals yes yeah he's doing what's legal that's what it is yeah you know if you you the doctor writes up a prescription you know there was this whole thing with what was that there was a reporter that named the Duane Reade pharmacy that he had gone to in New York to fill this prescription for a metabolic condition which he said is like a bullshit reason it was like he took diet pills and this diet pills were speed but it was prescribed by his doctor but look if you're a guy who want to fucking get shit done all yeah you want to be on speed I know people way to go I know people who say they write songs on speed like that I you know need a musician Slayer I don't know Slayer but music oh okay you know yeah that speed music I don't know what the kids list Sarah McLaughlin on speed I imagine she's like fuck those puppies yeah you know I I I went to one of those uh what they called the woman's Lollapalooza what were they called Lilith Lilith I was dating a girl oh and she took me Oh chewing oh my god she's just trying to drain you turns out I was going through mentally imbalanced time I didn't know that I was like oh I was that was what I was going through a nervous breakdown music to listen to it was that no but I do remember the what's that hard rocking woman who's really good middle there's one that's really good Chrissy Chrissy Hynde yeah from the pretenders that's it yeah she's a beast that she was there that I'm like this is good oh yeah I was like that's really good ya know I always loved her yeah she's awesome I was like let's just have her play more yeah what the fuck is this I can't remember who else was there Oh anytime you have all woman's anything or an all man's anything for that matter it's a mess like if you say this is a men's conference we're here for men that you're gonna find a bunch of bitch-ass men too you're not gonna find any real men and all men's get away let's get together and talk about our problems and they're all they all stem from bitches yeah fuck us it's a horrible situation I don't know how I don't know how a women I just feel sorry for women that I have to fuck men I do it don't you we're gross no kidding no kidding and do you ever just listen the way guys talk to women trying to get laid it's like oh my god really dumb guys that which is most guys most guys most people yeah most men and women are dumb yes fact yeah I would I would I'm close I'm ever in the dumber yeah I put it down there's gaps in my knowledge that I can't believe oh yeah and will neither / neither of us are gonna figure anything out we're not that guy that they're gonna call on there's a real issue we need jimmy dore no but that's but that's see that's the thing Joe but my whole show is that someone as dumb as me can see through this yes I can picked it I can put it together oh we're gonna admit that we have UFOs and now we're gonna have a space bar okay I can put that together that's the whole thing it's like if I can do this I know they can do this they're just not doing it I think the UFO thing is you know I know you're probably right in terms of like one of the reasons why they released it but I think there's also this when you get a bunch of like really credible people like that commander flavor guy when you get actual data like radar you actually could look at the video of the infrared infrared camera of them tracking that thing there's enough of those now that people are like well what the fuck is going on and if you guys have all this money and all this equipment is this is this something that the Chinese are doing or the Russians are doing or is this something that you can't explain and I think we're in this area where there's so much information people who can get ahold of so many videos and so much stuff that they kind of have to start talking about it now okay I you know I I see how they shut down conversations around the most innocuous of enquiries so that's true too they can just a shame pretty hard yeah they that that's pretty that's true too but when you got a guy who's like a decorated pilot like flavor mm-hmm and he's like look I'm I don't many other crazy stories in my past he's not crazy guys rocks a general all-around American hero type guy he's like look I'll tell you what I fuckin saw and it's pretty crazy about those pilots though they look like to pay them up crazy life they don't think well they have to go and write faster than the speed of sound Oh sex it dawn with the the book yeah um look Chris is a good friend of mine I think there's some of the things that Chris looks at like Chris is kind of freak he wants things to be a little on the freaky side yeah but the idea about the pilots is that they all swap slopes my wife swapping because they think they could die at any moment and they they I create this bond yes yeah they want someone to love their wife as much as they do or maybe they want to fuck their buddy's wife joke there are Trump's diet pills and then what a Badgers wife so you don't think that happened probably sure happens oh yeah especially during wartime yeah war war people shift war is crazy you know the the mind shifts when you see bodies when you've killed people when you've made these rationalizations and also you're very aware that someone's trying to do to you what you've done to people and your entire existence is you know from dawn till dusk is eliminate the enemy and this it's a it's a mindset that people slide right into it's my doctor dr. Sharpe that fucking guy Sharpe just kidding dr. Sharpe doc Sojin so dr. Charles Sharpe was uh he's the guy he's the greatest endocrinologist drunk Charles John Darrell that guy he's new he's in Pasadena Alta I almost said Pasadena ah if you said ivories out fuck what at Glendale cuz it's funnier ah I always go Glendale I always go Glendale and then then it a go Glendale and then Torrance those words is a good one Jones is good it's like why you living there what do you what do you wouldn't need a Pinto and Taurus anyway so um what was I talking about you dr. Sharpe oh so he said he smoked pot in when he in Vietnam because I told them I smoked pot right just to let him know everything that's happening with me chemically and he said that he said yeah I did it I said you ever smoke he goes yeah I did it once in Vietnam he said they would have a helicopter circling the medical he was a doctor in America and so you could always hear it constantly searching for whatever people coming at us and then all of a sudden I didn't hear it and it had crashed right so I had to go help the guy and he said I just smoked pot and as a doctor you have to be able to disassociate from what you're doing and he said I couldn't and he said so when I came up on him and I could tell this guy was going to be crippled further and I couldn't it would mess me up because so I never smoked pot again Wow I could see I could you imagine like you're new to pot you know how it makes you sense things extra when especially when you first start you know how you just extra cent and then you walk up on a scene like that like oh my god I couldn't imagine that so that yeah I probably was nothing yeah I mean that's talking about bad trips bad bad trip that's as bad as it gets yeah walk up on someone who just crashed in a helicopter in the middle of a war and you you're you're high as fuck and you realize he's crippled so let me ask you question when when you when I would travel out of the country I would always think that oh I get like a little cold flu thing every time I travel out of the country like I would get night sweats and I would kind of get a headaches and I would feel a little fluey you know and then I got this dental implant and so I didn't I so I want they say don't smoke whenever so I'm like gonna be extra good I didn't smoke for a whole week I felt like I felt when I go out of Europe I think you have a physical addiction yes I was like no way did you I'm that's why I won't ask is that ever happened to you and you travel outside the country no no but some people do have that apparently yes like night sweats the worst nights where you wake up and you're you know as soon as I take this cover off it's gonna be freezing yes I got to get up and change my t-shirt and sleep in a t-shirt and and jeans and I like to be read in timberlands what about now do you sleep before do you smoke before you go to bed is that your move of course okay so it helps you sleep oh yeah yeah how about you know it doesn't help you sleep no no no when I smoke pot I'm awake I start thinking about shit I don't want to go to sleep oh it depends when I smoke right so there's the thinkI pot and then there's the shitty but even the sleepy pot makes me sometimes it gives me a burst and but then like I smoke this stuff called GMO whoa it is the best genetically modified organisms oh I wonder if that's what it stands for yeah exactly they're trying to fuck with you they're like this GMO shit son they are fucking with me well he's working like they're genetically modifying the weed for sure I was just don't forget today I was just in port so I get this at my place over in Eagle Rock so when I was in Portland last weekend it's legal so I just walk into a pot store and I go ham looking for indica high THC he goes how about GMO go you're getting fucking buried it was great how high is it it's got like 29 percent THC what was that shit that Kevin Smith dropped off wasn't at 42% how do you get something forty-two he's going hard he's an all-day guy he's one of them all day guys he starts off in the morning just keep going yeah so that's the problem with like I love to take a little puff in the morning with my coffee or what have you but the problem is you're giving up your later night buzz because I can't get buzz more than once or twice a day that's it but cuz of my tolerance and then if I try to smoke more I'll just get headache yeah do you ever get headaches no I don't get headaches from party you don't get any of these problems I just get the in the over stimulation the I mean you would call it paranoia but I kind of welcome and sometimes because I think it's good to be hyper aware of all these different things and it makes you appreciate when you're not you know I think that that that feeling that you get when you get high when you're like oh my god like everything is fucking dangerous the world is a dangerous place and I'm gonna die someday for sure everyone around me is gonna die I hope they don't die today and the crazy thing is like these feelings for some reason aren't they even though you know those things to be a fact no like you know you're like a basically like all we are all water balloons they're like water balloons of blood with like sticks holding us together we're so doughy and fleshy and weak and vulnerable and you know like that guy found when he found that helicopter dashed and that's that's what happens to your body your body's a very vulnerable thing it's not very tough even the toughest bodies very vulnerable yeah yeah I know I I watch boxing yeah yeah see him go down oh yeah toughest guys in the world but you know what I always wondered what it I have been knocked out you've been knocked out yes okay so it's not a bit like when you get knocked out and you wake up you don't know you're like did I just get backed out I never really completely unconscious but I got TKO'd in a kickboxing bout I got drop and then I got I got hit with a bunch of other punches and the referee stopped it oh that was more like mine that wasn't weird that was the worst feeling I had ever had up to that moment it was like my legs just stopped working my butt they just shut off like this guy hit me with a left hook I was conscious but my legs just went whoop oh that's one agent though his legs aren't there you always heard them say that but like they go they literally go out they go whoo did you any of the power oh yeah they stopped working it's very strange and it's like your your brain gets jostle around inside your head and also when you get hit on the jaw there's nerves behind your jaw when your bone of your jaw slams into those nerves and your head gets rattled in the brain all of it together is like everything just goes what's happening here you know sometimes you get knocked unconscious I didn't get knocked unconscious but my shit just shut off I did I've always surprised when guys get knocked out they don't piss themselves I got and sometimes they do they when they do they do a lot of times when you choke him out oh really yeah we choke guys out they piss themselves all the time to shit themselves too if they have to shit really yeah yeah there's blood so deals like before you go fight Dee try to make sure you don't have to take a shit yeah sometimes guys do have to take a shit though like I've had guy at one time michael Chiesa who's a top UFC fighter he was right before he was fighting he looked over at me like he's as he got into the cage was dude he goes I'm gonna shit myself he goes to guarantee I'm gonna shit myself while his fights going on my fuck why wouldn't he just go to the bath couldn't it was the way it worked out like you know their call okay you're wrong it's coming but you can't go right oh no and then he just makes the rock up there and then also wait diaries like oh my god he went up winning the fight but did he shit no he didn't shoot himself huh I talked about he's I was swore I was gonna shit myself talked about him he's a funny dude no I didn't talk about it I don't think I said it I don't think I saw but I talked to him I talked about it with him after the fires like no I didn't shut myself it would be funny we were laughing about it if you could talk about it's like I think I'm gonna have diarrhea let me talk to you for a second have you heard this story well if you do you know if you have diarrhea it's like it's one of those things man I'm I've been on this carnivore diet do you know what that is no I'm eating only meat for the entire month of January just to see what it's like no vegetables none zero I had an olive and I had one piece of chili mango actually a two pieces of chili mango but uh and so is this good for you that's where it gets weird it's a really good question I don't know um I don't even know how I feel about it so what where did you get the idea to do it everybody's doing it Oh real all the kids okay so I did the Atkins thing I did that like back in 2001 or something when I needed to lose whatever I did that and that that worked like it does work it's very similar in that you know you're just you're eliminating carbs yeah you get your body to go into ketosis you're getting to buy your body to burn that's them yeah but it's the thing about the carnivore diet though is I actually checked my piss with a ketone strip and it showed that I'm not in ketosis so you pee on this you happy in ketosis no I think it's because I'm eating so much meat that when you have too much protein there's something called gluco gel assess I think it's called where your body breaks the protein down and turns it into glucose and so that fucks with your ketone levels and that keeps you from going into ketosis but it doesn't affect your energy level my energy levels have been amazing like all day long I'm flat I'm sound like people always ask me why do you always have like that cough it's this goddamn coffee his layered superfood coffee it coats your throat it's delicious it is delicious I love it when you said hey do you do you like to Burak and you want it in your coffee I'm like cut them what the fuck'd in my head I was thinking he's got today was there in the clothes the fucking tumeric tumeric goddamn coffee come on how good is it it is amazing it's amazing but I drink too much of it and I'm always like a little Flemmi because yeah it's like in my throat I'm not a big on American coffee but this is Ventech American coffee how much of his grown America mm sorry any coffee groaning all I know is that when I go to Italy and or if I go to Hawaii and I have coffee it's always better no no that's the best coffee on earth my favorite coffee comes from Kona yeah there's something about Hawaiian okay it's the volcanic soil is that what it is yeah and that same thing in Italy that's why their tomatoes taste better in their cars everything tastes better it's the volcanic soil pretty sure what does - pussy any questions I'm gonna say I'm gonna say it makes some juicier I bet right just like a piece of fruit or tomatoes juicier [Music] I would so it so funny you say that because I would just for out of nowhere I started talking about on stage last about how I you know I hate the word vagina but I like pussy the vagina word is a weird word right cuz like who's saying that other than a doctor right no you never you never in the middle of sex in her a woman goes thinking him like if she did you'd go with you sure Oh what are you doing I would say meaning with me are you experimenting I don't think a woman wants to hear that I mean maybe they have like cute little names for nicknames I had a job I had a joke where I would say oh I get it we were experimenting the other night my wife and right in the middle of sex I took it out and I stuck it in her vagina Wow totally different looks like a glove why are shot jokes but they're fun they're fired and shocked oh they're fun they're always been fun for me I don't like when people say they're cheap like no they're not cheap they're different it's a different thing you know there's really clever intellectual jokes and those are great to write I love a good fucked up joke yeah especially because you think it's going to be something cleverer and that it's just a nope bad - right in the face yeah that's funny to me it is funny yeah I'm a fan of all kinds of jokes I like I like all kinds of comedy and there's a while that we're like dirty comedy was like looked down upon as if it was easier well that it was it was Dan Andrew Dice Clay so when Andrew Dice Clay happens so a lot of people started to ape him right because he was very popular this is going back in the early 90s yeah I know if you're born yet and and so comedy clubs started expanding and they had more clubs and there were good comics so then they they started to give free tickets away and so they started to book they wanted more generic acts that appeal to people who weren't necessarily comedy fans or whatever so this is my theory about what happened and so then they would keep it clean because we don't want to offend anybody it's like that's not what fuck it that's not what people like then that and you know that's why they all closed and you know what my opinion on that is I think bad comedy sucks but bad dirty comedy makes you angry yeah that's what it is well you know what's funny is I've noticed this like if people watch a musician go up and play like even an open mic rotor and he plays a song or two and you don't like him you're still applaud after he's done blowed up the comic goes up and he's not funny it's like what people get angry because you have to listen to the whole thing he didn't talk during it yes awful yeah so that it's I always noticed that you could suck as a musician people will still play you suck as a community like this you know why also because if I go to see a musician I really appreciate the fact this person can play a musical instrument which I can't do I have no musical talent at all but I know how to talk I can talk everybody can talk and everybody pretty much everybody said at least one thing funny at one point time so you know what it's like when I say something and then it gets a laugh you know you can do it mm-hm you know what they've done is just do it more and really put a lot of time and do it you know craft and act but when that acts terrible you start thinking I could fucking do that why am i listen to this idiot well it was bad cut yeah so it was bad comics that made me think I could do comedy oh for sure open mic night right oh no was watching it on TV oh so I remember when I was in college we got comedy like a cable in our dorm room right and so I remember I was watching the show I forget maybe what was that one on a and he doesn't matter even with the improv no it was that Rosie O'Donnell 101 forgot about that yeah Fridays or something forget what it was called but stand-up spotlight me yeah maybe I was on VH yeah that was VH well vh1 was stand-up spotlight yeah so anyway whatever so I'm watching and i see this comic go up and i'm he does like to jokes i beat him to the punch line I'm on both of them right I'm like he said what I thought he was gonna say and then the third one wasn't even funny he had inverted the punchline which I didn't know that's what he did but I go he should have put that thing at the end and then I afterwards I go wait a minute that guy I'm funnier than that guy and he's on TV I think I could do this yeah right like when I would go to clubs I would go to zany's in Chicago and those guys would just be whole area and I'm like I could be funny for five minutes at a party but I can't fucking do that right but I didn't realize they were hot wet you'd do an act and you've work and you do the whole thing and so that's why I was like I can't do that those guys are special funny and that I saw guys on TV suck I'm like well I could do that I might not be able to go to zaydis but I could go to there was a time during the 80s where there were so many spots and so few comics that some really mediocre comics not on television yeah really like mundane nonsense bits yes and they all had that kind of comedy yes well you're from Chicago too which is a rough spot like it's fucking cold there people don't take any bullshit it's a different kind of thing you know like those are the kind of places that make great comics like fucking cult like Boston same shit New York fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck hold and leave a little misery hey Hong Kong fuck you and you need a yes there has to be a need for comedy yes like I guys I say just in Hawaii we did shows there I'm like man these people are laid-back yeah it's not a lot of great comics there's a few good comics that come from Hawaii but not a lot yeah not a lot is that you got it it's hard to be upset they have a lot of local humor like the comics from Hawaii they I've seen some comics from Hawaii they talked about local stuff mm-hmm you know yeah I just like a cruise ship yes like that well there yeah like the guys the guys who are lived there they do their whole act as local yeah and a lot of times they like a morning DJ yeah yeah you think about it that's a pretty great life pretty fucking great place if you're a comic and in Hawai Jesus you beat it you did it you really did first time I went to why I was in Maui as working at the some extend up book through the ice house and I got off stage and this guy comes up we're talking and I said where you from he goes I'm from Pittsburgh I go really what did you do there he goes I was uh I was a plumber I go what do you do here now I go he goes I'm a plumber I go how do you make it from a plumber in Pittsburgh to Maui he goes well one day I woke up and I realized I could be a plumber in Hawaii or I could be a plumber Pittsburgh wife makes all the sense of the world it's all this is the world yeah if I was a plumber I'd moved there yeah I know a guy who teaches jujitsu there who used to teach in he actually gave me my first lesson ever in Los Angeles and he after a while he was like fuck this what am i doing and I could teach him to Maui you know and the thing about like a place like Maui there's enough people like do you need everything like it's not like like Lanaya we were talking about earlier yeah that's a weird spot mm-hmm because there's only 3,000 people in the whole island it's like a good theater show like a good theater show and those people empty out that's the whole civilization and then there's people that fly in because it's a resort area but it's uh I was in Kauai one time too and it's similar like after I got off stage I was like hey where can I go to get something to eat there like there's no there's no place to go this is in the ocean catch it who does Laird Laird Hamilton he lives in Kauai I don't know Laird Hamilton that's the fucking coffee you're drinking bro this guy talked about it for about a half hour early I'm bad with names does that work is that a good enough excuse I'm bad with names Laird Hamilton's married to Gabriella Reece that's the giant Aquaman motherfucker mm-hmm great coffee yeah he makes killer car who thought to put to America Kauai is a spot that I need to get to I've never been to that one I've never been to that Island I've only been to Honolulu very briefly during a layover you know when I was actually the first time I was going on lanai we flew in a Honolulu first and then you have to take like a Puddle Jumper to get to lanai oh yeah those lanai is like there's nobody there around and you go on the beach is like fucking eight other families on the beach everybody just like everybody's just chill I never sleep better oh my god I never I mean when Iraq Singh I when I was in Hawai I would go to bed at midnight I wake up at 8:00 in the morning I'd slip straight through it's never happened you feel great ever yeah I come back to LA I'm really getting headaches immediately gets five like god damn it so I go go get a drink and I order a mai tai believe it or not Wilma Maui and Hawaii in general I think they have some wonky weed laws I don't think weeds legal there no no it's not it's it medical is I think that's hilarious yeah medical life is my condition I know and what I needed for life yeah um but I have so I didn't I have fans there so they just give me some uh-huh do you still do used to ever take pot from fans unit braid yes yeah me too yes just you're asking for it you are right yeah oh I thought I'd give you a little extra taste I put some acid out of it for you I don't need that right my good friend Ari Shaffir dosed Bert Kreischer when they were doing a podcast again so that's regal that's really thought it was Joe knew he gave him Molly dropped it in his drink so with their hard feelings over oh yeah there was a real problem so it was all a joke oh there's no jokes with us we don't do jokes I mean I just saw it on Twitter yeah that's real oh that shit's real no yeah so they're not pals on their back okay the wife hates them still Oh Bert's wife still ragged Verizon I would have a hard time with that yeah I only tell issue yeah I don't you know doing some like that you that's not right that's that's like 40 he knows he knows it's not right what's really interesting is I was we were just we were all joking around about it like this is the only business where you could dose your friend we all joke around about it laugh about it more nothing happens and he actually got a bump in his career like it starts selling out places faster and when he was going places who you already be doing shows and people would yell out dose me re dose me so now he's known for dosing people and before that are used to do something I should say allegedly because would this the this thing which may or may not have happened is very illegal but he would do a play in places where weed was very legal he would play a game called fine edible so he posted on Twitter who give people hints and he would leave some fucking nuclear edible like to some North Dakota guy who's gonna find it who probably doesn't get any real weed and he's gonna get one of those stars of death and he got in trouble I think in Minnesota oh really allegedly cuz I don't think they ever found any of the things he was talking about so maybe it was all just a prank let's go with that those edibles man my brother has something one time he goes it's Jimmy be careful it's called the creeper that's what they call it and I'm like I glad I have a high tolerance to wear so I ate one and have like nothing so I did the I did another one and about 45 minutes later we're at a campground talking to my parents and all of a sudden I can't remember how to breathe [Laughter] [Music] I'm so I just go I have to go make a phone call I'm in a campground so I just go to my car and I'm just laying down to the next thing I know I hear my wife behind me are you okay I go I'm not good we have to go let's go say goodbye to Brett I can't say goodbye let's just go I couldn't deal with saying goodbye oh my god so yeah turns out there is some danger to that metric oh well there's danger with schizophrenia there's a real danger with people having schizophrenic breaks when they take high doses of edibles really and even smoking it yeah well you were like you were talking about well you get that withdrawals yeah I don't get it withdrawals but there's a small percentage of people that do there's small percentage yeah so that must be like so people like all aren't you gonna quit because know if you know if if I stop that guy if I drop drinking coffee when I went overseas I would get headaches too right so it there's a lot of things like that yeah coffee is one thing that's addictive that we all just admit it's just it and we just accept it yeah we're addicted to it because it doesn't really change your state that much right were you like freaking out like you never drink a cup of coffee like me I can't get up you never on the ground tweakin but I know a couple people who have had legitimate schizophrenic breaks okay you know a couple mm-hmm yeah yeah legitimate ones legitimate ones where like something happened and then what is it we're never the same again what is literally yeah well I've heard about that with acid but I never heard about that with well it's not that much difference when you take a high level dose it can get cycles yeah yeah different but you feel like you're tripping yeah a little and you're experiencing the God saved me from the comments but people get mad at me when I talk about this but there's a thing that happens when you because I've talked about it so many times and I know I'm a repetitive fuck but even you eat marijuana your body produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolites four to five times more psychoactive than THC so as its processed by the liver you get something that's not psychoactive in the smoked form so when you smoke it you get THC when you eat it you get 11 hydroxy metabolites it's much much stronger much stronger than THC it's a totally different sensation you know people talk about the body high like yeah you feel it everywhere you really tweak out - but but of small leppe doses of that are wonderful like a little like they have these Jambo has the sprays oh I used to have one on the desk but it's a THC spray just a couple of pumps really yeah it's like a breath spray a couple of pumps and it's like God you feel great you feel really yeah but if you take 12 pumps I took 12 pumps once I did a podcast with Sam Harris and them in the middle of I took the pumps like 20 minutes before he got here and then in the middle of the podcast I'm like holy shit I don't know if I can thank God Sam is like a super articulate guy so I could just kind of like throw a question his way and he would just expend while his expanding and talking I was pretending listen but really just trying to keep it together trying to keep it together and and and make sure that I tried to sober myself up I was like trying to force myself into a state of sobriety it was about a thousand milligrams out yeah I have a hard enough time paying attention to conversations when I'm not yeah when I'm completely sober I lose my train of thought me too and I'm like why did they or I'll be sure if I'm bored right yeah not even that even though if I'm super interested I'm interviewing someone and all of a sudden I'm like oh fuck I'm not listening I'm thinking about that thing and then they stop talking and I'm like huh oh you can't do that that's the cardinal sin ah it's still good that's one thing I don't think I do overlays at least I don't I can't remember I try to really lock in its me too but then I just my mind will just get oh so I was in interviewing Tulsi and so this became to this important part of the conversation it was about how she had switched there's something about her some policies she had so I asked her about it and every I know people are waiting there was a documentary interion guy in there with her and his phone went off at that moment I asked the question but it didn't go off like a ring it went off like a scene from a movie so now I'm like what is that who's talking and then I was said I'm like what is good and then after I realized that its disguised fallen this is scene from a movie and then that but tells he's been talking this whole time oh no so then I come back and she stops sounds like you don't want someone else in the room when having conversations no no doubt what she was talking to a guy and his girlfriend was sitting right there and she just kept spinning in her chair and I'm trying to pay attention here but I'm just seeing this girl's chair I'm playing with your phone and then afterwards it was like no more no more people in here because sometimes people try to come in here and then you'll see them like hold a camera up to take a picture while the podcasts over like a you're you're fucking this thing up man this is a distraction yeah like I don't do live ones do you do you do live ones live what live podcast yeah well that's a different thing though because you know you're gonna be live yeah this isn't I mean live in front of a group of human oh you mean with William in that audience yeah but this is a lot either oh so that's so that's not live we stopped doing them live - no this isn't live no there's a reason for that oh that's good oh why what a head it's on Mount know because because often the other dad might show so like when we were in the green room me Graham and Ron will comb we're gonna do a show so we'll say things funny to each other that you can't say in public like South Park right right and so we were saying in it it's funny to us and then I was on the show and with Ron and we were talking about a gopher everyone and I almost said it and I was like oh my god so you know that you know yeah come South Park gets away with that they're the best because first of all it's cartoons they don't even look remotely human and they've been around for so long the grandfathered in they go fucking hard there there's so important see the one with the Harley Harley Davidson motorcycle riders where they called them all I don't even know if I can say it they could say it what I'm talking about they call them all the f-word the ends and the T yeah yes yes and and many more things like that good it was played on TV like yes they could play it on TV I can't say it well do you remember a time there was a time where they used to show those old Roadrunner cartoons yes where they were hyper violent yeah they were blowing things up and hitting each other have frying pans and shooting each other in the face and it was okay pushing my husband because it was old and so the new cartoons were all sanitized and nerfed up but the old ones were still on but you would watch the old ones go oh yeah this is what it used to be like well I watched some old Popeye the other day and Bluto is basically a fucking rapist yes thank you yes a straight-up rapist just grabbing olive oil like big fat face is crazy she's trying to fight him off and papas like hey let go of me girl yeah and he has to punch her and or punch him yeah he fights with Bluto and it's Bluto was a rapist yeah he dragged her away that's what that was somebody so fucking it's like a hundred years ago right so basically a hundred years ago Popeye was like nineteen thirty so almost 100 years ago and humans were just living different back then I think rape was probably really prevalent so prevalent that you could joke around about it in a fucking cartoon yeah and so so you don't go alive now because well a bunch of channels started creating their own channels with my clips and so this is what can happen so if you have a channel like and then someone says hey I'm gonna take all your clips I'm gonna take the interesting parts your podcast I'm gonna make my own channel then they can get like hundreds of thousands of subscribers with all of your content right and then they can have whatever they want put that on this other than they could use it as a white power fucking YouTube channel they're 500,000 subscribers they could use it as a men's rights channel they can use it as you know they could just switch it over and say it's not about jimmy dore anymore now it's about Bill burr and they'd just use your content which is not legal and I was like when they were doing it while we were doing the show so while we were doing the show they were making clips and then uploading them as we were lying you're still going yes so they're doing it in real time so okay I got it so now we realized that those can be taken down and then we started doing it ourselves and then we realized like the only way to really stop them from doing it in real time is to do it like film it have the podcast filmed and then have the clips cut up and then release it okay oh okay that's why okay that's a big one the other one was copyright there's a real problem with copyright strikes like if you get three strikes they fucking pull your channel so do you ever go we've gotten him we've got him before for shit that we show we've got him for before for shit that we show in the corner of the screen like the corners feel like a photograph or a video or a little tiny thing the corner of the screen we had one where we got one from a fucking a guy took a film from his like it was like a cell phone of a satellite being launched like the and we were watching it let him watch the video we got a copyright strike from that like just watching something that we really internet you can't do it you can't people own these things the big one is nature videos those fucking nature videos when you're seeing like a pack of ya hyenas try to take out a lion if you play that that's a copyright strike they'll get you for that so I had a copyright strike recently a first one only one we've ever had right that's a strike not like hey we're gonna demonetized totally different I get that all the time yeah that's all the time but a strike is serious because they can take your channel down to more of them so the and when they do that they have to put they put a stamp you know time stamp of what is the copy written audio right and someone had put a copyright strike on it at the end of every one of my videos it goes dududududu and it's just from itunes right it's not it's non royalty thing it's just it's like a it's a chime it's not even music right so it's from GarageBand yes GarageBand right yeah and so that's why LT 3 and so somebody put a copyright strike on that and I'm like that's just someone messing with me that's just so a hater and some guy from like Canada who's now living in like I'll and we've had a guy track him down and he's like yeah there's he has no obvious source of revenue as he's trolling you so he's saying that the guy who investigated said he thinks it's intelligence I'm like and so the reason why he took that claim on that was the show that he could take down every one of my videos cuz that chimes and every one of my videos so for a while I'd so until that copyright strike got cleared up I don't have a liaison it took a while and so we took that chime out of all our videos Christ yeah yes so that's so I don't yeah YouTube is weird but they're dealing with managing an insane amount yeah I don't know mo they can't and they always err on the side of the copyright holder I get why they do that they do it automatically mm-hmm yeah I mean we've gotten copyright hits for a screenshot you know when you see the video and there's like two heads and there's a small photograph screenshot the screenshot was a photo that someone that took and they were claiming copyright on that photo that was just on the Internet it's just because we had it in our scan we had we had to change the photo really yeah dude it's fucking I know and it's weird because like some people like you have a podcast that's just audio right so yeah I have an audio and video and video some people don't some people only have the video and then that video goes away the the you count on that YouTube monetization like there's a lot of people that did that they counted on that YouTube money and then YouTube D monetizes things just randomly like it doesn't make any sense of podcast with Tom Papa that were demonetized my fatty stuff uh craziest thing he is like the nicest roasts is like an offend no he's not offensive he's hilarious he's a sweetheart yeah like Tom Papa like how many did they deem on ties a Tom papa was like two or three right to the point where Papa gotten like really paranoid and he was thinking he thinks I want a new tube doesn't like me there's something going on so yet he wanted to contact some people at YouTube and he went down this journey I remember he had a he was hosting a pilot online or like TBS or something and I got called in to like do like a run-through of it or whatever and I remember I walked up to him and I go hey Tom how do you get your own TV show I really want to get one and he goes here's what you do you have to overextend yourself house you can't afford desperate yeah and you got you gotta make this happen can you imagine going back to regular TV now though with all the freedom that you have no I can't no I can't I can't even imagine going to the radio right I've got in trouble I just got in trouble right so I have to show it's on KPFK they're all nice people but you can't just cuz they're a non-profit there's certain things you can't do like you can't over endorse like I had a candidate on and you're not supposed to endorse and I can't you can't go hey go to their website and donate you can't say any of that stuff so yeah it's just that I'm like oh so how'd you get in trouble would you just so I did that with who does so that guy Jen Cukor I was running for that 25th - what the New York Times did in him was dirty that was didn't say the New York Times I just say that writer whoever that writer was the whole but there was a LA Times see it was a unbelievable where York Times one was the one with a job for ten years that Duke where he was like oh of course you're not racist it was as clear as day that he was joking it's clear as day that he was being sarcastic and so talking to David fucking Duke yeah the Grand Wizard of the KKK and he's like oh you're not racist of course you're not racist and then they take that and put it in quotes he said to David Duke of course that's right so that's that's like mr. Smith goes to Washington she's dirty but I couldn't believe that was the New York Times that hurt that one hurt because I was like like you let you think it's funny yeah like a New York Times is horrible oh don't say that all I've got left you don't know Joe you've got me got Kyle kolinsky oh right Kyle yeah yeah hi I saw I saw your interview with Kyle I love God I heard we were talking yesterday he said this shit you said good things about you always I didn't get that part oh I could after you told him he was your favorite new show oh you're my number two I'll take it I think he's the most reasonable of all the political commentators but you're a comedian right and a political commentator I think you have a dual status specialist yeah and you're funnier than him for sure oh that's feet that's all i curve he texted me yesterday New York City was 68 degrees yes he was like what in the fuck is going on then he's like I feel bad because I feel so happy it's like seasonal depression you know it's sunny out in 68 degrees like yeah it's great meanwhile the world's on fire yeah yeah yeah whatever it's warm it is warm yeah no he's great there's that's the beautiful thing about having corrupt and dishonest media is that it opens a door for honest media like you and independent guys like yourself like pac-man kolinsky it's easy this includes you it's easy to outdo them and and MSNBC or CNN or it really hurts hearing the the freight from a guy respect the New York Times is horrible that's always been what I trusted he do I know it was it was tough I was tough when I when I realized that the mainstream news media is just the mouthpiece for the establishment when it really matters therefore every war therefore every war they're repeaters that how do we get into Iraq they got jet Judas Miller to uncritically put whatever Dick Cheney told her on the front page that's why they all day of aluminum tubes front page of the New York Times and then Dick Cheney so Dick Cheney tells Judith Miller they they have aluminum tubes she prints it on the front page of the New York Times Dick Cheney then goes on Meet the Press and said look even the New York Times is reporting this that's how they do it and then Judith Miller gets it she gets an on-air job and Fox News after that you got rewarded there's that and then there's probably also access to candidates access to top official access journalist you know if you don't give them what they want they don't give you access and this is sort of the game that they've always played right that's exactly right fact that they have access and they they I've I've experienced it but what do you think why do you think they want a smear jank I mean like because they see him as an enemy of the Democratic Party because he wants to get money out of politics right so that's his big thing he has Wolf Pack and his whole thing is I don't take corporate money and that justice Democrats they don't take corporate so that's this whole thing right is about getting money out of them politics and they want to keep money in power because if you give money out of politics their whole grift is over right right then you're not worth a hundred million dollars anymore that's right how do you go from zero to a hundred million dollars as you're in Congress well you're a criminal that's that's what Truman said yeah there's there's the only kind of people get rich while in government are criminals that's what Truman said but there's like isn't it something like there's forms of insider trading that are legal if you're in Congress that wouldn't be legal if you were a regular citizen I don't know I know that they don't have them the rules that they should write I know that there's rules that I shouldn't say regular citizen but if you were like working for a corporation there's rules like they're allowed to get information and influence in terms of like how they invest all right if that's not right right that's that's extra information that I could get exactly yeah that's right extra and then they're allowed to get that information and then they're allowed to use it for their own personal profit like somehow or another that's not been stomped out yeah and that was someone there was a video I don't know if it's accurate or someone was explaining how Nancy Pelosi made all that money and I was like if I watch this fucking thing I'm gonna stay up all night it was one of those like I can't watch any more of this yeah well you have a hundred millionaire is the leader of the People's Party isn't that amazing not only that like what did you do did you sell hats or did you make that money what do you do do you make cars why do you think Nancy Pelosi impeached Trump I did impeach George Bush I don't know I'll tell you tell me as Julian Assange revealed through WikiLeaks it was because Nancy Pelosi was told in 2002 that our government was torturing people and she was a present person in a position of power and the reason why the Republicans in George Bush administration did that was so now they've got Democrats complicit in their crimes and so she didn't tell anybody about it she didn't launched an investigation she didn't blow the whistle on this so now she's complicit so what George Bush Luke wants only Republicans lose the house and she becomes leader and they go you're gonna impeach him she goes impeachment off the table and nobody could figure it out but nobody pushed her on it cuz we were just so glad we had a check on George Bush at that time well Julian Assange then reveals there's a there's the memo that shows that she was briefed in 2002 on their torture program which makes her complicit it towards her because she didn't do a goddamn thing about it did you see the interview that I did with Edward Snowden oh yeah yeah yeah that's not the first half it was very interesting yeah Danny Pelosi came up oh yeah he came up that she was one of the people that cleared they made it so that these cell phone companies have access to your data and can can spy on you and use it the government can use cell phones and also all sorts of telecommunications and essentially the video your your voicemail emails all that shit all that all that shit can can get spied through and there was it was very complicated like I don't I don't remember the exact thing that that I don't remember the exact scam like but Pelosi was involved in that there you go I mean they're all corrupt that's the whole that's that that's kind of like the mission of my show is to remind people how we got Trump people want to pretend that a corruption in lying started in January 2017 the Afghanistan papers just came out Joe that revealed that three administration's in a row lied completely 100% about Afghanistan from the day they took over to the day late left stuff like Donald Rumsfeld saying we don't even know who the bad guys are we have no idea who they are well why are we there well it may be because of the couple trillion dollars in rare earth minerals I don't know how they really think that maybe it's we would go to war from minerals come on he was crazy would try to steal somebody's natural resources do we use upset at what a small story it was I'm upset what those papers came out and then no one really even talked about and barely got it nothing so ain't nothing it justifies everything Tulsi Gabbard has been saying these Wars I rely and bullshit and we gotta get out of them and that that that she's not the one lying about him the one that's been lying about him in our government including Barack Obama that's what the Afghanistan papers prove that they've been lot we've been lied to her with the paper side some people so what happened was they did a study just like the Pentagon Papers right they do their own study that reveals that they're lying so they interviewed four hundred people that were like in the middle of generals into the military and contractors and all the kind of people to find out so they can know what would happen in Afghanistan so they revealed all this the people who they were interviewing revealed all this that at the beginning of the board they didn't know who that they still don't know who's the bad guys who were killing they were lying about they would lie that it's going well and then their personal writings would be revealing that they didn't know what the hell they were doing and so it was it's worse than you think but we can still just keep sending four billion dollars a month they're just keep sending it just keep sending it for what no one knows we're not leaving trumps didn't take us out here it's gonna it's he's an up for reelection a couple more months we're still in Afghanistan he didn't do what he said he was gonna do nobody does that's the problem and that's why we got Trump in the first place because it comes in as an anti-war guy immediately gets rolled by the military-industrial complex just like Trump did I believe that I I did believe that Trump his druthers would get the hell out of the middle east right but he doesn't really have any druthers he was like okay I'm done doing that cuz they rolled me hard enough three years of Russia gate I'm gonna do what they want well you saw the conversation that he had with one reporter we talked about the military-industrial complex and about how they want to go to war yes I mean Trump looked actively while in office this is like an Eisenhower thing like as he's leaving while in office it's talking about the military barely got mentioned I know and so I so I think that's why the establishment wants to get rid of Trump even though he does their bidding gives them their trillion dollar tax cuts nobody asks how were gonna pay for it he gives him he tries to go into Venezuela he tried he tried to do it you know he's doing Iran he didn't come out we didn't get out of Syria we're not out of Afghanistan keeps sending more people back to Iraq it's amazing what what's happened the exact opposite of what he ran on is happening so why do i why do i think this happens it's because just what eisenhower said is he left he says did we the undue influence of the military industrial complex and mention they just invented 131 billion dollars more worth of work for Raytheon and Boeing and Halliburton how much money that's the recording music business make a year I'm 80 Billy I mean how much does it we've just invented a whole nother economy just since Trump got an elected 131 extra billion let me just think what you could do with that you could build 131 Yankee stadium's do you think every year non-sena Klee do you think that a lot of this impeachment stuff and a lot of the scandal stuff is really a distraction for a lot of these things they're pushing through yes it's a hundred percent distraction and just like I told you because if they really believed that he was doing all these things and he wasn't why would they keep giving him extra money to go bomb people that his own because they they they don't try to put handcuffs on him so that's how you know they're full of shit and the reason why they're coming at Trump in the way there's there's waste so now they're starting to oppose him because of this Iran thing so now you turn on CNN and Chris Cuomo goes hey why doesn't Congress do its job and take back the War Powers that they gave unto the president under this a um so now which is what I predicted what happened with Trump the silver lining of a trump presidency was all the shit that the Democrats Republicans have been agreeing on which is war fracking oping the Arctic to drilling and all that stuff gassing immigrants at the book now we're all gonna become aware of it well the Democrats spent three years doing freaking Russia gate so they didn't ever oppose him on that stuff and they let him keep doing it and so now people are starting to become aware of what's happening and so now Chris Cuomo is going hey why don't why don't we why does it in Congress do their job why are you letting crazy president Trump well they just gave him a hundred and thirty one but they they gave him his spying powers again through the Patriot Act they this guy who's working for Putin you're gonna give him spying powers you fuckin bullshitter they're all fucking bullshit errs that's a weird scam yeah Joe if you thought a guy was working for Putin would you give him an extra hundred thirty 1 billion dollars to go bomb anybody at his own pay by the way that's also intelligence is that a rhetorical question yes so it so that's why and you know people people give me a hard time about support tulsi right it's like why use but I think it's really important to have an anti-war voice that has you know speaks from experience she's actually in the military right now she actually volunteered to go serve in their illegal wars and then they smear for it it's kind of amazing well she's a weird one right because she has so many characteristics that you would think that everyone who is a progressive would want as president she is a veteran who twice served overseas took twice deployed she's been a veteran for a long time long time congresswoman she's from Hawaii she's I mean I guess she's Hawaiian you would say she's a woman of color they say she's a woman of color what color it's like she's Tanner than me is she well she lives in Hawaii that's why yeah I don't know about these things I'm white I don't know it is really I mean the Hawaiian roots are essentially Polynesian and South Pacific travelers who landed thousands of years ago on those islands so yeah I mean it is essentially a person of color either way she's in a very articulate rock-solid woman and they've tried to find a bunch of dirt on her and they can't and they and they don't know what to do and it's just funny to me that a lot of people who were supporting Elizabeth Warren were shitting on Tulsi as hard as they can and of course Elizabeth Warren shows her true colors she she does a right wing sexist smear on Bernie Sanders was that was weird this is what a crazy fake smear like nobody's buying that so it was it was heard the media and the DNC got together and they're like hey let's do this cuz it was coordinated this didn't come out of nowhere right and CN n to see that story see it and wrote these to people who heard it from these other two people who were not even gonna name and that's on CNN that's CNN that's how they do it it's so great yes they're digging their own grave though what they're what they're doing is they're making themselves less and less relevant and they're making guys like you and independent people more and more relevant and more and more trustworthy and that's why they keep going to the catnip of Russia gate or Joe's tweets or whatever at Pietschmann and this phone call to the thing and you know look how they look how the media runs interference for the establishment it's amazing like you know to pretend that the Biden's aren't corrupt I know this and to have people come on and go that's a that's no corruption it's been looked into there's no corruption that a guy has an $83,000 job on a board in a country his dad just helped overthrow what are you fucking crazy it seems like it might be a little corrupt well the conversation where he tells the prosecutor that if he's not gone you don't get the billion dollars right what do you know they fired the guy right saw that video so yeah I've saw that video and did but the defense to that is they're saying but that prosecutor was corrupt and the next guy was even more tougher of an investigator but that guy was investigating verismo at the time yeah and that guy it did say later that guy who got fired said I got fired because I was investigating BER is mo he said that in a court document so believe me they're all Crider why didn't they why didn't they impeach Trump on the emoluments clause why didn't they do that why did they do it on the lawn so that's him benefiting off his position in government it's because they all do it why do you think because it would bring up everything you would have to that's right hey Hillary Clinton I mean Chelsea Clinton's got a nine million dollar job for she deserves oh my god she did she did the best so then people are saying that people are saying what's wrong with the woman using her degree she has three degrees I wonder how she was at for able to afford those three degrees I wonder she overcame all those obstacles did she did yeah so if they're all corrupt that's that's then that's the story and that's why we had Donald Trump clinging to this system that's why we don't have a functioning medical system or a functioning banking system because Barack Obama was paid off by the bay by the health insurance companies and the Wall Street banks and that's not me saying that that's Dylan Ratigan an award-winning Bloomberg reporter says that how'd they pay him off uh well he has a I don't know if he noticed he just bought a house at Martha's Vineyard from the guy who owns the Celtics he says yes forty has 49 acres he's got a lot of money forty-nine that's more acres than Kevin Hart wow that's a lot of acres yeah that's that's the guy who's a community organizer I guess it was a gated community [Music] but how did they pay money how does that work here how's that work where it's legal like how does how does the the president get pushy when he left tot when he left the presidency he goes windsurfing with Branson for a while right as we still don't have clean water and Flint and and then when he comes back in the public life the first thing he does he goes to make speeches for equity firms we had a half a million a pop yeah for 20 minutes Pete what do you think that is what do you think all this is this is a bribe what are you after the fact yes yeah but it's amazing that they still honor that that they're so rock solid in their commitment to this corrupt system that even after the guy can't even help him anymore he's out of office they hook him up with these speaking jobs right he gets a half a million bucks a pop and then whatever he wants to do yeah was another thing about the Clinton Foundation where Bill Clinton would he would make sure that he got speaking gigs along with that weapons deals that she was giving yes yeah this is correct yeah everybody's again they're dirty we didn't get Trump because the Democratic Party was doing their job right their people were got desperate and decided to take a chance on a political novice game show host who they knew was a bullshitter everybody knows Trump's a bullshitter they were that good go bullshit those people we hate yeah and that's deceit and iÃ­ve been imploring the Bernie campaign which nobody listens to me so it doesn't matter why don't they listen to you I don't know maybe because I communicate in a caustic way Joe but I I've been trying to burnish is should be wiping the floor with these candidates he that shouldn't even be close right Minh so I've been employing them Bernie take the gloves off would you quit turning to Joe Biden and saying my best friend Joe Biden you got to do what Trump did what Trump was running he ran against the Republican Party he ran against all those pukes that the people are sick and tired of that the people have been let down by these are the people who took you to Iraq these are the people who took you to Libya these are the people who are bankrupting you these are the people so that's what he did and and you know Bernie gets up and he goes drove my good friend I just want you know you're corrupt it's like quit saying you're friends with these fucking guys to work erupt quit do just what he could land it he should turn and I've been begging he came close in the last debate he kind of killed it in his voice tell I'm not good at impressed he's my good friends the best buddy got right there that was a pound one Joe Biden the reason why you can't understand how a medicare-for-all works is because you're corrupt and you're paid not to understand and we're gonna get rid of your brand of corruption when I'm president cuz you're the problem oh my god people would go crazy the place would go fucking crazy and Elizabeth Warren would stand up for Joe Biden that's all I'm a sexist piece right and everybody would see what the game is wasn't he like always in the name of Elizabeth Biden yeah Elizabeth Biden Elizabeth Warren wasn't he always in support of her Joe Biden yeah no no no no Bernie Sanders yeah II was always in support yes so Elizabeth Warren and was like hey Bernie's policies are pretty popular I'll pretend like they're mine yeah well she's a Republican people forget until she was 47 years old Yeah right forget that yeah well Burt while Bernie was running around telling people that a woman could be President she was still a Republican yes FYI yeah so it's amazing that you know it's like is anybody gonna vote for Elizabeth Warren over Bernie it's like vaping that's what I say it's like just smoke the real thing right well there's a lot of people that still just want a woman president that's right yeah and I understand I understand that but you you got you can't let identity trump policy you got a you you know that's what identity politics well we're gonna have a woman who's not as good as a guy or and we'll have a woman who could be it's like no you're supposed to marry them together you know you can't just just because of her identity that's not good he's gonna torture her if she makes it if she becomes the nominee she felt honest shit she's handle Meghan McCain the

going on you haven't been doing a lot I go out but it's like I don't drive as far as I should are you do you go to the store I get it you know what I've never worked at the store how dare you I did actually send an email I go hey I want to do my show down at the store in La Jolla yeah cuz I want to go to San Diego again do you oh that Club is one of the greatest clubs in the world it's like store down there that store down there is perfect it's perfect it's like a perfect comedy club I sent an email I didn't get in return oh well they're probably booked it's so booked every blow that you know the store has never been more popular right now it's sold out every night yeah I know I did yeah I should start going there I just gotta get out my ass I just gotta get off my go to you know I go to flappers which is in Burbank so it's real close to my house and I go up I go up there a couple times a week and it feels good then I go to the comedy magic club on the weekend it's good club that's a great I love in there and I go to the improv randomly yeah and so that's that's pretty much my how often you getting up a week just maybe you know two or three times well that's not too bad it's not you buy it's not good yeah I'm doing three sets tonight see that's what I'm talking about yeah do a lot of reps about reps all about reps it's like Alan hate my out my friend Allan Havey goes to New York and now he who works at that um the Comedy Cellar and they have like three venues now so he just has to make one call and he gets three sets a night if I could just go out and need to have to travel far it's like all real close yeah that's yeah that's there's nothing better than doing three sets a night right well stand-up is like I feel like it's like running like you want runners endurance you want to be in shape you got to run you have to run and stand up you have to do stand-up you do it you get into it you get the rhythm you get the groove you feel you feel it once you start thinking over thinking it yeah and that happens with you know if you have too much of a break for me anyway I start to overthink it I starts to get nervous yeah of corner vez oh yeah if you take time off I was take you feel uncomfortable that's the best way to describe it's not absolutely nervous cuz I know jokes I know how to tell him right but I don't feel comfortable right yeah it's a totally yes I was in um so just in Portland this last weekend did helium up there no I do the Alberta Rose Theatre and I had to write a whole new show cuz we came back too soon like six months ago we were inside to write a whole new fucking show and I was really sweating it I didn't realize how how nervous I was you know like I and so when I got on stage like about thirty minutes in it was going good right I got my appetite all of a sudden I was hungry and so I got a calzone I had to eat it on stage yes what I was starving I had another two hours ago my show goes two and a half hours and sometimes eight while you're on some might sound like I have to get yeah right it's got a calzone handle it they all went and got calzones they sold out so you had a break no we just sighs I'm doing the show I have I had three people up on stage with me I had you in the calzone business are you the Nancy Pelosi of Callan's I how's that what's going on you know I have I have some interests in calzone know how you can do that that's I I've often looked I'll be on stage and I look down and chicken wing I'm like I could eat that fucking thing right now really I get ya so as soon as my nervousness goes away like I'll get hungry yeah that's so weird yeah while you're on stage you get hungry if I'm yeah cuz my nervousness goes away oh no I understand so before that because of the nervousness you can't eat yeah so you go onstage hungry yes but you probably should be but I don't feel hungry when I go out say this I feel like a naught or whatever and then the nervousness goes away everyone well yeah I got a fucking to eat something mm-hmm you go onstage and you do two and a half hours yeah whoa yeah a lot of time well let's not stand up I'm now I have video that's right you're doing your shit video time doing a video show yeah so but we write jokes for the videos and everything it's not just guys doing a podcast right that makes a little more sense that you want to eat in the middle of it yeah a little more sense cuz I look if you're on stage doing your ass oh yeah you can't if I'm doing my act that's why I say I often doing my act I've looked like I'd like to have a piece of that chicken you can't do that like I could play a video that's gonna be a minute like oh so that's what you need to come back yeah do you worry about shit flying out of your mouth were you talking I do not worry about that because if people already like me okay that's good yeah that you know it's such a freeing such I don't have to convince anybody or and that's the weird thing with my kind of calm like I like to go up in front of people who don't know me to Surprise them and it's in a way like watch I'm gonna but I also have to get into it a little gentler yeah gently I don't get more gentle yeah so I have to get into I have to act like hey my brother said this you know or hey why did I'm stood um I don't get it you know like why why is the government against workers strikes but they're for a military strike you know as opposed to the way you would do it in front of your crowd yeah yeah in front of my crowd up much more you know amped up and angry or what have you that make sense yeah yeah it's a weird thing right there's a catch-22 to that cuz like if you play to your people all the time you can get soft cuz they'll laugh at stuff just because they like you that's right and then a regular audience be like what the fuck are you talking about that's right there's some people that I've seen where they do well especially like some podcast folks they have a crowd and then the people will come to see them when they do their shows and like oh they're just happy to see you in you well but then you go do a show a Rando show on the fucking improv was like five other people especially that lab that lab is hot deaf at the improv yeah that little tiny room it can be it's set up all fucked up the doors right next to your stage you're on stage and you hear the door and see people walking in the bar is enormous it's way too big it's like if if everyone in the room was a rabid alcoholic maybe you could justify having a bar that big in a room that small then that's funny better you know but now that you mentioned I'm I guess I noticed that stuff but did you like that room on fire this really should take sage through that room I injured of ghosts in the way not far I enjoyed it because there's no waitresses right not that I don't like waitresses you go put it your Ostrom go get you if you want to drink you go to the bar oh so nobody walks around in front of you with this so it's indoors no distractions people just sit there all your anti waitress a male bartender a rugged you know we just got done making fun about Kyle kolinsky got in trouble for making fun of Elizabeth Warren's dancing he didn't get in trouble that Booker guy went out like that is nonsense you virtual signaling dummy that is so silly if he made fun of everything he made fun of cory booker's Jos dad Joe made fun of the thing that's that but if he makes fun of Elizabeth Warren all of a sudden that sex is that this is his quote well you see what he said it like it was so clunky like I'm sorry you had 18 year-old autistic college students get to talk for the first time yeah yeah yes so clunky yeah how did you formulate this this sentence did you really feel this then and who do you thinks gonna believe this what is the people who are gonna believe this what you would they already like you the most of the people are gonna see right through this thing so it was just to me it's like you know it's a schizophrenic message from people like that Lisbeth Warren's defenders it's like well women can women can do anything except take a joke I guess dance you're dense let's watch that video Elizabeth Warren desi if you're not making fun of that you're out of your fucking mind if there's a thing to make fun of why do white people think this is dancing by the way you ever noticed that George Bush dance move and then then she does this to undo that I think Ellen maybe may do that I don't know Elon must do to de Cielo Neal uncle China I took his jacket off threw it on the ground was dancing it's having a good time I guess that's okay I gotta cuz that pops yeah he's not running for anything exactly yeah and everybody made fun of it nobody accused anybody being sexist really yeah dancing was hilarious we'll play that first well played that second let's play the Elizabeth Warren one first because it Elizabeth Warren one it's so fucking ridiculous you're watching her dance and you're like how how dare you say I can't make fun of this how dare you how dare you fine obviously it's by the way it's not like somebody put up a cell phone video of her dancing at a wedding no one's gonna get make know was that's okay you're gonna she's on stage trying to get something from people and she thinks this will get it for ya here we go here she goes oh here she goes here she's up there I don't know if you can play that music so she decided yeah we can't play that music so it's uh we're gonna dancing so first of all this isn't that no there's no one with Julian Castro is in the background this is a different one this is her oh there she goes though oh no she did there do ya oh no that would know she keeps doing this if she looks like her back is welded like I saw what yes you're right she's barely real it's about being white mmm you know those weird because I thought she's Native American well that's what I said you know but so obviously Bernie's lying about saying women can't win or Elizabeth Warren is lying about him saying that and I'm not gonna accuse a Native American of lying I'm just not gonna go good for you she is one one-thousandth Native American so that's that's real that's a real number so it might be mm she's 70 that hot her moves shouldn't be like very last right that's a lot of 70 year olds that are not there good point 70 she actually looks pretty good for 70 because bernie looks like shit right Bernie head is in the middle of his chest it's like it's like falling on if I was his friend I'd be like bro you got to work on your posture we gotta get you some spinal decompression okay do some yoga classes you're gonna your head's gonna fall when you meet him he's taller than you think right that's right for you yeah you meet him like oh I thought it's supposed to be up here I thought for sure I was gonna be taller than him when I met him you ever have that happen I thought for sure I'm gonna be too or uh any any was he's way taller than me well I'm 5/8 I always assume I'm shorter than everybody meet him okay pretty much so uh unless they like a tiny person I thought Chris Hedges was gonna be six five when I met him and he's saying like he's a normal guy yeah it's normal that tall if you met Chris Cuomo afraid Oh Fred you call afraid oh no he'll read my shit if I do he'll wreck your shit and throw me down some stairs that was so revealing who are you are you 16 but you know that Fredo is the N word for oh we've all said we've all said we've been saying that for years get fed it fettuccine L N word that is so fucking dumb and say that the idea that he thought that he could pass it off and he knew they were filming right yes yeah how do you not so it's like Colin saying that to an italian-american is like using the n-word like oh is it really guess what here's the thing about being Italian there's no word for us there's no word for us you can call me a Guinea you can call me a greaseball it's like okay doesn't work whereas no word they don't work they work for my grandfather's day I used to talk to my grandfather because you know he was an immigrant and he came over from Italy and he told me all the horrible shit kids in school would say to him all the horrible shit people history yeah guineas back then were they were they were talked to like trash immigrants like they were they wanted them to go home they didn't want him there and there was a lot of dispute between the Irish and the Italian yeah once were thought of the way a lot of racist people think of Mexicans like they're coming over here to take our jobs coming up they're investing our neighborhood with their smells and their food in there they want to talk their language like my grandparents always spoke Italian in the house always they smell great depends what you like I love Italian food so it smells great but they always talked Italian my grandmother and my grandfather always spoke at town each other yeah they lived in an Italian neighborhood up until it changed they lived in Newark New Jersey okay which was all town so it seems like every wave of immigrants becomes the new horrible person right so I grew up because when I was Irish and they talk about how the no Irish need apply all that stuff and then you know I mean that's what it's just there's waves of this right and now the wave is you know Mexicans the scapegoats but you know there's that documentary they did a while back a day with no Mexicans uh-huh but it's true everything would fucking shot down especially Los Angeles no kidding but most of the country most of the country this is the dirty secret about the United States of America is that we rely a lot of it shouldn't say we a lot of industry podcasters doesn't really rely on illegal immigrants but a lot of industries rely on illegal immigrants and it's it's a fucked up situation to be in for them because they really don't have a path to become legal even if they've been proven right for decade after decade that they're a viable contributing part of our culture because they got over here illegally even if they came over here as a child that we can't we can't let you stay you know and that's another thing you know the immigration had they've been scapegoated since as far as I can remember Bill Clinton so Bill Clinton if you go back there c-span videos of him saying Mexicans coming here taking our jobs and all that stuff used he did all that stuff and Hillary Clinton she bragged that she voted for a border wall so our barrier was a fence in some places about she bragged used to brag about it and so then Trump comes along and turns it up another notch and they're like this guy's fuck yeah it's like no you guys went so I make this point he just says it in a way this yeah it's very offensive and it's wrong right when he of course it is but what I'm saying is he's building off of a bunch of shit that defense have been wrong just like when they tweeted out those so you find out this is what I say oh he banned all the Muslims at the airport then you find out why are they at the airport brocco bomb has been bombing them for eight fucking years Street he dropped 26 thousand but they ran out of Bob's then you find out he's putting immigrants in cages you find out about Barack Obama built those cages then you say find out that Trump is gassing immigrants at the border and you find out Barack Obama also guessed immigrants at the border and they should be honored they were gassed by the lesser of two evils so there is the silver lining and it's finally starting to come out because the Democrats have run this Russia gate too that it's done they did the mullet report it's over he concluded there is no collusion it's over so now they moved on to impeachment but now he's bombing so they're finally starting to talk about the War Powers Act they're finally talking but nobody's talking about cutting the Pentagon budget did you hear do you hear that I don't hear no do you think the the main the main thing about impeachment is supposedly that he tried to get Ukraine to investigate his political parade Joe Biden right that's the main thing that's what they say take that out and there's basically nothing right and and and people aren't really that upset that he tried to half the country for sure aren't upset that he tried to investigate so many people are clinging to this as if this is a repeater makes sense because they think that he's not presidential that's it yeah that as aaron Mattei says who's the only guy I know who won an award for his Russia gate coverage because he debunked it like a good report is supposed to do but he he always makes the point that Trump is not a suitable steward of imperialism and they think he puts an ugly face on the shit we've been this is what I've this is the Trump puts an ugly face on the stuff we've been doing all along and so now people are gonna be more aware of it and we would have been more aware of it if the Democrats would have actually opposed him on substance instead of Russia gay he says things sometimes ego you are just allowed to write your own speech like we knew when he was talking about Baghdadi that he died like a dog senior like what you're allowed to say that he died like a dog or how about that this is the weird thing that he uses Twitter to threaten other countries like when he was talking about Iran that if they respond they will respond in perhaps a disproportionate manner mmm-hmm like you're using Twitter mm-hmm to threaten like nobody ever thought that there was gonna be this sort of a venue for a president to just just have mouth diarrhea mm-hmm and that's why they I mean I really believe that's a big reason why a lot of the establishment wants to get rid of him because he makes them look bad because they agree with his policies the Democrats just gave him everything he wanted they paid for his fucking border wall they gave him expanded spying powers they gave him my extra 131 billion to go bomb people they helped fast-track as judges they fucking also helped him deregulate Wall Street what the fuck aren't they doing for him and that's why we have Donald Trump and that's why it's important that Bernie gets in that's why it's important that he overcomes their cheating and I just want Bert you talk about schizophrenic like Bernie has a schizophrenic strategy like people are upset that I critique his strategy I want pretty to be stronger I want him to win and I want him to so like he could come on give a speech where he says I'm running against the Democratic establishment and people go crazy right because we know that's the problem and then he'll do a video where he endorses the DNC like hey give us money we got he listed a video with all the Democratic candidates talking about unity and you ate every campaign had to pay 170 thousand dollars to the DNC to be included in that video why because the DNC is bankrupt why because no one's donating to it and so they have to extort money out of their own candidates saying if you don't give us 170 thousand dollars each to do this unity video we won't have any money to help you once you win the nomination so they all pointed up and they're all in it and Bernie's in a unity video where he's supposed to be speaking against millionaires and billionaires there's two billionaires in the fucking video Tom Steyer and Bloomberg we got to come together with boo billionaires to oppose no they are the fucking problem is the problem he's not he's the guy who instituted stop and frisk he's the guy who says New York needs more billionaires those are the fucking guys who are the problem and if Bernie would just get stopped you know playing footsie with them in a sense you know and just bash them I think it wouldn't even be close they would say he's got like Barack Obama he's got to over win because they're gonna cheat him so he has to over win you know and I tell you what if he picked of tulsi gabbard as his vice president he would crush Donald Trump because there are a lot of right-wingers and there's a lot of independents there's a lot of anti-war people who are upset with the Republican Party a lot of independents libertarians were set and they like her because she's a and all the things that you like about her she's young she doesn't fly off the hip and she's proven herself as a patriot all that stuff what do you think they're doing who do you think they're leaning towards for the nominee do you think they want Warren oh the establishment yes yeah the devil that's why the DNC the media and Elizabeth Warren's campaign coordinated on this latest sexist hit on Bernie Sanders but it's not working I don't think so I think it's backfiring it's it should backfire it's just it's amazing that the the Pocahontas stuff that she's gotten as far as she has is with lying about being Native American and using it to get a job and the way she lies about it but she's such a bet again she's also a bad liar like when Megan McCain can twist you at a pretzel that's not good you know when you cheat she went on some podcast with these black guys I don't even ever see that video where she's being interviewed by three black guys and this broad yeah they just tear her to shreds was that Charlemagne is that on The Breakfast Club I think maybe I don't know you don't know anything Charlemagne sharp as fuck I think he went after her for the whole native yeah thing and she was just basically saying well it's a family worry that we he nailed it was it was easy you know it was like you got you talking to Barry Weiss questions Karen what is a toady mean Charlamagne tha God calls Elizabeth Warren the original Rachel Dolezal that's right yes that's right yeah that's what he did yes yes yes yeah yeah that is that's a hilarious thing to say the original originals though well she used it to get a job I mean she really did and she didn't give any of that money back I mean didn't she get a job at Harvard because of that she claimed she did it she claims she did but it was on her application yeah she was Native American reason why yeah and she's just saying this because our family but she was saying she's Native American like that's the whole thing you're a heart a hundred percent that I don't know what she was right I know it's it's really come back to bite her in the ass no huh not enough she still bouncing around I think that's how lier like she's a she's a person that makes up a past she's created a fake pass and she did it back when there was no DNA test available so you can get away with being Native American it makes you look like you're well first of all you're kind of cool right everybody like never see that movie Vision Quest no great movies Matthew Modine his buddies like fake Indian his buddy lied about being Native American he had a mohawk and everything he was playing up the Native American thing because people want to be Native American it's a cool thing yeah you know that they're they've thought to be more spiritual more deep and interesting and and it's certainly more oppressed so if you say that if she says she's Native American oh look at this Native American woman who made it all the way to be President it's exactly yeah meanwhile she's like what like 1 mm Native American is that what it was some ridiculous ridiculously small numbers right so suggestion when she got her DNA test Trump said that you if she was Native American that he would give a million dollars to charity give her a million dollars some of that and since she was like well time to pay up like what did you look at the numbers yes she did yes she did Joe like that everything you're saying right now is sexist I hope you know that fuck yeah everything you're saying is saying mmm must be right I'm talking about a woman what do people you know what I you know you talk about how you feel bad about the New York Times that being yes because I know I know that feeling you wanted somebody to be what what are the other news people like at MSNBC and see what did they think when they see Tucker Carlson kicking their ass doing war coverage isn't that fucking amazing the tucker carlson thing was interesting right amazing he seems at least partially independent like hawai is he allowed to tell the truth about war at foxnews i don't fucking get that they're not allowed to tell the truth about war at CNN or MSNBC well shepard smith was allowed to tell the truth to but he's so sorry truth but he was against her why i really the fuck out of here yeah again there's lots of truths he didn't tell also so that's why did you see bombshell no what is this that's the movie with the Roger Ailes movie oh I started watching that oh man that guy who's the actor that from Australia what's his name Oh whoever that guy is he's fantastic in balm what business that John Lithgow and bombshell though if you're thinking of the Dick Cheney movie I'm thinking of a series there's a series about Roger Ailes and Fox News oh and now this is a movie Haydn's this is a new Charlize at all oh really yeah well she plays megyn kelly oh really yeah yeah so she ain't playing someone else attractive ni WRC is a nonprofit working to protect Native women from violence more than half of Native women have experienced sexual violence and the majority of violent crimes against Native Americans are perpetrated by non natives send them your 1 million dollar check real Donald Trump so she's saying that because she's Native American she tested like a trace amount like it really it's probably like she blew a Native American guy in college well when it is by the way real Donald Trump I remember saying on 7/5 you give me 1 million dollars for charity if I choice my DNA showed Native American ancestry I remember and here's the verdict Warren tests were worn reveals test confirming ancestry yeah but it's such an insanely small amount uh-huh god I am 1.6 percent African I am 200 times more like a Native American that's real yeah l-o-l so imagine I mean I thought that when she said she got fired from teaching and then the video came out said she quit I thought that would be the end that should be the end too I got called from talking about that oh you are successful I had a Clinton advisor come at me a Bill Clinton advisor hmm that's hilarious the advisers should all shut the fueling up you would think you were so lucky you're not in jail you only flew 26 times with Jeffrey Epstein it's not a lot of times he was a good guy he had a nice jet we flew around we saw the sky things we had a couple drinks you do a good Clint it's all right it's not that good Jeffrey Jeffrey actually does a good clan but that's because he's got hours and hours and hours of tapes on me am I trying to do an impression it sounds like a drunk Irish no you're Bernie's pretty damn good but bill is so obvious $27 yeah there it is you know why $27 cuz that's my social security number 27 that's good yeah he's cuz he was the 27th personal life I told joke Joe yeah it was funnier in 2016 I get it okay but any Bill Clinton adviser calling you a sexist yeah that is it that's right damned hilarious that's rich did you write to come off your dress before you called me a sexist that fucking guy goof when he dies there will be stories yeah well there's already stories it was just we just haven't heard them oh yeah yeah but I mean it's just it's amazing how much they can keep quiet well it's amazing that the Epstein thing just comes and goes and nobody gets nobody nobody gets thrown running out of office nobody gets nothing nothing fucking nothing well how about the fact that they accidentally erased the first attempted suicide video whoops we accidentally erased that too how about they erased all the torture videos I mean they did that too CIA did that they lie to Congress on camera they did its Joe we're living in it happens yeah things go bad what does jesse ventura say he says uh when yeah telling the truth is if I couldn't forget that quote but when you're living in the universal deceit telling the truth is a treasonous actress mm and I just said it earlier Oh Jesse Ventura yeah he was gonna run for president wasn't he he as an independent I don't know yeah I think he toyed with it his bloomberg's don't right yes he is yes I don't hear anything about he's spending tons of money on ads and stuff and so is uh Steyr steyr they say was like number two and he got himself up to like number two in South Carolina or something because of all the money he's spending and you talked to people who lived there they guy went home for Christmas and every third commercial was a Tom Steyer commercial so it's a local thing market yeah so he's like okay I might not win Iowa but I can maybe put all my money into South Carolina so do you think the establishment wants to Lizabeth Warren cuz she's because of the fact look she's willing to play ball yeah she wants to be president yes she was a Republican forever and then she switched over became a Democrat this thing about him Bernie being sexist is so obviously a political ploy it's so transparent and really gross yeah so now when someone acts so now when they call Trump a sexist it doesn't land right exactly the cried wolf to me that's exactly what I mean you at they teach this to six-year-olds don't cry wolf and here they are an entire organization that's the establishment has been crying wolf it's crazies motherfucker these motherfuckers what do you keep looking at your shirt for I spilled that did you notice that see how I'm noticed I'm observant I am so huh so how many times you go out in a week how many times I do shows yeah stand up it depends on the week but always at least for this week I'm only working Tuesday and Wednesday night because I've got to go and do the UFC this weekend in Vegas and I didn't schedule a gig and but a regular weekend boy depending on from on the road or here if I'm here I mean on a regular week I work Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday I do that all the time I'll do multiple sets a night I'll do the store I'll do the improv you like to do the ice house okay so I change subjects real quick do you watch boxing yes did you watch fries yes what whoo you got fat he was party why did he do that he had a good time he fucked up got rid of his trainer he did a lot of things wrong they at first they were saying he lost too much weight did you remember that but that was just because there was a photo that he was doing like the Instagram oh is that it okay if you like okay yeah like I gave nothing nothing gives me more excited than a good boxing match well that fight should have been a great fight but Andy fucked up yeah he really fucked up an Appalachian afterwards he was asking for a rematch I'm pretty sure he trained himself to for that yeah I think he did yeah well he was I know for a fact why would he do all that he was partying because he became the heavyweight champ in the world in an incredible knockout and I bet everybody was kissing his ass and he bought a Rolls Royce came to the podcast oh yeah they did the podcast he came at Rolls Royce yeah whoo which doesn't necessarily mean you're going off the rails but it's a really good invitation yeah I mean if he showed up in a fucking Caprice Classic I believe this guy's dialed in yeah he's focused yeah he's gonna get this one that's got old cop cars driving around that's bench seats let's go get the champion yeah he's he's Rocky Balboa but he he had his chance and they're not gonna give him another one no because he can beat a lot of guys yeah but I don't know if he could sell a lot of pay-per-views especially after that second performance the problem with the second performance is the second performance was so piss poor that you're gonna need multiple like big wins and fights before people take you seriously again again and he needs a real nutritionist he really does even though he he won being fat there was a lot of factors in that fight one big factor that I have heard from people who are very knowledgeable and in the no insiders was that Anthony Joshua was hurt in training that he got rocked and maybe even got ko'd when he was training and not not too distant from the fight really two weeks out from the fight got ko'd yeah oh that's not good when you're a heavyweight and you're slinging those fucking gigantic fists at each other like yeah all those guys need to do is catch each other once just once boom apparently it just happens all the time there was a Russian heavyweight boxer who was just criticized because he showed this video of a sparring session where he flatlines his trainer or his sparring partner with one punch happens it happens all the time for the knockouts you see in the ring there's probably you know dozens more you'll never see with top fight top-flight guys that are just you know they're bringing in guys like when Klitschko was the champion he brought in guys like the Joshua would have spar with he brought in guys like Deontay Wilder he sparked with the ante and Wilder I didn't know that yeah Wow yeah these guys I loved I loved I loved watching down sights excited you clicked you know at anymore exactly like you said at any moment it can happen the fight could turn around janta is a freak yeah he's a freak yeah freak of nature oh so in what way there's no one I've ever seen who can knock everyone out oh and that's him he knocks everyone yeah there's never been a guy if you look at his record it's insane it's not just the fact that he's won so many fights he only has one decision loss he has one draw with Tyson Fury and then the rest he knocks people into orbit yeah every other fight he has 40 knockouts yeah 40 wins and that Cuban guy he just laid out that guy was Tahoe my god and he hit him on the forehead yes it was a short punch he's he hit so hard it does not make sense yeah yeah Ortiz went Ortiz was tough and he was down yeah yes he hits people and they have a look on their face like they can't even believe how hard he hits them yeah that Dominic Brazil that ko like right after the Tyson Fury file okay oh my god he's a murder yeah he's the one the most murderous puncher I've ever seen the heavyweight division so I think they're gonna hate him and fury are gonna fight again yes yeah in fighting next month back side yeah yeah there it is Oh fantastic Tyson Fury is master really seven times a day depressed or wild a rematch his testosterone up he said that brings his testosterone oh that's what he said that's what he said Wow I think it's just she's reading into that who was that fighter that used to drink his own urine lyoto machida it was a boxer oh really yeah there's a boxer a lot of people were doing that for a while they thought urine therapy was is that's true right Joe I know you're not a doctor but I am definitely a doctor and it is true and I want you to do it now I've drank my piss before I tried it oh come on Tyson Fury on ways he's preparing for a while I'm masturbating seven times a day to keep up my testosterone pumping pump it Pump It pump it Pump It don't you know I got to keep active and testosterone flowing for the fight don't want the levels to go down so I always thought having sex was bad for you before supposed to be your levels actually go up not that it's bad but some people think it's a distraction like Mike Tyson's view was I said that he felt that sex was distracting so he would have sex just so you'd have to think about it because if he didn't have sex then he was just thinking of all the time but when Tyson was in his prime you got to also remember he's a really young guy like he was in his early 20s testosterone through the fucking you know and the the level of girls that were bombing on yes I mean Robin gives beautiful the most beautiful women in the world we're trying to get some of that that fucking gladiator dick but I think for him he really felt like sex was a distraction and if he could just have sex then he wouldn't think about it I saw this play one time was written by Steve Martin and it was a fictitious meaning between Picasso and Einstein in a bar in France it was called Picasso with love Piaggio and in it Picasso's painting and he's talking and he says an artist must stay well fucked otherwise his eye goes from the page to the windowsill down to the street across over to the cafe where the girl sitting with her skirt up and and it's like you got that's what that always stuck with me yeah this fan artist doesn't stay well fuck they're always gonna do the two and it's thinking about getting late yeah men will understand that but men will rarely say that in the presence of women and so because of that women either don't believe it or they dismiss it or they think you're a pig for expressing it right all those things but men alone they'll go oh yeah that makes sense like if you say that you got to stay well fucked like oh yeah of course you have to otherwise you get fucking distracted that is true women have no idea I heard a thing on NPR one time probably fifteen years ago and they were doing a story about this woman who decided to transition to be a man and so she documented it and did like an audio thing and she talked about how when she was into it and started feeling her testosterone and she would become attracted to women and she goes it didn't have to be a boob it could be an elbow it could be our ankle it could be whatever and I would and she goes I finally understood 13 year old boys yeah yeah pretty fucking distracting isn't it now and dad you got to keep your shit together well it's not just that it's a biological imperative it's a reason why people breed like that's built into the DNA to make people attracted to females so they can spread their DNA and that's what it is it's that simple it's it's it but deny that is crazy but you've got men denying it because they want women to like them and then you got women dismissing it because they think that the men who express it in an honest way are pigs and sexist and they exhibit toxic masculinity which is that's a hilarious expression because you need to thank toxic masculinity for all the bridges all the fucking all the Jets all the rockets all this toxic masculinity if you break down all the things that men have invented and all these toxic men have prevented like you from being murdered in war and protected the country and all these all the different things that you could attribute a toxic masculinity most of it's positive okay now I forgot what this guy had this question is it sitting in my head since you started talking about toxic smack salinity and I fucking can't even get the word fuckin sovereignty toxic masculinity is a ridiculous thing to say there's this terrible men there's terrible human beings that happen to be men there's also terrible human beings that happen to be women there's not toxic femininity they're just they just have any women women who developed in a terrible way most likely with bad parents most likely abuse physical and/or sexual and then they become a monster at the end of all this process this is the same with men bad men are just bad human beings that happen to be men and when you see terrible things happen it's not because of toxic masculinity it's because it's a bad person I believe in the individual there's individuals and some of them are bad and some of them are good but you want it if you just want to generalize against all men like you're you're on an uphill row there's too many and obviously not me I've never invented anything but there's too many things that men have done that are positive there's way too many there's too many thing if you wanted to have like Russia a scoreboard and you wanted to compete men versus women why would what are you gonna say when you look at all the different accomplishments that men have made and obviously it's not me and it's not you I'm not talking about us like we're on a team but I'm saying like just this this concept that men are bad and you hear this a lot today especially white man I don't wanna hear from white man okay well that's crazy because there's a lot of nice white men like this is dumb Phil Donahue yeah he's one of them but just just this idea that you can generalize about one entire group whether it's by gender or whether it's by race but by anything but you can do that with white men you can't really do that with brown women you can't say here's a problem with black women you know all black women are this that people go you're a racist piece of shit what do you say here's the problem with white men both are gross both statements so generalizations are disgusting whether they're a gender-based generalization or sex based generals whatever it is so they would say that that's okay to say that about white men because of the power dynamic yes that white men have power so if we say that it doesn't is not even racist right right that's what that's I don't know I'm not a dumb argument got a professor so I don't know if that's true or not but you know what the white power this is thing white men have more power sure but they also have more power than white men it's a tiny percentage of white men white men who have the power that we're talking about when you're talking about CEOs and you're talking about you know judges or what is it yes yes white men are in those positions of power but they're also in those positions of power over most white men like it's it's not it's it's a very small amount of people that have an extraordinary amount of influence yeah they happen to be white men but when you say white men suck look at this like no that's that's the smallest percentage of people who are these billionaires who are these CEOs who are these judges who are these people that are in positions of power that happen to be white men so have you ever now again I don't know I heard a guy refer to himself a regular guy refer to himself as a sis mile how many do that from now on have that has anyone ever done that it kind of blew me I can't even know what it was when I first heard it yeah it's nonsense well you're male if you're a trans woman and you you want to be referred to only as a woman fine no problem with that but I'm not gonna call myself a sis male that's some new made-up shit it sounds like you're calling yourself sissy sissy yeah like when I first heard it gender I thought that's what a guy was doing when if when I first heard it a guy said I'm assist male blah blah blah I'm like you're a sissy I didn't know what it meant I read this tweet once by this person who was saying basically to shame people into using that Ram it down their throats and eventually they'll accept it and it'll become normal and that you have because if they want to refer to us as trans we have to refer to them as says we have to force them process yes yeah I even know that's where it came it's to just to make a clear distinction so instead of making it look like a trans woman is lesser you set.you instead of that you have cisgender and transgender so they're there because you're you're adding to that name that prefix yeah because you're adding to both now yeah now you've equalize the playing field you level the playing field but the problem with that is trans is extremely rare it's the reason why you have that prefix in the first place because it's really really unusual to meet a trans woman despite how the internet would have you feel I was always I'm sure it's a tough life to be a transgender yes I'm like incredibly tough I was always a little jealous why don't you become a woman I was always like god it looks like fun why don't you dress up like Megan McCain and just start going on rants on your show you'd be free he would have such a fucking free pass I mean look Caitlyn Jenner killed a lady nobody would talk CEO says anything no just slammed her into traffic not paying attention rear-ended her into oncoming traffic she's dead now and no one even brings it up everyone's like she's so brave do you think she's intact I heard she cut it off oh my god it's a con I yeah I don't but that was accident right it wasn't like it was a careless accident Oh still she rear-ended somebody and slammed her into oncoming traffic okay and whether or not she was on her phone I don't know do you ever worry you're gonna say something I've always worried like I'm ignorant above a like I said that big gaps yeah a knowledge of stuff and so I remember I was was I talking about the other day and I got it totally wrong like I didn't know like somebody from the what Jamaica that's also an African American I didn't know that sure because they came over from Africa that's a guess I'm talking about how dumb I would say African American my guess once they came to America and they're American citizens African America yeah so I didn't again this is a lot of Jamaicans refer themselves as Jamaicans though the thing about Jamaicans is like it's really unique I like unique cultures are known for like specific things that are very positively Jamaicans are known for incredible work ethic yeah Jamaicans have multiple jobs it's always a stand-up job kidding yeah yeah in New York there was always jokes about Jamaicans about you know that they would get mad if you had less than five jobs oh no kidding yeah Jamaicans are known for being like very hustle oriented see that's a New York thing I mean the only thing I've ever heard about Jamaicans is the stereotype of pot no that's 2.2 but they have a lot of jobs hot smokers having five job skills to show you it doesn't take away your ambition they don't it does it's that that's nonsense look I smoked a lot of pot I'm pretty ambitious I work a lot that's it do you ever so I'll do a show right where I'm like criticizing someone or something and then I'll smoke a joint afterwards to relax and then I start every day yeah definitely okay we're talking shit yeah I know no I mean I'm thinking about my poorly worded rant of male versus women and I'm thinking like well I promise just said that better but that's just part of how it works you know when I was getting out but from all of this though is that we have to look at each other as individuals and this identity politics bullshit that people play whether it's male versus female whether it's black versus white and Asian and this and that we they have to be humans humans first and one of the weirder things that's going on in now is there there's leaning so hard on diversity that it gets distracting it's like it gets like I want to see is an example I went to see frozen the musical frozen is about in Nordic there's Nordic people one the girl has magic do you ever see it you'll have kids I don't know I don't in the play in the musical the dad is black and the mom's Chinese which is like okay maybe she's Asian I don't know maybe she's Korean I don't know it's hard to tell I can't see that good I'm 52 okay far away but she was obviously Asian and then they have a kid and then the young version of the kid is Asian and then the old version of the kid later in the musical is white and like you're distracting the fun yeah that's described you distract the fuck out but how does a black guy and an Asian lady make to to blonde ladies look what's happening or one is right here how that happened how the black guy and the Chinese lady make a blonde a union worship but I guess like don't you cut continuity they're just it's distracting the gay was great in his role she was great in her role they were excellent it worked I accepted it and moved up but I know what you're doing you know if you had a white guy playing a black guy in a movie I'd be like what is happening here why is this white guy pretending to be a black guy this is does this is are we gonna address this like if there was a musical and there was a guy and we decided we'll just have a white guy play the the father of you know some some black guy and we're just not gonna say why he had a kid that was black we just assume that you'll figure it out or just you just you know yeah that's that breaks the fourth wall it breaks your but you what do you think I'm suspending my disbelief and then you're doing things that make me disbelieve it's distracting it's distracting but I understand that the doing I appreciate it yeah because I think ultimately what it is is it's all a all of it is moving in the right direction it's just doing it in a very clunky way they're moving against discrimination they're moving against races and they're moving for cultural diversity beautiful but it's just distracting the way they're doing is so art but it's like Hollywood is so gross they lick their finger they have no virtue they lick their fingers which way the wind blowing this way I mean we need Asians and they'll just fucking just start hiring Asians for things and trying to get Asian people jobs and try to look look look look we have Asians we're really and that if it becomes Jamaicans Jamaicans we need Jamaicans get them in here get them in here they don't give a fuck they're trying to make money they're trying to make money and one of the best ways to make money is to ride cultural trends and so our cultural trend right now is it good one even though there's a lot of people that are there they're basically they're controversy pimps right so when these things come up they use this controversy to gain money or notoriety or push their cause or to use it as the wind behind their sail cuz they can talk a lot of shit about other people and get a lot of attention it gives them a bit of immunity yes it gives them a lot of immunity yeah and so like all these things it of course yeah how have you experienced it I've had people accuse me being sexist as I've had that clearly established you were so excited yeah well of course I am because I because I treat women equally yes that's the problem yeah I've caught you know I would sexist because I voted for Jill Stein both anybody that says you're sexist for making fun of Elizabeth Warren dancing is a fuckin buffoon that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about like are you saying that you a person running for the commander-in-chief of the greatest army the world has ever known and you can't make fun of the way they dance cuz they have a vagina fuck you I am woman hear me roar and they'll make fun of my dancing or my roars again it's like the I thought the answer to this was to treat everybody equally yes it's how it should be we would but identity politics the real problem that of course always is that you cannot ever say this is a man so he must be that this is a woman so she must be that this is a black person so they must be this that's those generalizations are bad for everybody people are nuanced and if we don't believe in the individual then we don't really believe in equality we have to everyone has to have their own way to make it through this life and express themselves in a unique way where they can contribute in a unique way and we could appreciate them for who they are not appreciate them as a woman or appreciate them as a man or as a white man or a black woman or what that's nonsense it's so dumb like you happen you might happen to be a black man or you might happen to be an Asian man you might happen to be all those things but you're a person you're a fucking individual and we should especially when it comes to meritocracy things like positions of power and government like get elected officials or even comedians or anything else I mean you you want to make sure that the person who's this is they're good so they're just good there's yes so there's that yeah but then there's there's also this other little part of it like so even someone who say doesn't have the pedigree like there's a white guy from Harvard right he has the crew straight A's the greatest whatever and then you might get a a - student who's a minority from stoma or B+ student and that would be more effective to have in a position because they have a different world experience so a meritocracy in a sense kind of leaves out some people who were have different hurdles to get over and have different life experiences that this person won't have you know seeing I'm saying like you become the people you're surrounded by so Eve you might be an african-american but a or so it's it's more important to have different economic represented because you can be really smart like Chelsea Clinton but she doesn't know what it's like to have to have her medicine just to know what it's like to have to drop a pharmacy to get medicine for her daughter or you know it means like she might be super smart but she doesn't have this information that we need which is like when FDR when he was doing the banks and stuff he got a banker from Texas he didn't go to Wall Street ago you mean he got regular people to come in so that there's something to that - right so straight meritocracy well there it is a meritocracy in that there's merit in their life experience oh okay what if those individuals that live these difficult lives like I think that's one of the greatest currencies that a person really carries with them in their life is their experience overcoming adversity their experience overcoming adversity shapes their character is and when you meet someone me maybe you meet this woman and she she has you know all bees through college but she's been through a lot of shit and she's uniquely clever and how she handles things and you talked her and you look at her record and you go you know what I like you better than this guy who got all A's cuz he seems kind of like yes spectrum me and he's not gonna like to fit in with my company but yeah that makes sense but that again we're just you don't just look at meritocracy don't just look at grades you look at the human overall the individual and there's a lot of benefit to people that have overcome difficult lives like those people come out interesting those people come out important because they they've they've seen some shit that you haven't seen yes that's that is what and they're and they understand things that you don't understand yes and that's why I like soil like a guy like Barack Obama could have a diverse cabinet but they're all from the same class right that's fake diverse that's fake diversity yes so they're all he still he served he served the establishment power like any white president did and his cabinet did the same thing by the way his cabinet came from an email from Citigroup which I know you know yeah yeah you know we are it's these things are complicated that's part of the problem with any of these conversations and also they're so loaded when you talk about men or women or black or white anything like everybody's on edge like don't say anything stupid right what how do you feel really like oh well I'm white so I don't have those experiences so I always try to limit how I talk about it like I always say I shouldn't be talking about this because I I don't have you should be talking about anything you want to talk about this idea that you could be silenced because you're you're not in some protected group that's nonsense I've always a well I'm always afraid I'm going to say something ridiculous and ignorant which I do often yeah me too I'm gonna save ignorant ridiculous shit like this you have to have the ability to say ignorant ridiculous shit if you're gonna have a free-flowing conversation like you and I so we didn't even talk on the phone before this we had no idea what we're gonna talk about we right into a pre-interview we did nothing but coming Capri will be hilarious would you start talking about farts blowjob free we were talking about Jimmy I don't know yeah it would Jack it up seven times a day to keep my testosterone let's talk about that yeah get it get it get it pre-interviews they still do pre-interviews under do you by the way do you ever watch any of those shows ever no no one does very few people are watching those I mean Conan O'Brien get less views than my show no no that's why that's why they're all doing podcasts now I know a fucking joke there was a crazy article that Conan O'Brien is leading the way in new media yes like what are you talking about we've been doing this shit for 15 years pages and this thing what the photos even get good numbers of his podcast no no like the actual download speed does alright but he doesn't do as good as like Dax Shepard or me or any of the people that are at the top of the heap and vomiting well be you know you use your platform Jo to actually have real conversations and say no I haven't listened the Conan Brian's a podcast because you know I've got anything else to do but he's interviewing famous people yeah it's fucking the same bullshit and it's not I mean hate Marc Maron's got that covered right he did that he'll doing it for ten fucking years that's right people opened up to their heart never so he has this thing and then you do this other thing it's fucking covered you aren't breaking any new debt was crazy that head that was a New York Times headline wasn't a joke I think it was always a variety variety and everybody in Hollywood was like what in the fuck are you talking about yeah yeah and what was funny too yeah I got tagged on it so many times I'm like I'm not even gonna comment because I can't it's Conan O'Brien he's revolution I see I was changing the game he stays at the game cuz they gave he had a photo shoot yeah he's a white man a bright problem he has assists male he's another one of those white man at the top of podcasting it's bullshit yeah I don't know if he's at the top of podcasting I wouldn't say that all of it it's just gross did you ever do his show no yeah I did a show before a couple times they sell seem like nice people he's a nice guy he seems like nice they all seem like very nice people I feel bad when I go after them on Twitter Andy Richter all the chords you do I go after a trick to go after it easy I can tell he's a nice guy I can know it well because you know he's famous right and it's white male and he's white male problems very safe for me to go after him but he they there's this Hollywood mentality on the left right and this Hollywood mentality on the left is that all bad things started in January 2017 they have no idea how we got there so he's tweeting out this stuff about how Trump is has the cognition of an eight-year-old right because he wants to do war crimes and so I went you know well how quick can you believe this guy I'm like dude they've been fucking doing war crime since I was born why are you acting like this just started we're just we don't ever prosecute them and they're not gonna prosecute him for war crimes why are you fucking dude you know what war criminals do they go and dance with Ellen on daytime television that's the cognition of Hollywood Michelle Obama says George Bush and her have the exact same values a war criminal she has the exact said that's the cognition of a fuckin of first lady I'm gonna talk about cognition how we fuckin got here and you're smarter than that Andy Richter and that's why I hold his feet to the fire I know he's a nice guy but he just locked into that although it's a tall team that's all fuckin vote Balu no matter who it's all it's all forget how we got here let's forget that Barack Obama was unbelievably corrupt which is why we don't have a functioning banking system which is why I don't have a functioning health care system which we why he took us from two wars to seven which is why he had a Peace Prize and a fucking kill list where's my kill list oh maybe it's underneath my peace prize and use it as a paperweight kind of ironically anyway these are the things that I try to focus on Joe by the way I was right about all of them yeah and I was right about fucking Russia gate you were but the beautiful you want to do a victory lap yet you should it's been around your chair the thing about you though is like you are a left-wing guide that's willing to criticize the left and for some people that seems to get the problem a boo thing like they don't want to talk about the left oh you can't I'm first of all so I found out that people who want to make it in the Democratic Party are not allowed to come to my shows no I was doing a show and this woman who I know who was involved in the democratic politics I kind of want to say anything about who they are because they'll get in trouble and she came to my show and she goes you know this other person who's climbing in the Democratic Party was supposed to come with me and at the last minute she didn't and I called her ass didn't want you come and she goes you know if I get seen at a jimmy dore show my career in the democratic party's over oh come on Harris I could tell by your accent you racist piece of shit I could tell couldn't you tell Jimmy I could tell and I'm like she's she ever been on your show Kabbalah her yes oh oh we did some quick easy FBI work right there sorry the way that made me feel good that makes me feel like I want to be an outsider I don't want I want people to be afraid of me they're afraid you know well I don't know if they are but they won't come on my show so that's good and well my show was never about guests my show was all about my opinion course and calling out bullshit yeah so it's that's nobody doing the right thing you doing I'm doing the wrong thing because they all keep asking to be on my show okay I have a request from all of them really oh yeah Biden Warren how do youhow do you resist shit cuz I'm I have my friends talk to my friends yeah I know I would get a phone call see and I like I like burning that's it oh yeah everybody else can eat shit look at you fucking progressive yeah well I've always been yeah what yeah everyone says your right wing they're out of their fucking mind I've never voted right-wing in my life really never never voted Democrat except for independent I voted for Gary Johnson cuz he did my podcast people don't realize how far like yeah I'm not I'm not right-wing at all okay that's while no there's nothing about me this right-wing yeah kill your own food that's it well that's crazy there's 95 plus percent of the population the planet eats meat I just happen to kill my own yeah that's a it's not like 95 percent of the population is right-wing because they kill their own food I think there's a lot of right-wing like family values and things like that that I admire I think but when when you can't when it gets to homophobia when it gets to women's rights that's where I break right I'm a hundred percent in favor of women's rights 100 percent in favor of gay rights gay marriage I'm a big proponent of the there's got to be some new action taken to clean up a lot of these crime-ridden communities and the idea that we can spend all this money overseas we can't spend money on Flint Michigan or Detroit or the southside of Chicago that to me is insane that doesn't make any sense and this idea that we're all in the same starting page is so fucking stupid - that that is a very non right-wing way of looking at it because everybody's like you got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps there's a lot of people that came out of bad neighborhoods but they didn't they didn't fucking cry what was me they just went out there and they kicked ass that's nonsense you have no idea what it's like to grow up in a crime-ridden poverty infested drug-addled neighborhood you don't know what that's like and we should make it so that no one knows what that's like if we want America better the best way to start is to clean up all the spots that suck and make people that are coming out of there have a real chance and making something out of their life don't don't have it so that they're starting out from the time they're a child with a massive deficit that's me and what you mean by clean cleaning up the plate it mean Community Programs putting money into these communities jobs not just jobs but community programs where kids have a safe place to go that's a big part of it protect them from the gangs put more cops in those neighborhoods and have them there all the time make them a part of the community they got to do something about the violence and do something about the gangs and this repetitive cycle of people growing up in these neighborhoods and getting trapped in these same horrible conditions that their parents did or their grandparents did and it's an endless cycle we and we pretend like we don't have the resources to fix the FDR did FDR whenever you want a job I'll give you a job that means you're gonna go work it's not I'm not giving you anything you're earning it and guess what we have the money for it wouldn't it be amazing if they did that there could be strategies that are implemented they might all not all work but I don't see like I don't anything is doing yeah yeah we're gonna help we're gonna have Enterprise Zones yeah obviously and then and then they want the school to fix all the problems of the community no what you need is jobs this what people need is something to look forward they need to know that they can fade you play by the rules they will get things you could have a job right now those people were gonna and they don't have any health care right and they get broken their life goes upside down I mean you know how I have I have a job but I got sick my life got turned upside because of bills and this is not just black communities either we're talking about the coal mining communities in West Virginia that horrific man you don't even like I have a good friend it's from there it's like man you don't know what poverty is like you don't even know what poverty is like until you see that nothing I talked to a guy on my show his name is Nick Smith from Virginia and he told me he was a Waffle House cook and he told me and I might even told you this before he said hey we all knew that Donald Trump was a loudmouth Yankee who should have had his ass kicked a long time ago but Hillary Clinton wasn't offering us anything so he was at least offering us something right so they're desperate these people need something she wouldn't even sign on to a $15 minimum wage what she was ready was it but the fuck's wrong with you yeah well she didn't even believe in gay marriage until 2013 how about that 2000 fucking 13 she did when she came around with gay marriage yeah you're you are you're ahead of her on that weren't you Joe yeah well I actually lived in San Francisco around gay people and I was real little really 7 to 11 my family lived right off of Lombard Street Nokia we lived in San Francisco and the height of the I mean it was the Vietnam War there's all these hippies myself as a hippie oh no kidding yeah so it's like I mean I've been liberal my whole life I just look like a Republican you know yeah I think attend beat the shit out of people I'd like some violent things and I have guns and you know there's a lot of things that you could make an inference like oh that guy seems like you would be but no I my friend my friend Graham Elwood is do you know him sure he's he was on his live stream the other day and he's a very anti-war like me and so these people were fucking with him be pro war and he's like that's right I'll knock you out that's right you ever been knocked out by a vegetarian stack cellairis well that's another group that people like to play identity politics with what are you eating you know how much how much of that is so you with the meat so my doctor doctor strep so no you I have a special bone broth Sharpe from Pasadena that's tough holy shit so he tells me yes he he always does this like this right he goes oh Jimmy you're from Chicago you eat right deep dish pizza right sweet and I go I go yep try not to and he goes why I go you know I said global warming I saw cows jumping like dogs bouncing around yeah I can't eat me I can't eat pork this get it that is county pork pork is Shady I can't do it but but wild pigs must be stopped oh there they they can kill you right over swallowers they killed a lady in texas and ate her they found her on an elderly lady they found her in her driveway torn apart by wild pigs yeah she was on her way out to the car and she just ran to a pack of him they took her out a pack yeah yeah yeah I've seen videos those things are but I have to kill them there's so many of them and they breed so quickly they bleed they have four in a litter they'll have four litters in a year really yeah bang bang bang bang bang bang bang that's why there's millions and millions of wild pigs they started with just a few pigs that were on like the Pinta or the Santa Maria or some shit and they spread across the entire country but once you find out that they have emotions yes that's process what I can't hit I can't do that they have them all you shoot them from a distance you don't want to get up close so so your theory is they don't know it's coming no that is a good way to do it what did they done their mother what if you have a pig and you kill the pigs well do that if you're an ethical hunter you know you don't shoot a pig that has piglets yeah you try to avoid that unless about a deal the only time they do they don't do that either that's illegal oh the only time they do do that though in some places illegal the only time they do do that with pigs is when they're trying to eradicate all of them like there's some farm lands that experience just devastating losses because of wild pigs and especially in Texas millions and millions of dollars a year which cripples these companies they go under because the wild pigs like these some farms can literally go bang oh my god you'd have no idea what it's like unless you've been around them but what about fig pig farming right that's a different thing most pig farming is disgusting I can't it's horrible but then there's there's ethical pig farms where they raise these pigs where they get let them roam around how the meat looks different they're eating acorns and natural food really yeah there's a guy named Joel Salatin and he runs this farm called Polyface farms and he's all about regenerative farming and he discusses like how like the way animals live best is the way they live natural yeah and they used to put chickens are supposed to roam free so he has this portable chicken house and they roll it into a new field and then the chickens going to the chicken house at night and in the morning they come out and then they go roam around and they move it to another spot so they eat all the bugs and all the grass and all the stuff in the area and then they move to a new spot and so they raise chickens and the eggs are healthier the the pigs the the pork is healthier these these pigs are wandering around in these open areas and then they Corral them and then they then they kill them quickly I just once I found out either they have real emotions like dogs I just think about my dog and now I just I just fall apart I can't I hear you but wild pigs are different yeah that's different because they're an invasive species you know they actually morph they change shape when they become like a wild pig and a domestic pig is the same animal like people talk about all-russian wild boar it's all nonsense it's all sooo scrofa it's all one genus it's the same animal really yeah really when a wild when a pig a domestic pig goes wild I mean it's different versions of them but they can all breed with each other when a domestic pig goes wild like say if you had a domestic Pig and you said go ahead porky be free and you open up your gate within weeks within weeks they start to physically change their snout starts to lengthen their hair gets thicker and bushier and their tusks grow no kid yes they literally become what you think of when you think of wild boars it just takes a while but they fit they're one of the weirder animals they're almost like gremlins when you feed him after midnight when you let him go they start changing they morph so I did I so dr. Sharpe says to me from Pasadena he says he said well you should eat meat and I'm like because of my condition right and he tells this long story about how we evolved he sits down and starts telling me and about how we were cavemen and inside the glaciers and the thing and he's like so you should eat meat especially you because of your condition and I go okay well how often and he goes every day and I was like Jesus I can't do that you know and so but this is medical advice from a guy who saved my life right so it's like I eat meat a couple times a week do you feel better or worse we need it I do have more energy yeah well that's probably good right yeah why not meet more often I have just because if you don't have to eat pork I know if you eat humanely rate me so there's great grass yeah you can buy grass-fed grass-finished meat from farmers that have a commitment to humanely raised and humanely euthanized animals I want to euthanize killed killed animals and they when the way they kill them when they harvest them they just lead him into a pen they have no idea what's coming and they put a bowl to their head and bang they take them out yeah it can't it can be done in a way where the animal has no idea what happens until it tilts over mm-hmm and it's not like they're gonna live forever I mean obviously this is a slippery argument cause you say that about people too okay this guy's an asshole let's just kill him it's not he's gonna live forever all right you don't want to say that but the the the quality of the meat is far better if the animal is living a natural life right you're talking about organic no hormones no yeah no corn manage it's terrible for cows they're not supposed to eat that did their the the ruminants they eat fucking grass that's what they do when they're at their best and healthiest and healthiest for you there's better fatty acids in it's just healthier for you and so and so you think if you went vegetarian it would be bad for your health I don't know I don't think it I think it's definitely doable I definitely think you can go vegetarian and and be healthy but you have to be really careful about a lot of your nutrient levels you have to really make sure you get enough vitamin D a lot of b12 you gotta check your essential fatty acid levels there's a lot of stuff but like it looks real good on paper but then you find out it's not bioavailable I tried to go vegan for a while and I got I got fat well it's a lot of cars yeah just you know I didn't know what I know what I was doing I wasn't doing it right whatever yeah I'm not a like soy why don't I sound like tofu little fucker yeah just something about it did you fuck with any of that vegan chicken stuff or any of those weird ones that are make them look like real food there's a name for that oh no no book that fake meat they have now is fantastic really bad for you though do you know that actually causes liver problems and rats what yeah pull up the fake meat liver problems rats no yeah look it's all oils so that stuff's all kind of assess food oils it's processed vegetable oils and then add yeah just eat fucking vegetables man if you want to be a vegetarian eat vegetables look most boys a lot of people who would say regular burgers not good for you either but of course a regular burger is just me with bread and all the bullshit the bread and all the bullshit is what's bad for you it's not the burger itself as long as it's an actual meat burger particularly if it's a grass-fed burger yeah so what is he pulling up he's pulling up this study about one of the meet the one of them impossible order beyond meat one of them but they were talking about how there's studies that are showing that this this is not but then again they're not marketing it as a healthy alternative no their marketing is a meat-free Berger & Berger is kind of like a fun food anyway here it is rat feeding studies suggest the impossible burger may not be safe to eat ello fucking ha but if you go to the ingredients man I've had scientists relay the ingredients to me I thought it was just coconut oil oh it's a bunch of fat up stuff because they've got to make it seem like it's a real burger someone heme is that thing they that makes it taste like it's called heme heme heme iron some like that that's what gives it that flavor that people are looking for getting that I don't know where they get that for a boil in green that good it's a People's joke it's people that sucks yes sucks well it's so you don't think I'll ever stop eating me do you think you'll always you'll you're like animals are here for us to eat and that's that I don't think that I think we definitely evolved a human animal evolved from eating meat and that's not that's not under debate I mean we evolved from eating meat and weirdo vegans to try to say crazy shit like oh why don't we have canines how come we can't eat meat raw well because asshole we figured out fire a long fucking time ago and our bodies adapt it because of that our teeth adapted because we figured out how to cut things with utensils and we figured out how to cook things so they're more tender it's it's not as simple as like why do we have an appendix why is that I'll tell you why because we used to eat differently and we still have a leftover organ some weird fucking organ from for breaking down bark and shit you know we don't need that anymore would any bark anymore is that what that's like roots and stuff like oh we yeah I think that's what the appendix is for I think it was initially for breaking down like very hard to digest fibrous things so I have my gallbladder out whoa what did you do with it I'm gonna put it back in yeah I'm thinking about it I have it in my glove box but what happened no I his head yeah I was having gallbladder attacks I thought it was a heart attack whoa where's so in it it was like right here oh jeez and I always heard like your heart attack feels like it's in the center and this was this was a little lower I'm like this is a heart attack I'm dying this is no doubt I'm dying I thought for sure I was dying so I'm on the couch and I remember I'm just like this is my wife calls the fireman and I'm just like this is it this is how it's gonna happen I was kind of okay with it right but I was in because I was in a lot of pain I wanted it to end I was like okay if I die I die well then they came and they shot me and I was like oh I feel fantastic again so it wasn't it was just my gobbler they took it out and what does it do the gallbladder secretes bile into your stomach to help digest things right so gallbladder is would be like the four bile and your liver makes bile it like your reservoir so now I don't have a reservoir anymore well so now it just is always kind of dripping does it fuck with you anymore you know it's fucked with me a lot in lots of different ways yeah my my appetite is tastes weird when you get nervous it doesn't come it doesn't come on slowly it's that's why you had to eat when you're on stage so that happens so that and then and often often after I eat I have to go right I have to go the bathroom right away right away yeah I don't know ever since I had my gobbler I don't know if other people have that I haven't googled it now was there any alternative to getting it removed did they say hey maybe you could change your diet I was not given a alternative there was so there's you have like calcium and deposits in your thing and they block the duck and then you don't that's what causes all the pain and so eventually it'll dislodge itself and the pain will go away but it could kill you if it stays and doesn't go away and so they have to take it out Jesus Christ yeah and guess huh so here's a great story about our medical system right Joe so I have Blue Cross insurance I had the best that you could buy or what have you and so I had my second gallbladder attack and I was like I got to get this goddamn thing out because I can't have this happen again it hurts too much right so I called the doctor and they're like I can't even get a consultation for three weeks in network to get it so I have to get a consultation then I have to wait wait another three or four weeks to get the operation so this could maybe be two months before I get the operation of these ten I'm gonna have another goddamn attack so I had went out of network and I got another doctor to come take care of me faster so I couldn't have to worry about the other side to pay out of pocket god damn yes so this whole thing you're gonna have to wait you have to fucking wait right now yeah it's ridiculous what you actually know it's true it is true it is true I have friends and candidates way worse up there though about waiting yeah if you like I had French needed in the operation they waited a fucking year so for a whole year she's walking around with a torn ACL really dub knee yeah a whole year a year 12 months 365 days I was the hobbling around do you know anybody in Canada would that would trade their health care plan for a United States I didn't want to pay for it once you don't have to pay for it you don't want to pay for it you know you know there's a great video where this guy interviews people in England and he asked them how much do you think sauce to be married or how much does a baby to have a baby and they're like $100 try ten grand he's like what what yeah I saw it yeah everybody freaks out everybody freaks yeah well once you're used to things being free you don't want to pay for them I don't look I think healthcare should be free I really do I think education should be free I think if we're gonna spend money as a community if we have a gigantic community of people and that's what a country really is it's a community what is the most important thing to take care of well we got to take care of old people sick people we got to take care of poor people we got to take like this is this the idea that somehow or another that this is uh this is a foolish notion that you have to take care of people that education it wouldn't be better if more people are educated yeah so why shouldn't that be free well we don't have the money but we have how much money how much hundred and thirty one extra billion they gave trouble would that be a lot of Education yeah a lot of people learn shit that way yeah it's almost that's double the money it would take to send everybody to college for free that's hilarious sixty five billion dollars a year send everybody to college they just spent 131 billion to give gift to him that's double right I'm not a math surgeon but I'm pretty sure that's double Masergy I think if we figured out a way to you know you know Ari Shaffir says the same stuff yeah I was just on his show and he was saying we gotta take care of homeless people I'm like I thought you were a right winger oh he's not right way at all I guess not Ari's very left-wing why do you think everybody was right-wing cuz we talked shit I don't know I just hear it you know on social media all those idiots they just think because I've talked to Alex Jones or because I've had you know right-wing people on that you know oh your platforming people joke I've been friends with Alex Jones since the 90s I've known that guy forever so when I went in that never tell you the story when you spin his face so on so when the ice tea's accidentally I got so um so whatever first I didn't think that would be that big of a deal wowthat's or not to be a big deal right right so then whatever so then the next day I talked to some people from his show we're all friends right but not him and so I went down like a couple months later did you uh Austin so I go to this the the steak house right and there forgets the name it's the big place right try to cross tree from the Weston and so I'm there my brother came down for the weekend my brother and his wife and we're all sitting there we're eating and all of a sudden goes Alex Jones just walked in he sitting right behind you I go get the fuck out or he's gonna come present your organ but my brother's big guy right so mom my brothers are bigger than me and and tough to write and so I was like alright well if you see him coming this way No so he's back and he goes he just sat down he shook hands with this guy three times I go it sounds like they're up to something I go and we were luckily we were eight finishing and I was like okay I'm not gonna I'm gonna finish it I'm gonna walk the fuck that's hilarious just get out here slick he could crush me he probably wouldn't you would be able to talk to him he's a lot more reasonable than people think he is and especially now now he's not drinking anymore oh really he's been off booze for shit I want to say many many months now yeah it's been quite a while he is no drinking she's changed - he's he's realized he was losing his fucking mind was getting deep platform he was drinking like a bottle bottle a half of vodka every night yeah he was going four times I kind of stand with people do you like that what we need and when you do drink that much you do get psychotic like you start dude I love drinking and I can't I don't drink like I used to anymore because older - right in I wake up the next day I'm depressed yeah yep I love drinking martinis during a live show everything's wrong everything's bad I'm this but you know what a lot of that is a lot of is not just the alcohol it's also the dehydration oh yeah yeah if you just hydrate and take a lot of electrolytes you think yeah yeah you can mitigate a lot of that stuff also glutathione glutathione can help your body process alcohol quicker glutathione Lewis I own yeah it's an antioxidant super potent antioxidant yeah it actually your body produces it and aids in the process of processing alcohol I didn't know yeah I can help you a little bit my little boost I did drink in Hawaii they have them couldn't stop drinking them they taste oh yeah that's a problem when things are delicious but yet also get you far Kalka halt yeah but the Adam wasn't driving anywhere I didn't ever do anything so bizarre there was to be a place in West Palm Beach improv and downstairs they had one of those alcoholic Slurpee places oh no yeah they taste fucking blessed man one of them called call a cab and you would drink it it was like I drank one onstage once and by the end of the show I was like thank God the show ended the way it did I forgot how to talk really oh my god it was so sloshed by the time the show was over I was one glass I mean one like it was like a big gulp sighs call a cab I don't know how many drinks shot one or like seven shots to load but it's like a giant mix right yeah it's just like 7-eleven Slurpees yeah it tastes good mmm it tastes good and you get fucked up yeah I've never heard that fucked up on stage there was a time when I was I was going through a phase where I dropped my pants on stage oh you stopped doing that I did people start to complain why I don't know how much this is the oldest comic gig in the fucking gig and the thing it's just a gag you drop your pager Lewis is funny did you have underwear on yeah oh yeah are you Ahri's pulls his hog out not anymore Lily scared can you do that is in the day you can still pull your hog out he pulled his hog out and a skank fest in New York they had a you know skank fest again I don't not familiar you gotta get in the loop I know I'm out of it did a few weeks ago that killed Tony yeah let's talk out yeah yeah right before he was here I preferred maybe Tony was here one of the times where was it oh yeah well probably shouldn't say that what wasn't be illegal well I used to do it Joe rubber dick don't worry about it folks I used to do it and yeah and then nobody noticed that I was embarrassing yeah Joe just sometimes I do jokes all right okay what am I here with my father no it's okay it's all fine it's all fine ari has always done ridiculous shit he used to go on stage with his balls out of his pants address it so go onstage and do his act he would just unzip his pants pull a sack out and then just have it at the store where there's like someone onstage Joey bombing and yes Joey bomb it was a woman on stage she was terrible like one of the worst comics has ever done comedy and this one night she was killing I mean fucking killin and this is why when she would hit a punch line Joey was hiding behind the stage and he was naked there you go close the curtains and so she would get this giant fucking laugh and she was like wow and she's like and then I told him fuck you know yes balls ass naked and would that seems like me in jail that seems criminal with Joey's balls look like grapefruit and an old lady's pantyhose and he's got a giant dick so Joey would you know is he got this huge belly so he opens up the curtains his pants are down by his ankles his balls Daan's dick or hanging out as good this huge belly yeah she never did comedy again really no okay she should have larious that's in Austin actually that was where we were at the hotel hanging out in the that's our in the background yeah hanging out at the jacuzzi get ready for the show Wow yeah today that I mean like comedies it's already dangerous enough yeah I don't need to add nudity well you get in trouble now yeah it's like that like people can get really angry at you for showing your dick well that could it's not not like the olden days it's kind of a subtle gag it's a good we could see it yeah it's a cool nobody cares guys yeah you Joey used to do it all the time yeah I don't there was I remember when I was a kid I had older sisters and they there was a flash of our neighborhood they were going like oh the kite-flying I'm like I don't understand this whole thing I understand why he's doing that I don't understand why it freaks you out so much it's like I don't the whole thing but I GU don't know I understand why it freaks them I get the freaking out I still don't get why they do it but I think it has something to do with someone traumatizing you when you're young it's cut yeah it's gotta be humiliation something you're addicted did that kind of if there's lots of people like that yeah well how about guys who are addicted to they hire women to gag them and shit on them and kick them in the balls and yeah sometimes like really powerful man and hurt them yeah yeah hurt that stopped or not like stop on their nuts with a stiletto it starts bleeding how is that fun how is that what is that I don't know that is such an peep that is broke such so down a rabbit all of you million you know I mean I was hit a lot as I can with the capitalist guy got all the guilt and hitting invite and somehow I managed to avoid that kind of that kind of shit I don't have weird shit but that's a mommy shit and it's like the whole pantyhose and beating you and kicking in the ball so it's like there's obviously it's gotta be my dream of pathologies that people can develop in their life and it's probably a lot of mental illness involved in there and violence and abuse but apparently there's a woman that I talked to who is a dominatrix and she was telling me and Jim Norton you know Jimmy hydrogen in a dominant he loves dominatrix and she was saying most of her clients are like these like wealthy CEOs and they run these companies and they're the fucking man and when they walk at home mr. Olson's here hello mr. Wilson can I get you a cup of coffee and everyone's kissing their ass and they want someone to shit on him like literally shit on him they want someone to tie him up and she yeah she would say that those are the guys why is that though I guess it's just so every powerful guy wants to like feel a release of their power well that's why when the John Wayne little shit on I don't get it maybe the steel dossier right when they were talking about yeah stop getting peed on and all that stuff for peeing on them that's why it made sense it's like well of course of course what not that it's real now I'm gonna made sense of its real but that would be a story because you expect from a super powerful guy who had a weird kink a super powerful guys with weird kinks they usually want to get pegged right they want to get pissed on pegged is the best that's one of the that's one of the best things like cuz you could say pegged on national TV right now yes still you can still say pegged no one can stop you right peg does not like it's not in the dictionary I don't think right if you say but fucked with a dildo people go hey but you shouldn't even say that because it's too wordy the economy of words pegged fits better and it's it's it's got a P and a G pegged how do you just not start laughing when they let you start pegging you I don't know how do you just not start laugh it might be really into it oh you're some a bad boy I what are the women get out of it did you get to dominate you and that's it humiliate you yeah I knew a guy in this group girl said that she would fuck him if if if he let her peg him and he wouldn't do it oh really we're calling he wanted to do it yeah well she said she was I'll let you fuck you me hug me but I want to fuck you in the ass huh she she's pretty hot and all my friends called him gay well bro you're gay hey you should have just fucked a letter in the ass you're gay my friend it was funny he was like it's not even a real dick bro she probably doesn't want to fuck you but she's willing to do it if you willing to do something for her she probably always wanted a peg a guy you got to make some sacrifices yeah it's like your joke about the the female version of who wants to give you a job in Hollywood movie Oh Harvey Nina Weinstein yeah yeah Harvey Weinstein came to my son with a solid contract I'd be like dude you're gonna be Batman that's true we were talking about that last night with our Kelly like the our Kelly story is horrific right he's having sexual 15 16 year-old girls but imagine if JLo had a bunch of 15 and 16 year old boys locked up in the house I'm wearing Miami she's making them all eat her ass and videotaping them we would be a little happy we'd be it's so funny it's so different it is a different thing men and women are different yeah they're a different thing this idea that we're not different it's so stupid we're not math you know we're very different right yeah but we're in denial of that because we work in these environments where men and women are side by side forty hours a week and everybody's under a human-resources fucking tight grip of behavior and so everybody guys act weird and then men don't want the women mad at them so they have to pretend yeah these guys are assholes this guy's a total Pig yeah as a male feminist I find that atrocious you know who's not a male feminist you know you never find it's a male feminist gay guys because they're not trying to fuck you okay so they don't have to play some stupid game they care about women more than they care about anything and women's equality is the most important thing no they're trying to suck dick and blood fuck dudes they're having a good time that's what they do they're not they're having a fun time with other gay guys they don't give a fuck they don't want you to be victimized but they're not gonna go out of their way as a male ally that's all guys trying to fuck you a hundred percent it is 100 percent sneaky guys who can't figure out any other way to fuck that they that they pretend to be female allies or Seminole feminists male Fateh you cannot be a nice person who's got like good values and ethics and you want things you want equality for all but the idea that you're a male feminist you come out I'm a male feminist like just saying those words out of your fucking mouth you're a sneaky fuck I know what you're doing you're sneaky so your gender traitor so you're telling me that guys who say I always thought feminism was just about treating women equally that's because you're talking to too many liberals what is it about well it is about treating people equally if you feel that it's about treating people equally but when you hear a man say that he's a male feminist you're going so out on a limb you're not just saying you're you I'm all about treating people you you're labeling yourself and you're labeling yourself and this sort of submissive sort of you're giving in to this cultural wave so let me this can you what is the definition of feminism is that okay if I can have fucking knows right I mean he's gonna look it up right I could ask siree I bet you she's yeah yes sirree okay ready we gotta end this soon I know hey Suri what's the definition of feminism advocacy advocacy of women's rights on the basis of equality of the sexes boy that's an open-ended saying right there the quality the sex is how weightlifting making babies there's no advocacy of women's rights based on the Equality of sexist notice of the sexes I think you're equal but you can be equal but different well we're not math right certainly should have equal rights we certainly should have just equal build the way people treat each other just equal morals and ethics another definition of a material political economic social equality of the sexes organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests I mean that thought sounds like shit that you would agree with Joe well organized activity on baha this is we're gonna this is gonna take too long okay unfortunately cuz it's three o'clock okay but yeah I agree with most of those things but I don't agree with is someone labeling themselves that way that's a man because everyone that I've ever met is a little weasel well I'm Jay you know I always say show me a male feminist that can pick up heavy things and run fast they don't exist they
