good goddamn time last weekend in Vegas holy shit was that fun yeah whoo that was a good fucking time these guys dropped acid they were up in the they were up for the stairs watching with big fuckin smiles the face I don't know when I found out that they dropped acid did I find in ur weeded you at during the UFC yeah but I don't get tweets I mean I mean text texted me you texted me yeah so that's how I found out like Long Knives yeah no it was like the last half hour right look you will know that I looked up I thought I never waved at us okay then I must have known you know we're sitting in the draw are we table one day we're talking about something or something looks going to be great this weekend and as I'm talking to welcome for joining the Harvey Mudd and there were seven hits asking I bet we dropped the acid he's like oh I don't know when I go every time somebody you know gets hit will feel it yeah original fucking plan at first so then we were like well what do you think about red band we don't know but when they were saying yeah we should fuck him dose yeah maybe we gotta put on some pop just take him for the run and we said nah because I know it's hard to have nine one one fucking that's my little brother it alas it's a little different you don't want to dose somebody with acid oh yeah I've made a decision just not to do it anymore in my life because I've gotten to a point where my brain I just want to keep my brain a little bit together to put together stations they say so about yeah this stuff is very well that was nothing sir that was kid stuff that was giddy yeah well if you took her two hits and you were still being able to sit there then it had to be chef very mild very mild it came in spurts and bursts it was very nice up down up the lights fucked of you what's his name voice fucked with you from time to time buffer buffer yeah he really vibrated is vibrated you in that video before the UFC starts that oh that was powerful yeah there's a part where Ari looked over and goes this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen the best was good time on that thing I what was a bathroom the UFC video when it first started was like oh they said it to the who American teenage here up teenage weslia Mambo Riley's yeah and the song yeah and uh yeah they set all the beat like all the punches to the you know John hits yeah you realize how brilliant something is sometimes when you're high what is it about that why do you why do you have to get high to realize that I don't know it seems so when you're sitting there and you're straight at a UFC and it starts when Outsiders oofah and all that shit you feel it yeah we with we did the acid it was a different fucking level we felt everything it's not funny how like you go to movies and if you go to the movies you're on acid or on pot or anything you could see bad acting yeah easily like that's why we watch Domino that man huh that's why we sat down watched Domino with fucking Mickey Rourke and Keira Knightley and it was it I think yeah it was interesting it was from a different angle you're watching acting so I'm sorry I interrupted you so what were you saying you're saying you're you guys are there you're on acid and running the Bob O'Reilly starts playing which is if you've never seen it never been to a live UFC it's really brilliant whoever edited it it's like some of the highlights of some of the greatest fights ever and it's all put together to the who it's a fucking it's one of the greatest videos humans of ever so it's a perfect volume yeah to rip you apart funk you can hear it but it doesn't really bother you then Jana and I go with it Dana and I were watching that the other day and I go dude I think I've seen this a fucking thousand times and I still write everything I've never stopped watching it love it it's good thing if you're there like 10 minutes before the UFC actually starts you have to be in your seat yeah he's so good to like whoever did it you can tell that guy loves fights like he just he nailed it the perfect beats to the perfect fucking punches and kicks and get you pumped up yeah all right guys dude I'm telling you it never wears out I've seen it hundreds of times I don't know how many times I've seen it I've seen it I mean every UFC start I've done at least 100 ufc's you're there you know yeah go on getting food when that's happen yeah because between spikes between spike tights and regular ufc's I think I've done over 100 so been over a thousand fights well here's the best when you're there and you're tripping to me if you'd like I said would you last a civilian and once then it just goes from Baba O'Riley and it locks down and also you hear this is emotional you just see a picture Anderson Silva saying when I go on that thing tonight I'm gonna knock his fucking mouth well that's up right now yeah it's about it on the acid now his head just came out and I think it was Vito's it was just a fucking head I thought it was fucking the Marlon Brando in Superman that 40 got yes we had the fucking heads around them it was a fact you're going down in New York City cocksucker wallet I don't know they would judge me but it was just head well that's the brilliance about it that at one point in the UFC as a civilian it just gets very dark and what's not just a perfect timing or so you see a head pop up low tonight I'm gonna take them pound them submission you're not good enough yeah you just go laughs and they keep showing little tidbits you know let me show the vitor then they went to John Jones then they went to Jake Ellensburg it's just so well done every times I've shown you a lighter reduction crowd explode yeah and it's and when you watch another sporting event now it's so below that part I would more like a game last year against stick uh against with Dwayne Wade's team he might have Miami him there was a fucking great game but there was a lot of lulls in it mm-hmm there's a lot of lows at the UFC when Bruce Buffer says do what you got to do go for twenty two fucking minutes I like a blast I like go get a hot dog right we are you go get fucking thing we are not go now have you ever won a fucking game stuff that's huge that they tell you yeah that's courtesy and what that is folks for the folks that don't know sometimes we have a certain amount of prelim cards but then the the co-main card starts it's a like you know seven pm and if the main card starts at 7 p.m. we have to have if the prelims are all done sometimes you got 20 minutes for the fights are supposed to start so we don't start fights early we have to wait until pay-per-view starts yeah sometimes you get like five first-round knockouts in the early fights yeah they're just like yeah and then yeah we run out quick and it was weird because this particular UFC started off I think with Gabe Ruettiger and whoever he fought a big Paul Taylor's and Paul Graham he got beat up fast then and then Kingsley came out against Romero and hit him with violent gladiator fucking up these to the body they're like fucking BAM Casillas Roscoe Ginsberg so again fucker million you can seal the fucking get these strikes yeah I can't have had the acid I was I'm gonna finding myself like this also Coran adjust myself what's going on check yourself before you wreck yourself Huskies you're watching you can't Kingsbury even when you're not hi that dudes a specimen oh my god specimen don't shred it he's got like a fucking solid 12 pack he's got a 12 pack on his back he's one of those dudes like you look at his back there's all these crazy striations in there when he was a super athlete yeah yeah you would shit with those fucking football players when they're on another level it's another level of athleticism and Kingsbury smashed that dude he just he's one of those guys every time you see him it's like he's been training for three years you know he makes these leaps in a couple of months and they're like yeah all those super athletes man that John Jones dudes those guys they make these giant leaps you know there's some dudes that just get so good so quick you know when you watch like John Jones the first fight that he had um you know or even the fight with Stephan Bonnar yeah you look promising you know look but Bonner made it to the the distance you know I mean he beat Bonner up and everything like then did some wild stuff except but you know people like wow this kids wild he's unorthodox but then you see him now and you go fuck man this kid is on another level dude another the way he handled Brandon Vera and you know I mean his last fight was just just proved it Brian Bader's a fucking stud and he just manhandled that kid he was on top of him every time there was an exchange he was on top control in the position he was never remotely threatened and squeezie yeah the kids a beast man Ryan Bader is a fucking gorilla dude you just stand next that guy he's one of the biggest 2o fibers out there and the fact that John Jones is able to handle him like that there was a half second where there was like a scrum like he tried to flip and didn't get him all the way over and then John Jones got out of that and it was done yeah and John Jones has two brothers and both of them were fucking football player bad motherfuckers yeah it's like his whole family's got like super genes you know I was standing there and he had two brothers the big American sees that he has a baby brother whatever in the 1975 MBA playoffs one of those years Darryl Dawkins remember Darryl Dawkins he was six foot he smashed the backboard right you know he was six of them yeah 290 I remember that into a brawl with Maurice Lucas and Austin they showed his family down from the stands and he had two brothers in the system bigger than him oh my god oh from fuckin flora you know you with those mother homework yeah just throw in security important they're all nice white people up there important least four fucking fucking people were just throwing them just round of you six foot eleven down with buckets Brian was smashing fiberglass yeah yeah I've heard I remember you don't say we just hang on him just crush up but they were glass weren't they were their mother break it fuck super reinforced yeah that guy was fresh out of the jungles of fuck what yeah what did they do back then what when the glass breaks do they stop no stop again they just roll without they roll another get another with the fucking fine yeah he got fine how much did he get fined uh I don't know maybe ten grand or something that's so work with us yeah well that's how we know about our high life food well glutton luckily they don't all do that that would be so douchey if they all did it look like I do just like the way you can do it by accident game he won't go back we just come up like Shaq would just smash through it he wouldn't build up this some you can really try to break it to Shaq smack him occasionally yeah but not on purpose he just fucking Brian was crazy so hard down I'm looking into it okay he has done in a while that one of his first service may go dude I met him a couple of times I first met him at the UFC and I met him he did an episode of fear factor with me and he did the countdown you know like three two one go you know standing next to me dude it looked like it didn't even look like I mean look like we were two totally different things you met him in Boston we ran everything without oh yeah that's true he's giant he's so big man he's so big it's ridiculous I feel like I like a little child you know this dude Darryl Dawkins played for the sixes and he got trades and that's when he moved to New Jersey I hope that her fucking powder did it really did that would sell him the powder was the speaker kid he was the ball kid on the Nets at that time and this kid ran a tremendous scam because the players on contract they take after every game they put on blue sneakers and they throw him away well his kid would take every sneaker and take it into a city and sell it I'm one of his jobs as a ball boy was to get Darryl Dawkins powder that was never and whatever you did but we all met a member then he took us a Darryl Dawkins house Darryl Dawkins showed me a fucking rolls-royce with a 14-mile fucking carrot - boys know what a gold - alor gajah how does or Oh finally no fucking idea those things why his wife died later on he came back before a couple years there I went over to his house like three times lived in Secaucus New Jersey Big Pimpin with the motherfucking 14-karat dashboard shit wow that's ridiculous that is ridiculous though you gotta love it though what is it about black people and shiny things I don't you know don't live in a tent to have a fuck Rolls Royce to the 14 his neck is will start as much as rock stars like to rock it and like to look badass they don't go that deep they don't go diamonds I heard a theory on that it's a black people rappers and stuff they're just doing what they thought about was rich when they were little so it's always them holding like a bowl of like sugar cereal and cards is how many women yeah but it's like oh this looks like rich stuff Rasheed Wallace got a urinal installed in his house nothing wrong with that that's really a good move especially one of those splash lish splashes there are no safe cake in there save water they have like a little disc little UFO you piss on somehow another go somewhere you don't have to just rinse the word water yeah that's like the the latest eco thing but it's been rejected by plumbers plumbers don't like it because cuts back on the maintenance so they try to say unsanitary no but in actuality the other ones are more unsanitary how weird is that you know there's been studies Joe Diaz studies on piss let's talk about urine we tell you something I was a kid the first house I moved into North Bergen a nice big one we had a fucking bidet really really yeah bang I was about handed nine to ten I used to go over there take a shit my mother's back and turned the bidet on a hit you the fucking face and I'm saying yeah but then you soup you put your little muffin in that bidet you get that little hot water though when I was the first time I had that little creaky little muffled thing he blasted hard who your asshole spotless you can feel it shiny I was about ten man that's what my asshole used to shine I use my bidet for carrying magazines you don't use it you never wash you have one yeah I go use that shit every day it's so much better than wedding toilet paper seems so bizarre I have so seams on American Dixie Mafia into the French what am I doing here things I thought in my own what am I doing here what a roll of goddamn toilet paper is not enough for you Rogan yeah I feel like I'm not supporting my own not okay you some French bullshit a bidet is nice right yeah okay wash her Nancy wanna give a lot of a commitment when you wipe your butt it's
