the girag and experience we're also paying for the sins of a lot of other people sure like for centuries lets you know white American men dominated everything in this country and like you know there's also a reality of a lot of people were treated like garbage for a long time and a lot of promises were broken and there's a reality to that that's not excuse making it's not right it's a real thing and and then they say well you know why people have benefited from that system even to so what's happening is in an effort to balance the fucking playing field a little bit a lot of us today are being treated unfairly because the balancing act is making things go so far like I do understand that like that's why I had a conversation after Tasha's I done who did the ghetto Tracy's gay jokes I had to become from folks alone know Tracy Morgan did a joke about if his son was gay he would stab him yeah and everybody went crazy I had a couple gay comics on Ric Roman Jim David and we talked about this on this comedy special I did and as comedians I asked them how do they feel about the imbalance in the language like the fact that you get in trouble for that now and Jim Davidson I'm okay with it and I'm like well how are you okay there's a comic and he goes cuz it's not a level playing field meaning what he thought was like in life gay people had not treated as well so he didn't give a shit if that guy got in a little bit more trouble and I kind of I heard what he said they're like even though I don't want to get in trouble for it in that sense he was right it's like you know we still have a big segment of our country that can't get married and they're treated like second-class citizens but yeah we go around and tell other countries how to live their lives which so fully shit it makes me nuts well I think there's a real legitimate argument in the idea that until it balances out until everyone completely relaxes on discrimination towards gays like like there's no discrimination on bachelors anymore you know like if a man is a 50 year old man says I'm just not getting married again there's no discrimination or social pro it's not a social pariah but if he decides to marry a man than it is like well what is that and why is that not eradicated from our culture yet well once that is eradicated from our culture then I think people are going to be much more likely to accept gay jokes much one because I keep hearing that gay jokes or homophobic and I guess what no they're not it's not homophobic at all it's a gay joke just like cats jokes about straight sex aren't hetero phobic all right they're jokes about sex and there's there's jokes about everything and it's really about context it's not about the subject matter you can't eliminate certain subject matters you just can't because the human language is very nuanced there's a lot of shit going on and every single interaction that you have where humor could potentially be crafted from it can be taken in the whole wide variety of different ways and I like all those ways I like people saying fucked up shit they don't really mean sure I think there's something funny in tracy morgan saying if I thought emotion was a little nugu and it's ridiculous it'll heal Ludacris right it's not real of course he wouldn't do that of course it would be you know it's ridiculous the idea that it's like I do a joke in my act like guess what Johnny Cash didn't really shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die either maybe it's I don't think he did he- more likely that he did then Tracy Morgan would stab his son yeah stupid Johnny Johnny Johnny Cash probably should have said I took some pills and fell asleep on the tour bus had a more accurate longest boxing match ever let's find out much ever oil good typing was the longest boxing match in history oh my god a boxing match land it lasted seven hours and what up fuck is that is that real oh my god listen to this the longest boxing match ever took place in New Orleans on april sixth of 1893 the match was between andy bowen and jack burke both of whom claimed the lightweight title after the reigning champ Jack McCall full all a fee aula fee Jack McCall he retired the winner of this take all purse was set at two thousand five hundred dollars and in order to decide who is really the new champion the match was set to fought to a finish they fought to a finish like that all through the contest fighters went at each other aggressively pounding each other with their gloves inflicting and sustaining tremendous punishment read like someone wrote it with their pants off that red was vigorously bastard oiled up and shaved and her yet three-minute rounds wore off oh my god they went to a hundred and eleven rounds both fighters dazed and weary gave up and did not come out of their corner Pooh Suze well you can't fight on your twelve round well how to be one guy telling them just get up rocky in your wing Jenna said all that what's Nina says it's 276 rounds in 1825 but that's English people long might we heard it much longer than that we are endurance is superior with proper boxing training that sounded more South African so maybe they're right man I don't know who ever fought over a hundred rounds is the craziest fucking human being that's ever lived that fight was only four and a half hours oh that's weird we live at thirty second rounds it doesn't make sense I can't even do the math I'm gonna try 2,500 bucks that's crazy for the welter with the welterweight championship of the world or without or lightweight rather code these days it's a good question it's a very good question I bet it'd be like a million bucks yeah it's that weird like when you hear about like economies imploding and then all of a sudden like a loaf of bread is worth a million dollars like how the fuck what does that even mean yeah I don't even understand how people have billions of document how does that number even a real number and can I have you a pull out a billion dollars in cash let me see ya at a certain point Tom you have to admit the you hack the game okay you hack the game somehow dude how'd you get ten billion dollars I don't understand when you know you got like Bill Gates you have a submarine and aside your giant yeah okay what happened here what exactly that you do are you getting all that money this is this isn't fair we have escaped pause in your house to jettison you to the middle of the fucking ocean whenever fucking danger shows up yeah you have a constant team of security detail around you that's like having a bank you know around you all the time Bill Gates is worth what a hundred billion or something crazy like that but if it with the whole him dropping forty thousand dollars he shouldn't pick it up kind of thing yeah that's what they say like if he drops 40,000 dollars it's worth more of his time to keep moving forward than it is to turn around and pick it up yeah he just what happened was he just didn't turn around the pick up the bonus i just got almost four for bludgeoning another man for 15 minutes he if he dropped that he wouldn't pick it up son your itunes oh shit itunes are recording to server get the fuck out of here server
