the girag and experience what the fuck man we're weird so weird what a stupid culture well you know I can't stop thinking about the guy that farted at the sink the airport we talked about it for ten minutes afterwards dudes fart when they pee go to the bathroom dudes constantly farting in public restrooms yeah but we were at the sink and the dude was washing his hands and he cut a monster far and I told Tommy about it I was like dude this guy he broke he broke the rule yeah I walked out just before this happened I unfortunately missed the incident but you said it immediately and I was I kept wrapping my head around I think what I've come to the conclusion is that if you do that all I'm looking for is for you to acknowledge it yeah yeah you need to say something yeah I want you to say something about that because I was thinking about how an old guy one time farted next to me in like on a tram on it and then the airport and I was like cheetah he let it fucking pretty big fart and I looked at him he goes snuck out of me I was like all right and I kind of took away like know what were you betting in it yes yeah I was like well thank you for acknowledging your your fart right now yeah this guy was just washing his hands and just the sink is not the year I don't think yeah I had a pastor yeah it was definitely urinal who does that it was definitely a gray area it's definitely great yeah people fart all the time at the urinals that's so common yeah I hear a lot of parties but if you get done zip up walk all the way around and wash your hands and a little washing edgy just unload and no one said a word everyone just it just let it go and then we got outside I was like you know dude how do you feel about this yeah I can't stop thinking about and then we're trying to figure out what kind of farts girls cut when they're in the bathroom and whether or not they wash their hands before I each other probably not as much not as much but they definitely drop heating there once they close that door I then they allow themselves yeah they allow themselves to fucking fart it up mmm you know there was a time when it was I want to say was like my my was like 23 I guess and I'm uh there was a squirrel and can't even say in the story she like we had this thing like it was this kind of like a fair if you will like she was engaged and well yeah and so like it was hot heavy it was fun but it was a girl it was yeah that we had a good time and it was one of those things where you know she would tell me she's like you know you're not gay this you know you're doing this too well and you're playing with my heart and so it's kind of like dangerous at the same time and then her fiance found out oh Jesus her fiance actually found out when I was going down on her in her bedroom he walked in no he was knocking on the door outside and the lights when I were like oh shit he was like hey I'm here I'm here I'm here here open the door over the door and immediately what do i do cuz there's like what do i do what do i do I jump in the shower like an asshole no because that's not suspicious I just came over to shower her fiance's hun you turn the shower on the shower on and he's like what he told oh my god yeah I'll see you later it was great thanks for the study break and the shower what I gotta get pussy off my face right yeah I really did that's the thing with a steel wool pad you know um God so what so and then and then like she moved away and then um I got this phone call oh god I was so crazy um I got this phone call from him to the fiance what'd you jerk off over the phone no he was mad he's really oh dude he was like so what the fuck is about hearing about this and this and this and she's in the background and she's just like he's lying he's lying he's a fucking faggot don't listen to him in a year oh yeah she threw you down threw me down was mine that was the last time and this was somebody that I was like I we had like I thought we had something and when she said that I was like later like I couldn't like that was it so you how will do you the time I was 22 or 23 you had already come out you'd come out yeah so when you were when you whether you told her that you were gay yeah like everyone like new like it was just one of those but then you get those girls who are like I'm gonna turn you and you're like no really oh I get it all the time you get it all the time okay so trying to turn you straight yeah there's a lot of fear involved in being in the actual wild itself yeah and there they worry about stuff they make up stuff to worry about I mean just to just to give him a way out and so that was a bit and that was that was true for me too I mean it was overwhelming for me I didn't go back in there in the mountains for ten day solo huh right out of the gate I went for like one night like I went on a scouting trip and then stayed one night then came out and it's just kind of baby steps into it because it's you know if you if you pull you know I don't know how many people are here in LA but how many people have stayed out overnight in the mountains by themself it's not be very many people I mean it's I don't know five yeah maybe I mean it's it's just not something people do in this day and age and so it's because it's you know it's you're out of your comfort zone but if you can do that and that's why I became good at that and actually then I I I loved it now remember let's see it was uh um let me think what I don't know what whatever I can't remember the year but I killed a six by six bull elk by myself and it was my best bull and I got out of the wilderness has a little Toyota four wheel drive I had this this bull loaded up and I was just so pumped finally got cell service out on the highway and I'm driving home you know I called my wife and I was like I was like hey trace I killed a six by six bowl and she's like princess died died I'm like what she's a princess died died I go who cares i chilled a six-by-six bull it was like I you're so you know to everybody else Princess Diana dying was just like you know the world's going to stop but when you're back in the wilderness and you killed a six by six bolo nothing else matters and that's I just remembered that's the difference between living back there where it's just about am I going to find a place to sleep tonight am I going to be warm and we'll have food that's it that's all you care about yeah and my parents actually didn't want me to do martial arts because they were terrified that I was going to become this angry kid who knew how to fuck people up whereas before I was this angry kid who really couldn't do anything it wasn't wasn't dangerous I was 11 you know and then this 11 year old became 12 and then 12 year olds like I want to be like Bruce Lee now I got the fuck you know I don't think so you know didn't want me I've been doing Chuck side nunchucks all tylers people were taking shit away from me I've make him in the woodshop I tell him that I was making chair legs fucking my cherish grab two broken legs funny did they look exactly like nunchucks attached mr. chase on who's the every kid love nunchucks yeah that everybody did of course the Bruce Lee movies man yeah they were dope you see him swinging around us I had a really funny story that happened there so there's a kid I was like seven there's a kid
