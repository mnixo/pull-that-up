the girag an experience the other another experience I had I've had in recent years it led me to not want to engage in this is is walking around various events in sort of breakout things you people who you know people I've admired in the past all saying things like do you see that as you see I flamed X on Twitter I do see what I eat about that person I I think these used to be serious people yeah in the southeast to be serious people engaged in serious things and here they are engaged in these four flailing fistfights and often often let's face it on things which if you didn't do it like that seeking out the fight are the sort of thing that would allow for normal human interaction I mean how many disagreements do we have with people in our personal lives all the time if we want it to right you didn't vote this way that way I mean some people would mind about that but you know I I know you've you think's like differently for me on this particular issue you don't say let's have that out now once and for all um you found ways to live with people's difference and different opinions and I mean you're not gonna get everyone exactly in line I mean that we all knew that before the age of social media and now it seems to be the only aim what do you think that is I mean think it's what we were discussing earlier that it's idea sport and then you just get caught up and like someone volleyed your way and so you have to smash that tennis ball back their way it is something like that I mean I I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious pleasure of some of that myself you know that old Chinese proverb about sitting by the river watching the bodies of your enemies float by I had a big sense of that the other day when somebody I deeply dislike came a cropper on social media at the same time as somebody else I deeply dislike was being held by the French police on serious charges and I thought that was a I felt like the Chinese proverb they're that's alright and so I can I can see why people feel it sure and of course people who they could never normally get to who they've got to right I mean I think that's I think that's the big the big thing of you know look I poked that you know one in the ass yeah I never engaged on social media for precisely that reason am i that reason of my father's that you would never I would never want somebody to know they could get to me even if they even if you just blocked them there's many people who take pride even in their heading they say I am blonde on Twitter by all these people and and actually I do sometimes read what people say is sent to me and I've never blocked anyone because I sort of think you should might if you put your ideas out that you might as well be as open as possible to receiving them back some time ago when I got into a row with the with the Turkish president about about something I got all these Turkish sort of account saying he said there's one guy just repeatedly sent me pornography of animals having sex it's very it was very hardcore and and so I used to go down the feed there that guy and I didn't even block him actually because I sort of thought well somewhere in Turkey it's a really angry man desperately finding horse pornography sent him to me and in a way I felt so sorry for him that that was how his life had come ugh you know the end his life had come - at this stage that I I couldn't even block him and also he'd be like I'm the donkey porn guy who got blocked by dog value he'd get a certain faith do you think that they're just caught up in this sexy thing yes a lot of it is sensationalism is also what the public is really focused on right now something that gathers ratings I think they're driving it hmm I think it's driven from the top down from the establish from the media down from the Democrats down because again if you talk to regular people they're fucking hurting right wages have been stagnant since 1980 there's 30 million people that don't have health care in Trump's first year in office three million more people lost health care because he did all these executive orders that basically took a hatchet to Obamacare so you have all these people who are really hurting there they care about their wages they care about you know not being saddled with over a trillion dollars in student loan debt this is the shit regular people care about so if when they turn on CNN and they see Russia Russia Russia even if you don't like Trump I just Bice Trump with every fiber my fucking being but when I see this I roll my fucking eyes and then they have the nerve to say Oh Trump won't shut up about Russia you were talking about her all day and he responded to it and because he responds it to it you're like oh there he goes again with Russia yeah it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this all plays out I'm really fascinated and I'm fasting to see if he can make it out of for years well not only well I think he's gonna do you think he's gonna run might be he's gonna run again and he's gonna win again he has a chance it has a fucking chance because if the Democrats run Kamala Harris if they run Cory Booker or any of the other corporatists he can win because he's gonna go right back into his tap-dance about being a populist and helping people and guess what in the first few years of his tax bill regular people did get a tax cut so he's gonna say looking look at your tax bill I just gave you no extra thousand dollars this year who you want to vote for and so there is an argument that he's gonna make to the people and if you don't have somebody like Bernie Sanders or Bernie Sanders talking about the issues that matter to people well then of course he can fucking win again listen there there was I was laughed at when I said if it's Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton he can win people laughed at me we have a soft life now so there's gonna be a lot of people that are ridiculous and you know are there's always been those people that are weak-willed and they want the world to be nerfed up and of course had their feelings you're gonna have that there's also more people that have an understanding of like that's not a happy healthy way to live your life it's not and I also think that like reality at some point will always supersede nerf padding yeah there's always gonna be pushback on that we go look like I don't want to offend anybody but let you know and I do agree that like there's a movement by the left that really does push you know I did a thing Reese I'm doing this charity event for like an urban program for kids mainly inner-city black kids and I'm hosting it with my my buddy Mike yard he's a really funny comic black dude and we went to meet with the guys for this charity and they were telling us that uh you know we're they have an auction like any charity event right an auctioneer comes out there try to auction off and raise a lot of money from return to help the program that's a very basically 99.9% of every charity event I've ever been involved this has an auction segment in the dinner right they were like we're gonna have that but we can't use the word auction I said what what do you mean you can't use the word auction don't like it's a sensitive word for you know the community I was like and then the yard goes are you talking about slave-like his head it was like god wait we know and I was a quick we can't say the word auction I'm like but aren't you hiring a guy from Sotheby's yeah his cards gonna say auctioneer honest oh my we're just gonna pretend that's not what he's called and they were just like we just don't feel comfortable with that word in the room and I was just going I can't I said guys I gotta tell you like you're making me wanna vote for Trump that's what I said that's how dumb I think this is [Applause]
