three two one dam would live we got up early as a motherfucker ladies and gentlemen not really no it's 10:00 a.m. didn't we do when I'm like 4:00 a.m. before we didn't want at 5:00 a.m. better for down it was it was a is a England card right was it something called Anna or something cock and lendable charge it might have been like what time it's in Africa right now is it yesterday yeah I think it's there 12 yes I had Wednesday I forgot he knocked out Whitaker we're looking at wonderboy stop and Whitaker yeah that's big at 70 yeah but that was Whitaker was diminished man getting down to 170 was a fucking battle for him do you look at wonder boy what he's accomplished it's so impressing although indicators would point that wonderboy should win this fight but I'm on the fence man well I think he'll really is a bad bad man there's no question about it but he did come up real short on the way in which really bums me out now I had heard that his pregnant girlfriend is in this is what everyone's saying is in the hospital and that she's had some serious issues and he's been going back and forth to the hospital and he hasn't he just didn't have a chance to cut the weight right a lot of people claim you know that that's exactly what that would the issue was I don't know that dramas never good especially your first main card main event in your hometown against wonderboy yeah there's enough pressure as it is well the cowboy fight was a big pressure fight but he rose the case really though it was it was it cuz we didn't know who he was really his opportunity for sure but you're fighting a smaller guy it's against cowboy you know so he goes forward and does work now it's like man I mean there's been guys who have blown up before but the the hype on till and I'm all up on his dick but you know there's a ton of hype on if he wins this one it's off to the races it is but he's fucking four and a half pounds over a championship weight that is a lot that's not a little that's a lot it's such an advantage to you know fighters that wait are undefeated this year when they still fight they're undefeated yeah it's a big advantage I think this one cheating it is a fault if you do it on purpose for sure I think what's interesting with wonderboy did he said you gotta weigh 188 the next day type move yeah just tales Omar big boy yeah tills a really big boy very very smart like whatever advantage that he got from not cutting that extra three pounds you know now he's three and a half pounds now he's you know lost a little bit of it I guess it's you know if you're Wonder Boy though you want to drag this into later rounds you know you can come out aggressive you know he said some drama cutting waiting he had to cut more weight to maintain it the day yeah a day of so yeah yeah that's all fascinating man so fascinating we're gonna find out a lot the other thing is to the styles like what Wonder Boy does is a kicking distance like if you watch like the exchanges that he's at he moves real good at the waist like a snake like back and forth but he wants to keep you not even that muy Thai taking distance he keeps you at karate kicking distance forces sideways and very far more stuff to reach and Darren's got to close that gap and closing that gap is when Wonder Boys the most dangerous and if you see some of his training footage he seems to be concentrating on blitzing in and letting and countering and sidestepping encountering yeah I can hear door yeah if you look at wonder boys history when every fights aggressive dudes they get fucked yeah that's and that's what till wants to do I'm telling you man if nothing in this fight would surprise me unless Darren till just goes out there and just Maxim just no respect merch and that's the only thing I'm surprised me but if tilt does win strap a fucking rocket ship that boys back because now that Bisbing is retired UK needs a face that's him that is the fucking guy man even if he loses he could still be that he's 25 years old yeah but not to that extent you know like you beat Wonder Boy and you knockout Wonder Boy it's fucking he's a super talented striker though what he did to cowboy it wasn't just impressive it was like complete domination demoralize just just controlled the range he controlled everything aspect of the exchange his cowboy got like one good knee off at one point time and one good right hand to the body I rewatched a fight the other day just to kind of get me am so impressive oh my he obliterated them the thing - about - I think you had so much hype is a lot of guys talk like kobe commenting amazing talented fighter there's a lot of guys talk a lot of stuff and like i it's more of an act to super talented when Darren till talks my cop it's almost that Conor McGregor affecting like I put this fool actually believe said he believes it and here's those ridiculous skills that's gonna go a long ways hmm did you put your tank down there's me know jujitsu in this Eddie no Jude's oh I know about Darren till is his fight with Cerrone that's it I'm this card you know it's um it's gonna be interesting you were on the car no he got hurt but you have Gunnar Nelson Neil Magny which was a fun fight so great fight they were gonna do Gunnar Nelson until but for the reason they decided to go with Wonder Boy Jason Knight I know I know about him did he already fight a London RC on the main card he's on the main cut all beautiful was a tough fight oh my god he's a tough fight a very tough fight no no he's well he lives in Finland but what is his background he's a he's a really good wrestler who also has wild a strikes mouth fine super tough fight for your boy yeah yeah Neil Magny who's Neelam Agni fight now for Wonder Boy though there's not there's not a ton of upside Mike Ross fight I don't know why he took it to be honest watch up for him but yeah it's your you're in dangerous territory right you're fighting the number nine guy you ranked number one you know he misses wait he's huge like there's just I feel like all the pressures off Wonder Boy right now especially afternoon mr. Wayne but I just if you're Wonder Boy and you even if you starch till they're not give me a title shot until Woodley loses that strap Wonder Boy is not fighting for a title 14 - and one for Wonder Boy you got to remember loss was to tyron woodley and then to map around those two fights and one draw with Woodley crazy so why couldn't fight Woodley again they fucked them well that's the that's what he's asking first of all he's saying why don't I get a shot at the interim title how are you giving the interim title to Colby covington who only beat Demian Maia who's 40 years old who's clearly past his prime how is how is that good enough to get him a shot at the interim title when I talked a lot of shit that's it yeah there you go basically but that goes along with the same time yeah it goes a long way this day and age but at the same time with RDA you know they're not doing Kobe any favors send them down to burn on sites in Chicago Chicago to fight RDA which is if you look at Kobe style it's probably the worst matchup for him he's a heavy underdog so I'm hoping not hoping I think what their plan would be RDA wins that fights Woodley which is tough matchup for Woodley and then RDA were able to beat Woodley then you have one away slip in or Kobe wins and then you got mad shit talking with him and Woodley and it gets very interesting gets like that fight some I 5e and Tyron Colby's the underdog in every one of those yards yes but RDA Woodley you got a barn burn and that's a great matchup yeah RDA Woodley's very interesting because because as much as as they you know I love woodland I think his style is ridiculous he's gonna be tough to beat you know I think they want some bit of turnover in there they want some turnover what is already a gonna do it to Woodley I mean he's never taken down no he's the only thing he's got strong on the striking his movements good and this does go to the to the ground and his kicks would be a tough one to beat for anybody yeah striking even Rd a striking Woodley has I'll put you to sleep instantly striking well there's more power RJ has better fundamentals I would say as far as putting more tire on it together kids speed the power and the explosive is a goddamn nightmare it's not going to the ground and Leslie wants it to Woodleigh just got through shoulder surgery he just got his labor repaired which is not the worst shoulder surgery and he does that mean exactly stapled the labrum back to the labrum no the labrum he had some sort of a tear in it that fucked up in the Demian Maia fight like instantly they stitch it back together again but he's gone through crazy PRP and all kinds other shit now he put up a video of him hitting mitts and it's only been about three months since the surgery and he's hitting mitts hard I don't know if that's an old video though he's sneaky you know he put up this video he's a him though he might he might be doing you know actions of this who definitely got some injections he was talking about all the different things dude for as far as there he came on the podcast just a few weeks after shoulder surgery and he was moving around normal and moving his hands around normal but it really depends entirely on how bad this the big one is the bicep tendon when the bicep tendon gets torn off the muscle or off the bone and then they have to put it back in staple it down everywhere and then they have to it does work right now now does not for pitchers if you're a pitcher and that should go south not good you're diggity done but for a fighter no problem it doesn't seem to be a problem for fighters but I bet Woodley so you got RDA Colby so the obviously the winner that will fight with the end of the year will it be back into the year no doubt yeah it could very well be on the December 31st card you know that's a big one huge guys you know I mean I think they were trying to talk about him being on the August card in LA but that's yeah that's a damn good card right now right la is who do they just be named now see that's not happening so who do you have now in LA let's see let's pull that up did they put do they find a opponent for as I beat there's gonna be at Staples yeah yeah well they want to do cyborg versus Nunez not happenin in a suspended is she yeah which you hurt her hands from whooping that ass whupping that ass damn oh yeah TJ and Cody okay that's all a yeah very cards not no struggle Street right now with hey not nearly as good August 4th cars not nearly as good as it was gonna be no it was gonna be a bother partner but yeah yeah so far this cards is uh they have some time though it does we're only in May and then there's some great fights coming up Rob you well Romero's son Chicago was one of the best cars ever Jose Colby Covington Holly Holm Megan Anderson hey let this sink in you got CM Punk first that Jack I forget his name Jackson over Overeem Curtis blaze cloud Liga deja Esparza that's so discussed and then on the undercard you got Rashad Evans and my boy Joey Benavidez were status no see I said take a seat y'all that is so crazy Mike Jackson that is that is so crazy oh and one versus one one does that piss you off no cuz I get it because I'm not a fight if I was a fighter I'd be furious but not out of the game in the entertainment I know what you're doing sounds a wolf tickets there I see what you're doing well it's just the worst fight of all time UFC history skill-wise oh yeah spice teas good he's about to fight now Eric Spice Lee what do you guys know about him I don't know anything about him no I mean I probably seen him from his jiu-jitsu is really the favorite he's really good a weird body um where's he from gym somewhere on the East Coast when he's in LA he comes through my school Mercs everybody really yeah does that does that seem punk Jackson stuff bother you Joe are you used to it no bothers me yeah I don't like it I don't mind him fighting I think it's great that he's fighting in the USA but he's testing himself in the UFC even if they wanted to do in the UFC have him on the the you know the prelims put him on fs1 you know make it you know make it a fight pass thing I think it's contract won't allow that I think it's gonna be a pay-per-view I assume if you see him Punk you that big of a draw maybe he was is he still do you think how many people are gonna buy that pay-per-view to watch him fight that first one yeah now first thing you got is asked what's so bad how is the WWE like raging huge or is it that's why it's huge people are actually going it's Jerry so just like that that raw the Rosses which Fox has now which a lot of people I don't think they realize Fox decided to go with the WWE instead of the UFC they turned down the UC and went with doug w and now they have the raw surge which gets like three something million viewers every time they air it's a built-in audience that's crazy I always bet on dudes about hairy backs yeah their testosterone is usually higher than everyone else's Manny's going bald two for two he's got some fucking gorilla back look at some werewolf type shit but not hairy legs which is weird yeah very strange it's not weird that's some weird hair placement unless you say as a bush trying to slip out of leg locks all shaved down he's got a weird body though right yeah right it's it's interesting he's a kid he's a character because the ground homeboy is in trouble good jab he's got a good job look at that pop hop you know good range Oh mm-hmm damn Stewart just popped where's Stuart from he had a white flag it looked like a Red Cross flag this country dude fucking England the wall come on Scouts lad I'm sorry haven't seen Braveheart in 10 years a totally different country oh shit okay it's still United kendama good boy yeah we were talking before the podcast about how good huh not too low Rogers Scouse oh shit his Liverpool access George was good to the other night the cobblestone you didn't till was fucking good to him it was good that was high yeah super legit though I've doing everything I can to prepare dump them to me a lot of pressure on that kid yeah well it's crazy if this is all going on as we heard that while his girlfriend is pregnant and in the hospital and she's having issues like with the baby I can't imagine the sound he's about to take him down we've been through pregnancies but he's gonna take him down I just want a healthy baby that's the last thing we'll deal with fight week ago yeah the same baby mom or a different one we probably did you sync up did you do people know what we're at no do you still do that yes necessary do we have a number on the screen 239 Jaime hooks it up on the screen now we're watching no type move Jaime fucking balls Jaime's it's vibrant today because it's Game seven of the Cavs he's all nervous look at him he's got CC CC pray this morning Jamie for LeBron James health Hebert's come back I saw that three-pointer that he did he hit like I don't know Game six or something the game learner actually have some interesting going I'll never concussion protocol that's getting one of their players out so like a guy got hit in the head during the game and he can't play it until he goes through like five Kevin Love yes who's missing the game the fucking basket for Game seven oh you see a guy but God man the fuck up this time from asylum it's the league it's there's rules and seven him it's not him it's the rules how they do that for basketball damage like some CTE in basketball sure really who players that have had some problems really not like rampant like the NFL obviously but they get in trouble and they don't want to be liable just like the NFL you make sense makes sense crazy though huh the last people you'd think that would be putting people on the bench I know so she came seven so what's going on watch ESPN deal like when does that start I don't know so UFC is gonna be on ESPN now yeah no more Fox that's done no it finishes at the end of this year who should be Fox an ESPN we're gonna split it right yeah and then Fox didn't want to pay like the premium but I think it's better I think I think it was a homerun for the UFC man to land at ESPN it's you know it's as serious as it gets as far as major sports it's on one network when and also with ESPN she of ESPN plus which we get some fight nights any of regularly SP on espn2 with Fox not that they didn't do a great job but it was off xx FS - it's like you know where is it and then outs on UFC fight pass and outs here and she's just going I think yes PN can learn from mistakes from Fox and just make it that much better I think you're right about that because there's been some times that I thought I had my DVR set but then I get home and it was on fs1 I'm like mother fucker or sometimes like my back it's like my bat NASCAR's playing so go to FXX time fuck man we're a baseball game goes long and you got to go FS - yes I'm gonna find it that's 672 my only concern on ESPN is because ESPN FC has then FL has NBA how much how much folks are gonna put on the UFC you know like we don't be the side chick right because they're made to the NBA NFL that's that that's their baby are we that is the UFC give me the side chick you know right good point don't want but they've been putting on some good boxing matches there the lomachenko contracted loan Jenkins yeah they had they had another really good fight on recently let me check on my podcast coming up ooh yeah yeah excite for that I'm gonna English its mobile figured out yeah I'm they contacted me too yeah I think I'm gonna have them on as well might as well might as well I got questions watch yours first learn from my mistakes get a translator it sometimes it's like you think it'd be a good idea to have somebody on but if you had them on like oh how long could you talk to them I know well it'd be for the show time below the TV show so it's only a six minute segment yeah when you've had you've had cyborg on but you've had her on with her boyfriend her boyfriend translates yeah well no her English is pretty good but if there's ever issues so like take over you know like she'll explain it and then it's a little I'm like I don't know what my right and then take over but it works great yeah it's hard you know when I had yeah well we're on it was the best cuz Joey was translating for Yoel so you know it was it was great it's a fuckin heart gig though translating translating nightmare I can't actually do it for all the fun I mean Eddie you speak Spanish you know how hard it is I barely speaks man but you speak enough like to talk to people yeah you know we keep it light yeah as soon as we get deep I'm lost as Iranian start they start real flowing fast yeah my grandma when she start you know I was the first of the grandkids to lose Spanish and felt really shameful because of that but man it was it was rare it was really embarrassing hanging out with my grandmother and she's going off and I'm like I don't know what she's saying I got looking over to my aunts I'm like what did she just say it's very very embarrassed it's tough when you have a translator because you don't get in that flow you know pot there's there's a flow and you're like kind of connecting going back and forth where if there's a translator just the chemistry's not there right you don't have that fun yeah hello no but the one thing that is good though I what I find is that it allows you more time to think about what you're gonna say oh oh oh oh damn Stewart's teeing off Oh spicy coming back but but sometimes I have too much time to think about the question I'm not you know I don't it's not as fun it's not as good sometimes we're gaming right then I feel like like I work for ESPN or something right I know exactly we don't know and I don't want to be that yeah yeah yeah yeah right that's not the hard part of like having these conversations with people is to keeping them conversations and not turning them into some corny ass fucking the interview the worst there's nothing right but sometimes you have to do it if you can't like sometimes fill myself with so she was aw damn Stewart was an underdog doing this damn hit him with some bombs England coming and strong yeah man I've watched those interviews those standard interviews now where you know there's no connection between the person talking and the other person answering the questions and they're so gross you know I've done this conversation with that Ken Jong yeah right Ken yeah dr. ken is amazing might be the last guy in the world he's sweet but he doesn't do a lot of he's like podcasts really I'm like dude go and have your publish it up Joe or something like the pockets is it's as big as it gets amazing yeah I'm like like and I the example I gave him he'll say you went on tonight's show you do a four-minute segment you're gonna have to you literally promote in whatever movie or the stand-up you're special coming out that's all you're doing is ya holdin trying to get people to buy that that's not that's not real man that's not the real you know I mean we're time like this if we film this people gonna be a fan of you then buy whatever you can be into or whatever you're pitching that's a much better way to go there's no time limit there's no restrictions it's crazy that you never get there's no other place for that like even Howard Stern would do interviews with people he would get people to say a lot of shit yeah agenda yeah he had an agenda I would Stern had an agenda technically yeah fuckin he wouldn't he wasn't just having a conversation with you yeah he calls himself the dentist okay does he have nice firstly a dentist I hope you know he pulls people's teeth out it's hard with his fists or sure hmm yeah well it's already been taken to Josh neer yeah I'm Vermont bro old-school that's a great name dude it knocks teeth out yeah what's a guy like Josh neer and Martha's like the janitors sweep you up he's a guy that you're a hardcore fan you know who Josh neer is and Josh neer has been around a long time the new fans don't know no so that goes so cool still that's like calling yourself hands of stone if you're a box or lay the fuck off yeah that's Roberto Duran yeah fuck up not saying that Josh sneers in the same breath as Roberto Duran but still as a fan a fan for more time yeah that's his nickname someone had hands of stone no like stone vinegar Jon moniker Dominic or or Sam stout one of the that's right but so did I so did homeboy in strike words too came over the UFC we had that they almost had like the double knockout he hit uh homeboy with a body shot and they got knocked out oh what's his name got Scott Smith yeah Scott Smith hands stones right has a steel steel steel there's a lot yeah there's a lot of that going around now some people just go hard but those fucking made up nicknames and make them up from themselves you can't do that man you can't give yourself a nickname like you're kidding when the neighborhood and just gave yourself a get the fuck out of here we're calling you dance I'm The Dark Knight no you're not well that's what I like about Brazilians like they all have like silly nicknames like shoo face yeah stop calling yourself if you're if it's 2018 and you just starting out and you call yourself to pitbull fuck off fuck that might be on pitbulls super there's about seven pit bulls in Bellator there's three and you at least wears girls to sleep there are other cool dogs isn't Jack Russell have you ever seen that Netflix documentary where they use Jack Russell Terriers to get rats there you know yo it's crazy for an hour no no no the the documentaries all on how fucked up rats are and how much got you you see that dude it will freeze Jack Russells to go after rats yeah Russell's are so aggressive hmm little Terriers it's one of the reasons why they're so aggressive is because they're they're constantly chasing after these fucking rats when they get them they tear these rats apart man look at that damn dude those are some bush-league dogs that's a mix Jamie that let this from the movies are but these are some these are all Jack Russell Terriers in particular one of the reasons why they're so small and so aggressive they would go into holes and go after rats dude look at the blood on the back where the fuck are they so Michael Vick video place oh but this documentary will freak you the fuck out there's more rats than there are people in New York City they're like 30 it's 30 million 60 million rats some shut myself someone say and they have like all sorts of diseases that everything they can kill you yeah they have all kinds of deadly shit you just don't get it cuz most people don't get bit by rats and they're smart but we need rats though right don't they eat the trash that's good question do we can't we just do they you just can't just breed rats and you throw them in the dump and just have them eat don't think like I don't think they like fucking milk reading service releases when the dump your the cans ticket right yeah but now we got to get rid of rat shit oh fuck use it as fertilizer that can't be good for the dogs Jimmy manoa boom boom boom he's a fun hot minute when did he fight last a long me started did he I thought he starched homeboy though the wrestler hmm Oh Nordine Taleb he's very good that guy's good he's nasty he isn't he Tristar yeah he is he looks like the he looks like the guy with the rose in the mouth from Mike Tyson's punch-out he does Darin tills got some prominent cheekbones huh yeah he didn't really like that that's why you got that nickname the gorilla he looks like he's got at least 5 percent Neanderthal do you think someone gave him that nickname the gorilla yeah I hope so too that bums me out I called myself two gorillas I hated I hated my nickname to twist her so much I hated that shit cuz I just sounds pretty homosexual the twist yeah yeah I was because Higgin and jean-jacques would always call me that because of the guillotine yeah they called the rustlers guillotine the twister and I asked John Jacques I'm like how do you say the twister and Portuguese and you know stolen either I go can you call me that that sounds yeah they would never call me that they kept calling twister and it started snap it started sounding good when I'd compete and people would start yelling at then I thought okay okay I think I like it now I dig it man Toronado tore nah I just kept thinking of the game the twister and the yellow dots and the Greens yeah she get a tattoo that says L Toronado yeah never stop I don't you get what's sticking right now that's way better than the twister - that's a great word sound sounds dangerous - this summer Toronado there you go I'm a German that would be a great license plate if you could fit all those words tornados [Applause] tornado there's a there's an A in there in English is tornado tornado is it no I'm just the aid that's what makes it dope you can't you can't pick your nickname like Cal called me big brown for the longest like I'm like why is it because your big fucking brown that's sweat and then I would walk place people yell up big Browns like I will fuck that stock name that's a good nickname kind of it's fun yeah yeah that's good man dope no Sh yeah that's that's just from you yeah that's it even when you were doing Taekwondo no one gave you a nickname no Joe no when I was playing pool a lot I was Joe the comedian - good GSP went off on Yun that the podcast he just did on your turning sidekick holy shit talk about indoor she's critiquing it that was Jay is gay for a half an hour is going on about his power it's incredible no shit George holy shit that's GSP going off on Joe Rogan no trained a little afterwards I switch my mats out I had those zebra mats that are super smooth no bueno - zeg on on throwing kick TV GU as in 1997 some sort of a video you know John Danaher just put out a DVD well he put out a video Wranglers and fuckin Under Armour tots of course what a DVD yeah I would I would do that George now we we went over the front leg side kick first which is like the most important part the turning side kick once you get the front leg side kick down you understand how that works then you turn and then it's basically you're turning and then throwing the front leg side kick it's just go you an extra push to it but most people do the front leg side kick wrong their knee is too low and knees too low you lose all the power crazy shit you think you fight he's gonna fight at 55 the other 100 he's only 185 pounds yes P yeah and he's only doing it once it's gonna be the winner of Conor khabib he started dude this is C look at this this is what wonderboy does it's that's weird that side way stance is hard to fuck with man I used to spar with this guy named Larry Jones Larry Jones was this dude who was like he was like 6 foot 2 but his fucking legs went all the way up to his armpits man he had a long hit the guy standing in front of the bag when you first walked by the nose John Lee jobs the other tall dude dude dude black dude John Lee was a beast that could easily be a Chinese dude yeah it could be yeah if you heard it but he was like 6 foot 2 black as coal Dan that's the beginning of our movie dude you walking by that Taekwon he just wobble I saw him flatten a lot of people with that too but anyway my friend Larry Jones I was too short you know i'm 5-8 when i would spar with him my legs were normal length he was 6 2 and i just could not get past that front like sidekick nightmare that front like psychic is so hard and they can just move around with you it's basically like a jab and they can move around with you you know it's like and they're safe yeah yeah yeah and getting tangled trying to get an angle on them there's actually a thing on hen Zoe's Instagram the other day we had a photo of Hickson throwing a sidekick and he was talking about how Hickson like the sidekick best for valley tudo because you know you never lost your base like if you throw a roundhouse kick you throw the killer you're sitting around Yuri said he was kind of throwing like a front push kick side kick yep and he would out of all the Gracie's it looked like Hicks and through it with the most power yeah because the hoist would throw but it didn't look powerful but but when you watch hoist Sakuraba - when I was at the Coliseum that's a forgotten fight people watch how host would be on his back and and in Sakurai was standing over him there's like purgatory Sakuraba standing hoist throw side kicks off his back did he do it better than anybody I've ever seen he's on a side and he was throwing some serious side kicks off his back my chakra and fucking up soccer Robbins knees I've never seen anybody throw member Hicks and did that to Funaki when Funaki got Hickson down Funaki broke Hickson's orbital people forget like that what that was Hickson's greatest victory because Funaki was the guy that what people were saying well he's such a good grappler if he went to the ground with Hickson he could he could actually hang with Hickson but he cracked Hickson with a big right hand heard him fucked up his I broke his orbital when they went to the ground and as we knocked you standing over Hicks and Hicks and fucked his knees up you fucked his knees up with sidekicks off of his back yeah that's huge huge and no one practices that shit no no and and hens Oh would practice up kicks specifically just just in case he was in that purgatory position where he de boom any it worked against Oleg Taktarov remember that yeah that was the first up kick for us up kick ko yep and I think it was either I think Morello Bustamante did it to Jerry Bohlander or he was either fabio shell de bolander or Bustamante to bolander up kick boom took him out BAM you know numb kicks are now legal in combat Jiu Jitsu they're legal yes drop kicks you're legal now shit how hard was that to get that um you know what an amateur MMA up kicks are legal Jay Cardosi amateur MMA up kicks are legal we added them to combat usage because guys were getting too comfortable in purgatory don't you just standing over guys they didn't want to go into anybody's guard that could kill the show so now with the threat it's really easy to deal with up kick so all they gotta do is just get to their knees and start passing they got engaged yeah just engage all you get because you rarely see up kicks in MMA rarely because they're so easy to deal with but the threat of them will keep you you know either away from purgatory or get on your knees and and commence to passing that's what it's all about you're about to say Mousasi Jacque ray yeah he knocked out Jacques all right when they're trying to choke them yep feel it a try yeah there's been probably I would say Rory MacDonald Adler like seven total up kicks history something like that so we're not adding up kicks to combat Jiu Jitsu to increase Kos we're adding it to increase the ground don't fly over the guy says let's go yeah yeah let's get to that smart yeah yeah I love combat jujitsu I love the ruleset I love what it does it opens up the the reality aspect you understand that you can't just do certain things you're gonna get smacked in the face all right it keeps your jujitsu honest that's it don't get too crazy dude I forgot my Holly Holm vs. Megan Anderson yeah that's a barn burner oh yeah it's a big fight for Anderson is their first shot at the UFC and his right away Holly Holm you know is there any button they could they could give cyborg a match a good good competition Ryan the right favorite right favorite if there's not a woman who's gonna give her any challenge cyborgs to fight a man no no no sexual assault Craig no I know brother and I'm not saying you're our favorite did that but you paint this story mark it she comes out with me too and just beats the shit out of it throws my gallons in her corner in the city comes out of the floor right behind my main event CM Punk against cyborg that would be great I said you know I said that before not bro she would knock his head off in the fuckin cartoon just saying that weren't you guys saying that guys could never be an MMA fighter could uh would always beat a girl right we're talking about Ronda Rousey back in the day that can Ronda Rousey he said that he said Ronnie could beat Mike Tyson ya know or the flying armbar maybe know the huge still slammer event today he's like 50 yeah I guess it was rough she she would beat me that's right now but um I think the rough sea is he doing bad I'm not doing bad it's just you don't when you when especially as me growing up with with Mike Tyson you think they say never meet your hairless you know so it's like I think of him as that Mike Tyson in my head we're and then when I saw him you know you had sweats on and some white New Balances and he was out of shape is fashion what's right no balance right away you like his fashions off why don't sweat Sunday afternoon leisure time like it's the middle of it was on your podcast is hilarious with your

suit right sky looked like the McGregor matching grays you know and then a whitetail dude I dive terrible fashion you can't listen you don't know you have gzo is a nice shirt your fanny pack finis packs are back in the game I brought that shit come on I want the tenders are back I want 10% of the credit you sure that gook I just post this thing on how you might have more than 10% of credit I'm done being I'm being humble you're you're the guy who I know whose rider died about fanny packs and then cro cop still fucks with it but he's out of where on how big of an impact Croatia they don't

em up and slam the shit out of them ya know he's good man nor Dean's very good I never stopped with the fanny pack no you just ride through it even ya feel like you chose fanny pack like I know man I'm always out of stock my boy wants one bad hi mate calm we're at Disneyland are we close to MMA and the Olympics yeah yeah we are yeah holy shit they're working on it yeah they're trying can you imagine that well it'd be I can't imagine it it would be amazing not would Russia just went all the belt sir well what about we had some tokens man fucking situation I mean Russia would be tough man well it really depends entirely on the drug testing they'll figure it out by me Russians when it comes you know box and combat sports Russia's really 350 years what Dagestan be considered Russia but the thing is that's what I was putting yeah I see a banner yeah but the thing is what would happen is if it did become huge in the Olympics then people would realize like you know how guys like food Mayweather and so many different professional boxers got their start as Olympic gold medalists and then went on to become these huge superstars in boxing lomachenko is another good example yeah when you have a real great amateur background people get super amped up on your GoPro Andre work yeah Anthony Joshua yeah you get super amped up about seeing those guys go pro in America it's a little different than for the reason when it comes to boxing yeah the other good we used to with Mark Breeland member of those days with Tyrell Biggs we used to love it we used to love it when a guy was a Olympic gold medal Nell Whittaker yeah you know Ray Mercer yeah a war but still you know and he look at this leg lock John Towada has a bronze medal this machine is he started sad loser like oh shit anytime you hit them double outside ah she's in MMA they're risking what such a weird position to find yourself in a forgotten ponch you in the face and again goes back to your combat jujitsu all Monta yeah it goes back to your combat jujitsu you understand what positions are like super dangerous because there's positions that guys regularly practice in jiu-jitsu that will get you fucked up if a guy can punch you in the face exactly that's what it's all about combat jujitsu such a good idea Thank You Man and so he's going well right Eddie before he does it there's the UFC being acquired by ESPN affect the fight pass and are they gonna continue with the fight pass oh hell yeah how are you sure absolutely as a matter of fact the the the president of fight pass when that deal went through emailed me personally to let me know cuz listen this is this deal has nothing to do with bypass look at this game over so body triangle deep deep deep deep hat can you hang in there for 40 seconds I don't think so son oh he's in trouble he's got a he's got a center dot and he's tapping about the tap no it's on the chin oh he's out almost broke his jaw yeah yeah yeah that's they said you're just the only problem you'd have to worry about is now that people have to subscribe to us bm+ yet the full ESPN experience now there you have to pay for that and fight paths is that real that's real so fight pass doesn't really change it on they're not getting rid of fight pass at all I think getting rid of as far as it growing could be an issue stays how does that work though they're gonna stream some fight still on fight pass know what I don't think so what do you mean my ESPN's gonna take all that content why cuz because you have right just now ESPN Plus and ESPN platform it's gonna have 30 fights than the ESPN is gonna have 12 paper use at least so you have 42 fights a year now so there's no I could run Jake or if I'm wrong there's no fight pass car I don't think I think it's just give me a database for stuff like daddy's old school fight libraries and then you know no that's all I don't think it's gonna grow I think it's gonna continue its doing and stuff like Eddie's might grow but people need a seam or ESPN Plus packaging that's a tough sell because I love it I think five pass is awesome and if you want to just go old school and watch a bunch of great old fights it's the best format on the planet Earth if you're a hardcore v you're hardcore fan but I like the fact that we would have the prelims some fights you couldn't see anywhere else but fight pass and then they would have certain fight past cards well you wouldn't how many times we watch do fight companions yeah with the entire card but now you can do it on these to look at that shit but I can do it on ESPN Plus Joe yeah could be bet could be s-pen plus is that guy for another online it's digital use p.m. plus is a digital app any what could he say miss get out of this he's got a peel that arm up his neck couple things that you got to protect your neck obviously and then he's got to get up to the leg press position where you know he could get up on like it's he's doing a leg press pushing back that'll relieve some of the pressure and then eventually get over to the side of the cinched body triangle and try to break that shit apart yeah yeah you got to break those body triangles apart move fast to prevent them from happening in the first place you got to be soon as someone takes your back first thing is don't let it get too deep and by too deep that means body triangle you know don't let that shit up we gonna say Jamie the fight pass thing is that so the ESPN deals us only it says so that be for us broadcast only and five passes still for the rest of the world yeah yeah they assured me I didn't even ask they said dude don't even trip I don't know they sent me they sent me an email saying don't worry about it we're not getting rid of EB I we love you it's it's you know don't even trip sure if that raise did and so that means in so in America it's just gonna affect fight pass in the UFC everyone else is there they're good to go well also they there's no really pay-per-views outside internationally they get it for free I can Brazil all that all the stuffs free there's no pay-per-view in Brazil right you're watching on Globo yeah they get it all free it's right there ESPN broadcast deal that includes ten full UFC cards or primary ESPN channels on primary USP ESPN channels ESPN espn2 along with the prelims for a dozen UFC pay-per-view events another twenty fight cards will stream on ESPN Plus totaling 30 full events annually between ESPN's broadcast and streaming outlets all full fight cards are expected to have twelve bouts Edition additional and shoulder UFC programs such as Dana White's contender series a new all-access series and pre and post fight shows and more are also included in the deal oh that's interesting I can attend tough is done so can has done tough is done from I understand so the Dana White's contender series was gonna kind of be the focus now would you I which I think that's good tough is a dying person man look at those dudes stay in that house for six weeks and all that crazy shit I don't like who you tone so they have so even with DC and steep Bay who are light heavyweight champion the world every chain there were those then you get the inside on those guys even those ratings suck dick it's just not going well it's twenty seven seasons d it's a tired format yeah everyone's just over and no work no stars come from anymore know what's the girl's anger series is great contenders is good John O'Malley came from you know yet Greg Hardy fighting on though you get some who's that guy that knocked out Thiago Alva's didn't he come from there as well I'm wrong about that sure the biggest one is Sean O'Malley but then you're also gonna have homeboy why am I freaking this name sorry dude the guy with the the with the arm come on Nick Nolte Newell is finally 12 fight win streak holy shit Nick no one's gonna I mean Big Chief on the condemned is he should not be on this you don't think so god no we take off for a world title against Justin gates but it's good to get him exposure we let people know how good he is I guess I've had some easier watching contender season you got some real potential talent out there I think the real thing about what's interesting about the contender series is now people you never heard of are very good I mean how many people do we know that are just guys in the gym they like dude that guy is fucking good yeah and they've never thought a break they never fought or they've had one amateur fight or something like that but you realize like when you see them roll with like really good guys like holy shit this guy is like just a hair below a world-class level there's so many guys like that force no no that's not what I'm saying I mean he has the potential to face one of those guys in the contender series see I'm I almost think it's oh it that's opposite of what they should be doing cuz if I found my young-do I'm trying to get my break in and I'm gonna contender says and he gave me Nick know who is 17 five to seventeen and one right fuck man why can't I fight a young guy and this coming from a guy who had three fights fought Roy Nelson in the finale that's true I was like you want to blow up you got it you got a fight I mean yeah that's true it's not like it's the fighting uh the UFC world champion you know you got it yep you gotta go in there and I see you're saying it should be a lower for someone yeah for someone dude I get fucking I draw Nick Newell Sean O'Malley was fighting guys with his same similar blew up just knocking dudes out now he's a stop out maybe you'll be like one or two fights and then they'll get Nick in the UFC it should be one so they're familiar with them yeah yeah but he's easing me tough man if he is so he gets into that division he tough to beat laughs it's inspiring story - I don't I would I would market the shit yeah I think they're worried that if he gets head kick which he's never been knocked out from the head kick they're worried with his arm where I can't defend it he gets brutally knocked out right how would you how can you put that guy on TV well you got to realize to think about how much your arm weighs like I mean it's not an advantage by any stretch of the imagination but the rest of him is bigger and heavier yeah like if if what is I mean how much do you think he's missing 10 pounds you think know how much how much is an average arm way Jamie that's got to be 10 pounds no 8 pounds 6 pounds dude I think mine seriously like from guys that grapple there's a guy that grabbed those without a leg and his upper body is that of like a dude that's too many classes above the guys he's fighting you know what does he say Jimmy eight pounds what the whole arm yeah that's the whole arm and average arm weighs about five percent of your body weight okay but that's the whole arm see Nick has the upper arm he had cast down to go down past the elbow he's got here yeah so so let's say his yeah and sometime think of an event no there's a rep there's a wrestler world champ night Connie's next oh shit boy Jason I've done some tough times he started off super hot and lost his last two who did he fight he stepped way lousy idea that was crazy la mice's world title contender fuckin monster all across the board yeah like okay yeah Lamas you beat shots Kelly here's minato bob says - he lost - Mowgli yeah man it's tough he got knocked out you cannot jump i Lamas and then he comes back and he lost to Mowgli what's the night this is a tough fight man army Mach 1 armor Connie might be the toughest fight at all three of those more than Ricardo he's dangerous district offices yes yeah you're right you're right but this Mach 1 armor Connie is a wild motherfucker he does a lot of crazy shit mamas just chills until top six no I'm he's just they're world-class get some I'm gonna have him on with his dad Carl Lamas I've been like leaving him alone if he thinks I forgot I haven't forgot his dad is like a Cuban exile his dad left Cuba and his dad enough Joe in there - no no his dad speaks perfect he speaks perfect English in Spanish - yeah I know Ricardo does yeah maybe so I gotta talk to him I just didn't want to fuck with him before his fight he's got a big fight made sense in Chicago yeah that is very interesting we're looking at the commercial from your chick steep a versus Daniel Cormier it's great fight whoo interesting like what's the oldest with John Jones what's going on dude I wish I knew he's doing to see what exactly suspension is but the word is he's gonna fight you know fairly soon oh really I root so hard for that dude me too man but why cuz he's a beast too bad motherfucker and I think in I think in his heart he's a very good guy today - yes I really even know that he does fucked up things and he makes mistakes but I think John in his heart is a very good guy I really do I just think he just makes poor choices and he's wild and you know and and one of the reasons what we love him is that wildness I like that he's wild yeah I don't like that he hurts people but I he's it's typically when guys act like that I usually ride him off like fuck that dude but with him I he's so talented I'd literally think he's the best of all time to grace the Octagon I want to see him back and I think comes back at heavy weight I think he beats the brakes off Brock I think he's come back fight his Brock and then he fights for the heavyweight title against the one of steepy DC ESPN you like this deal here's to our 19 weirdest dream that I was that I had shorts on with no underwear and I jerked off in my car I know I came all over myself and I couldn't figure out what to do and then I had to go and meet some friends in there and I was outside the door and so for some reason Kyle Kingsbury was in there okay let's get grilled I like the problem I'm like I'm covered with my own jizz and I don't have any underwear and I just have my shorts on like and then I woke up going what the fuck is wrong a wet dream though no really no you busted Ranaut is the weirdest dream I've never had a dream this a big ever car was it Joe I don't know we had a dream jack I bet June when I'm having sex yeah of course it is my bad like wait a min you had a dream you had sex and you actually busted on a wet dream it yeah a myth my treasure is like real I had a figure I was going to meet some people and apparently didn't have any underwear on I didn't know his shirt on and I had I was like I had to crack the door open I'm like dude I got a problem dude you gotta help me up and then I woke up going what the fuck kind of thought is that it's coming from it's rare I remember my dreams it's weird you remember you're just rich I remember mine last mine last night I was walking around I was backstage at Bellator I was gonna fight something I can't hurt and I was like I'm not doing this I ran I was like pleading to I'm not gonna do it that's a weird thing that's like one of them I got to go back to high school and graduate things those dreams Oh tears oh you can never remember your locker you're the combination for your locker how do I open this motherfucker my dream is where credit's I was too many credits shy of graduating high school they were making me go back another year you know yeah I did but you remember like when you when you were in high school there was always that one dude that somehow another fucked up and how to repeat the senior year - he's 18 everybody else is 17 this fucking dude is in high school achieve Wrangler he's a sad he's got losing the year of his little bit work out for I have this recurring nightmare that I don't think it's supposed to be a nightmare I think it's supposed to be a great dream but it always turns into a nightmare because like when I is the DJ at strip clubs I had a good time it was always fun picture and then I dream about it I dream about it and the problem is to be a strip club DJ you got to you got to know your CDs and the girls that are going up and your matching up the songs with the girls you got to be sharp as a long exactly so in my dream I think it's supposed to be a great train but I can never read the seed and the managers come at me I'm like what girls onstage and I'm like I'm going and the only CD that I remember the only one is the Crystal Method because that was my go-to CD no other CDs I'm like oh I could always pull that one out as your default yeah cuz you know you got to change the song every two minutes and 45 seconds because every song means money for the club y'all getting lap dances so if you let a song go three and a half or four nights the manager get on your ass go what the fuck it's doing a stressful it's very stressful so if there's a girl a girls bust about to go on stage and 15 seconds before she goes on stage she goes skip me I got a lap dance and we're over oh shit I got 15 seconds to find a replacement and to change the music so I got a plan yeah so in my dream I'm having a fucking nightmare I'm like I can't see the girl on stage and oh my god I may get fired I never figure in my dream ever do I realize that I make money teaching jiu-jitsu never it's always I lose my job what am I gonna do now and then I wake up between the track all right ladies and gentleman stage seven now but he never did it that way he didn't have the fake strip club all right no no no I did you have to know it was always it was always my Simpsons DJ strip club all right guys put those hands together for London no but you have to say you have to do that goofy voice to cut through otherwise people can't hear you if you just get on a mic in a strip club and you just talk like a Kelly's on table 7 it won't cut it won't cut through well not only that like it has to have some drama to it right you can't just go out here's Monica yeah she doesn't like doing this job but here you know you gotta have that cheque rat that's Lizzie she's got some unfortunate Goofy's we should find a good guy leave this made some terrible decisions check out our table that back tattoo is unfortunate but she's been in 25 foster homes just hook her up Jason

similar Diaz brothers mmm - the domestic abuse charges well very fucking that domestic abuse thing is Bomberman do we don't know the facts though do we do I want to Nix guys sent me something his friend doesn't count when you're Franco's all egos she's actually a stalker and really good he's a really good person like well well fuck you thanks I'm wrong thing yeah there's Jason Knight nasty off his back yeah great class the great part quick he's an Alan Belcher student Alan Belcher's jujitsu is pretty awesome for MMA this kid's been talking so much one-armed Americana mr. Finland Belcher vs. Rousimar Palhares we beat the show one of the greatest fights of all fucking put he had Rousimar in a twister went into it I saw him a week later and I'm so impressed by I scared him you thought he was Mike Tyson I was like bro Jesus Christ yeah what you did was insane and at the time he had more and it in a twister he had him in the truck almost finished him Russa more get saw gets out has Alan Belcher and all sorts of leglock trouble and Alan Belcher just dismantled all that shit and beat the fuck out Dean Lister and who else was it Tom to blast he brought in for that fight for a month we brought in Dean Lister and Dobby Ramos who's on the UFC like locks - so he had he had he had Dean mr. Davi Lamas on his legs for a month he said the first two weeks he tapped out probably 500 times but then he started to learn how to stop the leg locks then he went into it shit and then we made then he made a DVD called immunity how to stop lag glass Allen belt sir he's over there talking dude I'm telling you homeboys talking so much shit when they did the post laughter you know Wayne's when they always interview he was like I'm gonna beat the shit out of him he was going hard in the paint night yeah well Jason night is one of the few fighters in the UFC where they can't show his flag because this Flags got the fuckin flag on it Mississippi still has the Confederate flag in their state yeah they're proud of that shit Jamie can you get the final on that screen as well crazy that is that is crazy we satisfy the night written all over this big-ass screen right here siya boy y'all turn my mind acts all stiff what are we doing look at right there three screens in here this is like a goddamn sports bar it's like red Buffalo Wild Wings - the wings this is a very very interesting fight and this led Tommy Ricard he's been talking crazy shit huh oh dude was going so hard in the paint he goes this a long trip free to come just for one round to get knocked out she's going super hard things just trying to get him emotional is he from England yeah does he live in oh he lives in Finland where did Elise he did for a while I don't know he needs to call mr. Finland I think I think yeah nights the underdog here well I mean it kind of has to be after those two losses in a row but americani was a guy who burst on the scene a few years back and you know was really promising but we haven't people don't talk about it much they will feel like oh shit oh oh guard America this isn't what he wants you don't want to give these scrambles in this straight-up cock fight with your with night molds argh quit yes honey walk - yeah shit - please don't do that he's controlling his biceps and talking shit jump it don't do that though oh good posture yeah he did a good job at avoiding any kind of guard attacks yeah the way he did that by planting down those biceps of various myself control and then he postured up at the perfect time broke through those legs he's been doing his homework yeah and he's telling him not to like you ain't getting shit off on me let's snake tattoo hanging over his shoulders interesting it's like Mandy to the main stage yes very similar trying it emotion hurt those jabs are yeah touching him he was having a problem with that eye dude he has a lot of scar tissue on his face he look at his face like it looks like a great whites nose it's fine it's just all sort of shit all over swell that's style I mean that crazy Bulldog style doesn't really work these days man once you get to the upper echelon level it works until you you can't take a shot anymore because York City I say it's smashed in too much work so don't we get the technicians right cool man you look like just engaging exactly that's what you want to do cool yeah guys just smart he's ma Quan just keeps looking for that right hook counter and he's doing it real nice I like what he's doing I think his jab - oh they Oh guillotine oh my kind is a good wrestler - very good yes drums background oh shit okay he just keeps more of that damn shit it's comfortable in there that leg kick could hurt him you think that inside one it always hurts that thing sucks especially when you get kicked right above the knee oh it's a fucking terrible feeling it just feels like you're hoping your your ligaments stay together and they do dude how much always do it every time you get hit they like oh no shit damn wheel kicks dude how about a man and unis kicks against Raquel Pennington well Penton said that first kick shit surgery on that oh shit dude he stopped right on that knee and folded him a little bit you see that yeah he's thrown a nice variety of kicks I like yeah well he's got to do that yeah guys didn't fighting today there's a whole bunch of them that they don't throw really any kicks till they're still out there and they don't throw any pizzetta at the priests at the latter levels they try to fix it all up could you have you should make some heavy weights cuz you know what you know you know I love Damon Maya fucking more than any other fighter out there I think by now he should oh damn damn we should have stayed on top you should have stayed on top I'm here Connie still hurt he got fucked oh shit that was dude what the fuck is he doing with his lines fighting off his back he likes his recovering yeah but look he's in Mission Control here yeah this ain't bad this ain't bad at all you're gonna turn right there oh he's let just triangle his legs it's always got to do if he triangle his legs you get him in a dead orchard does he know cingulum out there oh yeah he knows it buddy what he's trying to do is clear the neck that's the main thing he's trying to do he's gonna try he's trying to invisible collar at this point or some kind of meat hook or something look at that door he'll team go for 10 seconds awesome talking shit how about he stood up search like you said this kid oh you went to the wrong corner damn it's all fucked up that was awesome everybody embrace a scene I caught him with some good shot yeah her dad Wickham on 40 seconds left it fucking go down to guard like I don't care if you liked or not it's a bad idea I'm sad I'm in a triangle man if that fight was two minutes longer he could have caught him in something it's not they were scrambling he's got 30 seconds on top of them 30 it all depends on the way only a a pulling guard it's so suicidal like people say why is it so hard for Damon Maya to pull guard he'll sit on his butt people don't want to get on top of them but he's my chief finals yes maybe I can't win any other way here we go round two and Mick Conte got fucked up in that fool again tonight dude he's still confident he's a little bit like I'll fuck an Emer Connie still make Takens big deep breaths dude he got hurt bad that one uppercut really fucked him up anyone else just rooting hard as fuck for night yeah I'm at right now I hate well smirk on him at Connie's he's a tough guy I like watching him fight but I also like a guy coming back from two two fights around did you lose three in a row it'd be tough his career be in trouble man these findings not the one I've seen how dare you dude one Fc he's putting on some good fuck control how do I get to but compared to the UFC I mean there's Bellator too he's done the problem with one Fc is just about exposure hmm they've got some great Thai fighters over there in Asia 1 FC as he is huge huge to this giant reaches like a billion households yeah bastions huge star know that Asia is owed look at this talking season Asia to now son yeah it is but one FC I'm telling you Brendan it is very big overseas I know it's big I know it's big if you're not near see it if you're not in the FC it it's a tough go man it is it's a tough go but it's not over one Fc is catching up yeah in Asia I mean they're bigger than Bellator is over there their bill doesn't really do it exactly but that's our number two right our number two in America is Bellator well Bellator is getting bigger right it's bigger I mean they're in Europe they obviously just had that card in London well what they're heavyweights tournament they're doing it they're killing it right now and then the ratings well I gotcha off a tour coming up you got Ryan Bader Mitrione well they need a heavyweight champion Michael venom page easy that they don't have a heavyweight champ you can have one now into the year yeah I think that many big guys it's Ryan Bader it could be issues right cuz he's a light heavyweight and he's the light heavyweight champ but maybe he fights better at that heavyweight that he doesn't light everywhere true she felt Davis's head kick him that was crazy Davis looks good that was nasty I'm her cool inside light talking shit now I had some common americani got that that nice jab and hook combo look at that right hand he throws looks like oh we clipped him damn he's got a good right hook Oh nice uppercut - we've mixed it up we're missing Kalin right at going God these guys are sweating why doesn't he just hit him with a right hand yeah can't you be like what is he just no challenge Oh dad keep your hands up why does he throw the front kick Oh Oh shame again OOP he's hurt get her and guilting coming hot no paddle again he can't get his oh yeah trying on the body he's doing a good job at defending you wouldn't give that first round 10:8 would you no no no maybe he knows what's the new rule the new scoring system what is it the new scoring system is when you show like a clear advantage you'd have to have someone look at it but a clear advantage is the difference between like winning and winning like clearly he clearly won that first round I would have to look at it like how they how they frame it now I think we have a real problem being imprisoned by that 10-point system the 10-point system is stupid pretty haven't there what do you think about the recently there have been a bunch of early stand-ups from the ground well Leon Roberts one with Demian Maia and Guzman was ridiculous yeah with the wizardry that was supers ridiculous and so we're not knowing what's going on not only that I mean you're dealing with a fighter that is taking a fight on last-minute notice again it's a super dominant wrestler and he essentially is in a great position and could maybe get his back and that's just biggest advantage you fucked them americana takes him down now here yeah it was another fight recently when they were on the ground the guy was like side control or the mount and the ref stood him up like that about that same Chile card there's also in the girls fight were that the female referee let them just stay on there but with no engagement and like stand them up right the officers should only be down there she does no one's interacting let's go taste it nice he's got a fucking wicked mission control he pulls to that mission flat roll very immediate right now he could hit a triangle right there meathook look at that Oh Connie ain't doing shit on the ground either he's not getting a mean he might be doing okay defensively but he's not getting shit off oh no he's threatened non-stop down there which to me should be a win for Jason nightmare Jason Knight going for a leg lock here oh you thought about it Americana outstanding he's losing and so he goes down but oh shit it's like around a piece maybe maybe the judges for sure given that americani yeah that's it's one you still took him down doctor cuz Jason Knight was doing work and threatened him the entire time on the gun get the gift of Americana he's blinded defensive that's the flaws in our judging is isn't is enjoyment it's fucking insane I feel like it should be like a hundred point system I feel like there should never be any standing up five minute round there should never be any stand-up yeah I'm with you why are you standing them up down ever ever ever five minutes by the time they get to the ground like there's not any get downs like if there's so you're pouring on the feet they're not they're not doing what you do can I just hold in position that's just the fight this is the fuck this is the chance in in four minutes to get back up to the feet when the rounds over because Brendan this is what happened if good if they stand them up because they're holding then guys why would they learn jujitsu if they get taken down if a striker gets taken up all you got to do is get good at holding and the reps gonna scan them up that's what it leads to and it fucks the sport up round three you can't have that that gives a strike or a reason to not learn jujitsu and just hold and and look look to the wrestler wrestling keep winning by just holding him that won't take that then you got a long fight off your back god you gotta learn how to fight push the sport you can't go back I'm Eric standing looking for it take two standing standing up the fight that takes everything backwards it is trying to win the fight though it's an issue man you could say the same thing about them standing that happens all the time standing no-one says shit about that we can't put them to the ground why not we do it in combat Jiu Jitsu we have get downs baby in two minutes if you guys there's no takedown two minutes we get them down legal these kidney strikes were illegal they're not illegal anymore they should do more of those when a guy is a someone's back remember how I used to do that to the stomach why don't they do that that opens up the neck people forget about it these are some serious kick to the stomach no wonder they're breathing no but he does it they never get create some space America is a strong wrestling man he's gotta hit a flying kung fu here this guy's too greasy and his guys Oh triangle for a second he's trying just trying to throw some shit up there it is so easy he's throwing some shit up Cavanaugh is in his corner there Connie's must be huh yeah 100% of Copan of course but how's your boy Dan Hardy you still talk to him Eddie you in touch with him but I haven't talked him in a while but he seems to be doing great as the commentator yeah he's doing great really good at he's he's got a book out too what does it say like half-reptile or something like that fifty percent reptile I forget what makes martial arts on conspiracy theory I think I was life it's got a gofer triangle right here part reptile that's about his life story so you have to say UFC MMA and me part reptile affiliates bad name for a book I don't know maybe he's got personalization for it now Blizzard men this is uh this is a terrible position for Jason Knight just losing yeah I mean Connie is not doing jack shit does it but this right is threatening off of his back oh there we go game yetsko at the crack head that's actually one of your crack head right there like what is our Americana gonna do here he's trying to stack them and just pressure through and just survive here look at him nice talking shit like you he's not doing anything yeah dude he's not doing shit he wasn't doin that is true Jesus Christ how dare you stand them up for action how dare you there's action on the ground well I like this ass always stunned him he stunned him all omere Connie please could take him down well he wants some points well he's getting him I mean that's that's literally all he's been able to do in his fight other than that couple of jabs landed in the first round true Richie's not beaten him stand up o lot that's a tough sell he's got to do something yeah yeah who's in this now oh dude for sure he's in this fight but it's weird he's losing a fight but what the fuck is con I'm here Connie done taking them down but that's it is that another struggle is just being on top enough when the guy on top buddy you got to take down but it's not good enough it's not it is in our sport but how much of this should be scored with Jason nine controlling off of his back and going for submissions versus americani literally here doing nothing nobody has control top control right but but also anybody's control though he's just on top he doesn't have any control yeah but drunks doing anything but holding him in the spot but Jason nice not landing he's not driving he's at least trying to be offensive off of his back Americana is literally doing nothing like all he's doing is holding on here look that's what you guys wanted but that's a shot there he lands a shot that's good for him that's good for him but Jason Knight is being way more active Amir Khan he's throwing a few shots they asked yeah now he passed yeah no I I'm with you man but there was a score the way they scored look out look out for Jason Knights neck I mean Connie has this fight easily oh we could have a 10-4 your Chokey what is that fucking that step over oh shit oh he heard him he heard him I'm here car never legal knee though I think perfect I think the knee was to the body wasn't it was it there it is oh no I'm here Connie definitely win this fight I don't think so any baby what's that what's that technique goddammit I can't you're you got one arm under the the the arm one arm over the top and you step over with the legs you know that move for approval top ten finger choke I forgot the prove it well isn't a ten finger choke the one when it's in the chest you got them in the chest and you have that the head planted we were jokes it Peruvian necktie wood for a reason with Upton ten for you well Tony de Souza is the reason why everybody calls it the Peruvian necktie because you had a pad yeah and there's a Peruvian darts as well too and oh there they get he was out look at that mm he knocked him down twice yep twice a 10-8 round that could be a draw it could be a draw is this guy from the UK no Phil oh he's not from the UK so maybe with Kavanagh now I bet Jason I'd loses the fight decision it could be could be interesting yeah what do you think they're probably going to give it to Murakami this is no I'm here Connie yeah I probably gave it down yeah you gotta take downs you know he didn't do anything on top but those take downs count yeah yeah interesting now is that the co-main do you remember that's right do you remember that guy that was I think the first guillotine master in MMA was that little pequeno guy do you remember him used to fight and shoot a little Brazilian guy his name was Antonio Nogueira [Music] he guillotine so many motherfuckers I think he was a an Android Panna darris guy from Nova yu-yan remember him he was a guy that if you shot in on him he was gonna guillotine you and he had his own special ten finger guillotine he called I don't know exactly how he did it you know everyone's got like their own little modifications for guillotines because you really can't see the grip when you get a guillotine the grip is actually hidden you really don't you it's hard to tell what kind of guillotine you're putting in right even with the high elbow guillotines of our cellar that's Marcelo teen it's hard to tell if you're holding it like this or like this because the grip is hidden yeah secret guillotines and the way that pequeno Nogueira did it man I still don't I still I don't remember it's a weird little secret grip did you ever get into the pretzel grip did you were you big on that that weird grip where the palm of the bottom hand is facing outward and the palm of the the top and it's facing towards you that's a great that's a great grip if you get your hands together and that's a great grip but the reason why Marcelo instead of going here he goes here that's the difference yes is when you go here you need your palms to meet so if there's a guy here and I'm trying to guillotine him the first thing he's gonna do is bring up his hands like this right he's gonna defend a guillotine like this so his first move is going to be to come between your hands right so if you could beat his hand then you're good and this is amazing but if you don't beat his head beat his hand then the guillotine is lost but if he comes up and and and blocks it like this and I come around the back of my hand he's still fucked so it's a false sense of security split-decision americani interesting interesting yeah does that make sense on the grip yes it does also - like the seams like with a rear-naked it's like if you can keep that hand flat it's easier to slide it up in there then if you got it like this where it's harder to get it underneath the chin I'm not too sure about that I'm with the guillotine it's just a lot of people do it with the pretzel grip yeah but you got to get your with the monster marcelo garcia variation it doesn't matter that your hands are gonna come up they think they're safe but we're going behind our own hand so that's what that's when marcelo was fucking people up with that on the daily no one black belt no what the fuck is going on I'm defending the guillotine and I'm still tapping right it was the crip what wouldn't they give it what decision i'm murakami yeah that's tough for ya what are you gonna do C cup Swanson does that we said that's not a good move for him Cup Swanson's on another what's he calling out I don't know thank you that one I'll say it's up to the Jimmy Manawa I never see crazy guys like this what's the next fight he's talking about an old story what do you mean man yeah what did the rest of the crowd turn the bar that was amazing Arnold Alan bersin mads Bernal and show up the card pull up the card yeah he's probably delirious from that uppercut al Jemaine he's trying to get five done the crews he's a bad motherfucker out Jermaine I like how he bounced back from that model in Mariah's fight to hell he bounced back you my love my rights where's Jimmy Rivera coming up I think that's next week that's a motherfucking fight yeah it is next week right is that next week think so dude we need a white knight fight companion for that motherfucker what day is that Jimmie Rivera is a motherfucker it's a beast what day is that is that Saturday June 1st Friday night June 1st I'm in town you in town I'm in town that's too weird son Buzzard I mean

fire I'm tired I just put Jesus Christ Joseph still fucking around to like still like try new shit on stage he was telling me that this Netflix some of the references he has they're like you can't say this you need change to this so he's saying he's messing with that like how to hit the joke still using that context what references are the UH I don't give aways okay yeah Eddie you round next Friday the first June first let's do a next Friday night so next Friday I'm in San Francisco would sound Tripoli you should cancel it what's happen so I compare your looking Friday Jimmie Rivera versus Marlon mirai's son that's gonna be a good time that is a good fight Jake Ellenberger Ben Saunders yeah couple the old - I mean if I didn't have that spot in San Francisco I'd be cornering done enough like I see yeah no not like a real comedian real comedians go out all the time I I'm like I'm like below an open mic er you know what I mean are you enjoying it I love it I love it the show we did Friday night in the Bella room that was the most fun I've ever had man that was so much fun is it all just conspiracies theory stand up because I know you guys are calling a tinfoil hat conspiracy night is that just because the podcast name it's it's um it's more designed to it's not a you know there's a lot of conspiracy theory comedy in there but you know you know it's not like a hundred percent you know right but you guys you fit you take fan questions - right so you can go hard in the paint yeah at the end we do a question and answer type but like a mini podcast thing yeah it's fun Friday night at the belly room was so much fun man it was it's such an amazing but that's the truth serum room is if your jokes are like fat if they have too much extra words in them if they're too fake they come off corny that bedroom just highlight you feel it yeah I've always liked to run my material in that room before I do anything bitch so he did his short ever been in that room in a nice house the one not to make the big room they didn't the small it's almost like the belly room that's where he did it yeah that rooms amazing yeah times a Joey - that's a great that's a great room the joke when I opened for Joey I love it because it's probably 90% Latin and I love telling Mexican jokes I've got so many Mexican stories it's just all fun there's no conspiracy theories going on and with those crowds crowds like 90% Latin really last night was it no it seemed like it was one it's interesting like in Ontario Ontario that Latin was a great raw material levity yeah I did Chrysler's podcast last week and he said that that because of you you you he said that he was telling you that Russian mafia story and then you said you should do it on stage and then he did it and he and it blew up Russian mob story and then I remembered I go you know what Joe told me to do that bleeding asshole story Vince - my problem with blood coming out of my ass so I told them what how I just dude you got to do that on stage I'm like no way at the first my first reaction was like fuck no I'm not gonna talk about that on stage but I did it Friday and it went over well it's a funny story man when you told that I was a howl and laughing it's funny I like you say that like I should do that bleeding asshole story people who are listening what the fuck is wrong with these guys just a matter of like how you telling me the story and when you were telling this story I was cracking up I mean I am NOT a comedy snob by any stretch of the imagination I like comedy I like things that are funny and if it happens to be funny for X Y or z reason I don't care I just want I like to laugh I like funny shit I just I don't believe that like like there's there's certain subjects that should be off-limits it's just a matter of how you approach the subject if it's a part of life the problem is a lot of subjects are tainted because a lot of people do bad comedy that's like cheap and easy and they did they they like they use those subjects instead of because the subjects are interesting and they they have like a real valid point they use those subjects because they know it's gonna get a cheap laugh there's no original thought with a fart joke or a cheap you know whatever kind of joke there's there's a bunch of cheap jokes but then there's like a real-life situation we you have to shit your pants like Claire Ari Shaffir had a fucking hilarious joke about there was a bridge across in Sydney this is crazy bridge it's like two miles long or something you walk across it and he was halfway across the bridge and he had his back and he told the story and he had an agent at the time I told him that's a shit joke you gotta stop doing that joke and Arie looked at him he goes yeah we're not gonna work together anymore he just got rid of him rid of his agents like the fuck out of here cuz I told me about it I go what I go that guy told you to stop doing that bit because it was a real story I was with him we were together in Sydney so it makes it funnier but it was a real story where he had a shit his pants and he was some violence in itself and it was killing killing and his stupid-ass agent was like you know that is that's a shit joke shouldn't do a shit joke because he doesn't get it cuz he hears when people are talking about just like I would she's an Asian on a Chandra Tunisian I know agent it's early why would he didn't but when look here's there's two stages of your career right there's a stage where other people trying to tell you what to do they're like what you need to do is wear a tie what you need to do is change your act we need to go clean yeah I went through all that shit too and then there's a stage where they just leave you the fuck alone ari is now in that levy the fucking successful because he's successful success we can say what you wanted but a few years back he was in that you might make it you might fall apart stage in an agent's eyes like agents look at you and they go man I don't know Eddie you might be able to make it but you're gonna have to change some things you change the way you dress change your hair drop the meeting asshole sorry bleeding asshole thing is alienating fans you know and they get it in their head that they know how to fix your act they're almost always wrong they're almost always wrong are you Solaris yeah we have the same agent he doesn't tell it either one of us shit ari doesn't give a fuck now ari is like this my theory available he's got a flip phone but he's my favorite example of a dude who got money got some fame and some wealth and got some success and just said fuck you I'm doing whatever I want yeah Bert was saying like touring wise he was taking some time off he's going somewhere now doesn't want TOI he's like he's needs a certain minimum and that's all he cares about he hits that he's out he made his monthly nut or his year than not he said in the first couple weeks of the year yeah they just did a bunch of theatres and some some good break I sure know Ari all right shit and he just hurts a beast whore he's got a fucking low overhead man he doesn't have a car he lives cheap I mean he's just he keeps that way it's still in New York yep ya know he's hilarious he doesn't give a fuck man I mean and he loves travelling he loves traveling he's material from it right well it's not just that man he just really enjoys going to different cultures and be I mean he wants a fucking Asia dude like Asia Asia stole shit-stained and places were like 18 year old backpackers go I mean that's a jobs like your felt that you're in danger it's not not ever I'm like what I'm too scared to do that I don't want to do that well I don't think it's dangerous I mean I think it's rarely dangerous but I think any kind of travel you mean I'm talking about traveling to a bar in you know Canoga Park could be dangerous you know you hear about it in the story Brendan Schaub Joe Rogan go to a bar in Canoga Joe gets stabbed by some crazy person oh don't go to Canoga Park that's not what it is it's just like life is occasionally danger yeah you know I don't think those hostels are most of those hostels are just college kids that are just travelling abroad and looking to see the world I've always been scared of houses my brother stayed when you're up today woke up someone's sucking on these totes that's scary so you did well what I was scared of it because of those horror movies the hostel the hospital are fucking terrifying part two is even worse turista dude hostel is so boy hostel is brutal man dude how easy is it to lure you know those 18 year old backpackers that are gone across Europe so easy oh dude all you got to do is get hot chicks point out the dudes a hot chicks or drag them into some shit awesome put some drugs in the drinks and Bullock and to fit year-olds at a 35 year old a hot chick that's how they got them in your hostel they said they'd just send chicks after them yeah that's the easy chicks work every to fall right the fall right India man chicks with drugs you know drink and it's over but I think for a lot of those people that travel like that and live like that it's gotta be very hard to settle down once you get used to just travel is doing drugs and partying places and I feel like that movie doesn't end well for those people there's no like real stability oh that means a lot I mean everyone has their own movie player' I know no it definitely doesn't end well I mean maybe start a pottery business or some shit [Applause] [Laughter] what is this one this is the movie that Eli Roth made he also made hostel it's called green inferno I did see this with a teacher they get eaten by cannibals yeah I like to Brazil or somewhere some Brazil's like some remote location like in the jungle I was actually a little disappointing this the trailer I was like oh shit picture the head in the upper left-hand corner there's some crazy shit that happens in the movie dude send me that send me that a text message man don't you think like Brazil like a we tourism is down eight thousand percent because of these fucking movies but you know what still maybe Brazil's like you slow the fuck now with these goddamn movies but they do have the biggest rainforest in the world yeah they do I couldn't breathe I said I was a text Tim can I say I can't believe when we start about all those Nazis dude what the fuck is that they flew from Germany to fucking Argentina that's a true story - I'd excellent do I wanna do this are there you did the greatest promo ever for your discovery and History Channel show yes I really was I love Tim but I don't watch that much TV with that with that stuff dude he was talking to hand those Germans that live in Argentina how many cities how many villages I don't know about hundreds of thousands hundreds out and you go to the village this is and it's all German the architecture we go into the house it's all some images of it Jam they don't speak out this fucking lick of spam they Louie wear lederhosen the drinking giant Stein's and they're so proud of their now you know what history yeah that's what's creepy do you know what stopped out he goes do you know I built that land Jews fucking the their cavity fillings their wedding rings that's what they're so would you do old I got so upset man no he's talking about how that how they would torture kids I'd tutor I stopped listening at that yes I'm out well he was talking about how Mengele and a lot of the SS soldiers went to Argentina and continued a lot of their torture experiments and that they had met some of the people that had been tortured by these SS guys horrific why they break their bones bring her some back to health set him on fire just the worst shit you can I mean just to see like what they could do I went to Argentina like like 10 years ago and I swear I swear to God I've never been to a country with so many beautiful women it was unbelievable say no and there it's like there's you see like ten at a time thirteen year they're like everywhere and you would think you would think it would be easy to pick them up but it's super hard because they have no faith in men because the men they're like prostitution is illegal yeah they know that there's no reason for a guy to get committed so they don't trust guys so they're like just that was my experience they just like hang out they hang out with each other and they just they travel in packs everywhere it's incredible what's a very touchy gun I'd love to go to Argentina yeah you watch this it's it's crazy man and Tim said you'd go there and you know they're like so so proud of their Nazi grandfather and stuff like that and Tim's like what da fuck man it's crazy crazy no no no not a lick of Spanish anywhere and Hitler maybe you know yeah that's a Joe asked him he goes if you had to decide right now did Hitler dine that bill in like history tells you and this is Tim Kennedy he's never total line in Sly feels nope history's wrong on this one dang it he'd be so happy about what that history's wrong history is often wrong that's what I'm saying his dream Kennedy approves it it's fuckin we go in sisli suitcase never told light his life are you sure though dude Tim Kennedy's is I mean he's his American Pie as it gets yeah I love that guy man I cried cuz that bet he's gonna die one time I love him yeah he doesn't he have a crazy show that he where he tries to kill himself they try to kill him what's the name of that show what's it calls like some show where someone almost died it was an apple and it jumps out of a plane yes yes oh you bullfighting hard to kill hard to kill Tim Kennedy and that's what Steven Seagal movie isn't it yeah it is terrible movie all those the fan as a kid but yeah and then he also has hunting Hitler on History Channel damn he's a beast man and then he's still serve been doing like secret missions and killing people on the side his side chicks killin Isis that's what he does what he's still active Special Forces going on projects and shit killing people / oh yeah hell yeah damn dudes another level can't wait for this main of that man is that hearts kind of bullshit man God dog magnified snacks well thanks for that so how stand up gun it's good man grinding it every week yeah six watts last week at four this week and that flex approach you for a special nope not yet not yet man little ways to go and you've been doing comedy now for a year two years two years two years it's been two years shit two years really having to live firing the kids for over three years that's where it started yeah yeah damn for some reason I thought you were doing stand-up for a year well my first spot was at the Comedy Store haven't written my phone I have to look comedy chaos tonight knows as a they gave me a spot in the belly room you you may be the fastest-rising comedian of all time right like who's with zero stand-up experience and then all of a sudden you do stand-up and now you're fucking playing all over the world making loot right it's good you're getting paid right yeah this is good that's incredible I've never fast full-time you could be dressed you have to generally you grind for about ten years until you pop yeah if you do it all yeah you know so but but I think you can do like the Charlie Sheen route where if you have some sort of falling you do shows and people like this sucks and I'll come back I think the sign of it is you can come back to if you sell tickets of places you've been before you know I'm saying it's yeah so it's not so they know it's not a gimmick that's the big thing yeah the job do it's incredible man I think either way it's incredible congratulations I saw the fuck did I didn't I you know I was uh hanging out with Joe in the comedy scene for many many years I seen comedians just eat shit you know can we crash yeah come and go never make it this same guys from 15 years ago still trying to make it's a matter what you're doing is incredible man they'd say it's unheard of thanks man see I was telling me you're killing it the other night I had a good set Friday night so yeah it came together you know it was the first it was the first set I did not stoned that's good so I decided you know what unless you're really good at something you shouldn't be smoking weed and doing it you know what I mean and until you're super confident and you got your shit down don't smoke weed you know what I mean so I decided to try it out like not smoke weed and go on state and see what happens and really good it went it wasn't better than I was probably my best set so then you guys are at Cobbs on Friday Friday at Cobbs yep never never been there bunch with Joe love conquers a day the best you've been there a couple times twice now headline yeah Wow twice down then I'll be back you sell it out yeah holy shit that's 400 seats god damn dude holy shit then we do a Saturday we do Sacramento or the punchline so that's a smaller that's like yeah 115 or something like that but yeah San Fran - until I get my shit together you know I'm gonna go on stage clear-eyed but that's the smartest route man yeah and then later once I once I feel super confident in my material and my problem is I have way too much material and it's just scattered everywhere all these ideas every day I have new ideas but they need to be organized more and fleshed out and that's what I did for this show - I decided you know what there's just so much it's overwhelming I just took three pieces below Michael I'm just gonna stick to the and I've served great at helping with that - at first I was writing everything out and then I then Joey told me he goes dude you're you're at your best when you don't write it out and you just go off the cuff so Joey told me just have ideas but don't write anything out and just go out there and try and not and I did that and and I think that's for me that you know Friday I just had powerpoints and a couple lines I go okay this line is kind of funny and that line is kind of funny and then I just went off and just kind of just went for it it wasn't that great sam says I just doing the ice house last night was Sam said it went good you guys write your material out yes material well you know what cuz hanging out with you for fucking 20 years in the comedy clubs you always stress you gotta write shit out you gotta write you tell every coming you're right show so that's what I was doing I was writing everything out and Joey told me goes right now maybe you shouldn't write shit out just go out there and just free ball just have some ideas and I said are you sure and he said yeah so I did a couple spots with him at the Ontario improv and those are those are two of the best shows I've done with Joey so I decided to do that just happens set of write everything out maybe write out the funny you know what I mean but just kind of go out there and there's rebounding the same set over doing new sets that every sets mixed up different so you have to carve out the bullet points or like what's like say if you had a bid on building a table whatever like it's the bullet points the funny parts you have memorized yeah the line like memorize the fun and then the way you set it up you're gonna have to kind of I kind of just go for natural exactly because if you start memorizing shit it takes away from the spontaneity yeah it just doesn't it's not funny yeah this one even though you have a structure you can play with the one thing the one thing that I've learned from me anyways like I watched I still watched Chappelle over and over just like you know it for me like the latest Chappelle when he tells a story and he's telling you like a ten minute story of how shit went down to me that's the funniest shit an actual real event like the Mafia story the Russian mafia story with Bert Kreischer it's an actual story then you see how real it is when he's describing it instead of trying to make up a joke and trying to find funny stick to funny stories and then that'll and then from there you could kind of you don't know you know Joe shooting mono Monday night in Vegas yeah and the shooting six of them not six of so there's six comics 30-minute specials right but big J occasions in that who's he is yeah Christina P Tom Sierra's wife's is in that that she's doing that because she just did know she I wonder why she blowing the fuck up I know but why not just save it to an hour trying to extra blow trial of forget that extra blow up yeah but with Joey yeah Joey's yeah and then they shoot to 30 minutes for me shoots on Monday night mmm Vegas some room in Vegas but when you do those 30 minutes because I you know I'm used to dealing with you I'm like oh and you like i'ma shoot it here this is what's happening and there's you know you have saying marketing with that it's different now yeah shooting here someone's gonna be this is where yeah time yeah different animal yeah it's a different animal for sure residence Brendan's selling out cops in San Francisco by himself holy shit you know that's fuckin huge man so that consumer in Boston the what the Wilbur theater in house and it's 1,100 something's holy shit god damn I told me he's probably one of the fastest-rising comics coming from never doing stand-up I mean who else is there really ever ever right no ever stand up to sellout theaters in two years did you know this crazy I mean it's animal doing like fuckin an hour and killing like you you put in the work dude that's what I would I tell other young comics I say pay attention to him because this is what happens when a person takes pro-athlete type of discipline and it applies it to stand that that discipline is everything that work ethic and discipline that's everything man it changes the whole game cuz a lot of comics are funny but they're fucking lazy they're fucking lazy and they don't think that's why I like you you're dealing with guys who do the same material year after year after year and they never do specials there's a bunch of those guys that are really talented guys they just never they never bother to record anything because they don't want to have to write they don't have to rewrite it doesn't make sense to me like it we talk about work ethic and stuff like that I see these other comedians who maybe aren't doing it but don't you see the guys like Rogan and burned Aaliyah like you want to be on there you want to do what they do right this always got a guillotine that's over it's the same with fighting to us like you look at GSP it's like he's doing this and this don't you want to be like yeah should probably follow that plan but people complain but here's the thing you get scared and then you finally get some tools right like say if you have an act like you put together an act and you're like before we ready to film a special the idea is that your act it's killing right so if your act is killing you've got it molded and hone you don't want to let that go I gotta let it go I can't decide oh I gotta kick it aside but if you don't do that you don't keep getting better but here's the thing one thing that I've learned even though there's a lot of fear and letting go that old material you always write new better material because you're a better comedian now you understand comedy better more experienced yes you're just gonna do better like yeah for me like letting go that like Bruce Jenner bit because of the special yeah I couldn't do that if my life depended on it right now how it works I don't know the beats and I wouldn't do it right but when you get to a point when you get a bit so tight and so finely tuned that's when you got to let it go and then you move on to the next one and I've got some shit now that that's killing harder than that bit did but when I first started doing you know a year ago year plus ago when I first released that Netflix special and then I went right in to write new material and doing new materials on shaky legs man and a lot of people don't like that shaky legs feeling you get real scared but you gotta go through that you got to go through that and you that's what makes you grow and and continue to get better but you know one of the things that helps me a lot that Jeremiah Watkins show that stand-up spot dude that is a fucking farm for material so much fun because people yell like someone look at you and go of hurricanes and you're like then hurricanes and then you start talking chin every now she will say something it is in the crowd the crowd knows like yeah you know you just riff and they're not like you know you know you're not shooting special so everyone's pretty loosey goosey and those you know like strippers I'm at about them you know yeah it's amazing dude it's an amazing resource to have those shows where someone just yell he used to call it thunderpussy they used to do it in the the ice house the Thunder pussies a great name for it so it just so sit up on the spot but uh yeah I've been doing that show for years that's helped me a lot and I told Jeremiah you're telling me I'll get bits from it and it's the same thing with fighting like if you're in training you know how this is wealth you guys know this there's one guy who's fucking he's really good and you know maybe tapped out last time you kind of you don't mean to avoid him cuz it's gonna be the toughest round like over here that's I was with Jeremiah and stamp on the spot I was like I know my stuff I write all my stuff I know what I want to do here and I can't phone that but on the spot I don't know man yeah dancing on him you text me this week I'm like yeah for sure then the next day I'm like dude I'm swamp them and then I told my hey next let me ask you do it know I'm lying to you I need to do this cuz I'm scared of it what's the show called stand up on a spot Jeremiah Watkins Bell you know I think there's a show tonight every Tuesday night yeah Tuesday night stand up on the spot yeah no not every Tuesday night no I want to find a yeah I'm saying I think is this Tuesday but it couldn't I'll try that it might am I going crazy I thought he said it because I was trying to do three spots at night and I go hey you have Sarris Pontius no telling what laughs right the economy storms trying you another spot I don't think it's until June honestly I think he just did it and I was out of town no I was on his last one when was that how long ago two weeks ago yeah so the next one would be like two weeks all right that sounds like fun oh it's the picture off June 12th there you go Tuesday June 12 and yeah I fucking love it man it's it's really fun and it's always packed - yeah it's packed and again the crowd knows what's going on you did that for a while after your shows you would do that question and answer and there was nothing there was nothing anybody could have yelled out that you couldn't tie into some past bit you know what I mean you had there wasn't anything yeah it's better though stand up on the spot thing is better because it's not that it's not past bits it's all just can't do material you can't no they they tell you no no material it's got a ball Janet yeah some people have done it and done their act - and Pete the crowd gets mad they know they can they know what's up cuz you know it's not you tell what's off the table yeah yeah yeah yeah do you remember we did thank you at Wilbert so I did my showing them William boss it was late and you know the dudes were drunk when I kept flight hoechlin Joe Joe's fucking went nuclear on the guy was like stupidly isn't how my fake questions go if I could get a scar fire well that's it for big questions where to go fuckface well he was just just trying so hard to get attention so I've witnessed many many people getting torched by Joey once it's it's awesome to me the Dawson it's awesome watching Joker's Joe he doesn't want to release until the guy it's clear 100% he deserves it so a guy will yell and it's like calm down everything's like and like inside I keep going so I could just know I just want to feel guilty so when Joe decides to go off it's over son there's no way I deal with the mic forget it Joe without a mic you're still fucked dude that's like I know she cooked I saw Dane Cook go hard on these two girls in the front row when it comes to last Tuesday night oh my god they went quit talking he's like honey you shining you through a story and he's a longer story you could tell he's doing new material and striking it through it they can't interrupt he's like we can go in on you if you want see another thing and she's goes another thing is you want to do this and then just fucking cute I mean it was just brood old man it makes a show though does he did about 20 minutes of it it's a lot of fucking heckling in at the Comedy Store lately not that people want to become a part of the show that's a terrible idea there should be a warning warning there's two girls in the front row the other night just drunk and sloppy and talking really loud where you you know like you're on stage and you hear them you try to ignore them but then you see the rest of the crowd going like this that's when you have to acknowledge it you have to see people turning towards them you're like all right I got a play cop here most of the time the stores on top of that big time which is a new thing in the early days yeah the way I got good at heckling that heckler is one of the big ways there was no crowd control at the store I mean zero Mad Max because in the old days when I used to go there the fucking comedians were all doormen and and security everything was all comedians it's not anymore now they have like legit security like big guys that take care of everything people have ear pieces on there in control for everything when the store picked up the business like about three years ago when it really took off three four years ago that's when they go okay look this place is sold out every fucking night and then a guy got murdered there there was a murder on the front latch yeah guy got shot to death on the front porch yeah it was some gang-related type thing okay some guy did something to somebody and apparently the dude who got killed he had some really dark shit on his facebook too like pictures of people tied up and shit and they murdered him they shot him right in the front porch and from then on they put like a super intense security system there and cameras everywhere hired real security everywhere and ramped up the place stop letting people walk into the parking lot that was a big one too because people just stroll in the park and these drunks people would be backing up their cars that people would be getting hit by people's cars and shit show what do you shit what do you think is gonna happen to the Comedy Store now that Mitzi's passed away if you think the business is better than ever the thing about it is it's sold out every night and it's making a lot of money like if you go to the Comedy Store on a Tuesday night you're gonna have a sold-out main room 400 people sold out oh are 170 people sold out belly room 80 people I mean that is big money but every night to two shows a night off that's a to two main room shows every night or both sold out now thousands and thousands of people funneling into that place as far as like from the beginning of the show's that started eight o'clock till two o'clock in the morning people are buying drinks is it a night money is it enough money to keep it running yes it's very it's making more money now than in the history of the club never made more money ever damn so it's a viable it means crazy it's all within the last three and a half years three half since you've been back yeah at all just have this podcast blew it up yep single-handedly you come and part of it and they don't deny it I talked to management there they don't deny it I asked like what you know what do you what he thinks the cause of this boom he said Joe rogue and now say Joe rogue huge part of it and they all the comics coming through it's the Golden Age of comedy yeah it's also the talent there there's so much talent there I'm it's crazy how good those shows are I mean you look at the lineup sometime you're like what fuck dude I ran over cuz Patton Oswalt's doing stand-up again I've ran over to see him cuz he's there for the whole week and usually the New York Comic you're just up at the o.r went if we can Tom pounds obviously in New York Comic what do mean yeah I nobody was in New York for a while when he was doing starting to stand up I only saw him post him out in New York house it can't wait for him to come back when he started doing it again again yeah I saw him do spots in New York galore interesting yeah and I saw him back here he's a good guy man you know what Tom papa patton oswalt then Brogan then D'Elia I mean nuts top four top five guys at the Comedy Store right now there are regulars with Joey for sure birds there all the time daliyah's there all the time Theo von is a motherfucking monster he's there all the time who else who else would you go with Hinchcliffe has been Tino's a month's Santino's our monster as a monster Christina's a monster or crashing her Christ sure god man there's so many there's so many yeah there's so Tom pop out there's so many Neal Brennan it's a fucking it's a crazy place right now it's crazy insane Bobbili mean it's just kill her after kill her I mean I was walking by the messenger Whitney Cummings walking by the idea or the other night and it was just roars coming out of there and I was like this place is nuts and then you go down the hallway and there's roars coming out of the main room you Grey's right that's crazy the greatest time ever for standup greatest time ever you go in there you just feel that man in the walls I don't know what and then you go over to the Laugh Factory and it's like an antique shop that's what Theo Vaughn says when you feel cities do it's like in an antique shop I went oh my god you can't say that yeah you can started filming people everybody was like what they start filming people just put it up on YouTube they say they're not doing it anymore but everybody just lost all faith in that place they're like yo fine I still do spots gonna do spots where I can but yeah they're not releasing my shit the fact that they would do that it's like you guys are good man and then offering people half of the revenue for you to yeah I just put on myself just what what age are you living in yeah and then when confronted they're like well Tiffany how does she's making so much money now and it's all because of that oh yeah that's delusional just I don't know what he did the guy who owns it I don't know why he did like letting those kids do that and put those things up but people that had no idea about the stand-up comedy business that item basically interns just filming people sets and putting all their material online but the way it works is you know the clothes committee self Joe or whoever sent Santana goes hey they're film and don't do it there anymore I said I mean you just don't go there I mean you you'll have three sold-out shows not even a half a mile away at the Comedy Store and then these they're cancelling show different name because there's no one that differently but then the improv the Improv still doing the Improv is doing better yeah yeah and you know what the Improv moved that stupid fucking piano off the stage out of time they put a platform on the side and push the pan over to the side the piano would fuck up the whole show leave her anybody that was on the right side of the stage they can't see and cannot see the comet in ice house still bumping right bumpin yeah especially when good comics are there you know it's with the Ice House it's all about they have to have good people to get out to Pasadena because the Ice House they've had sketchy lineups in the past like you know they'll have Joey and Brenda they'll have like real shows that are really funny but they'll also have like some bullshit and they had for years they had some bullshit which kills your because you get if you get known as that where it's like the gimmicky bullshit guys people aren't gonna fry day night let's just go see who's playing at the ice house yeah like I'll fuck that man yeah people will go down there and they'll expect to see like a Joey Diaz show and then some wack-ass fucking road guy who does mug cruise ships but if they did more for the people that live in that area like I mean isn't it like a local kind of thing yeah but it's still if it's a bad show it's a bad show they don't want to come back yes if it's a good show like they know when I do I do those Wednesday nights once a month there and they know if you go down there I'm gonna have killers on that show you decide who goes on yeah it's all my show it's your show yeah Wednesday nights I do one Thursday night at the Comedy Store every month and I do one Wednesday night at the is it called Joe and Friends yeah Joe friends and the next one at the Comedy Store is June 21st June 21st yeah just in the green room with like last time it was Tony Pheo you meet just hanging out back yeah I think the best time I could run out to 2:00 in the morning Aries laughs it's the best man yeah yes very laughs so hard all you guys well it's just it's hard it's hard to find groups of people that are just savages just loose and fun and ridiculous and then there this is the world they live in they live in this comedy world so they travel around a lot fucking around a good time talk to shit and one person to say something that it's just like yeah fucking on so that's fun man fun times everyone's baked it's just fun oh it's just like high school with your good friends yeah like you know when you walk into like first period and all your boys like went at the front that's what it feels like what a lot of ways right because one of the things that happens as you get older is you lose all the fun because you have you have responsibilities you have a job you hate and you get up in the morning and you're always tired this is the the world that most people live in when you could find a place where it's all basically people that avoided that rat race and figured out some sneaky way through the system yeah and that sneaky way is talking shit ya know soundcheck needed you know you get on stage and it's a you know especially when high level comedians go up like yourself like you're gonna get an hour of just laughs just over and over again it's way better than a funny movie yeah but if you're a new comic you didn't I'm getting education to get around with those people I can go listen to teal Vaughn talk about something I mean Joe talk business not go watch Patton Oswalt do his set and then I'll watch Joey Diaz and then bill burr is coming in and for me as long as I do comedy I still love it I still watching it I still have watching it someone's killing I still love it you know I love it it's the it's just it's a great form of entertainment and I think it's necessary to because people get so serious about certain subjects if someone could just come along and mock it and laugh at it so hard and then you realize like oh is fucking ridiculous this is ridiculous yeah Italy V eights what was fascinating to me the other night with Tom papa Oswald and Tony Hinchcliffe they all had the same premises on their joke but everything was the each opinion was so different I was laughing so hard man but you just see how everyone's different but it's a popular subject so like Trump no sexual assault it was so funny man I like Joey's that I don't want to give away he's got a great back bit on that Neil Magny is tough to take down though very tough very wiry long and who's this gentleman he's fighting James James white do you know anything about Craig white white Greg white it's supposed to be drawn a blank what's homeboys gonna get or Nelson yes grace what happened at Gunnar you got injured I'm not sure but though it's gonna be a hell of a fight yo Matt team that neat Neil's beat some tough guys speed Elvin Kelvin Gastelum yeah Kelvin Aggies almost making Johnny Hendrix you beat Hector Lombard later Hector Lombard Kelvin Gastelum Johnny Hendrix and Johnny Hendrick but then every fire now went air when it refights a Jitsu guy screwed it's his Achilles heel because they've taken down murk among his jiu-jitsu is not that good his defense is just you know but when I say it says the kids he'll the only love the very tip of the spear black belts fuck them up that's why I was so impressed with dos Anjos dos Anjos smashed Neil he leg kicked him dragged him to the ground and choked the fuck out of brick Demian Maia did that that other homeboy got in the inverted triangle the bald guy forget his name who's ridiculous at jujitsu Brazilian bald guy Brazilian all Brazilian Thiago Alves no no no there's Jim Rice really good good and then Demian Maia was like you do what he's got he triangled someone from the Mount what years ago and I'll never forget II forgot his name because of that he's a beast man he set it up beautiful he's got a crazy tricep - he's like missing a tricep like you look at one of his arms because tricep was non-existent he must have broke off and slid up or yeah I must have tore anything up yeah fruit roll-up yeah he never got it fixed cuz he's got a bicep but then there's nothing behind it it's very weird looking a house what's he doing is he still fighting just got Kayode by somebody somebody good pull-up serger morai hmm yeah he was the first guy to tap Krone as a black belt it was like look at that Magne in the mount Magna in the mount yeah see house left by tricep is oh yeah I'm missing it's even weirder when you see it like hanging low pretty weird there pull up his his record look at this shit doesn't a clean the mouth is going for an arm around there immediately oh he's gonna stand up let me see no no no yeah just go go to his record though yeah it's right here where is it scroll down no no fights Tim means bustamante Odom oh yeah yo zeus mines only KO really yeah yeah there's a lot of decisions man hmm super disappointed and that stand-up Matt Serra was going off about his memory about us the referee standing them or separating them when Danny and Maya had his back I was ridiculous it was really yeah okay who was the ref I once it was Leon Roberts wasn't it yeah I think so yeah it was a terrible decision yeah they're getting too crazy with the stand-ups that was way too crazy or did they need they need to relax well especially in that situation you got a guy who's a strangulation expert that finally gets to clinch on a world class Resler swishing this early in the first round early in the first round got a real good position in them and you also have to think Maya took this fight with zero great camp oh shit Neil Neil Magny yo Neil Neil Neil whooping his s he's hurt come on he need him right in the face yeah it was legal yeah for sure legal oh oh he's out oh he's out that's it Neil Neil mattress round baby yeah when Hill Magni Neil Magny stop it motherfuckers powerful back on Neil yeah he's a long dude huh that's about as long as it gets for once to have a great cardio long yeah and good fight IQ you know like never never blows his wad he's always in there like look at that just finish the guys barely breathing heavy me seriously man that dude is in fucking shit freak he's always been that women is that just a discipline thing just always he's a military guy yeah also a Denver thing right always in Chicago at the same fucking cardio cuz I was uh I was only the coaches on the Ultimate Fighter 14 he came off that season even then they're like dude look at the cardi on Neil what does he do for cardio you know him well he just trains non-stop bones like Nate Marquardt when he first came to Denver and he just me kid you know Nate train non-stop so he just kind of took on that role he just trains Nate retired yes it's done it's good he's doing the Lord's work now Oh what kind of work is that whatever the Lord wants him to do was saying I think sell Bibles I don't know what they do I don't know man he's working for a church or something I think so we just kept trying to become a priest or something okay he was always super religious yeah always yeah I'm glad he's retired great guy he had a lot of great fights man a lot of great fights when the great snake the great his ko of tyron woodley for the Strikeforce welterweight champ is one of the all-time highlight reel case total combat kale yeah literal combo elbows the best oh I love knee

not a fan of how they do the ratings I think do you think that's a fox thing so is he as being gonna stick with it I don't know is it Fox's decision that was that was one of Fox's deals they want Rankin's cuz they didn't think the public could understand you know who's who without the rankings the two arbitrary into the two disagreed upon by high level people it all no no no matter how you do

he's all light on the toes his trigger is insane a lake kick right away by - very interesting I'm so curious about this fight see that video till put out of him sparring just beating the shit out some guy yeah it was weird right I got very strange yeah doctor heard that good but he knocked them out yeah hurting him - yeah I wouldn't post that if I said yeah and then you know he posted some of him getting hit too after that because he said people calling him a bully that I don't like because that means he's reading the comments and then he's reacting to those comments which means people can fuck with his head if you're a young fighter to me tough man to navigate through well those comments you got to leave them alone you have cuz there's so many you're dealing with a you know a pool of thousands and thousands of people and who knows who they are or what they're but also loved those yet but also a lot of those people aren't happy for your success like no MS bro in their life so they talk about you of course especially a guy like til is on the rise yeah or anyone in the spotlight tries I switch kick off the front leg UFC might want to hire someone to help these younger guys with that well just give them a little psychological counseling on how to handle it get a social media expert in there till still gonna close the distance and lend that left hand over the top wonder boys not there though yeah one of ways footwork it's freakin ridiculous well this is the perfect kind of style ramp to an aggressive guy coming forward this is what he's used to yeah after I have to imagine that's why I took the fight to stylistically it was like yeah big guy aggressive let's do it right after we fight yeah yeah even though remember just beat Moz Vidale who he's see one way that he shouldn't be there alright you better get the fuck gather don't stay there yeah he knows but he's a little yeah he didn't cooperate well Darren made a shift as he was going to launch that leg kick and he put him in a weird position where he was off-balance I mean there's some good adjustments going on here both guys trying to find the rent a what oh shit till likes that one who likes that slide with the right hand forward and then look at the left hop you good oh sure 1 2 damn Wickham - wonderboy letting him know slowly every boy has not finished still there look the tilt tells a little hesitant now wait a little bit now be careful like a cobra man be careful oh you're talking about dude who was like 57 and oh was a kickboxer that's not a good one to buy as far as high level striking I can't remember last time two strikers were matched up this well no this is five round son oh yeah who knows what's gonna happen in this fight this is interesting so so high level I'm just trying to fit in with my left hand popped him with the left hand just caught him at the end of it not a lot of power but reached him and he's letting till know that he's down ah yeah snap he's also switching legs switches dances now he's all sideways it's it's hard to find a training partner who's gonna emulate Wonder Boy man yep you don't really get a real look at - yo he's picking his shots buena I think he's trying to frustrate till so till jumps it makes me look for it I don't think that landed though huh no look cool though and I was on board I yelled out you gotta get off the cage here you got to get out yeah I think for one away these first two rounds just trying to frustrate till what time is it in England right now they're seven hours ahead hmm are they eight eight so it's fucking eight o'clock it's really late same clock 8:30 at night so see yes I think it's 7:30 it's eight hours so it's 9:30 p.m. right now 8:30 bro a third what time is it now 12:30 watchword unless there's a couple different time zones in the UK I thought it was just one I mean I have daylight savings time or something nobody should have that dee-lighted Arizona does it right they do they like fine and not our sleep we lose got yourself sure you got a two-year-old yeah but how about when you've gained that out oh it's nice when you gain it for like two days not worth it bro it's not worth it just in the morning it's dark in the afternoon it's not your boys - yeah you know yeah night six gang he's all into Harry Potter and shit now we go to Universal Studios how long do the other buddy you haven't been a Universal Studios you need to go Universal Studios fucking rules now that's the 3d situation is high love that that Harry Potter ride to me holy fuck the new guards yeah it Disney's pretty sick yeah I was straight-up scared on that house get the transformer ride is amazing also yeah you know what's the best ride ever all-time hands-down flights a passage avatar ride in Disney World in Orlando is it like a simulation it's incredible dude it's incredible it's like virtual reality you go and you sit on this bike you're riding a dragon you saw avatar oh yeah yeah you're riding one of those things through the fucking jungle what in the sense it is every think of like have you ever done that that there's the thing at Disneyland called soaring over the world well you it's amazing giant screen you're flying like over India and over the Everest it's a maze sure that's not Disney World no I just did it that Disney World yeah Disney World no Disneyland has soaring over the world oh but oh here we go round two fuck look at the world what you can do that oh he'll get a little more aggressive it'll tag them with that left hand and that castle that bet Harry Potter Castle did they bill but what the fuck that's amazing oh it's incredible tills getting way more amped up oh shit one mistake man I know I wonder boy such a good counter fighter no he lives where it doesn't he oh gotta get off the fucking fence whatever that's all till wants so that first round you got to give it to one or boy right yeah I mean super close but yeah yeah give it to wonder boy yeah you have to wonder boy not a whole lot going on most I mean he landed like maybe two shots one of the body one to remember this though they're in Liverpool the homekit he's the hometown kid and the judges look at octagon control so it's not necessary could give to wander bloom on that front leg but no I don't think landed anything but he's gone forward and the judges are morons so like Oh going forward that works hold give it to till he did a good job didn't he they always ask a question after they say something he's amazing isn't he fantastic right hand wasn't it the fights about to get loose in the third round I know and what's getting loose already a little bit it's just such a dangerous chess game I know and wonder boy hands motherfucking down son he's always like that always like that that's that karate style son look for it till slid slid to the right till the elbows are no joke either now if you get thing closed they're the one that he landed on cowboy was oh God who else has he beaten it's about it sir yeah I'm really in there's not anybody else he's a really big ox he hasn't really knocked you off your socks before that cowboy fight he's at some decisions hmm yeah he knocked out you stop somebody - no yet early on he had one stop it oh shit ooh damn wonder boy very smart in yeah well this is like again stylistically such a great fight because this is the style that wonderboy really does like he likes a guy that's goober aggressive and when it turned in terms of like high-level technique both these guys are really good really really good hill till keeps throwing that front leg sake to the front oh no wasn't there a little short yeah Dixon yeah he doesn't like no wonder boy he's gonna have to adapt to that yeah they both switch it up don't they yeah Oh whew just missed that head kick son but I miss finance as good as a tills got great distance control they both do don't they help do they both do don't they don't they don't they that's Irish isn't it I don't know my accent suck we need honto in here I have some Scouts for us I mean okay definitely a different accent to it the thick man yeah Sunderland Liverpool thick yeah Liverpool I think is the odds eoz born Oh rushing in man wonderboy loves to do that like switchblades Blitz yeah but it's it's so it's so hard to figure out what the fuck he's going to do because he switches stances while he does it sometimes his imil throw a kick yeah he's about to rush in again Hills was trying to figure out and pin him down but it's not there I wonder how this is this is Wonder Boys game plan man give it up commit and make a mistake nation capitalized but tilts doing a good job of not giving him much space where the cage is this is not happening in the center of the cage as much as its hat Wonder Boy try that sweater shields gonna feel any pressure should get a finish because till is absolutely controlling the center of the cage the under boy does not have a lot well now they're in the center and you know that wins rounds for these judges yeah because they don't understand fighting that place is packed do man I'm sure they say you know he's a superstar superstar be the face of the England man oh yeah you big knockout hair be the fake cuz biz being ops he is but if he's retired yeah who else is coming up in England we got a microphone and page right sure yeah but he's not in on this level well why don't they give him high-level fights he just had fought Rickles yeah did you see what he did to him no fucked him up I heard he explode his face and choked him out yeah that was like his first like well they weren't feeding him you know like that was a tough fight microphone page daily next they say and and and Brian McDonald Mousasi ooh those are two very good fights I really mean I really like page daily because they don't like each other if I could hate each other I like that fight a lot shout out to all the 10th planet schools in the UK we got like eight now London Birmingham how many Barry redditch Darlington shit am I missing one Oh Glasgow that's Scotland Scotland how many got worldwide about a hundred that's amazing yeah it's great amazing hmm and it keeps growing man it keeps growing oh he hit him with that sidekick in the knees he Wonder Boys leg buckle see that in the replay he didn't like that he hit him with three straight one really made his knee buckle man those things fucking so here it is Michael venom page Buechele kicked him oh shit damn oh he's so fast that's again karate he comes from that point fighting background you know there's a great karate match that I watched I mean I don't know how many times they fought but on they fought point fighting way back in the day Raymond Daniels and Michael venom page fought each other in in point fighting now Raymond Daniels is the glory champion and Michael venom page is coming up in Bellator very interesting oh he's a Bellator champion now Raymond Daniels right he left glory mm-hmm here we go here we go here we go dare until super aggressive here now I wonder if wonder boys knee is okay because those uh he still hasn't landed anything though except for those side kicks to the knee yeah he doesn't land anything to the head nothing wonder boys knee seems fine he's moving fine just around so far no shot to the head yeah ooh kick to the body well the whole thing with Wonder Boy is just you make a mistake and he counters you and so far till hasn't really made any mistakes but wonder boys found a few openings but there's never been like one big bum rush where he left a gap and Wonder Boy could drop a ball on him did I miss anything no nothing but they did show the replay the the knee buckling a wonder boy I look pretty now oh yeah from what from that side kick Oh from a side kick front leg side kick knee but he's moving fine it doesn't seem like he's limping at all and he threw some kicks with that left leg it would be nice at 1 1 it's hard to tell it would be nice his wonderboy was a little more aggressive though yeah knocked out you think so same thing with the Woodley 5 I was like oh be more girth like and get fucking starch by Woodley but still you got a man this is his style you know whose style is move around but the thing is till is so high level as well that it's it's hard for this style to even find its home you know you have an aggressive it's counter striker this is I don't know what people except early Machida yeah how about that Machida front kick to V tours dear dad Peter how fucking dare you who the man sign up fighting what you know what enjoy the retirement he goofs yeah crazy right I was one of the worst knockouts effort and this just walks off fuck it start spraying you see the the photo of the foot on the face yes textbook front kick balls of the balls of the feet you think those two rival just juices with every Brazilian drug ever a my heart hope so me too I pray for that at now I pray ordered golden like the Astor's division yeah just go off and I see veins and his teeth again it's it's crazy that he's still fighting Jesus Christ dude he was around in the early days and he's the only guy from the early day stuff oh yeah encounter boy caught him with that right I mean you could say the same thing for Dan Henderson but he's officially retired he's retired but Wonder Boy I mean Vitor was around UFC 12 that's crazy Henderson was around in 98 so wasn't much longer afterwards you know crazy really be fought right Dan Henderson sometimes yeah v torn K Odom both times yep oh all right see till starting to get anxious here this one is getting in trouble man did you see his legs man I mean his hands are dangerous but his powers in those fucking legs oh shit he's stood on that head a few times there's a six lip bite ill who does still train with so much about his cabal and Liverpool his coaches Colin I forget his last name it's crazy wonder boy his dad trains him right yeah be tough dynamic ooh dim that no I won no just touched him but he did touch him at the very end with that round kick to the face you might be fun and an opening for that one to blitz Oh till just tagged him with that jab have a hard time believing these judges I don't have it 3 nothing right right in Liverpool Octagon control well I'm not saying it's right judges are too right are the American judges the English judges are all morons though aren't they although unfortunately I love the fact that you could say that you don't work for anybody I know isn't it cool and you can know till got poked in the eye right get the fuck out of here mark cutters weren't worried about an eye poked in anybody that point that doctor gotten everyone quick the doctor just jumped in God where'd he come from and now he's out he's trying to do a little too much TV time oh yeah oh definitely not into Pokkiri no oh they're booing them yeah you say no no boom oh shit sometimes I post really revered dude up or a dick kick Oh My Damn Darren tells get wild here no don't get too comfortable okay they're over the top oh shit over the top talk fight oh he's getting crazy here dude that I poke really poke I wish you would poke my anniversary of the round here oh now I was trying to get loose nice about to get fucked a that was three so you got two more to go thank god this is a five rounder right yeah oh fuck so much on that fight if it's three rounds it ended there yeah man that dude has a prominent forehead cheekbone situation going on I think Genghis Khan got a little bit of that it up he's definitely got some fucking ancient man and all he does I don't look like him he definitely boom that right hand that was nice to counter him here boom boom know how that got him that did definitely he slid with it yeah he went with it but it caught him at the end of it for sure look one way don't look tired this is his style you know he's so efficient at doing that Oh both these guys can do this for 10 rounds yeah round four here we go guys this is a fight that is a great argument for the five-round fight for high level ha Turner sent me we would feel so bad if we were leaving here and there yeah yeah like who won who cares what even happened like what what are the stats on dude unless hunches and kicks landed yeah unless you're super and you'd be so dis Wonder Boy with a hard jab right there kid dang better watch his P's and Q's though you're too hard man yeah but juice is worth the squeeze you can get a knockdown oh damn just getting hot yeah cuz yeah dinner tills never been five around says he no I don't think so he hasn't switched in you see this first made it well first times gives his main event against cowboy else he starts cowboy say that yeah that's his first main event right and what about outside the UFC how many fighters you know you know what seventeen or fourteen uh crazy speaks perfect Portuguese Oh does the other know that oh yeah man who when he fucked dare until attend this kids market ball when he fought in Brazil he spoke Portuguese to the crowd he lived there for like ten years right yeah I watched one of his older fights let me stop this guy and he spoke Portuguese to the crowd after the fight like the guy up yeah first ten fights were there wow he went down that just went to live down that he had to get on liverpool cuz i guess there's a little talk tip for him we got stabbed yeah yes yeah you can see the stat mark where is it it's lower like on his beyond his right he got stabbed in Brazil but right above his hip in England yeah in Liverpool in his hometown and his coach is coach Tom hey get out of here man if you wanna they need to ban knives and the UK enough to enough how many more people gotta get stuff that's you know the London Mayor actually said that you get caught with a knife you'll be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law what about if I had to open boxes that princesses brother-in-law our brother got caught with one when he went over there for the royal wedding last week well that yeah call it a night they said he took one because Trump said that you should take one with him he was in a bar god oh he's crazy is he crazy my brother's crazy like she's a dime piece man I'm assuming you two have nothing no I don't give a fuck about that I'm watching this fight here son one boy with a step in jab not a lot of ash in this fight Oh wonderboy looking for that left hand over the top cuz it land nope just kind of grazed him it's kind of hard to tell his back was to us it's gonna be a tough fucking fight to judge man tell us having a hard time hitting him that's for dead Oh beautiful tuck under that we get this tail with the clinch well if he takes him down do we just stop the fight interesting that tills the one holding on to him here oh well trying to dunk that clinch is mortised nasty good elbow on the break there you're one of my see exactly I wanted that legs kind of fucked up that lead like it right yep it does look a little bruised oh good kick to the body oh yeah you guys watch that show Cobra Kai no I haven't seen her supposed to be good yeah no that's great that's a crazy welt on Wonderboys leg I really haven't noticed him getting hit that much me neither it's on both legs to the off see the right Lakes worse with that left legs pretty tenderoni to the right leg was really fucked us I don't really around kicking that hard it must have been when he was standing southpaw sideways you know and now he hasn't gone back that Athey really not just round doesn't like it oh my god yeah we his foot works just stupid so Darren till I can't really get a read on him but again the judges are giving out to tell ya that nothing big has happened where you go all that guy definitely well if someone ladies don't just knock someone down you've got the fight it just might go P got the good right hand of the body so just a high-level chess game here all right which I did get on the edge of my seat but if you're just a regular fan Mike come on man I tell you what he's gonna get more shit his wonderboy because it's 1 Woodley fights which stops you know like no it's not his fault I'm just a the public Kingdom shit I guess I don't know it's what it is so this is the I mean you want to beat him you got to come after him and you come after him you run into the wood chipper but the thing is he's not winning when he does this but we didn't win against Woodley when he did this for sure but he's land obviously yeah he's obviously got number one for a reason happen there that's back like it's fucked up man yeah well two friendly boys will try for me yeah he's wobbling a little on back to his corner that leg is fucked up man they just loosen this fifth round they're saving it for the fifth round Eddie I hope so me too cuz again if it stopped right here I'd be bummed out I've been pretty lackluster yeah I was really they're gonna give it to till not 100% no thanks don't give me every round that give to my hat and then one just like we don't like me to obviously give them on the water boy yep three two one til ya real because of the judges yes but Rogers of what you think right uh even then it'd be tough you can maybe go to too bad I'd say tills win this fight I don't know about that I think Wonderboys winning can I get some goddamn comp you strike numbers Fox I know no wonder they left your ass just kidding can I get something how's your show going on Showtime enjoying it yeah it's been good man it's been fun nice do a lot of fun did you know that guy that just died without from the comedy division yeah I did not did you know everybody seems to think he's I might have met him but everybody seems to think he's a really good guy that sucks man yeah fifty five man I know sister shame raising Burt loved the guy yeah yeah yeah burner something real nice to say about also did dice that's a bummer man yeah till super aggressive air coming out yeah I'm sure you let's get the finish probably feels a little bit of pressure and you should okay they're saying Darren tills corns very urgent like you sleeves in the fight yeah I think he's losing you do yeah yeah I think if I would count up all the different strikes I think strikes out landed yeah I think once according to the UFC thing I don't know close in terms of strikes landed yes that's forty eight to forty two goddamn that's tough to judge yeah that's impossible and then you have one aggressor right in Liverpool I got to freeze won five rounds forty eight strikes landed that is just but not bananas a lot of defense going on yeah a lot of missing is a lot of movement which styles are you think would make for three but there's a good right hand by two little jab to the grill face sidekick no one's really going balls to the wall are they now Darren two would go balls the walls but wonderful keeps moving it's a fucking ride he keeps movement you don't get blasted in the face yeah it's hard what would come on maybe sit there fellows that about he threw a shitty wheel kick and then shook his head then they touch gloves it's fun fucking weird Oh switched up on him it's to her a little too friendly for my liking he's gonna set up his wheel kick with his left leg someone throw something anything the crowds like yeah that you have them there till but he doesn't dare he landed a left hand why are they touching it would touch dab cuz got all the gotta in corner yeah is that about gorillas don't act like that I don't understand this that desk touch gloves again too much respect I know there's not enough killer instinct in this he's looking for that low fake and then go with the high round kick off the front leg he does that sometimes but he didn't do it was like you know how many miles they've ran this goddamn fight you kind of give it to them for sticking to their foot no one's getting out of composure here two pros pros now I get this style you know you don't want to risk it but if yeah if you're not balls deep into fighting you're not happy with this fight now I'm not thrilled with it this is like what I get it one of the most uneventful big events whoo good jabs fight til guillotine oh yeah I thought oh shit that's enough to win the fight no hunter present that's all you needed don't get wrong time to go a little bit of time to go yeah how hard is that my fucker hit they don't look like it lay like behind the air we'd have to look at him to replay but it already heard him that wonderboy has gotta move his ass now he lost the fight well wonder why he's in trouble know him he's flat-footed yeah one of ways be a little bit rubbish what till lifts were damn wonder boy would have one too till just out of range for it to hurt this got interesting that's a physically roud man it ones on their feet now but this is like Wonder Boy when he fought tyron woodley - right got tagged got hurt and then people rushing you dealt with look at this Wonder Boy would have fucking takedown you know she go you know shit any excited when someone shoot for a takedown all these days yeah oh no it left - wonderboy still dangerous crazy right 40 seconds left boys maybe til just thinks he has in the bag I don't think so I just think he doesn't want to get tagged coming in he's a little tired - mouths open hasn't been a high pace there's been a lot of footwork though so you might be a little but you gotta remember till did have a real hard time cutting that weight and he's been going through a lot you're right they need some get downs in this no stand ups just get down get down yeah there's no wake you have one a boy the fight after that no and be hard-pressed especially in Liverpool oh man and today I'm one of ways in a tough spot now I don't know why he's that happy about that that was um I mean he landed a good shot I guess he was trying it wasn't like he wasn't trying yeah he was sore so when full-tilt after that lackluster performance cuz he because Wonderboys number one y'all reckon number one obviously I think put him in the top white boy is just a nightmare for everybody he's a nightmare for everybody just it's tough to look good against him a win over him is a win you know he beat ya the big what about number one well he didn't even make the weight so that's that's where it gets tricky because a gives a fuck about that right but you're saying that they fought here here's that front leg side kick that wobble is knee good job MetroPCS a block in division god damnit MetroPCS why would they do that why would they have that right where you need to see I'll tell you right now if you're my friend Lee of MetroPCS we are not friends anymore is the lockdown lockdown do you get angry just because of that well no I kidding you gets the cricket of wireless cell phones now cricket oh shit hard fucking left hand yeah boom right behind that was legit got one in the fight he clobbered him right there yeah that was behind the ear huh that was as legit as it gets that was the legit shot of the fight like one legit shot that's why I like if you have 49 other strikes at land do they even count I mean that that's a real strike that well now if you ever use the word clobber when when you're calling fights I don't qualify clobbers not my diction no it's too old-school and clobber and clobber them clobbering who says this is the thing says that right yeah if they think long tested for clobbering time so what do we think here what do you think you think challenge a hundred percent for one to close I think I think till split someone's gonna give it to Wonder Boy well that tills gonna some rebel some rebel who wants to die in Liverpool I want to get going on my shield a place that will they set that place on fire if they do give to Wonder Boy Liverpool goes hard in the paint you know there's some hooligans yeah it's gonna be a tough it's gonna be a tough exit strap no way wonderful is that a bird or the fucking name is she there does she go everywhere yeah she like gives lessons on judging and stuff you know that you don't think they put her in there for a reason you know coz she don't give a fuck I think they they want controversy they want people to get used to fucked up decisions well we're used to it that's yeah yeah I think they want that because if they ever needed to pull something out like something was like dude this motherfucker has to win you know people's like oh it is Vegas Vegas yeah I don't boxing's corruptive ship and with MMA I just think they I don't know what they're looking at they don't understand and either way either way they either way it's so here we go here we go Jamie can you give us some volume it just offered me a killer strip club DJ holy shit Wow well you don't even need that knock down that's a big fight for him where were some of those scores I can hear it 49 47 48 47 right 49 46 49 46 48 47 Wow that's it that's a big victory for him that's for sure you pointed wonderful way I think you said something bad thinking you some potty language there what do you think classified uh there's such a specific way of talking I feel like it's so much cooler when they talk like this is a fighter yeah it's pretty cool [Music] right not really really I'd have to hear yeah what is he saying what it but what are they saying boy fucking censorship you know what let me let me hear the boy's neck extend everyone anyone I don't care goddamn with the censorship ESPN please let these guys swear please come on they're not gonna let it no way it's gonna be worse neons ESPN good call I think they might not even let me do commentary over there you have you guys seen solo hockey about that you out doesn't eat it over Star Wars right yeah have you seen solo no dude I lasted literally six minutes and I walked out yes know the reason the reason why I walked out I realized what it is about Star Wars lovers it's in the chase scenes they use the classic Star Star Wars movies music yeah like that music is just so Indiana Jones can't be corny right I couldn't stand it man and I was ready dude I had fucking can on scene I was one of those those chicken baguettes with the barbecue watermelon sauce barbecue watermelon sauce on you special walked as soon as I was done I killed it before the that was done with that before the movie even started that the chicken I'm Joanne Barnes go by myself you would see myself well how at the ArcLight in Sherman Oaks really yeah yourself my my wife took my son to some a birthday party thing and they were gonna be gone for a couple hours like I said you know what I like I like that the idea of going to movies it's just that they all suck but I like going or like I like buying some candy later so low though it doesn't matter well I did I did not not so much since I had a kid but back in the day I would go all the time by myself I think I've only been maybe three times not even in my life by myself I saw Easter Bunny only because I want to be able to leave if I go with someone else and I got a fucking stay cuz nobody likes to talk I like know most people don't like leaving most people a they're getting so I got a fucking sit there for the whole stupid movie I like to I like the freedom to leave cuz I won't i won't as soon as i don't give a shit about the movie i'm out I heard Deadpool twos amazing that was good I stayed for that I saw that by myself - that was good yeah Deadpool - I I just I just need the freedom to leave that's that's really what that's about mmm through that welterweight division is purify right now ya know pure fucking fire I think at all of the young guys that if Kobe Cummington Susman and then Darren til til if I had to bet on one of them being like the the world champion beat til I think so yeah out of all those those three guys dangerous motherfucker that's for sure if you trade him with that guy I mean the thing that wonderboy did that was so interesting is he's just never there he's just never there and it made it a hard fight for till to keep his composure and fight five hard rounds and constantly be chasing him and wonder boys never there and wonderful attack them a couple times but till was the one that landed the big shaming but you also see till under control experience still stuck this technique he's me tough to beat man yeah now I'd like to see him against a guy who has high-level wrestling like Kobe come dinner would Lia or even who you know who's been super high level recipe that where it's not ideal match up for platforms because cowboy and Wonder Boy or striker so it's it's wheelhouse yeah let me see a rda/us menorah Colby County yeah I would like to see him versus Cole I think it's purple he's a purple thing I'm pretty sure he's our purple he's been doing it for a while but see I don't think you do coke we versed in I don't think you kill off the young lines yet I think you let the young lines go after the Robbie Lawler's the Cowboys the RDAs do you think that way do they think that way or do they just try to make the best fights they can do UFC yeah I think there's no Z sing oh just what do you like you know I think it's just whatever the fuck works is this fight doesn't make too much sense for Wonder Boy right but it's a fun fight for us to watch yeah very fun fight to watch yeah and there's a clubbing puncher boom yeah lot of power yeah he's got power and he's a big fella I mean if he if they wanted him to have to weigh 188 they know that he's probably well well north of that are probably coming in well north at 200c but missing the weight we we don't make a big enough deal of it I don't give I don't really kill either but it is a problem and it's a huge problem it's such an advantage but like with Mackenzie durin after you missed it I didn't care I'm like I do your thing girl she missed it by seven fucking pounds man that's so big that means it doesn't drain her I know so when she goes to it's a huge advantage yeah she goes to fight she's not drained out huge did that McKenzie Dern fight holy shit that was like some UFC two type shit she took that chick down mounted her it was like that it was like a hoist versus that that Dutch kickboxer with the G pants when I got her striking was the impressive thing she does overhand yeah she does she has big she's not afraid to throw down Mackenzie turn ahead man she's got giant balls right through that it looked like that chick never trained she looked she looked too thick though that fight she didn't like it I like thick but then there's like damn girl you need a we need a little pride here she said to the way she's dressed if she was in a miniskirt with a halter top don't get a twist I'm on board whatever she's gonna I'm just saying that like the love handles are spilling over the top all right now something looks like it's a little thick sometimes I like that yeah I'm not mad at it but depends on how much ass goes with the package you're right the front to back race it's a bit see this way this is why I can't be your father fire me good yeah Wow it's not saying that just make me just do the pay-per-views I'm fine with that that's all you do anyway oh wait no I mean I do the previous I do the prelims ma well yeah well let's see no cuz why I guess they're just the contract comes over like does everyone like do UFC tonight crew everyone's everybody UFC and I was never working for Fox I didn't do the fire there's one of my before yeah but one of the stipulations of my newer contract I said I didn't want to do the Fox events anymore and that deals through when you've done it it's already done I mean it was like this year I don't do any of the Fox events if you notice like when there are big fights on yeah I know you don't do any of them not even a big ones nope none of them zero justice paper right too much work too much work soon this is not a big deal because they have the suit there for me but the my issue was Fox actually paid me less money less money I was like you guys never paying you yeah I thought the UFC paid you know I get to fox event it's a Fox event so that but it was also I didn't like when I first started doing it for them they got in my ear like the very first events for Fox they were like telling me what to do they were like telling me to take it down a notch don't believe about that yeah and I was like what what are we doing here I go listen I do commentary this is what I do I've been doing it forever this is how I do it if you you think you can change me then we're not gonna work together I'm like we are with a real problem and that was a Fox reduction right Joe yes was a fox productions that's a Junior dos Santos came Velasquez that was oh that was at the pond yeah I believe that was the first one yeah but it's just I just didn't I didn't like it they want a sports guy look look MMA is what it is it's it's fighting it is a very specific kind of sport and I've been doing it the way I do it forever if you don't like the way I do it that's fine don't hire me but don't try to get me to become some sports guy I'm not interested in that at all when i commentate it for pride they told me i said nice too much North a nice there's like no they couldn't even speak English they just gotta said nice a lot I think nice shot nice jab there's where did they stop they stop to the first event when I voice my displeasure I just let them know like really clearly there's and we're not doing this I'm not gonna change how I do it to make you don't need to do this I'm helping is not even that it's just like if you don't like the way I do it this it's not an option for you to direct me and tell me to do it the way you like it because you think that that's better this is a personal choice by one or two whoever the fuck the people were that were producers or executives I don't agree with them and I'm not doing it that way like this is just how it's okay it's like real simple like if you bought a Ferrari and it had a certain sound to it you like man I don't like this sound can you guys go back to the factory and fix these mufflers they'd be like what are you high yeah this is what a Ferrari is well this is you don't like it then you like Ferraris no no I like it for right but I want it to sound like a Corolla doesn't were like like no no you probably a bad analogy but the idea behind it you get I'm not this is what I do like I get amped up if some shit is going down these guys are throwing blows and I'm screaming it's because I feel that way some would call it passion yeah it's well it's legitimate passion I'm not I'm not faking it but they didn't want that but they let it go after a while but it's not like they fought for me when I quit either how long is the Reebok deal for I don't know three years I'd say another three years yeah two three I wonder if it it worked out for Reebok like is Reebok Reebok exploding now because of this well adido Zones Reebok so dealers is killing it but I don't know free box exploding there in the niche right there MMA the therein with CrossFit so they're in that world into Reeboks defense you know they made the offer they don't know they didn't know what the deal was they know they're screwing over fighters it's more of a UFC thing it was not Reebok reacts like whoa the fuck it seemed like even the UFC wasn't aware of how much fighters were actually making off of sponsorships I mean you and I know that there was some debate as to whether or not I mean they just they had a distorted perception of how much some fighters were making and they don't think they cared I think they talked to maybe the top 10 guys in like a we're gonna pay this we would take care in this way then the rest of the guys get on board and they you know but but again I get it man if I'm doing while I'm not making decisions based off those 10 to 15 top guys I'm making my decision it's gonna affect my bottom line and one is what they did one judge in the date Jason outfight gave every round in Jason Knight so once one judge did look at it like you like he's on his back and he could get taken down yeah but he was the one it was aggressive on the ground yeah I agree with that I don't think you just take each one and have one thing you do know it's a fight roll yeah Bravo tell everybody you're a
