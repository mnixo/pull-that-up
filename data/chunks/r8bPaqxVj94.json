Telemundo lab before we do it unless a here we go [Applause] why are they getting this do you not hear the song Brandon are in the song it's just hit their arm huh you're on the videos not making some their videos - not making sound is it's not the program is just freaking out of it it's too much fun get the fuck off the phone you're live in front of hundreds of people hey I didn't know John Heffron ladies and gentlemen winner of Last Comic Standing not like those faggots he beat yeah he's the goddamn champion we were the first champion of that calm I was uh I was second who the fuck was the first deck fan that fan good old dad was that does that in any way diminish your accomplishment what happened that dude I don't know what happened to my pinkies uh he does wildly I think he said he does a lot of shows and they they sell out and stuff like that so kissing deaf fans ask yeah that's the thing a lot of guys like to bag on the guy for because when he wanted he was really really green and new yeah well I I don't fault anybody for that yeah he's always been nice to me he's been nice to me I've never seen and watched you stand up and I saw him one I judged the first Last Comic Standing if he fucking crushed you did the bull a fact that was when we caught aunt stealing material and that's one now well yeah it screamed at me alright almost had a heart attack that was a fucked-up story cuz this dude ant was stealing jokes we feel like like book joke right like jokes had a movies or get Harlan shit and you know I said I complimented him first with city a really good performer you got a lot of energy you know but I've heard that shit before and then you fucking a pow okay yo you're fucking me out my cat just got scared bow to him baby give me yeah she got scared when I use my buddy he's not doing more buddy heck voices um anyway the story was with Buddy Hackett when I when I started when I started saying that this guy was stealing material Buddy Hackett got really upset because what you know bloody Hackett's like an old school like he's a comic from like you know the Catskills days those guys lost stolen terrible you know they all did each other's jokes and there was no internet back then yeah right wasn't even a fuckin TV you had some gags and he did them and nobody knew yeah and if you didn't do your gags first you know the guy in front of you did them you know I mean you know it's funny is a lot of guys if from that era like everyone Bob Newhart's famous for the phone bit you know yeah Bob Newhart's famous for he's like on the phone and he'll do one sided the one sided phone conversation hilarious but there's a lot of guys from that era who did the same exact phone bit so oh well um but anyway while he was yelling at me there was a part of me that wanted to go shut the fuck up you old cocksucker but I didn't guess what he died two weeks later Oh wha which means he was real close to death that night cut up so if I yelled at him he died a keeled over and fucking died right there and it was news of 10% 10% of me that was like why am i listening to this old douchebag cuz my philosophy on old people has always been that old assholes were assholes and they were young they just survived you know right right it just became an asshole when you turn that guy's a douche bag and I thought about yelling out I said you know what that's not gonna help anybody and I'm like what's the point this is all on television so everyone's gonna see this guy's material Maggie what's going on everyone's gonna know what happened so I did not think so here we are with John Heffron neural linguistic they examine freak John Heffron is recalibrating his mind he sets a very negative negative patterns that he was following earlier on his life he's abandoned all those no more drinking he's no more bad stuff john Heffron it's all about positive energy and Tony Robbins right well kind of yeah but the Tony Robbins without the walking on on fire and going to a seminar with 20,000 really motivated people yeah what is the walking on fire a job well probably helps you it teaches you to walk on fire how you would then apply that skill to other things in your life I have no idea you know because even if you having an argument with your girl you can't go well I can walk on fire it won't apply to anything else but walking on fire right okay like guys fighting that bus board's right it's great if a guy jumps in front of you with six boards yeah what's the fucking point of breaking boards I don't I don't get that or the the break-in uh I guess it's your power and a punch but well that is it what guy is standing there boards break pretty easy that's the sad thing those boards used for demonstrations they all break when I ask a consulate I can go whenever we used to open up a new school we would all have to go and do demonstrations and what part of the demonstration was he how to kick boards break boards this always seemed so silly we're talking about the nearing linguistic stuff yeah so I'm Buddy Hackett so you knew your thing so you're doing all this programming and this programming leads to you better performances on stage yeah it's basically that it just kind of we rewires your brains every everybody if something happens you probably wrapped similar in every single situation so this kind of just trains your brain to maybe take the best it gives you options to handle situations where you have zero options then you're just gonna freak out if you have a few you usually take the best option for it but it also keeps you from doing shitty things right it keeps you from ruining your life yeah yeah for me yeah for me what I did is you kind of work backwards you figure out what you want to accomplish and then you you kind of get all those feelings and what it feel like once you accomplish those and it kind of lets your brain know this is the way I want to go this is make every decision in the right way to obtain that goal you know I think for me it's you know some people go that's all it's all common-sense stuff but there's a big difference between common sense and uh you know it's common knowledge or actually applying it right but you apply it now you're all about doing yeah I do it before I get on stage I do some techniques to get me because you know as stand-ups you can get and people don't realize it's not well you travel with guys that you like but a lot of times I'm working with dudes that bug me yeah you know yeah or whatever so you get in a bad mood for a billion different reasons before you get on stage and then you enter that stage and you're kind of in a pissy mood which then that comes across to the crowd or what I would do is I would see a group of guys let's say and in my head I would go all those guys are gonna heckle and then I start playing this movie in my head all they're gonna heckle right on my favorite joke oh it's gonna wreck that thing and I start to go like literally play it out as if it happens so then when I got on stage I was already mad at these guys that didn't say anything so I take the stage with a little bit more testosterone and then that puts a weird vibe on the crowd even though those guys might have not set anything the entire show but now I do that with every part of my life and I think a lot of people do you know you're like oh look at that girl over there I'd ask her I actually probably gonna say no though she's probably gonna say no and make me feel stupid in front of all my friends and blah blah blah she was saying there's a lag there is a definitely a lag because I'm watching us on the video and it's totally different from what we're saying it's like John still talking on the video but right now I'm - you're always gonna have that really is that because you streamed gaze fuck it's just we're live streaming video you know because it would if we were on blogtv I mean justin.tv yeah but who cares but watching this care man how did they live in the lives of guys saying lag he's upset no how does how did let another the lag yeah because he's watching the video and the sound is different no no the sounding video is the same is it yeah okay it's just 15 there's a fifteen seconds delay well how the hell's you know there's a lot then he's probably on a slow city you've got a shitty asset in that connection good while you play with us and a well dial up John Heffron not only is he a stand-up comedian he also hosted the MMA awards this year which was a total fucking disaster really the edited version came my awesome way you told it to walk for me for me it was a check lewd the check is clear let's talk yeah the check is coming but for me it was weird the people who got to see it on vs. got to see it live as if it was happening so there was a lot of shoot this guy this guy sucks to me talking about me hosting to those sitting at and the safety of their computer and being maybe 15 or 16 year years old you would probably think that it suck not realizing that hosting something like Oh ladies and gentlemen the sound if you just have to press refresh if you press refresh your sound and video should sync up that's that's what's gonna go some dudes said that the MMA awards would lean well you know what well I think I compared to out oh yeah my thinking that at late lame this is always my fingers is lame to what is I is what I don't get is people compare them and they awards to what the Oscars no no my money it's just like not interesting to watch you know show a highlighted clip show and people gotta realize I think for the first one in the budget they had that's why you know guys like you or Kevin Shapiro I was like why is the Rogen host why isn't Kevin J like big guys that people know honestly because they had zero dollars what's also the Hosting thing I couldn't a hosted it because I'm a commentator for the yeah and you want to make it non ventures yeah on its own you know I'm I'm a huge MMA fan and I'm as objective as possible when it comes to other organizations like I'm always talking about phaidor and I'm always talking about ioki and all these different guys like asked our Overeem and different guys are fighting other organizations I'm I'm a big believer in you know you have to look it oh I mean if you're a fan you have to like all the different organizations you can't just be loyal obviously the UFC is the greatest job I've ever had and it's a fucking awesome gig and I appreciate the hell out of it I love the job but as a fan you know you can't just only follow the fighters and the fights that are in that organization that's just silly I thought my favorite thing I tweeted this I was watching you do a combat inning one of the fights I love when you call out an entire group of twenty thousand people for booing because I I get mad like we're just drunk yeah the bottom line is that I understand that they didn't like the decision that makes sense but once the dude is talking when they're interviewing the dude booing him all he did was like Aaron Simpson versus Tom Laurel yeah that was the last one like you can't boo Aaron Simpson the guy fought his ass off he got hurt really bad the first round and came back and won the second and the third and it was a really gutty performance man and it had mad endurance and even in the third round he outpaced Tom Lawlor I mean was just a great fight overall great fight and I don't know how anybody couldn't enjoyed it I mean I think in situations like that I hate close decisions because close decisions like that man it could have gone either way and so the fight really took place everybody saw what happened and to decide that one guy wanted or another guy wanted when it's that close I would much rather have a draw I think that fight could have easily been a draw you know a lot of people thought that Tom Lawlor one which I definitely think he won the first round but I think and Simpsons on the second and third although not in as large a margin second very slight in the third a little bit more I think if you looked at it on paper you could say well maybe you could give the first round ten eight but the bottom line is forget about all that the bottom line is it was a great fight yeah the guy should feel like a loser like there's no way Tom Wallisch should feel like a loser after that fight and there's no way Aaron Simpson should've got booed oh yeah why any time I've been at a live fight or or you hear the people I don't get mad but I love when people start going you know start yelling stand them up when they've been on the ground for maybe thirty five seconds yeah it's the war advisory or if guys feel out each other like I'm okay with an X bar to me a nice bar MMA is my golf I don't spar to really try to tell everybody I enjoy the work out of it but even you know you have to feel out a guy you don't just go go and then start let's start you know people expect like hockey fights sometimes where it just erupts immediately they walk out they go toe-to-toe in start well I think it's just that the one of the action is great it's so exciting that people want to keep that part going and then when it goes to the ground the uneducated fans if they don't know what's going on they they get upset but I promise the referees in small towns like when we go to Memphis I don't say small towns Memphis is in a small town but I go outside of Vegas a lot of times they use local referees and these guys they're too busy they get involved the action too much you know fight guys bike guys I'm while they're fighting you don't like guys in the guard he's working as guards trying for an armbar trap or something I'm gonna stand you up I'm standing up like what the fuck you talking about you're staying love this guy's are fine I don't think most a part of fighting I don't think most people realize the difficulty is I mean just have somebody your size if not a little bit bigger laying on top of you and then stand up from that position just letting that person just with their weight Center how hard it is just to stand up what do you mean like if I find one if I'm on my back here on top of me and I and I scramble and I get it that we both we stand up together that's a huge feat in it yeah it is you know it may be baby not that that not gonna be that the only way you should get up is if you got off it shouldn't be the referee stands you up I hate all that shit I've always said that if if someone like Brock Lesnar can take you down and molest you for five minutes yeah then that's tough shit tough shit he's got you on your back you got anyway to get back on TV and if you can't it's five minutes of him punching you in the face yeah it's life and if your technique to avoid that is to turn and run in circles so we can't tackle you didn't do yeah that's it yeah it is whatever it's not and believe me that's gonna you what's gonna decide your career is gonna be fans and with a fans like your style whether or not you sell tickets whether or not you know you optimize your potential as a mixed martial artist and the fans are gonna let you know whether or not they like your style and if you got a boring-ass style even if you like winning fights nobody's gonna give a shit they're not gonna buy your paper views and that's like that's like that's commerce you know that's how it's supposed to work you know it's supposed to be let let the market dictate what you know whether people like people or not no I said you sent a clip the other day a tag team wrestler but what do you think the evolution of your just to pretend the evolution you think maybe in 40 years to be like maybe numchucks on a rack like on a hook on the side of the cage where then no I think because that's not as fun the fun thing is man to man no weapons that's what I mean you could go the Roman gladiator style I've dudes have sword fights and it would be certainly be fucking crazy but ultimately I don't think it'd be as enjoyable it'd just be more fucked up because your champion like a stab yeah yes if I were in a moto musashi you know Musashi beats sixty two men in sword fights but unless you're Musashi you know what's gonna happen you're gonna get fucking sliced up you know sucks about that tag-team idea is half the people probably think it's a great idea you know they all came from wrestling know they're don't know go to the go to the YouTube clip that I posted up on tag-team MMA yeah every fucking Cobb realize what fuck is this case shit now why was this what happened then what happened from the transition of wrestling thinking that's an awesome idea to all those fans well guess Lee's face you know I mean basically you know the real the evolution is war it's like football it's like a team of MMA guys on one side of field it's yeah that we're you know it I got a Hulk Hogan story by the way when we were at the UFC he sat right in front of me and he has his really weird hair where it looks like it's a wig almost but he pulled out a comb and during the UFC the whole time he was just cloning the back of his hair and like just I kind of go like this and I'm flipping it over his shoulder and I was just like is this really the Hulk Hogan that I know he's combing his hair well he probably does it like fur like it's probably a show like part of his image and they just you know because I mean he's like silly he's always on and he's out in public you know he's the Hulkster do the interview and him was the show was that yeah fucking awesome man he was really nice guy huh it's great guy real nice guy every interview well not every interview you've done I saw you interview there's but there's been a fight in the stands right before you go to talk to them they yeah it happened with a semester so long your interview errata and there's a there's a thing hype did it happen was wrong there's always like a little moment right in for it's funny I guess or to make them more realistic maybe could have cage fighting or where you have the two fighters and then random people standing around like a bar fight so then you'd have to worry about throwing a punch back in half it's gonna be robots MMA in the future no guys human chimp hybrid people are gonna like infuse their body with chimp DNA and yes jump into the top of the cage they're gonna be so much stronger and faster well there's gonna be some definitely this gonna be genetic engineering in the future and one genetic engineering becomes a reality forget about steroids steroids are gonna be nonsense it's gonna be nothing when they get gene though I'm a trainers you know that you ever seen the video of there's there's a couple of kids that have been born with myostatin problems and what happens is they develop like extreme amount of muscle they have all that like there's whippets there's a dog called a whippet and they they breed these dogs to try to make them you know fast to make them sleek and run faster occasionally they they have an error in their genetics and they get giant muscles look like they'd only look really look Photoshop but it's a real dog like super roided-up read it and no fat meets incredible but that's all they've done it already to mice they've engineered mice so that these mice have this mile statin inhibitor situation going on and they have giant muscles and they can they live longer I mean I'm all for man I hope all that stuff come thrown right around the time when you know I'm in my 67 teeth it's gonna happen I'm gonna serve s you're still on it well it's everything is going in in a direction where like science fiction like the things that we thought of as being completely ridiculous in the 1980s stuff that you would see in a movie I mean it's all real now well you know I mean you see that new Microsoft touch thing where they have a table and you can put something on the table and it recognizes what that something is and gives you information on it I mean that's like minority-owned type shit I mean this is all gonna happen he said I was talking about that new cell phone idea that Nokia has where it's a phone that you're talking and then you flip it on your wrist when you're doing you know yeah it like turns into jewelry yeah and it wraps around you yeah yeah it's like those like this bracelets those old metal bracelets used to like flip on your wrist now that girls would have them but it's it's a cell phone it's a bendable LCD they just happen it the other day and it's pretty much what it is they can unstraight in and out use it as a phone and then when they're done you just flip it on your wrist I saw the dad this what's that neo technology where they took sharkskin the challah it's all bladed and they made this chute that's almost unstoppable and stuff for like soldiers where you've where almost like a wetsuit but it's on nothing can get through it so it's like Kevlar but it's thinner and stuff then it's ever been before so you can wear it as a full body and you can't stamp something with it um well regular Kevlar can be stabbed straight on you know with a knife you can get your Kevlar but this is some shark skin is what it's some guy invented he invented it to stop shark attacks but it's not that chainmail stuff it's like a wetsuit that can't be so now they're messing with that stuff one day they're gonna have a real Iron Man suit yeah it's gonna be crazy if you don't already all the guys are gonna look like halo the dudes from from halo definitely that's what I think all that technology it's gonna be like Star Wars where you're gonna have a helmet that you pull out so you know you can't breathe the air outside well yeah this is gonna be that but I think most of the war is gonna be fought like what the CIA is doing a Pakistan right now they got drones and these drones are flying over Pakistan just launching missiles down on people the bottom line is that all things accelerate no things stay exactly where they are and the only time they de Grasse is when there's a gigantic national commercial catastrophe or you know somebody blows up a bunch of nuclear weapons and you know we go back to being fucking cavemen I mean that's the only way things are gonna decelerate but the way things are going right now they're gonna move in a crazy crazy direction I mean laughter faster yeah we went from from bows and arrows to guns to cannons and it keeps going and going and going and now it's fucking drones that fire missiles from the sky I mean that's and then you know like the Star Wars program they were trying to do with during the Reagan administration you know they were trying to have it so they have satellites that could shoot down missiles from space but apparently that was all bullshit apparently that never really worked in a parent there's a gigantic conspiracy wrapped around the scientists that were involved in the Star Wars program because apparently a fuckload of them have died under suspicious cause yeah yeah yeah there's if you google it anybody wants to google it right now I'll put up a link for you guys but and I don't know if this is a legit obviously I don't know if it's a legit conspiracy theory but the Star Wars scientists on the side note on your up the conspiracy theory stuff that Utah boys at one site if you let's say you're a new guy abs jumps powers infowars.com ladies and gentlemen horse geo Marconi scientist death conspiracy theorist mystery of the dead scientist conspiracy hmm wikipedia has a little page on between 1982 and 1990 25 british-based GEC Marconi scientists and engineers who work oh that's a stingray oh yeah Star Wars Defense Initiative yeah died under mysterious circumstances Wow police investigations found those death to be unconnected oh yeah the same police that helped Taser and grandmas and shit is that he did it just probably the snacks out of the vending machine it's not works it's probably how AIDS was created there's so many sites on this I don't want to link it because I just yeah you know what I'll do I'll link the Google search so you do your own work because who the fuck knows how many of these guys are completely crazy so I just sent it up there who knows um who knows how many guys are completely out of the fucking mind and who knows whether or not it's real you know Starbucks was raining right yeah well that the Reagan administration was famous for secret shit was going on this is Reagan introducing Star Wars his announcement was yeah what are you showing it yeah what are you gonna show a video or something don't do that nobody gives a fuck shit don't put that up okay Star Wars it's the whole thing why not we can show people of them introducing Star Wars because I don't want to pull it's uh it was just a program with a shot supposedly had satellites that could shoot down missiles from space but apparently it was never functional never never proven to be effective they spent billions and billions of dollars on it and all these scientists dying the big theory was that you know these guys knew too much and they knew that it was horseshit and so they had a killing off before they talked I wouldn't I wouldn't put it past them you know you get the CIA involved and if you ever read like economic concessions of an economic hitman and you find out the shit that our government does to other countries they'd kill scientists they'd kill anybody they don't give a fuck you know the same people that wanted us to go to war in Iraq and we're willing to lie about the weapons of mass destruction you know everybody's a going on and on about September 11th like do you really think the government would allow innocent people to die during September 11th so they could go to war I don't know but do you really think they believe weapons of mass destruction do you really think that we're over in Iraq and Afghanistan for good reasons that benefit you and I know and millions of people have died because of that at least a million Iraqi civilians have died because of that and so if they're willing to do that you don't think they're willing to kill a few thousand here and there or Hitler of course they are and forget about the few thousand that died during 9/11 the million people that died in Iraq are human beings they're just as legitimate as the people who died the Twin Towers I mean it's all completely ridiculous someone says can we change topic to something fun Allah be praised as his name somebody sing please look up the definition of literally you know you might get gainin use that word too much and you don't know what it means oh what's it what's that the literal translation I know you know I was talking to somebody recently who has a Joe Rogan UFC drinking game where God gets rocked no but he pre watched it I forgot what said he he he pre Rox watched it and then bet his friends BJ Penn SpiderMonkey Lakes this is a Turner monkey lives that's kind of a weird random I don't know if you've ever said I might've said we know when you do a hundred yeah yeah I might you up said that one day and forgot I said it he doesn't listen this guy there's no such thing as a legit conspiracy theory okay smart man like you fucking know how funnier people there's no such thing as real conspiracy theory of course there are stupid look up the Gulf of Tonkin the Gulf of Tonkin incident is a real conspiracy theory where the government really did lie and say that there was an attack on American citizens and that's what got us into the Vietnam War look up the look up the North Woods document the North Woods document is a real conspiracy that the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted up and signed and then it was vetoed by Kennedy and what it was was basically they were trying to get people enthusiastic about a war with Cuba and they were gonna plan a on American civilians they were gonna blow up an airliner and blame it on Cuba and say that Americans were on board they were gonna attack ships they were gonna attack Guantanamo Bay they were gonna throw mortars in today at Guantanamo Bay and they were ready for US casualties which meant they were willing to kill Americans in order to get us to go to war with Cuba these are real they look up how about fucking cigarettes you want to be a conspiracy theory how can politicians all want to talk about drugs and we need to keep drugs out of schools drugs in this country can't even fucking come close to the death and destruction the health problems that cigarettes have caused but yet you don't hear a fucking peep out of those guys about cigarettes cigarettes kill 400,000 people a year in this country alone every fucking year that's a real legit conspiracy where no one is talking about it and the reason why they're not talking about is because tobacco companies financed campaigns of politicians those are conspiracies what a conspiracy is if someone conspires to do something there's hundreds of legit conspiracies look up the iran-contra affair look up the fact that Oliver North and all those guys were involved in doing illegal shit in order to help they bring it Cole I just watching where they bring cocaine into into the u.s. well that's the that's the accusation and there's a bunch of books that have been written right on CIA agents who've said that there's a guy named Gary Webb who's got a bunch of shit on that and there was a dude named Barry seal who actually was bringing in cocaine from other countries got caught and what he was about to go to trial was murdered and that was to go they bringing coke from those like Afghanistan type countries to help support them to fight the Russian yeah and here's another one is you know people say oh man the CIA is good they helped us and sure some CIA I'm sure do that but the CIA one of them one of the planes that's been to Guantanamo Bay crashed last year in Mexico with four tons of cocaine I'm gonna put up that link yeah and it didn't even fucking make the news man it would make Reuters and it didn't it didn't make any of the the big news programs I'll put up that link for you guys but this is a fucking CIA plane like Rupert with the LA cop that busted a yeah yeah that is special on HBO some the to cuz there are two black dudes that were the ones it all funneled through yeah the bottom line about human beings though is that people are so lack of days ago when it comes to shed it just so they you know you could that stuff could be on the news and people would care more about John Kate you know yeah John has to pay ten thousand dollars a month in child support alimony how's it gonna do it and that would be big news whereas people wouldn't give a fuck about you know the CIA selling drugs they would all you have to do is have one person on television say it's bullshit and that's all the I mean that's all you need to get ninety percent of people to believe it and a lot of those shows and a lot of the news ones that's there's people that's what they do for a living they say they can put their name in a database to be an expert about whatever and then CNN or Fox ago we need a guy that knows about and then you're the expert on drug attention well that could prove that they've proven that oil companies have hired scientists to dispute the fact that human beings have created global warming you know who the fuck knows whether or not they're right or wrong when it comes to mobile warming and most people that argue it they argue it from the point of being a conservative or being a liberal liberals always say we have to stop and conservatives say there's no connection and that's just because they're a bunch of fucking parents they here you know all these different people Rush Limbaugh or whoever on the radio saying that there's no connection that you're these silly liberals and they just repeat the same dumb shit and conservatives do that and then liberals they see that fuckin Al Gore cocksucker and they go war so that meanwhile Wars made a billion dollars off of this fucking Climategate if you look at like what Al Gore has made the money that Al Gore's made since then Inconvenient Truth came out it's fuckin staggering he's made an incredible amount of money off of this and the the people that would benefit from all these carbon taxes I mean they're setting this up to make money and that's what they're doing no one's doing this there's I'm sure there's a few scientists that are doing with the right intentions but most of the politicians that are pushing this they have ulterior motives and they're trying to make money off of this shit hey Joe Rogan did you hear Johnny Bananas 21 at gmail.com says did you hear that the Y chromosome is evolving faster than the X chromosome that's because we're men bitch Johnny Bananas were the only ones with the Y the women don't get the Y the Y is the future I just saw saw a documentary about that that males are disappearing with because of all the chemicals yeah for the debt that's why guys act more girlish now if you look at well that's a tie remember there's a surplus of men there's the when there's a server when there's a surplus of men rather men act more aggressive and grow more facial hair and become more masculine and have more testosterone when there's a surplus of women men tend to relax and they tend to be more feminine and they tend to shave more and be more metrosexual yeah this one was about that the other chemicals that probably our parents or our parents parents did in the 60s all the plastics and all that kind of stuff where they said wasn't bad for you now they realized it is and for some reason that those chemicals affect men more like to finally these alligators that live by let's say Dow and in the in the swamps at smaller balls then the alligators you know generations earlier that all those chemicals were shrinking the alligator balls I don't know what job you have it that's your guy that you know one guy goes I'm gonna measure it alligator balls yeah and I'm gonna measure it and we might need this data later but that's what that's what they say is just some other chemicals and stuff that men are acting less like men and producing more sperm I think in that more sperm less the gorillas no less perm like so young guys now have less sperm than their dad probably have which it should be well then the internet you know we're getting rid of more sperm in our dads it's very much more difficult for your dad to be as thyself about masturbation because they used to have to set up a projector that pull the shades down pull the screen run a little 16 millimeter or some black widows lean or go s molestation nowadays to I wonder what the odds are well it actually goes or less dinner everything's down I don't think it's down you don't know me or go even back further than that that was guys had to put up the projector but even go the guys before that had to paint stuff on walls and caves and then you know there's wings what Apple now there's way more people now so there's way more molestation but per capita yeah I'm wonder I wonder well you know that Jap that ought to believe the Japanese believe that if you show all that shit you show rape and molestation and crazy sex you know like that's why there's schoolgirls on that shit they feel like that it gets it out of your system that if you watch like violence in video and movie form that somehow or another it gets it out of your system why do they blur all their porn now the only blur the pubes you see pussy or you do not know the burner that's all that bad witness free little man but if you squint like in the old days in the news I'm squint you can see this magic and I find myself like squinting going there's other porn that I could be watching that's way more like that old old-school kind of French kind of European porn yeah do you remember when you when you're the old days when you would go on the road and you go to hotel rooms and the dirty movies would be scrambled yeah but they would all I'd be like Wiggly yeah if you don't mind through oh and you'd see like a Ted we go to mouth and you'd have enough to jerk off to you used to be able to those used to be able to get like a three or four minute preview yeah to see if you want it so you'd have turned and gone yeah you hit the second preview I was proud of myself I would get hard and then as the preview was going out be done 15 seconds or so weird with the VHS like if you borrow porn from somebody you could see like what their thing was cuz we put it in a hit play would ever seen you know that that he just had stopped after they were done do you like really that's the thing did someone have a bit about that Chris Rock had a bit about that about you know how he went turned out one of his porns and he had left it a certain scene but then because of the VHS tape when he went to it the next time it was a different scene it's like that way yeah I remember I remember renting VCRs this is like we're 18 I went VCRs and then leave it in there when you take it back or something or you drip off with a I remember I'm like birthday parties my mom would go to the library and rent a movie projectors to show like movies that birthday party yeah do you think the CIA had a hand in Gary webs death I don't know the the story behind yes Gary Webb died so I tablets gonna be announced next week supposedly by Apple and they don't know what the name is it's like I slate or iPad and I'm sitting in bed at like 4:00 in the morning and I'm like thinking what could it be called and I'm thinking why wouldn't they called like I tagged what if they call it I tap it sound like I go online if I I tap TV just in case you know I'm addicted to domain names I've got I've got like eight trillion that I would like never use for any really you have a lot what some of them that you own I've owned let's see this is back in lol days like because I never take lol well stop stop stop this Gary Webb guide they're asking that they were talking about that the whole dropped all the stuff about the CIA and the the Contras and everything committed suicide according to the coroner shot himself in the face twice that was the guy that said all the the the cocaine guy credible sources good yeah yeah this is the this is the guard that that was releasing all the information about the CIA selling cocaine yeah all right hold on I'll copy this no paste it for you guys that wasn't interesting cuz when iran-contra stuff was going on I think I was like you know 11 or 12 you know in there yes I had a Oliver North for president t-shirt yeah they didn't even that's interesting then shot himself in the fucking thanks twice that's hardcore ooh ouch mmm who knows anyway we talking about the I tablet know our addiction addiction names like what with some domain names that you could you buy cuz I I'll think of something usually we're gonna really stoned and I got like did you buy John Heffron sucks John that funds a fag John everyone's a loser and shut up sure or scam John Heffron scam because you always see those at the first whatever the whatever you're looking you always see the word scam at the top and then when you click on whatever it is it just pro whatever you're looking because I think naturally if you're looking to buy something yeah you see the scam you're like well I'll go to the negative first Oh some dude says Doug Stanhope spit about his mom with the porno that makes that makes us like oh well there's a company called ripoff report and this is like I don't know how this is legal at all if somebody's mad at your company or something like that they can put something on there and what this company does is it uses spam techniques where it spammed like message boards and all the shit all day long so Google puts it on the top of your list so my friend has a fashion company that does like dresses and stuff like that and the first thing that comes up when you google is ripoff report this person's ripping you off and blah blah blah in the show are my friends like how I get rid of this kid they're like well if you give us $2,000 we'll take it off it's like what yeah that seems a hold on a second so the company that it reports on people for scams they're basically just extorting people yes it's called ripoff report and then in a funny thing is you receive them and they'll take your name off of it holy sháá Ripoff Report calm and it seems like it's a legit company so if you have a problem with you know like somebody's business or something like that you can say you can write a letter like this person ripped me off and stuff like that that's extortion I was gonna explosion and if you go online there's a lot of people suing this company there's about 12 different lawsuits going on for this company right now but she's been trying everything to get this shit off like she's she was on TV the other day doesn't matter still first thing you google her name it comes up is what is her name haha Michele Wendell mich e ll e Wendell w e it's somebody like that I don't know how successful but either ways people like you don't have ripoff report Wow don't have the money to go after her to go after them you know me that that's pretty expect I'm in I was going to sue a company recently and it was just it ended up being just so much money yeah that you had to go well do I want to use that just to say that I'm right or do you just save you know both of those people or ex-employees to that wrote those things really she fired yeah it seems like there'd be some kind of like libel or something yeah well they're getting sued okay but the whole thing that's weird about it is is that it's like Irish the fear just showed up ladies and gentlemen that crazy Jew we did if we call him and tell him to come here I have a special guest my special guest this week is John Heffron it's not Ari Shaffir Ari Shaffir Kane because probably he knows I got the best weed hey let's talk about Ari's latest Twitter what's his last word I've had a lot of people ask me how many percentages of artists Twitter's are have to do with or now he's gonna say a shitty of some type of something leaving along his bone hall yeah you talked about someone says I'm disappointed that you're not getting high the reason why we're not getting high was because up until a few moments ago my little baby was in the house and my mommy and the baby and we're in the the media room right now and there's no ventilation up in this bitch hi Ari's down here with a shotgun in his mouth no she's coming yes alright so John were you at next were you at this weekend I'm uh nowhere this week you're next no and then I'm in the following weeks sorry have you fucking around deleting your MySpace I'm actually to the point where I believe my I still put up blogs I still will take a blog whenever I put up a log up I'll throw it nine out of ten times I'll throw it up on MySpace as well just because I think more people I liked you more will read it yeah I liked the myspace because it has the date and you don't have to be a fan to actually see the date so you don't have to be a fantasy today so you see there's two different things Facebook's really confusing there's a fan page I have a fan page there's something else it you don't have to be a fan to to see the dates oh really yeah it's what's the - it's a fan page and a group and group it's so annoying Facebook so annoying with this big group anyway you don't maybe the death of Facebook by the way is I don't want anymore pillows sent to me I don't want any eternal that I don't see any of that you turn off any kind of that pillows or blessings I appreciate that how do you it's in your settings yeah like there's this pillow fight so you'll go to your thing and there'll be like 50 people hit you with pillows I'm gonna find the dude who invented glitter tags yeah just I don't want anybody putting it's my wall who would have ever thought that that would be popular ah have you been to the mall hey let me get your iPhone or people that can tag you like I'll get comics Ted I'll have like their video on YouTube you can know tag me all yours and then suddenly their video of them on stage is on my it's my it's like my property that's my grass stay off my grass means you're talking about this other day we have a friend that doesn't one you know people just he's very private but if somebody just posted a photo of them and now every single person that that person's Frenchman's can see like you know oh yeah right right to that photo yeah he's private yeah yeah Facebook's a mess yeah the security settings I'm sketchy and there was a dude who was a former Facebook employee that was talking about it you know divulging all the information about how they do things and well you know that's how they're doing a lot of people are seeing a lot of people's identity is to go you and I'll get enough information from your site just in general that I that I can then use that to piece mail well how about this there's a photo a bunch of dudes are getting scammed this is very common where guys are pretending to be chicks and their pretend to be chicks online and some dude was posing as a Maxum model and scammed $15,000 out of some doctor in Florida same pictures Photoshop naked pictures and and apparently this dude had a girls voice like a really feminine voice I'll put up the link for you guys but it's fascinating how fucking gullible dudes are like how the fuck do you not know did you put up the link to somebody want you to know about that what you're talking about earlier with the mice no I didn't put up the milestone inhibiting I'll put it oh I'm gonna put up this we put a John Heather and Twitter up there though right keep any followers John Heffron follow John her thousand followers finally I try to keep mine too I go in spurts away Twitter sometimes I wanted Twitter three in a row but then I then I'll feel bad and then won't do any for like a day or two yeah naira but then I realize everybody's following a lot of people so it's not that annoying right it's weird how like it's so different like MySpace I had no problem getting friends you know like on or whatever but but Twitter people are a little bit more picky because they have to read your shit every day so do you it's different how like Twitter like some people are huge on Twitter you know you wouldn't think there they are like Twitter makes no sense to me big numbers why you know like ass enclosure is the most popular where's the magazine's if he goes on CNN and these talks about his Twitter on CNN yeah well so it is Larry King every day but he's not even a quarter that Kings a fucking dinosaur nobody gives a shit about Larry King the young people with Twitter don't give a fuck about Larry King but they certainly give a fuck about ask two Kutcher that handsome devil yeah with his elderly wife they love that dude I wonder how long he's gonna keep her cuz Ashton's only like fucking 27 years old right isn't he he's a penis dirt he's not 30 okay let's say he's 35 okay then she's 47 at 20 years 45 she's gonna be 57 who does a tough sell well I think it's good yeah I've got to go 20 years backwards he hangs out with Bruce close yeah like all the time they're doing the video let's enjoy later is again sort of Isis yeah I think maybe Bruce Wells takes a Jamie's or no that's nice weird I don't want to hang around with some dude who made babies with my wife yeah was fucking her like every night sleeping in bed with her and cuddling with but you know what I'm not that open-minded maybe Ashton's really open mind or maybe it's just like okay awesome I'm in with the whole crowd this is so cool we hang out party meanwhile Bruce is like go get me a beer oh your fear actually accidents that occur in Bruce nowadays how dare are you dare you with those terrible movies he makes how dare you say that no I'm not can you peek I'm not saying shut your mouth boys but like how many shows is Ashton fucking producing right now that dude something he produced the shirt I did get over my head he's gotta do stuff 20 things and they all suck every single one of them still make Bruce Willis is Bruce fucking Willy how many how many have you seen the butterfly effect how many people have asking cuz you're saved in a movie good good point say I've never watched I know but I'm trying the butterfly on awesome comedy have you seen that yeah you know it's awesome unintentional comedy Bruce what action flakes okay all the diehards you know how many people has actually cuz you killed him how about was that movie the monkey movie 18 monkeys that's right yeah he probably lost or died on the way over here it's cheap ass carpenters pretty selfish as far as movies who say he didn't save the world anybody do you have a video that we can play while we go for a weed break there's the video work don't lose it yeah yeah it's just I wasn't set up for that look what can you play that while we go do a weed break I'm gonna pick up Ari and we're gonna go smoke some weed and the show will be infinitely funnier in five minutes let's a global thermal master course only 31 years old Shazam these bitches know what turned everything how often do I get pwned PW how do you say pwned in real life I said oh and so I want to know how often how often it topped I get tabs at least every month at least once a month last month I got tapped one to three times I got tapped three times last month and that was because moving back to LA from Colorado I wasn't I was out of shape I wasn't training that much and you know you roll with good guys to get tapped especially you're tired when you roll like after the first guy your first guy you know you drill the way we do at a 10th planet is you drill for the first half hour 40 minutes and that gets you tired but you know you still have good energy but then the first role you have full energy you know the first role you feel great but if you roll with a tough guy and everybody a 10th planet I mean you're rolling with brown belts and purple belts all those dudes are tough all those dudes are capable of tapping you in out and then it's a matter of how much endurance you have because if you you know you put yourself in bad positions you know especially if you're pulling guard all the time cuz I'm trying to work on my bottom game know try to work on my guard and if you do you get tapped I get tapped shit I get tapped all the time once a month if you don't if you don't get tapped you either not rolling with good people or you're not trying you're not opening yourself up if you don't open your game up you don't improve you got a you got up first of all if I just wanted to get on top all the time and always hold position and not take any chances you could go a year without getting tapped but if you're gonna learn and you want to develop your game you have you can't worry about being tapped when you get tapped you got to go okay that's one more way that I won't get tell my friend Scott got me in this crazy armbar from inside my guard I was I had him in my guard and he got me in an armbar that's never happened before it's some crazy thing where as you scoop under the leg to try to toss the guy and get him an armbar he has this way of locking your arm with his leg and they pulls on it it's a real dangerous felling my elbow was gonna go and I was like you motherfucker I'm like magic and then I had him show it to me but now I will he tried to do it again the day before yesterday and he couldn't get me in it but it's just because he got me in it hey you got in did you let yourself in okay housekeeper chef propyl should be over Ari Shaffir ladies and gentlemen with Lola hug no all right you got a video yeah looking

kid just relaxes it calmed him down yeah you gonna go fullscreen with that bitch yeah which we're still trying to iron out programming like clunky we need to get good programs yeah we're trying to which all right houston mars-1 Mastiffs he's real smart we'll bring him in after the break I get a breakfast I've said that up again yeah we gotta time the bases push time the patient pills me back watch excuse one issue in particular should children take it to share Calvin here with an incredible story about one family's fight for their son sheriff that's right Micah and Victoria when you say that it sounds so shocking to so many but California's Prop 215 The Compassionate Use Act was passed by voters a decade ago and it does allow seriously ill patients with a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana legally but what about for children we did find this one family where the truly remarkable tale to tell us in this KTLA exclusive report this is Sam a 10 year old who lives with his dad his mom and his sister Lucy in Northern California sam has autism from age two till eight Sam's disorder made him violent and aggressive his parents Steve and Angela were truly living a nightmare every day he got her for where he was hurting other children at school and in public places last times would be stay in line at a store and he would just instantly just bolt off and go and hit another child in the face one time he told the teen again knocked over all the furniture I mean and I got and I had to put him in a hold for maybe an hour I mean just where his whole body was spasming it was just now just lay there crying holding Sam's parents worked with expert doctors who recommended a succession of conventional prescription medications like risperdal and a host of others but Sam just gained 20 pounds and became harder to handle he's getting more dangerous he's getting bigger and stronger now these 20 pounds bigger from the respirator the child that we had to love was it was just like when you looked at it when you talked to him he had just disappeared finally at their wit's end and faced with a very real prospect of needing to institutionalize their son Sam's parents decided to try something unconventional and controversial last year they began treating Sam with medical marijuana so this is the medicine right here Steve and Angela got a recommendation from a medical cannabis doctor they told Sam's pediatrician about their plan and Steve grew Sam's new medicine in their backyard we had six plants here this is where Steve took out his tomato plants to grow and then harvest the cannabis from the marijuana flowers he could make a concentrated form what people refer to as hash this ball represents roughly four months of doses for Sam later Steve softens the cannabis with heat then takes what appears to be just a speck of pot Sam's jokes for the day what effects it the medical cannabis Sam well the first time we did it we just wanted to do to see if it would work at all and it was just an amazing experience the man I'll never forget it to watch what happened to off gave us just like wow he's back this ain't bush and this pent-up rage and this you know obsessiveness it's just like it just went away just like it just calmed him down while we were with the family we watched Steve put Sam's daily jokes and a piece of melon and take it to him within roughly 20 minutes the effects were clear where earlier Sam had been animated and antsy after eating his speck of hash Sam became calm relaxed and social as a mother how would you feel about people saying to you that you're getting your sons stoned every day at first I was very concerned about that but recently I've been sharing the story with more and more people you know friends and co-workers and I find that you're the more I tell people that wanna share with people the more comfortable I am with it it has saved our lives and I think about what it's done for our son could stand story how others respected LA area pediatrician Christopher told sure says we don't know enough about cannabis for kids for all the parents out there those children may have autism I think the message here is that this is intriguing that these more research before we can confidently say that marijuana is a safe and effective treatment but for this California Family Medical Marijuana has literally been an answer to their prayers and a homecoming for their son it was just an indication that we saw that gave us the results that we were always hoping I mean I think that really is he was smiling it was so sad it just feels like I have more control to help my son instead of depending on doctors they don't know what Sammis I want to do what's best for my son you know I'll do whatever I can for him well one important notes Sam's parents tell us that they have followed the letter of the law regarding his medication and that they've grown only the amount of marijuana that prop 215 allows the medication is for Sam and for nobody else now share does he does he take this medication every single day you know they they started off at 7 o'clock in the morning he would take it then they would give him a second dose in the afternoon but after two years he started this at 8 he's now 10 they sometimes don't have to give it to him and only give it to him as needed which is incredible it really has changed his behavior according to thousands Wow all right sure terrific story thank you for the report thank you man for more on Sam's story information on treating children with autism go to our website ktla.com I want to party with that kid yeah he's so silly about his take on marijuana what the fight medical marijuana people that want medical marijuana he thinks they're silly and they're ruining America and he thinks that all drugs are bad that the one state of mind a state of mind that you're currently in is the only one it shouldn't be drunk you shouldn't be high shouldn't be drugged up he does not get it that is not true there are drugs that are terrible for you the ones you see on his show the crystal meth the fucking heroin and oxycontin those are all fucking horrible for you that's a guarantee but so it's all too well for some people it's not as he said I don't know you have to ask him but what he says about marijuana is ridiculous cuz he loves marijuana in with like heroin because my mom does she put all drugs there's so much proof that it's not addictive and it's like my argument about it is like anything can be addictive you can get addicted to cheeseburgers if you're fucking retard you could be one of those dudes who gets addicted to washing his hands you know people become competitive assertion it complies my perfect people get addicted to things around it's what we do it doesn't mean you shouldn't have the things that other people are telling you they benefit from it that's what's fucking stupid about this whole marijuana thing there's no heroin activists there's no you know there's no crystal meth activist who's like you've got to get on crystal matter but people keep telling you that weed has enhanced their lives and helped it with you think and made them a better person and that fuck doesn't want to believe that dude in the in that article you know what was that commerce market magazine watching Fortune magazine yeah the one dude was in the Kate the first like six people case study he said he's never gotten high a pot but he smokes it constantly all day long all it helps is with this like arthritis or whatever it is well we say no barbecued if you keep going yeah if you if you
