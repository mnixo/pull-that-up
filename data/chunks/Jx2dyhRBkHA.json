job at the post office he does that know what I'm did supposed office a good job man this ain't any sort of government job like that there's a lot of benefits to it stuff to get fired it's on the way out there right you know what I think I think that we're gonna have 3d printers and we're gonna be able to make things in our homes I think they're gonna be shipping raw materials to us that's what I think it's gonna happen I think we're gonna have like raw materials in our house and we're gonna download the instructions or the the code or whatever the the bin file that's gonna lead to like a computer and you're gonna print up a computer in your house that's what I think I think they're gonna have the new code you're gonna get the new code you mean eventually what would be amazing if they could ever figure this out I know they've considered this is recycling your old computer taking the raw minerals out of it reprocessing and using it to make a new computer like that they're going to get to a point where they can extract minerals from from used up electronics and like recycle them absolutely completely like in everyone at home you know that's what I think the future is so you

a corporation while drunk yeah that's pretty sweet that's legendary that's a legend shit it's done through Legal Zoom and looking I wouldn't recommend that oh that's not a story like this is this is how I this is how I approach operated so you could hire the girl who was in contact with this person from Legal Zoom they know what I was comparing it to is how easy it was like when it this other thing I did when I was drunk where I had flown somebody out that I barely knew from a different country to stay with me for seven days a couple weeks ago it was just like that where the next morning I didn't I woke up and I was like holy cow I did all this wow that was easy I guess and you know what's though they send they send you this really nice like book and you have like a stamp with your your corporation name on it you know for I guess doing paperwork what you're supposed to do we have the corporation and things like that yeah you have like all this good stuff that you're suppose I mean

legalzoom.com so go and go fuck yourself how about that well sobriety by audit com that's onn i t we have the new guerrilla kettlebell that's coming out any day now if you go to on it dot-com this is ridiculous ford slash apps ford slash guerrilla yeah no one could make that any easier they have like there's a a package like you can win a an on it primal bail i don't know how you win but you can enter and i guess we've given one it's theirs they're super badass looking these guerrilla ones i can't wait until they come out it's a 72 pound one and it looks like you see a there this angry face gorilla yeah it's in my twitter somewhere but uh that's the the second in the line of primal bells they're kettle bells designed like evil fucking primates visit chimpanzee and a gorilla one the gorillas one is so badass because the chimpanzee I always thinking the chimpanzee has the face that a chimp makes when it's biting your dick off that's this but this this gorilla this is the face that a gorilla makes when it's hovering over you and it's about to take your soul that's what it looks like the gorilla is amazing the guy who did the artwork for the grill it's so badass and I seriously I look at these things I like a workout with the chimpanzee when I actually imagine a chimp trying to kill me and it gives me I got extra rush you know we were gonna go find the man sighs Jim yeah fuck that dude good luck with all that shit yeah good good luck I would never go near those fucking things they're just so gangster they're smart and they're strong as fuck and if they decide to go after you you got like a real problem you can't fight off a chimp they're smart they like bite your fingers off first we wrote a baboon I wouldn't fight those either you don't want everything yeah I just think I think we are so ridiculously weak the human animal like even a strongest amongst us though the most badass football player of all time is so incredibly weak compared to a real prime who would win between Ray Lewis and a baboon haha a baboon maybe Ray Lewis could like hurt it real bad break a leg slamming on the ground or something but what if he gets bit my neck you know if it just locks onto his neck and puts his legs around his fucking shoulders and starts sucking his blood whoo I don't know man I don't know right I don't know how you fare there yeah I think humans are just weakest fuck I think even when you see a guy like Ray Lewis who's unbelievably strong for a person like between a person like my size and a person his size he's not even a same human like he can do things to people you've seen that guy rag doll giant men just wagged all them with ferocity a chimp would eat his ass it would hold him down and eat his ass there would be no way to stop it if a gorilla decided to fuck him it would fuck him until he starved to death it would just hold him by the neck and just girls have little tiny dicks don't have like one inch Dex they're wrong they don't have to have big dicks cuz they dominate it doesn't matter to them it feels good no matter what size the small ones don't get bitten is easy isn't it isn't the gorilla the one where the alpha gorilla gets to have sex with although yes female gir and everybody else is trying to kill him yes yeah their their appearance is entirely for protecting themselves against other gorillas and I guess other you know other like predators but like they have these giant fangs but the grass they like they've broccoli and shit you know and they have like a huge arm all the ridiculously strong like they're they're hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fury why do they freak you out cuz I don't think we could even imagine the horsepower that something like that could generate if it was coming after you I think I think it's if it didn't exist okay I think the problem with chimps and gorillas is that it exists and that they've always existed so we look at him we go yep there's a champ that's a gorilla if that if you didn't know that was real okay and there was this black hairy thing that's sort of like a person but not really and is obviously aware that it's locked in a cage and it's fucking huge it's like 600 pounds of muscle and it's looking at you and if it got ahold of you do tear you apart like tissue paper you couldn't do anything no you have no options you have zero option what would you play dead would you kill you let it kill you would you run you try to come up with a stick or a rock that you throw into its I or something if you get really lucky you could hurt it and scare it off enough so you can run away if you get really lucky but if you don't if you throw that rock and it hits him and bounces off like it's been at a styrofoam but like you know with a bear you're supposed to play dead or yeah you know the shark is Weist what are you supposed to do with a gorilla what's supposed to stand your ground supposed to stay on the ground yeah I don't think you're supposed to make eye contact but you're supposed to stand your ground so that when when they make a bluff charge which they always do you can't respond if you respond if you back up you are fucked just keeps coming they'll just smash you if you if you respond they'll smash oh but they if they run up to you and you can handle it apparently they don't want a fight they just want you to get the fuck away from them like most of time gorillas aren't looking to fight people they're just like bitch you better get the fuck away from here and then they'll charge up to you we'll look bitch I'm not fucking serious you gotta just get the fuck out of there nice and slow and but don't don't run don't run and stand your ground it's a terrifying prospect if it happens next time in Africa I'm gonna go I hope Rogan is right yeah I hope I'm right I'm like standing there he's still coming he's still coming Joe why'd you joy really wanna run you want bitch we scared of me yeah um they're just fucking they freaked me out primates primates freaked me out they offered ya a monkey killed the dude in India last year mmm cuz I've met like a mayor or some town and a monkey killed I'm a bunch of monkeys they jumped him fuck this dude up monkeys kill people man fucking terrifying anyway on accom oh and an IT check out the new gorilla a kettlebell which comes out very soon and we got all kinds of shit to this news report of this lady that this is this going on around the Internet of what to do if a bear comes know the funniest should ever listen to this don't run away oh she's acting don't make eye contact this is not gonna whirring flat I wouldn't throw away I think you shouldn't lay flat would you have to curl up in a fetal position and put your hands over the back your head what you really got to worry about is I'm severing arteries then biting into your neck you got to put your hands over the back your neck but good luck bitch that's a 900-pound dog 911 wild dog that kills moose we had a bitchface attack one of our crews once Alaskan the high mo refuge I loved that story hold on let's uh cue the music man let's begin the official podcast is that's one of my favorite stories the Joe Rogan experience that special that you guys did the Arctic adventure hein Moe's or adventure yeah that was the first thing that I found that's how I found out about you guys I watched that I watched it twice in a row cuz uh it was so fascinating first of all that there's this guy who was not a dumb guy no he was a smart guy and he was very like very articulate and really passionate about the way he was living his life in this really harmonious way hunting and gathering in the motor yeah with a log Shack and his wife and I believe at the time he was the most romantic person on earth that's why we did it it's incredible it's a such a fascinating thing this guy had never seen the Towers fall yeah I mean most iconic shit in the history of this country and he had never seen that he had just heard of it I mean he was so remote and so self-reliant and it was oddly fascinating really fascinating so and the being so heartbreaking toon who's talking about losing his child the the the canoe tipped over and they lost their baby I mean dude it was oh my god it was so so heartbreaking but it's so fast it's really fast it's like into the wild if the guy wasn't an idiot yes like if the guy actually knew what he was doing I think that into the wild guy I mean I I need to really look at the story better because all I know is the movie I saw the movie and I believe that the movie doesn't represent the truth for whatever reason they decided to make it out that he'd eaten some poison but it wasn't really poised and he just starved to death right I didn't know what he was doing yeah well I think that's a shitty thing to do yeah I think that's a shitty thing to do to make a movie and put this artificial ending to semi historical event I mean he's he's like a sort of a poetic figure mm-hmm this guy who just goes off into the woods and you know becomes this you should know maybe a bit more about it I mean nobody should how about know something about it he'd know anything they were I was like he can just live in the middle of nowhere yeah and and just live well it never gets warm first of all it doesn't need he doesn't need a refrigerator yeah oh yeah he's hanging this caribou on the sticks outside of his house when the scene is so crazy because this dude has always food hanging from frozen slabs on these trees and then bears come around and he has to kill the bear I mean it is fucking bananas well what was interesting about that is the bear was tracking the team so they left to go shooting you know and the bear was tracking them it was hunting them hands and so everyone was was aware of it and then homo goes oh yeah by the way we're being tracked like he was totally knew it he understood any of us and if if the bear comes in comes tonight it's gonna come tonight and if it does then we have to shoot it because otherwise it's gonna get us she's so so sadly they they had to shoot him sadly my ass that's a fucking giant monster who wants to eat people I fucking get crazy when people go you know it's really fucked up those people shouldn't have been there in the first place but they were okay but they were team people okay but they were right a guy had of course he had to shoot that fucking bear yeah what are you just gonna move I'm gonna move now well I mean and he lives there and and it was actually tracking him because I guess it you know got some of the meat from before but yeah we they they brought it back it's in our office the head no the skin the body the time won't they taxidermy oh yeah they have to when you shoot one don't you have to process the skull in some way don't you have to like send it to the Fish and Game no idea I think that was like one of the things that was said was it's when when you shoot a bear and I should get my shit straight on this but I think there's something along those lines of defense you have to send the skull somewhere close I thought I know how to do that deal with that wasn't there one of wasn't that part of it maybe I'm confusing my bear things I've always been fascinated by the we went to now I don't know if you saw but we went to another now the most remote person on earth is this they live in Siberia in the mountains and they were like Russian Orthodox during the revolution and they took off during the revolution and they're still there well there's one now she's like 85 she was the youngest and she lives there in the middle of nowhere on this mountain in like this crazy sod place with my and they didn't have shoes I'm like how do you how do your feet not freeze that's incredible yeah oh my god they don't have shoes yeah how cold is it fucking go home no sure yeah no frostbite I gotta I gotta watch it again but there was they were it was going on about no shoes now they have shoes and now they have like they wrap their shit in furs and stuff when they first went there they didn't have shoes shoes they must have wrapped it in something or maybe they stayed in during the one that is so fucking crazy huh barefoot in Siberia yeah you can google it it's a totally insane story that was like five of them living on this mountain in the middle of nowhere with nothing they had nothing that's zero that's insane so they're like they're almost like like just super evolved monkeys like well it's interesting because I was like if you actually take away everything like there's no matches like you know you maybe you had matches the first five years of the first year the first five hours but like 80 years later there's no they don't have matches you don't have you know glass you don't have you have anything so to go back to really primal like we have nothing shit but you know that there's another world out there it's not like oh I don't know anything like the date the one they went it was like the 20s or 30s so they had like cars and shit wings wow so how do they get by how are they cooking their food well the first it was like the first decade they were just eating like roots and they were starving in the winter and they couldn't get berries and then by the end they you know they were like 65 and just running through the forest like catching like animals by hand and stuff and you're like 65 years old I mean they were sort of super cut and tough but they got seen animals by hand yeah well they had snares and they would run them into like you know traps and stuff but odd but then they were really religious but then there was some weird sex shit that was going down course going on down there yeah if you leave a bunch of people by themselves they fucking each other and very weird way yeah once they realized no one's looking once he realized that there's no one else but them how many people were that we're up there it wasn't a lot it was like it was a family and they had like two or three girls I believe and then there was the parents and then like Uncle Peter wanted to lie with Jim chefs care oh my god you know Jesus Christ yeah if you only have a small group like that it's gonna be a mess gets it gets it gets Lord of the Flies quick yeah what is it about humans it's so disappointing like consistently pretty interesting if you strip away like cops and artifice yeah you know modernity and technology we just go it quickly quickly we go apeshit really quickly yeah yeah I don't know I I just as I get older especially the the broad spectrum of our ability whether it's to be just utter complete cunt merciless killer Genghis Khan style it's like super nice philanthropist person yeah it's like the broad spectrum of whatever capable of yeah it's it hurts your brain because it's so there's there's so much conflict going on there's so much weirdness and the potentials for human behavior and what it's all based on like the the principles of thinking and the the feeling of camaraderie you're supposed to have with your community and extending that to people that you haven't met before and don't disregard them because the numbers are so high that you're you're overwhelmed with people that you say you lose a sense of community I was reading this book and I and I saw a word that I didn't know so I googled it they're like it's this Empire just before the Byzantine Empire and and then I just sort of went down the Wikipedia page and they're like and it's this Empire and then this Emperor killed this Emperor and then took his wife and then they married somebody else in another Empire to save it but then they ended up you know going and you're reading going this is fuckin Game of Thrones like they were just they were just kingdoms all fully killing each other trying to marry and then still have a kid and then the kid would come up and slaughter the person who slaughtered his dad oh my god and it was just like but and and the the way that they killed them the way that they do and it's fascinating cuz like oh that's human history we just went after each other like continually you know for thousands of years until we've decided this a weird thing that we have with extreme levels of competition - you know I was watching some rug me the other day I'd never seen rugby before I mean I've seen it I've seen like you know a guy has a ball and you got running I didn't know what the fucking rules were I have no idea sorry I hit fuel TV the other day I've never seen it before it also dumb watch this Savage fucking game like first of all it's so aggressive like they don't rest like in football there's all this rafting going on rugby there's you know yes if you like it's just like that ball goes down then something's happening I don't see on the rules I don't know what the fuck's going on but I just know some dudes are colliding into some dudes and they're wrestling over shit and it gets pretty fucking Savage the only sport I think that's heavier well there's two is Australian rules football yes the fucking meter they literally kick each other like they'll jazz and and then what the garlic like hurling like you know Gaelic yes so when they have sticks my wife I didn't even know about that shit until dawn my rare in school beyond it that stuff is crazy with that that axe handle that they're carrying around a whipping that shit with yeah what a fucking nutty game man we have this need for for that extreme release and I think that's what what sports are trying to do with things like you know mimics battle mimic it does it mimics battle mimics war and it alleviates the need to engage in those activities you can vicariously engage in explosive athletic aggressive activities without getting your body destroyed without having to go to war without having to harm people around you and being a constant state of war yeah it's almost like we figured out a way to sort of calm the monkey down a little bit give the little monkey said well fake violence what's the quote business is the modern form of our modern our farm formal warfare that is it's just bit like going after each other like we're gonna get them Coke Pepsi now you know and you're you know all these generals getting their troops lined up supports like the training wheels of enlightenment really because they're allowing people to go through the need for war and conquest without actually going having to do it yeah we still cross the line we still little war the word they're really with the weird conflict that comes out of sports is when sports fans fight because they like opposite teams Jesus Christ boys really yeah you're fighting cuz this guy likes the red team what are you in are you in the crapshoot in the Bloods football oh my god if you ever want to read an amazing book it's called among the thugs and it's this literary editor who goes and lives among the the Manchester United Football firm and they go around and just crap and they have like just crazy for like crazy fighting techniques and stuff and they you know then they'll go like oh we fly into you ventus you know and there's 85,000 italian fans oh my god i'm 5,000 of us and we're like okay let's go let's have them and you're like you guys are fucking nuts that is insane 5000 dudes try to took on how they do it all the time yeah that's so crazy what a bunch of savages yeah they have that old-school savage gene that goes way back to like fucking Henry the eighth's days and they're fighting dragons and Robin Hood's and shit you know like English people have like a different set of genetics it's like there's a warrior it's like a history of war they like our genetics are all confused locally like they get over here you know our genetics like start here of course I know this is not how genetics really work as Mike theory they get here and they're like nothing going on here no one's really attacking us that much and like everybody calm the fuck down but in Ireland in England they're still remembering why they drive in the left side they drive at the left side over there so they could sword you with the right that's what it's for yeah I think they that's where their strong side is over the guys coming you want to be able to hack at them yeah with a sword that's some crazy genetics man yeah the English I think learned the best that whoever wins is the last guy standing so their whole thing is like you know Italians are French whatever sort of say yeah I got a few licks and you know what we'll get I'm gonna go get hung up and come back and then this guy will just stay keep staying on the field I'm not leaving I'm not getting off of here you know yeah what a crazy history you know when you when you go back to like European history and go back to the Revolutionary War and just think that was only a few hundred years ago yeah the like the British are coming the British are coming like the Redcoats there was a that was a few hundred years ago that's so recent as you get older you realize how recent that is like when I when I was a child and I would tell you know someone would talk about like you know seventeen hundreds because I lived in I was in San Francisco in 76 I remember was the spirit of 76 1776 two hundred years and it seemed to me to be so long ago it was so long ago but now that that is like 40 years ago oh yeah now I look I go oh that's not that long at all what like we've only been here for two hundred years that's not that's a tiny little little blip of time it's nothing it's it's a weird thing when you really start to consider how long people have been around and then how far we've come like as just it has it's cumulative like it gets faster and faster faster without a doubt right the amount of people that you meet that are tuned into what the fuck is going on right that jumps every year every year you meet more people that are tuned in do you are you talking to someone and in the middle of talking to them you're like okay this conversation is only going to a certain place you know this guy there's a roadblock there and they always tell me how you know whatever he is Pesce Balian and Mormon right whatever it is whatever whatever foot is a strict Republican there's a wall that you hit there if there's less and less of that I think sure well I think you know if you look at III would think is about this too because if you look at history we're sort of like yeah we had some Spears you know we had some bows and arrows oh it was a sword and then we're different better Spears and better bows and arrows no a crossbow and it sort of went like that for like you know recorded history and then you hit the 1900s in the show goodbye playing spaceships fucking lasers you know fucking nukes oh yeah we can blow up a whole continent now you'll blow up the whole world if we want you know it's just one actually in reality there was a lot okay than the first half of the century but the last half is essentially like from let's say the forties on like what like the whole world changed the whole world every fucking thing oh there's the moon let's fly to it yeah if I go home you know and and you know now like going to Mars and you know all this shit they're digging samples from Mars with a robot they shot a robot through the air landed it on another planet that's all nothing I'm just like a million fucking miles away and I always wonder like it's like a million miles or ten million miles whatever it is what do they have do they have like a Sega Genesis control pad like how do they control that all right like a but how but it's a million how can you how can you stand Samaras okay like even if it's going by light speed which is the fastest shit can go it still got to take like a year to get there for it to move the robot how does that work probably using like GPS or coordinates you know it's probably not actual video or anything like that's probably using like like a G wouldn't like satellite or something like radar like radar yeah satellite would only work if you're underneath it the fastest you can do it is is light speed and light speed just to get tomorrow's we're taking it like the closest approach when Mars that's closest is thirty four point eight million miles oh my god that makes me scared I get so scared when people talk about like going to Mars I really like legitimately start shitting my pants just thinking what if they sent you out there what if they put you on that tube and shot you tomorrow what's that I saw that Schwarzenegger oh you went to Mars no I saw the sports there Total Recall yeah know what I'm talking about just being in space in a tube for six months now Hurley through the galaxy with no safety net you see that dick pic of on Mars that they took they took pictures of dicks oh yeah the rover drove a day drove a day what about the one of the planet they just found which one the one that rains glass that's Christ four hundred and fifty thousand mile an hour winds or something like that what something crazy like that right mm yeah it rains glass it's like almost as bad as a sharknado I can't believe that was a real movie you'd have to have like dynamo Z fun you live there sharknado sounds like it would be a fun movie if I'm moving to me oh yeah I bet it's fun yeah I like stupid moves like that I love that a piranha movie we've talked about sharknado a long time ago before I even came out proceed reason did we I forgot remembered there was an I was also like the octopus that had instead of legs I had sharks as legs oh yeah that's right that's so stupid and yet awesome so yeah this planet rains glass it's 4.8 billion kilometers away so it's almost three months three three billion miles away how do you rains class that's crazy the fuck man Jesus it's blue it's a beautiful blue and it's raining glass it's like a spinning gigantic like one of those little paperweights whose glass paper weighs it look badass all right how easy is it to sneak somebody out of the Philippines have to do with rain and glass I don't know settle down son yeah you gotta get a passport which are remarkably easily what about visa they have to get visas that day to leave see no one's gonna see you can't like download a wife I can't do that okay they'll get you what they say she says I have to act like I'm engaged to her but then they have like you get scammed I go through email with a giant brothers they're gonna hold you down take your money then it could be like these guys are sleeping in my house I'm not really sure I should do thinking of calling the cop but don't want the girl to leave you know is that hard yeah it's hard man so yeah planet rains glass well yes but we were talking like the second half of the last century yeah I get these because I'm I'm a history buff i get these texts it's an amazing thing it's an oxford professor who who sort of puts history into like a tweet so he tweets it so I'm now getting the tweets from 1941 like what's going on what's the account yeah tell me what that is all follows awesome I gotta tell you it is awesome because you're sitting there you're having a weird day you're having a hard day let me just see if I could have any from there but you know you're like ah fuck today sucks or whatever and then you're like oh 500,000 Russians were captured you know outside smullins here we go world war tweets from 1941 it's a world war 2 it's called at real time ww2 at real time ww2 Nazi plans for all of Russia up to Urals be cut to become a German fiefdom full of disarmed slaves Goering we can drop bombs on them in case of riots and you're sitting there going these are all like news headlines and shit and you're like this was just what you read in the news every day you woke up you got your coffee and you're like Goering says we can drop bombs on em in case of riots we're just gonna have work Penza and people like oh yeah and then now I'm gonna go to work and do this shit but if you if you read the tweets it's like what the fuck was going on just like we you were saying yeah 1776 what was going on in 1941 when like people are still a lot of people are still alive who were there yeah you know at that time and you sit there and go holy shit like we were doing some fucked-up shit one generation ago like you fucked up shit yeah and yeah yeah this is Hitler and his chief ministers are now in secret meetings to discuss cutting up the cake of Russia to dominate administer and exploit it they're just like yeah we'll have Russia now we're just gonna take it over and fuckin was only 1942 they think what the humanity was so fucked up or is is so yeah I don't think we've changed so much in one generation that's all I think we've checked its again I mean maybe I'm being like super optimistic about this and I get accused at all the time and I understand well being optimistic yeah well I understand people's that people resist that you know because like what evidence is there I think there's a trend and I think that trend is the trend this this information trend and this growth trend with human beings I think it's a it's an honesty trend and it's a it's a it's it's a trend where people are realizing that instead of like just seeking out people and being an asshole and just being a dickhead you can be nice and you can also realize that there's some repercussions to a lot of shit that happens in this world and that you can use your money to protest and you can talk about things and like this Trayvon Martin thing is a perfect example this I think because there's a lot of people that are very upset with with with how the verdict went down but there's so little violence sure there's people who say but there's some there's some they're pointing at a few things and this guy got hit and that guy got hit and somebody did threw some rocks or something that's gonna happen in small in small numbers that's gonna happen it wasn't right right there King exactly when you consider the amount of people that are that are out there that are upset and how little violence is actually being actually in acting there's it's a it's a versatile agree with you and III I think it's a couple of things I think one if you ever go to really violent like place where they have super violent reactions and things there's not a lot of movement of information there's not a lot of you know a lot of the most dangerous places of the most illiterate places if you go to Afghanistan you go to Somalia they they don't have literacy they don't have movement of information so it's just word of mouth it's like that guy you have to kill that guy he's a wizard yeah or he hates you or whatever that yeah and so I think that now that there's we're bombarded with so much information at all time and it doesn't matter you know if you it could be on TV it could be on your phone it could be wherever and because of that it's it's actually bred a lot more tolerance because they're like that guy is a wizard that wants to kill you and they're actually like no he's not Ryan you know he's just a dude over there and he you know he doesn't have any water or whatever the fuck it is and I think that that movement of information has led to us being able to curtail our lunacy to go back to 1941 and say just you know a generation ago we were like yeah everyone's gonna kill everybody you know and now we would say why the fuck would we do that that's stupid exactly no hopefully no I do think you're right I do think you're right and I think it's that that ability to share information that everybody sort of gets a piece of what it really is instead of that's the enemy and they're coming holy shit look me up on Twitter now go no that's bullshit actually they don't want to bomb you actually the people of Iran don't hate the people of America it's one fucking dude who wants to do this fucking bullshit and you know that's the whole thing that I think that you know we have to get technology and the easy consumption of technology out to everybody quickly I think it's it's the most important thing for spreading information that's ever existed you know and it's beneficial for everybody including the people in power like it's the idea it's beneficial for democracy I don't know about for people in power because people in power do some shady fuck yeah they do but they got to cut that shit out and the only way they're gonna have their only way they're ever gonna tone that shit down is if it all gets exposed which is why you know fucking you know Snowden and shit like that like those guys have to keep doing them if by the way if you work for the CIA sorry sorry CIA tell us you guys tell us all the stuff we want to know at all I'm sure most always doing really good work what I'm I'm convinced mostly the CIA does excellent work so thank you very much thank you for your service I think that good for them too man this is my point is that you can have a government you can have senators and congressmen you can vote on laws but do it the right way it can be done but it isn't being done across the board uniformly even if you don't want to cry conspiracy just the way it's structured is absolutely ridiculous the way that these people are allowed to contribute it's just vast amount of money campaigns that is insanity that's bright I love it though I'm like look I'll tell you one thing seriously if I can donate 1.5 million to Republicans or Democrats I don't give a fuck who it is but if I can if I can get the American ambassadorship on my own American but if I can get it to England where I live in a castle I ride a white horse and put on you know princely robes and I can get that for 1.5 million or Rome you know be the guy in Rome for five years that's awesome right especially if you're like some Donald Trump baller dude I know it happened although it's not Obama just Obama it's all of them like they all do it but I'm just like how amazing is that to be in and just be like you know what I want to be the fucking ambassador to Rangoon you know I want to be the ambassador to India I want to be the ambassador to India and get dressed up like I can you know act like a Rajah and I'm gonna only come and I want Tigers and and and you know it's a million and a half bucks what the fuck sure I'll be I'm gonna have bucks if I can be the ambassador to I don't know China maybe that's a big getting really bored after a while man first of all you get really very fun you're really tired of the assassination attempts right cuz they be trying to climb every day no more like England where it's just like you know you just start wearing a wig and then you start powdering your face and like putting like you know weird you know you know like 17 7 no no like 7 like like little by little you just more and more like 17th century dudes you know and then you're like what are you doing like I am the ambassador to England and I just think that would be awesome just to be able to say that I think we get it sounds like something really good on paper we'd be like lots of terrible like ok the you know ladies horticultural Club of the Midlands is here for your you know tea and crumpets he like I don't think it would also be like I with my luck it would be like we'd be attacked you know like original corn would attack us immediately that's a week for every come across and then I feel like I don't know fuck guys I'm sorry I went out last night there was a rave you guys like raving I don't know like it would be terrible yeah you don't want any kind of position like that man stick to like doing that magazine about sneakers it's funny that's where you guys started out you guys do these like radical documentary pieces about dudes living in the most remote parts the world you started out like talking about sneakers well you started out the fucking taekwondo dude i mean then you became a comedian and then the fucking UFC fucking that's because i did the hardest shit first doing taekwondo we do the hardest shit first skate your shoes are hard man there's only so many types of shoes that are any good listen I got to tell you like if unless you're Bob Dylan you know going electric and like I have all the folkies or like fuck you you fucking sellout cucks like right and then like they're like ah Sh we're not them somebody else said oh this fucking music is way better I think unless you're gonna reinvent yourself all the time then why do it I know magazine I know after five years I knew a new magazine okay let's do something else and if you don't want to do different she's like I was thinking about you I'm like okay hold on a second he's sort of a a weird you know psycho sport comedian intellectual political you stretching it out haha well maybe you go actual and then you go oh I see no you're fucking intellectual you cocksucker do you know that's absolutely not true it's totally true no thing cuz what do you do you come up with will you come up with theories and you come up with some philosophies in my in my mind I'm sorry I'm more thinking of Harvard my money yes my scholar I'm thinking of a real really intelligent person I'm a curious person who happens to be a comedian and I have contact with a lot of people I've contacted a lot of people through Twitter contact with a lot of people through this and it's for me I feel like it's an obligation if there's ideas that you have or if you've read something that's fascinating or if you want to convey that you have an obligation to it but that's an intellectual okay it sounds grandiose it's uh it's for me too it's an obligation to explore these certain ideas and to teacher to tell people not saying this is a bad thing when I was there's five or six things in there and it's the same thing like wouldn't as you grow you want to keep doing the super ten ships word I can't accept it just it's what it is is what we all are human curious human to label us like this is an we're all curious and if you're afraid of gorillas and intellectual I didn't know not I'm not afraid of intellectuals I'm not afraid of calling someone intellectual but I would never allow someone to consider me one okay I would draw the defense things with bras I really appreciate that don't put a lot of pressure on me stoner douche bag is way easier to carry it comes with low expectations most like 50% of what you talk about is this is a interesting thing to think about what does this mean where does it take us sorry intellectual how dare you okay we you your pretentious definitions but the I mean the the the the world we live in now in now allows so many more bits of information to hit your mind yeah there's so many more things to discuss yeah it's like if you're just paying attention you become an intellectual yes like if you're really listening to all the the information that's coming back and forth between us understanding what's going on with the political systems of the rest of the world with our own biological systems with what's healthy and what's bad and what's good what's wrong and what we've been telling you for 20 years it turns out to be total bullshit all that stuff is like common Anacin a million-mile even the dumb people are smarter than the dumb people on a 1940's hundred the dopiest motherfuckers on this planet would run circles around the dummies in the 1940s I just think I think we're it's happening too fast for us to truly appreciate it but I think we're in the middle of one of the greatest ages of information and expansion of the human V by far and we're in the middle of a wave and we can't even we can't realize we're in the middle of it cuz it's too banana well it's also a lot of it is super important and a lot of it is bullshit so like a lot of it I am I I think the lectures only use the word intellect I'm sorry no I was I don't remember but dare you we're talking nonsense yeah which is I apologize it's my fault it's uh my fault I said how high we're talking about how confirmation yes yeah it it's it's amazingly interesting because it used to be there were you know generally you know a couple TV channels a couple of you know newspapers like there weren't a lot of things right and now you can get it from everywhere and I think that's what you're getting at before it's it's I think that's good for everyone's good for democracy that you know one one or two or three sort of information areas versus ten million or a hundred million because you can get it from everywhere your problem is is you don't know and we'll look back in retrospect and we'll say okay you know Snowden was a big thing or it wasn't or you know you know whoever were like WikiLeaks was a big thing it was it but you know that's the whole thing is you Dell used with so much information yeah on Twitter for example half of its fuckin you know people making bullshit and saying shit and then but the other half is like actually people saying some really great shit people say a lot of great shit on terror III here really smart points from a lot of people there's a lot of people that I've communicated with on Twitter that have set me hip to a lot of shit the amount of links that you get every day of amazing shit that people are just like you know what you gotta do this you gotta do a story on this you got your story in this we're doing a story now in Russia which I'd never heard about genetic passports of your own so what have you heard about it nobody freaking me out what's the genetic passport oh dude so we got my toes are crossed well it's interesting you're alright but we it's interesting because we got this this hook up to Twitter and what it is is they the the Russians actually the Soviets to go back to our 1941 conversation after World War two there's a cold war and they they were experimenting with atomic bombs on people like not on like buildings and shit like we did here in Nevada but on people so there's this area of Kazakhstan with about 300,000 400,000 people that were they just over the years experimented with on with radiation with actually blowing up bombs near them a lot of them died a lot of them didn't die and they what they had is they had genetic mutations so they became mutants like it's like x-men type shithole so they become mutants in this area and there are actually not allowed to leave the area in auto-ship but anyways they start on corrupt DNA strains to their offspring so there it gets worse as they go oh no and so now what they're trying to do to stop it is to have genetic passports where they're not allowed to reproduce they're not allowed to do this and so it's like it's it literally is the modern x-men it's fucking the mutants versus the human and so it's this whole cover-up this whole thing and we're going over there now shooting it we we have a couple of whistleblowers but like that's the type of mutant are we talking here well that is that allowed to say anymore am I am i mute mutant phobia am i a mutant phobic nor they they're there they're there they're technically human mutants like genetic mutations that you have to have a genetic passport and by the way this brings up a lot of philosophical questions not intellectual questions philosophical persons but because you have a genetic password you're saying okay you now can reproduce you now can like interact you can now can't leave this area you can't do whatever because we made you radioactive you're like well hold on a second I didn't fucking ask to be made radioactive and I can't reproduce now and whatever and like it's it's it's actually a massive they're not allowed to do so they no no oh my god they won't stop the mutant strains that's all true by the way this is a fascist is all true that's it's a fascinating idea now what when you say mutant like do they exhibit any sort of special powers I just became art Belle I just became art bell bitches sadly the majority of mutations are and and much I can't you know what the animals it's like enlarged livers you know massive spleens you know you know elephantitis of the balls like it's right never anything by the way all respect to our bail I'm saying that as a fan I'm a huge art Bell fan that's been a bell fan forever so when I say I just became our bell obviously I'm joking that guy is awesome man he's uh apparently he's gonna do radio again I used to come home from the comedy store every night listen it's a coast to coast with art bell you ever watched you listen that show I have listened to I know our value it's the best who's the best who can I ask you a question I always forget to ask you this and I've been wanting to ask you this for three times okay whatever the fuck who's your favorite comedian ever I always say Sam Kinison for one year I had Marc Maron on yesterday and Maron who was 21 during kinnison's heyday and actually lived with Kinison I mean he was in the the crest Hill House there was partying with him and doing blow with Kennison like in complete craziness the story was absolutely fantastic I was in my glories so if I had to say like who's the best I say Kinison for 12 months I think it's Kinison for 12 months between like 86 and 87 was the greatest comedian of all time and we all pale in the shadows but Richard Pryor was the most influential there's like but Lenny Bruce had to exist for Richard Pryor to exist right you know it's like there was like a whole series of guys and you can't minimalize each guy's impact so if someone says who's your favorite comedian I say Lenny Bruce and the reason why is cause Lenny Bruce was the guy who did it he was the guy who opened up the doors went to jail you know one on stage and did this whole bit about we have to if you say nigger enough times like eventually it's not gonna mean anything and it won't hurt some small black child's feelings you had this whole bit about this is an incredibly powerful philosophical bit about the the nature of hate words the the power that they give you know if you don't use them if you don't use them all the times they've become rare I mean it's a brilliant point and it's a brilliant objective point and then you stop and think through this guy - this is like 1950 something but he he was on a note about all the legal shit that happens horrible and what happened even after that is more horrible because he stopped being funny right he stopped being philosophical and he would go on stage with his legal notes and read out of them and you know there you go come on dirty Lenny they just come dirty Lenny you know why people wanted him to talk about sex they wanted him to talk about blowjobs this is like unheard of stuff yeah but if you unfortunately in the the comedies a weird thing whereas it's really it gets dated mmm you know like music does not get dated as badly as comedy does and it's hard to listen to like a Lenny Bruce like album and understand the impact it would have had back then like I still think it's amusing I think some of his points are hilarious he had this joke about homosexuals he's like he goes being homosexual is illegal Dave so what do they do they they taking they put you in jail a bunch of guys what I've said to you okay it's like like use almost like a Mitch Hedberg before his time I know I mean there's some of it that's very funny but it's so dated yeah that the the the the references are so dated the concepts are dated but kinnison's not dated and who's the funniest now the one who makes me laugh the most it's probably Joey dreamers Joey Diaz makes me laugh harder than anybody yeah he's just this bursts of there's moments when Joey Diaz is on stage where it's funny than anything that has ever happened in the world there's moments where Joey Diaz he hits these notes he says some shit sometimes they just literally makes me fall onto the ground I'll roll around in an airport I'll be on my back in an airport like cry and laughing hates the funniest dude ever to me and it's not just because I love him and he's my brother but I've been around that dude for like more than a decade there's no one person who's made me laugh more than him it's like if I had a like like all the laughs that I've ever achieved in my life and put it like Joey Diaz the Joey deals files like up to the ceiling it's piling over like the stacks of laughs from all my friends but with Joey it's ridiculous can't even really compare him to other comics he's like he's no different anything at aghori different kind of human being yeah he's just a funniest guy of all time I've met a lot of fucking funny people man I've seen the greats I've seen Richard Pryor live I see Hix live I've seen I've seen of the Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle and Louie CK I've seen them all alive you know who's your favorite Shane nobody could fuck with Joey Diaz is my favorite comedian our of all now I mean Richard Pryor has to be of all time I think he's like yeah yeah if you want to go with the most influential this is what I feel like I feel like it's Lenny Bruce and then slightly more richer but also if you look at if you look at Richard Pryor the reason why I say Richard Pryor is his stand-up was like Redd Foxx on fucking steroids I also know Redd Foxx but he was all like and you know grew up in a whorehouse all that shit you know he worked at red foxes clock yeah but then what I really love is shit like you know his Gene Wilder sort of you know movies for the masses yeah you know I'm thinking of the one where they go to the with the rodeo and they they have to do the rodeo what's that oh yeah yeah he was very fun believably funny very funny those movies come on watch that movie I don't remember any of those movies stir crazy or some go stir crazy yes that's good all right leave it alone stir crazy I need got him because okay I'll tell you why because he was doing all the the sort of crazy underground shit yes and and like you know fucked up and whores and drugs and fucking hey easy mixed company yes all right and then but also doing the movies that were just like fucking hilarious well he if I had to put like who had their like the most impact on culture I would say Pryor the only reason why I say Kennison was the best for a year because I think it was the most extraordinary example of a guy who was utterly amazing and astonishing and when tactful and then deteriorated before our eyes like a really like almost a cartoonish version of himself yeah a caricature of himself he just he fell into everything that was wrong with being famous hook line sinker yes but he was the greatest of all time for 12 months even better than prior I I just my feeling is that Pryor is the greater comedian he was the greater craftsman he was a great the more honest like the more insightful the more associated for a long time he did it for a long time he was never bad he was never bad he was just as good the day he died I mean he had a hard time when he came back from MS and they would carry him on stage I don't count those sets I had I did six weeks with dude six weeks a hard time I did at the store I I followed him for five is about five and a half weeks and he would go up like two or three nights a week and they would carry him onto the stage and he was it was really hard that was hard for him to communicate and you know but people wanted to see him before it went that's what it was essentially and it was packed was packs like almost every night so I if you had to say who's the greatest comedian of all time I would say it's it's a tie it's Pryor for the the length of the career and the the emotional attachment a love that you got from his sets like you got like a positivity from his sadness you got a also he was just naturally fuckin funny he was brilliant he was brilliant but Kinnison was just another thing man for 12 months or whatever the hell it was 14 16 months he was another thing man he was a motherfucker he because the people who don't know what comedy was like back then have a hard time understanding sure but if you were alive how did you get into it from him right from sure for sure it was two people was Pryor in him is Pryor when I was a little kid my parents took me to see live the Sunset Strip right and I was in this theater and I remember in the middle of it dying laughing I remember I don't remember the bit but I was dying I couldn't believe how hard I was laughing and then I remember like holding my sides laughing sarna and looking around at all these people rocking back and forth in their chairs laughing so hard and then thinking this is just a guy talking holy still is talking like I thought about all the movies that I'd seen there really liked like stripes like hilarious hilarious movie so I thought it was like the funniest thing you could ever see and then also I'm seeing this guy and I always do he's talking and it's so much funnier than that he didn't need a Winnebago he didn't need anything so that was the first was my first inkling of stand up and then Kinnison was like probably the reason why I thought maybe I could do it because I my sense of humor was so much darker than like what I was seeing on like television it was so much more wild than when I was seeing on sooo much more wild man stop wearing mood rings was serious I grew up a Steve Martin and Jeff Ogden and Doug Stanhope from my biggest influences Joe Rogan made it in there hell yeah holla I've seen Joe Rogan probably more than any more than anybody in the room for sure there's more pictures with me and him together than me with any other human that's ever exist and who are the new bad boys like Jim Norton Norton's excellent for sure this is a great time for stand-up comedy this is a great time for Roberto promotion or people like Tom Segura Tom Segura and his wife christina pazsitzky Tom Segura is one of the best fucking comics in the country it's just letting the world know about it that's all that's missing Ari Shaffir one of the best comics in the country and people are people because of the old death squad Network are sort of getting clued into like who's who we're if we're hanging out with people as who's they're funny bringing people around cuz they're funny and so it's spreading and in turn they're introducing like Brian's constantly introducing new people into the mix he sees people at the comedy story introduces them into the mix and then boom we know Tony Hinchcliffe now hilarious Tony Hinchcliffe and that's that's like that this is a rare time for that there's a rare time where the expansion of comics has been so easy and the ability to promote people has been so easy I wanted to ask you this question and you know last time we I was going you know you've changed I love you but it was that was an impression that was me impression of me you doing Nene doing me drunk oh god I was like I love you I don't know I become 90 years old but what I wanted to say is the like every time we do I get actually I was in Houston coming back from Central America night this guy came up to me in a full-on like a Sherpa gear body suit you know you going you know what I'm talking about the bright orange nascar uniform things like he was like oh air traffic controller i feel like those guys traffic controller right on the ground ground ground controller guy with the flashlight yeah thank you Nikkei my wife's life he came up to me and he was like fucking Joe Rogan fucking you know you and Joe Rogan fucking awesome and he was just maybe the best guy I'd ever met and he was just like you know I was in the City Airport and he was just so stoked he was like desk wat that's why and he's so shit and then he took a picture of me write me and he said can I take a picture I go yeah he took a picture of me and then some other death squad dude put it up on Times Square like in the photo shop alright and I've seen and then everybody went and I was like fucking death squad shit is crazy and what do you all want to say a what the fuck is going on with that so and be what like how did it happen like you guys have created this fucking amazing should I go well there's two there's two sort of branches of it I'm gonna go take a leak question it's like and then I'm just gonna leave you cuz I don't give a shit about what are you getting in there what could he possibly getting in there what is he getting would you get in there ice how dare you okay the world refresh my drink okay drinking already we you know all it is is really at this point there's two to two branches one is all the stuff that Brian's doing Brian what he calls his network is the death squad podcast network and it's a great connection to a lot of people that maybe you don't know or maybe you do know and you'd never heard him talk like that like Kevin Pereira or there's that and then there's all just sort of what we call all of us whether it's Ari or Duncan or we don't really call all of us we don't but which is also of approval of comics and friends that we're all yes that's a good way of putting it but why is it a steal but it seems a little bit more than calmness is like more political and there but it's not if it chooses to be it's not our doing we're not we don't all we're doing see all we ever say the bottom line don't be a cunt that's number one and number two like if I tell you that Duncan Trussell is funny believe me I'm not gonna bullshit you right now so if we're all connected like that like you can guarantee you if I I tell you Joey Diaz the funniest guy I've ever fuckin seat of my life you're gonna see what I'm talking about if you go see him live you know and so this sort of connection with each other right like that you know like Brian Britain's like Brian told me about Tony Hinchcliffe he's like dude there's this guy you got to see him this young guy but seen him at the store he's really fucking funny like and he says I'm gonna have him on one of these shows like the desk watch shows at the ice house so you put some on and then boom we know 20 Hinchcliffe is a bad motherfucker it's for the burn now yeah he's got like a real career and I brought him with me to Indianapolis the kids fucking hilarious right it's like so what it's allowing is we can bypass all those other systems we don't have to you don't have to be on The Tonight Show anymore you don't have to wait for an HBO special I gotta say death squad love is is fuck it's also using subliminal messaging like using that no that's just your app win cash so the whole thing this is the best part about it is it nobody nobody like is running it and nobody asks for it and and nobody no no no one's in charge no one no one knows what's going on you know I'm saying like we don't have an agenda there's no agenda a little bit older and then all of a sudden you start to let a few into the farm and a few more than pretty soon you're like there's no if I got 10,000 maybe some other fuckers there's no farm to what's starting out a civilization a new who you want I want I don't to say new civilization I don't let you but it will be a utopian that's impossible not in this lifetime not unless Ray Kurzweil is correct they're gonna come get you download cars if you started a cult they would get come get my call wouldn't do shit no my cult would just go like fishing Michael doesn't want to have anything to do what you're doing if I if I had a cult the last thing I'd want is to dominate the financial markets like you guys can have that's all you dude right have a good time we're gonna do it you want to dominate we're gonna do it sue we're gonna go fishing we're gonna smoke weed tell jokes okay said all right we'll just be over here and you swear to God we're not gonna do nothing yeah use the coupon code Rogan and take 10% off all homegrown mangos if I had a cult it would be the easiest cult ever like ghosts eh I don't know what here's a fuck okay nobody's trying to take over shit all right I'm gonna remember that the I think the cult is coming no because they're spreading their own cults to like there's like like if you go to like all these Twitter pages now it's like death squads st. Louis like they're doing that no one asked him to do that Brian did not I didn't ask him to do that and by the way when they do it nobody says anything we don't I've never said any hey you can't do that or hey you shouldn't do that or hey we don't know you or hey what are you doing why'd you choose that name or no one cares right now like 200 fuck you want to do right that's that's that's pretty awesome well it's unexpected it's unexpected and in unplanned right and so completely uncontrolled and not only then no one takes credit for it it's beautiful it's great it's just like how I like how you're like it's unplanned on credit you know that they're listening to it doesn't matter we're not doing anything don't blow my look look if I added a society the perfect society wouldn't be taking over this fucking mess it would be like living near a lake and having a solar panel that he's my fucking TV you know I wouldn't be taking over the government of a heated TV yeah man I want to be able to you know get satellite whatever get DIRECTV if in the middle of nowhere the last thing I would ever want to do is have any position of power over anybody ever anywhere I don't even like having employees that's why my loan employees they're both fucking crazy look at them these two dudes are savages I can't have like a regular employee some regular dude that's I can't even communicate with people like that I'm worried now I think I'm gonna be novara when there's gonna be a lot of people they'll be no count me thinks they doesn't protest too much Brian's letting out the cute those are on the side of the Cheerios box so the relationship park in China do you know the act exact address for this you had us I think was episode three of your shows about I didn't know that there's more women than men in China 50 million yeah oh yeah no 50 million more men men demand more man yeah it's so they have to they do these things where they go to these like parks with like like pretty much like it's like their profile like this is how much money I make this is my my house it would if you had sent one of your reporters there to actually try it didn't look like he succeeded in any of that no it didn't work out it's pretty funny when Thomas goes there but it's actually pretty sad they have 50 million was that's the size of a fairly big country 50 million 50 million what more men than women oh and so you have and the problem is is that you have most of the women moved to the city so that you know in the cities it's okay it's hard but it's okay but in the countryside is just dudes and actually one of the things that we wanted to shoot which we couldn't get because they the government fucking freaked out was they have these towns that are just like prostitute towns and and and the only women in the more prostitutes all the men come in from the country and have their sex and then go back out and now they're there making these sex robots do we talked about this before no they're making these sort of sex robot brothels because there's literally whole towns in the west of China that doesn't have any women yeah I think we did I believe we did we might have been drawn at that time it's insane story but yes hard to wrap your you know it's when you start doing genetic engineering you know shit fucks up and and in the cities it's harder to get wives and but in the countries there are no women and so when there are no women shit gets fucked up oh my god yeah it's just a terrible terrible idea of controlling the population that way yeah I mean well the amount of people that someone can have well it's interesting because you said you say okay well we're just too many people so we have to have one kid but you figure a while it would be 50/50 but then if you put societal sort of constraints or cultural constraints and say well we want the lineage to go on so we want a boy so actually they started a boarding girl the girls and then all of a sudden you have 50 million which in China you know it's it's more than a billion people so 50 million doesn't seem like a lot but 50 million fucking people is that's insane that's the size it's like Germany and it's more men than women that must be just a social chaos chaos like there must be so much depression yeah and the relationships you want a pussy-whipped dude but did you see the guy like they're just the most interesting thing I think about that piece is the rich guys actually take out billboards for themselves and take a habit it-it's pretty baller but the schlubs they like the regular guys the guys who are like you know just a regular dude with a regular job they're like we cannot get a girl like we're just we just can't compete to get it right right they're regular good guys like doing a good job doing whatever but they can't compete against the guy buying a fucking billboard you know a lot of it in China is mostly cultural too because it's also like we have to take care of our parents and it's sort of economic relationships and all this stuff Wow so actually the you know there are places like let's say Thailand where like you know the sort of gay populations are but I think in China they're actually coming up with like robotic well the only good thing about that is that no one you know maybe within a generation will have their population control the point where they gonna allow people to have as many kids as they want is that possible yes because that's actually declining now whereas India India's now I believe bigger than China and it did that in the last five or ten years oh it has the youngest population in the world and because they didn't have any sort of curtailing and now China sort of leveled off or declining and India just went through the roof Wow yeah India seems like a really insane place I've had friends that told me they went to India and like as soon as they got over there they felt like they made a mistake this is like this is too much it's too crazy too many too many back definitely gives you an insight into what cities used to be like because they haven't have not there as well that's like stagger oh we did a piece on that where the the most expensive and largest how on the planet is in Mumbai which is a 28 story mansion for one dude right costs it has staff of 380 it costs like 400 grand a month just to fucking keep going it's like this crazy skyscraper for one guy but it cut but the craziest thing the thing is it comes out of it comes out of a fucking slum and the slum isn't just like like what we think of as a slum like whenever I come to California I'm like hold on this is a bad neighborhood everyone's got a fucking house like it's like you know yeah but but but when you're talking about a slum there it's like like they have one toilet for every 1700 inhabitants of us well gee what's so everything reeks of shit all the repairs they they make all their money off just the garbage of the regular economy so like half the the economy of Mumbai is we take the garbage whatever that was thrown out food plastic whatever and we recycle or we redo it and we fucking that's a and so the thing is is you're sitting there in where people are like sleeping under their sewing machines where they make a bucket and stuff and then you walk down the street and then it's like boom straight out of the same thing a billion or it's I think it's 1.8 but billion multi billion over a billion dollar house 38 stories to Olympic sized swimming pools like observation decks 400,000 square feet and you're like you just take the elevator down walk two blocks and you're in like 50 people sleeping in you know a room this big yeah it's fucked up that is so gangster live like that like that's like so old-school gangster well yeah it's how the Kings used to think everyone was born the king was rich that's insane what must that guy's reality be like like the beans that far and the opposite you know what's interesting about India is I don't know if it's if it's you know Hinduism or whatever but it's like they're like yeah we're super poor we can't eat he's got a billion dollar house well really it's not great but whereas in in Europe they're like I love you burnish it down I'm gonna fucking some Braveheart shit fucking take your shit I'm not gonna eat it yeah that would not fly same thing in you know Arab Spring right now I mean you're saying fuck it I don't give a fuck well isn't that weird about the world like what we're talking about like the the variations of these different countries and what what flies in one place we hear about in some places how do like okay how about New Guinea you know about those people that live and they the seaman warriors of beginning sure it is the most insane story but New Guinea is got every good story in the world we're doing I got it right there I'm sure they got a lot of them like all the crazies like you know the cargo cults go cults yeah what's a cargo cult come on I don't know my favorite driver cargo cult yeah no no cargo look up cargo cult as I explained what it is okay so Papua New Guinea was a staging point for the American army during World War two and they cut these impossible run wings into the jungle right and but the people who were living there were like Bronze Age people and so they saw these planes come out and then and then you know they would give them like spam and whatever like stuff you know parachutes and so then they left at the end of the war and they started a whole religion on the plane so they built these planes and they come in and they mimic the landing and they mimic the people coming out and they still have the American uniforms and that the tribesmen with like a bouncers nose and you like one dread will come out with like you know Captain fuckin Joe Adams you know and then they'll bring like the last the empty cam of can of spam and shit and they have these like planes made out of flowers that they pretend to launch and stuff and you're like this is the craziest it's really watching religion they made they made the religion yeah because of the planes you know the b-52s coming with supplies and the whole religion is like the plane is the vessel of God and the captain Joe Abrams who comes out is the is God and the Ness ringing boy I'm and Giorgio tsoukalos would spike his hair up and come in here and say is it possible that the reason why these things exist that we learned them from me Liam yeah I mean it makes sense if you lived a stone-age life and a plane landed and gave you some spam 100 percent it would become folklore yeah and it's got to be so strangers are they are they illiterate culture so no I mean yeah the cargo called they do they do the whole religious thing through the re-enacting that when the planes first landed but actually there's a thing now they are kind of literate now because these these people in New Guinea who are fighting Exxon there's a lot of oil there and excellence trying to try to exploit the oil and these are they well whatever everyone's gonna get oil now if there's fucking oil someone's gonna get it but the hill sea have this crime but they have this tribe now that's dressing as you know the gods the car the cargo and they're attacking Exxon dressed as American servicemen from 1942 I think the whole theme of this is from American 1942 today but like it's it's cooler because they make big huge white helmets and then if Google god that's Google Papua New Guinea versus Exxon and you'll see the crazy outfits it doesn't know or New Guinea he barely knows house bells new but it's pretty fucking interesting that there's a whole it's a huge country popping is massive and there's a whole like a big Texas sized much bigger than Texas really and you have a big big country where like a like huge pockets of it worship cargo from 1944 oh my god up 42 to 40 is there um is there a big city like where you can go and get Wi-Fi and the Starbucks yeah there's that too there's that too this is like a cheesecake factory they're a bit of my being can you go get a Starbucks can I get a Starbucks if I went to New Guinea you can probably get some sort of Pizza Hut product Wow I don't know about start with I saw a giant coca-cola billboard in the Yucatan I was like this is the nuttiest shit I've seen in my life driving to the jungle the way the Mayan ruins there's a giant ad for sugar water focus everywhere oh it's everywhere everywhere you go it's go actually everywhere you go except for a lot of the Muslim world because they only drink Pepsi because somebody spread a rumor that coca-cola had sort of funded design as a movement whoever did that as a marketing tool was fucking smart yeah what does that mean what does that mean to Zionism Zion is all scientism and so and so mine is a design ISM and so Pepsi is now bigger in all these countries you're like I could I'm a coke fan right I don't like Pepsi I bet you are yeah I Drive you where's the ice son all right yeah people talk let's be honest I've been trying to drink water Larry bad you're a healthy guy I've been more healthy label here a healthy guy I'm gluten-free for one beautiful try I eat I eat everything imma fuckin I do too I do two things but I've been with garbage I do too and when I say garbage I mean I like street meat mmm me too you know any place I can get a kebab I'm talking about dog I'll give it up a fold like it has a car else he burnt charred meat eat it yeah no I agree in that I'm gray inside gray ashes oh yes she is she great oh I'm glad pink and strong and bureau.the yeah this is getting gross already I wanted to talk to you about there was some some article that who got nasty with you lately who say a lot of people getting nothing oh there was someone who said something about you lying about your past yeah yeah what was that all about you know it's interesting because when I was studying in I was a political science ball pollen and the firt I was in first year Poli Sci and a guy goes to me he goes I was he was a southern guy even though it was in Canada and he goes I was running a race and we were losing the race and we were fighting the incumbent the governor and I said to my client we have to tell the people that he's having you know carnal relations with farm animals and you know the incumbent is my vote yeah but that's Roger Allam but the guy goes that you know the young sort of idealist guy goes like I will not say that the governor of whatever it is Alabama is has carnal knowledge it's fucking pigs you know I'm not gonna do that I know him he's a good man whenever he goes you know and by the way he doesn't do it like we can't you know to impinge his character and and and the the guy who was teaching me this political class goes you know all you've got to do is say he's a pig fucker because then the minute he says I am NOT a pig fucker everyone will know that he is a pig fucker so the the interesting thing for me is that I'm just this dude like doing vice to my things doing my documentaries and when we did the HBO show and I got bigger and bigger and then all of a sudden it's not just the far right it's the far left everyone starts taking potshots because like oh here's these guys and we're trying to make you know impartial fucking documentaries and trying to news and shit and they start taking these potshots and it's it's a great question because my initial reaction is like you're gonna talk to my ex-girlfriends off the record you know you're gonna fucking go and there was nobody speaking on the record you're gonna fucking go whatever and then I realized I'm defending myself against shit that's just total horseshit so it's just a hit piece it's a total hit piece and then I'm sitting there going okay that's how it starts like because we've had this discussion where you sit there and the the left sits there and makes their comedy jokes about huh no you did this you said this irani in arathi just is a fucking schoolyard bully and everybody's just attacking attacking everybody else's character and all this shit when I said either I'm gonna fucking go down there in the trenches and start spewing shits and no I didn't do this no I didn't do this no I did not fuck pigs or I'm just gonna keep on fucking making the shit that I'm making and I'm not gonna fucking enter into this shit is it true no is it fucking a hit piece yes from the fucking you know whatever but hold on I've had them from the right from the left from anybody okay let's just be specific what are the accusations well I've had a lot but there's several specific ones lately about your past about your journalist history sure well what there's there's there's shit from like you know 25 years ago and by the way I can't talk a lot about this because you know with these things that gets a bit legal right I see we shine because a lot of it's just horseshit mm-hmm and you're like okay so we'll we'll look at that and I'm not actually gonna get into you know like the slinging of the shit and no offending myself because that's what I said I'm just gonna make my shit and it well I don't want you to express yourself in any way that you're not comfortable with and the whole thing about you know whenever people discuss their past the idea that anybody has right to talk to you about your past at all to me is I I feel like if someone wants to talk to me about their past then they choose to do so but they don't I get it you can pry and if someone's past it's completely ridiculous I can or I cannot the the thing about it is when somebody does something that's wrong mm-hmm then you can rectify that in a in an adult manner which is what we're doing what are we rectify some team yeah look you know again we're gonna get into a sort of legal shit right okay but the reality of it is is that you know look am i perfect no you're beautiful thank you you're like a Whitney Houston song no someone used their but by the way you know I don't want no matter what they say I do you know do I drink too much to anywhere no no no you drink the exact amount buddy you but but it's prayer but if and I made a conscious decision about this if somebody's talking shit no let fucking lawyers and other people deal with that and I'm gonna fucking make my shit because what I'm not gonna do is get into this laughs political I fucking attack you you attack me then we attack each other and no one's making the fucking news what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make the fucking news and do the stories that I want to do if people want to fucking attack me they can fucking attack me okay so and by the way if they want to talk about my girlfriend's off the fucking record if they want to talk about shit from fucking whatever right if they want to get like ex-employees that fucking and never speak on the record it's a whole fight so if I could encapsulate it what were you basically saying is it's all bullshit and to talk about it sort of like it's what they're trying to do is they see there's a lot of energy and a lot of lot of attention and eyes on this whole vice thing whether it's your HBO show whether it's the the web there's a lot of energy going on and for anybody not to be this is my personal opinion of course not to be appreciative of all the content that you guys put out there's so much interesting shit from Hamilton Morris's stuff Hamilton Martha's stuff is brilliant I love that guy there's a weird guy on the podcast cuz vice vice does a lot of stuff the one thing is is I'm his face I'm the face of ice eight so people on both sides are gonna come after me fine and I'm by the way like I said if you want to avoid criticism don't go anywhere don't meet anyone don't say anything okay so my whole thing is we're gonna go out there and make our shit our people gonna have goes at us on both sides of the fucking spectrum yes am i gonna fucking get down there and every time someone says your girlfriend said you didn't fucking whack off right no I don't give a fuck so they can fuck off yeah girls don't want to talk about the way you whack off by the way you have to look at the source and if you're gonna sit there and say okay I'm gonna go to some dudes ex-girlfriends from 25 boyfriend's you know if you're a girl and you got to deal with some douchebag dude from your past and make some shit about you that's gotta suck too there's it's like human beings it's like when we had Baron on yesterday he was talking about divorce and the insanity of a person he used to love trying to take everything you have and steal your house and it was fascinating absolutely fucking fascinating but that's humans man that's what I what I find interesting about America right now is anyone that comes up trying to say like you know what we're gonna try to do something we're gonna try to do something different we're gonna stay away from the fucking regular way the most fuckin people are doing this shit because it hasn't worked they just have a go at you and you're like I'm just trying to fuckin do my shit dude like you're having to go up me like well and by the way I've got to say I've got to say if that's your best go at me then so there's nothing no merit to it what we're saying it's just no merit okay so all the things they're saying you did or didn't do you actually did do and all the things they're saying look again it's gonna get into legal right I understand what you're saying but but yeah so it's a hit job exactly so they're trying to find some flaw in your character and they're going to though what do you do and they don't want they don't need to say shouldn't they say okay whatever you know what you have to be like mean of zero credibility well the other thing that's interesting is I've always said look if you're looking advice for everything then we're fucked and to begin with because right you know we used to as you pointed out we used to be this and that however look have we evolved have we done the shit have we gone from talking about sneakers to news yeah and by the way if you go back in my life have I done drugs I've been a bad boy Yeah right it's up Shh what do you people are listening what are you doing promoting drug use not on my show this is America it's my America you're Canadian you don't even American goddammit we're all calm together we're all calm with in a certain way right is certain way right I mean socialist not really a little medicine wise they're just a rich country so they can spread some money around you know I was just gonna ask you why are they so rich and is it a fake false of like are they gonna have a boom with their like finance like their real this is what it is because they're not cunts and they didn't get robbed okay they had a toe dig country it's a big country with so many not that many people are dirt ooh fuck everybody over and they didn't have the whole mortgage crisis that we had yeah and also I mean it's you know so much resource wealth up there as well as you know banking as well as tech as well as everything else but they have just a lot of resources and not a lot of people yeah and they're friendlier yeah that helps to help out and apparently people are the same pretty much in the most I don't agree with that I think there's a lot of friendly people in this country Canadians can be pretty hypocritical really yeah do you think those are like words no I what I will say is there a little bit hypocritical because they'll say we're not American you know we give out foreign aid we're nicer we're better were kinder what an actual fact it's that's a bunch of hokum and and yeah how do you dislike what what is what's hokum about it well like we give out for an aide for sure but we a lot of the times we were giving it to the bad guys you know who who were running these different countries we gave out for example CANDU reactors and we said hey by the way nobody use this radioactive plutonium that comes out of here for any other things you know and and also when so they gave it away the key they gave they gave can do right reactor technology away to who well I believe Pakistan and India right now it's on so Canada I think Pakistan in the other nukes I believe Pakistan through AQ Khan and France and some of North Korea weaponized it but I believe that the initial reactors both from India I'm for sure India but I'm pretty sure Pakistan came from Canada Jesus Christ but in any case the reason why I said that it's just because we're like we're like hold a little bit holier than that we're like well you know we're nicer were richer we have universal health care we have well okay well let's look at that because look at that decision that decision was only made by I mean how many people how many people were involved in the decision to sell arms to other countries it's probably a very small don't sell give okay give even give well there was some influence there's something something in exchange I think I think Canada is the largest donator of foreign aid per capita in the that's our fish that's our big thing just giving people - people might say whatever you do with it fine but do know but there's a lot of sanctimonious sort of like we're great we're nice we're cool you know we don't fuck with anybody where everybody likes us some of my favorite people that ever met a Canadian but you know at the same time you know it's it's you know we say okay you know we have this great education system we have this great healthcare system but it's a two-tiered system nobody admits it but it is you know it cuts off the tall tree mean it may be a two-tiered system but it's so much better for the lower tier correct then the system that it's in America yeah I think you can merit but America's system is fart insane it's no it's chaos you should do a special about if the hundred dollar bill in Canada actually really is purposely smells like maple syrup or if it's just box another room did you know that I knew I knew one of the bills are melted near the new the new currency is made out of plastic and it melt and it melts my sign if it's ordered in the dryer if it's really hot but the hundred dollar bill smells like maple syrup like in every way why would you have one of them melts in the dryer that's fucking stupid you can't rip it though you try to rip it you can't rip it but yeah but if it melts the dryer whoo what's more likely that you gonna rip your shit are you gonna leave it in your pocket I don't know I will say one thing a lot of times I take out bills and I give them to people in foreign countries and America money looks counterfeit because like the faces will be all blurred and shit so shitty - and like and it'll be all like you know you hand over like a hundred analog in Thailand or China and they're like that's not real because like the whole thing is like wiped out and faded City yeah and you're like that can't be real honey that's like their money like I was that pink dye and they have this wall of like every single like currency they've ever got from every single country and there's some like currency that's like really baby looks like a little monopoly money looks so cute I don't know there's there's a lot of countries that have that Canada is dope money they have like little windows little clear windows you know have you the money fuckers I don't I do this is my favorite somebody gave this to me recently and they're like here this is when shit gets out of hand oh yeah there you go that's real that's real money what is this for welcome Bob way fifty billion dollars oh yeah that's real it's like a doll it's like seventeen cents yes something like that fifty billion oh my so weird that you fifty billion dollars this is 50 billion dollars yeah that's 50 billion turn the camera on that is it that's 50 billion dollars King Todd that's real though this is what's weird brother links I just told me about that same exact bill last night she's like check this out and she should now have a one trillion I'm 50 billion now it's like one troll I got so what's the exchange rate way to even have that what's exchange rate what's that worth not with a dollar seventeen cents or something like that she said you're look it up no wait fifty billion Zimbabwean dollars versus an American dollar what's the exchange rate for 50 billion dollars in Zimbabwe money Zimbabwe dollars versus United States that's pretty good and I'd like the graphic I'd like I'd like to graphic to be a little bit better than a rock it looks like poop its raw like you know it looks like a dog just took a doodoo on a 50 million dollars you want 33 cents no whoa no no fifty billion dollars is 33 cents well I guess has been a little decline in the economy don't worry about it folks I could never have in the air it's not like we're all just human well don't worry about a kitchen management a 50 billion dollars for 33 cents then my whole farming fishing idea making a lot of sense how much does that money cost low to make it has to be more that's got to be cost more than 13 cents no no no no no when no one gets paid and everyone eats rice you can get people to print shit up pretty cheap yeah trust me all right well that the 13 cents is it's insane I mean well we just it's like it's a Coen Brothers movie it's it's a Coen Brothers movie about a country somewhere in the world where everything is collapsing and these are human beings and they coexist with people that have Samsung Galaxy s4 that can survive 10 feet underwater for like an hour everyone's living the same time it's crazy it's how do you also how do you like you have to go with a like a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy like bread and a can of corn well that's what we always heard about the downfall of the Soviet Union remember that they would talk about lines for potatoes and stuff whether or not I don't not you know obviously I really don't know what happened I wasn't there I didn't see it right but I can't assume that those stories were bullshit people really know there was yeah for us it's really hard for us to wrap our head around the idea that society can fall apart like that because we we haven't seen our lifetime go to a supermarket here like fuck we got everything it's a history of the world though shit falling apart yes the history of the world is shit falling apart people figuring out new and innovative ways to stop it from happening again and then that works for a little while and then their grandchildren getting charged and then it all falls apart again and then it keeps going on with a cry for revolution can be just switched out with the cry for bread yes we're fucking hungry that's what can fight or for books I mean you know they were trying to stop people from having books you know that I wasn't reading this thing about Martin Luther and the idea I'm a huge fan of Dan Carlin's podcast hardcore history right I talked about in the show all the time and one of the things I talked about is that I listened to recently rather he's got this whole thing about Luther ISM and about Martin Luther being the first guy to translate the Bible phonetically in a way that people could understand and that before that the Bible was only in Latin and most poor people had no idea what it said they didn't understand the words the Bible and this became like this crazy heresy that this guy had done this even the Bible is all these people and it's what when you when you hear about shit like that and you realize that this is just sort of always been going on yes this control and this this this thing that we see today with the NSA and with the idea of drones and the idea of the you know that it look we got to check your everybody email just one of you might be a terrorist yeah you you almost want to stop and put your hand over that your heart and go oh my god do do you hear what you're saying yeah like you're a movie you're a character in a Coen Brothers movie yeah you're the the most evil and ridiculous of dictators ever in the most prosperous of time that's what I always think is like do people have moments of sanity and realize what they're doing yeah because like if you ever like you know for example Libya you know you're like Gaddafi started as a man of the people he started a revolution and then all of a sudden you've got these mercenaries killing your own people and shit and you're like you ever wake up you're sitting on the can and you ever say hey I'm killing my own people same thing now in in in Syria like you're sitting there you're trying to hold on to power and you're like okay we fuck shit up hundreds of thousands of people are getting fucked up you know tens of thousands of people are getting killed like these are my people I'm supposed to be like a progress he was educated at Oxford he must at some point know what the fuck he would have matched you would imagine I have to call bullshit on my own self because me saying that like that anyone at any point time is like the the like if you'll go back to Hitler Hitler at one time was like the the most evil controlling dominant dictator in history but that's just because that's where he lived like he was and he was in that time he was dealing with the past but if you stop and like look at numbers look at the overall numbers of humans killed it's like there's always some new thing there's always some new focused point of energy and destruction whether you go back to the Mongols you go to Hitler you go to what you're dealing with is a human characteristic that embodies itself in a charismatic and enigmatic figure yeah but it's a human characteristic this does this want need for destruction this doing things you're terrified of having dune done to you it's almost it's it's it's almost an unavoidable human characteristics and it's it's incredibly fascinating to me it's incredibly fascinating to me just if I was a it was a an alien watching us from another planet trying to figure out what's going on with people that would be an incredibly fascinating aspect of it what I what I find interesting at two things one is you look at that time let's say the thirties forties fifties and you say okay Hitler killed all these people very bad guy Stalin killed twice as many as Hitler very very bad guy and Mao killed three times as many in his own country and then at that point you're like what the fuck was going on back then eh Oh be my second point is when you look at like shit like what's happening now and you say okay how does that actually happen you know like how do we get to that point and what happens is you know you sit there and say okay you know I went to school and I learned this I love this but you get cavalier and this is all these guys in the NSA or CIA or whatever like you know what they're like doctors you know doctors are sort of like oh well I deal with livers every day so I liket lift up the liver I take it out the fucking thing and put it down there kind of cavalier about the livers cops or cavalier about the Mafia everyone's cavalier about the shit what happens in the NSA is like yeah we're listening to the guys of course we're listening to the guys because why can we listen the guys you're like yeah but you're fucking up everything democracy freedom fucking private fucking shit life everything yeah yeah but fucking you know we got a we got a you know listen to these guys to get our shit done and once you just become cavalier about shit and to go back to it it's like okay these people aren't you know part of the revolution or they're not part of the thing they've got to be done away with that's the problem is when you take the humanity out of shit and when you take and it's just take your day in day out job it's like I got to make the doughnuts or fry the eggs or whatever that's the problem with running a corporation when you're dealing with the bottom line all the time that's the number one complaint that people have bought corporations is that they remove humanity it removed the repercussions for doing things the environment they removed the repercussions for influencing politicians or the restrictions for influencing politicians and if a government is what is it you know one one-fifth of the population yeah then it becomes standard operating procedure yeah absolutely and in I believe it's not only do I think it's not healthy it doesn't have to happen that way like I know I don't think that there's something wrong with capitalism and and competition because I think that that fuels people I think everybody looks at it in terms of like competition is bad and those are your enemies no I think it fuels you to do better I think there's nothing wrong with being in competition with other companies but we try common ethically shall we try communism it didn't work right well this Apple ISM works or even if it doesn't work it's it it's the system it can be I think there could be it is there could be a moral capitalism and a moral ethical honorable capitalist agree but I'm just saying capitalism one yeah between no gold war between communism and capital it's not perfect but it makes the most sense and it's just one it is it is yeah the dominance you can't just expect people to work if you force them into a job you can you're stifling creativity or you're stunting progression you're fucking up the whole cycle of humanity you can't do it if you take out incentive yes it's not gonna well that's a huge problem with it look there's I am I'm not I'm not really a right wing guy and I'm not a left wing guy but there's a lot of like really insensitive shit that gets said about people that go on welfare you know and like the idea is that y'all they become lazy and they don't do shit they just want to fucking lay around and get their check like maybe but that's not the way to handle it for humans like you you can't help people that way the problem can't just give a money like that the problem is is if you look at history there's always pretty much around ten percent of the population that just doesn't fit in like it just there's a different system could be communism could be capitalism could be whatever but they just can't get the shit together to work within that system because it is hard yeah this is 10% of the fucking people to just aren't going to get there to be agrarian could be industrial could be political to be anything they're just gonna be 10% to just can't get there they just don't get it they can't fill out the forms they can't fucking whatever so what do they have to do they have to find a better gig well I'm I think it's part of the human equation just I just think there's you need people there for some reason I don't know why but part of the humane equation is there's just always gonna be 10% of the people you got to go I give to the fucking I don't know Church to the soup kitchen or whatever they're like just and they're not gonna get there they're just not gonna get there it is that just the broad spectrum of biology you know it's I think so it's gonna be I think soaps I think Trey by the waterhole I think so I think it's literally just like there's always 10% of the people for better or for worse I don't know why I don't I don't like but it's fucked it's a self-fulfilling prophecy - it's fucked that once you get locked into a system of power are together it's very difficult are together it's hard to see the way out even though you see prosperity in front of you it's hard to see logical way to achieve that for you so I came up you know in Montreal which is the most sort of anti capitalist city in the world and really yeah anti-capitalist where I don't know much look all I know about Montreal's it's beautiful it's awesome yeah it's beautiful it softly in there it's it's literally one of the best cities in the fucker shot out to Joe beef but they like they just it's a weird you know artistic community weird community they want to separate from Canada or they did it just it's like they didn't give a fuck about success like Toronto so much I was richer and bigger and more powerful than Toronto and then at some point Toronto said yeah we're gonna be like New York and Montreal said we're just gonna fucking do our own thing so much sure all became like its own weird you know beautiful crazy place and Toronto became and want to be in New York so you know it's it's when I say anti-capitalist it's like for example bands like you know God speedy black Emperor or Arcade Fire they're like we're not gonna go on major labels like you know all kinds of people like we don't care about money kinda music is that well that's a good question I'm the Arcade Fire Arcade Fire is one of the biggest bands well gosh black Emperor is like more you know [Music] orchestral cool orchestral shit I'll try some of that so who's one of the biggest bands in the world what ban sorry I never even heard of them they're fucking off what kind of music is it our awesome polka fucking like jazz polka rock rock rock'n'roll it's rock and roll music yeah like if you had to compare them to someone that's the glue that's why they're so good is because you can't anybody else mm-hmm teeny bit I don't think we can unfortunately I'll listen to it off the air how do you say their name now fire like like arcade game fire anyway Arcade Fire okay listen to on the way home macho is a great town but no one cares about money and by the way that's what makes it great it's fantastic well I I really enjoyed there a lot of very smart people they serve ice cream over there if a place it's a fantastic fuckin it's it's a it's a an excellent community of human beings that's fantastic there's that place that comedy works you know that place no it's been around but they do theirs yeah yeah yeah yeah Just for Laughs in English they have I was on there in 93 yeah oh well you can you want to go to the Phillipines did I ever tell you they don't want to be in the Canadian journalist Philippines story no we never told you that I don't think so I want to make that fucker a movie okay I'll do it quick but it's a true story there was a once upon a time a magazine called Saturday night in Canada which was the only time Canadian magazines were any good at one magazine that one magazine called Saturday night and they had this one writer and he was like D writer he was like the Joe Rogan podcast but of writing of magazines oh you're too kind ha and so he he was like this really respected like like right he was like our young I don't know like a young hunter as Thompson like coming up like changing shit anyway he kind of disappears like goes off and he had this young protege right who started writing going like what the fuck happened to my guy and they had they they were like having this real like what the fuck's go but in the magazine it turns out that this guy this writer like real smart incredible writer or whatever went over to the Philippines to write a story and disappeared right and then his protege goes I'm gonna go find him right I'm gonna go get this guy oh and then what happens is that it says now this is you gotta imagine this is like politically correct Canada like really super liberal like right like politically correct anyway okay so he goes over there and it turns out that this super like the most respected writer in the best magazine ended up living in a whorehouse Oh with like a young Filipino girl and he's he went like Kurtz into the jungle and he's like I'm not coming back so then actually I remember I got the story because he came back and he was like in a in a Canadian supermarket and like he was bring the girl back no he had just come back for like Christmas or some for supplies and he wrote this convincing he wrote this completely scathing thing about the supermarket saying all this food is shit it's fucking inedible the person that the fucking thing is like pimply-faced they don't treat you nice like fuck cannabis but literally he just like basically had a scathing thing on Canada now you have to imagine what happened to all the people cuz they went you're attacking Canada fuck you and fuck you know you're fucking it all so there was this huge huge outpouring of like animosity towards this dude so then is his protege goes you know and he's like fuck this guy and what happened to him and we got to figure out what happened to my toes maybe a fucking apocalypse now my god so exactly so he goes over to Philippines to get him he's doing a horse dance I'll never ask him how much we will never forget the first line of like because it's it's really sanctimonious and against this guy and against his you know his mentor knows uh-huh and he goes over in the first line of his dispatch from the Keynes's I shouldn't have put my tongue into her pussy because now it's covered with a green film so he's gone there and he's gone he's gone he's gone into the heart of darkness and bad Islam but anyways and this is all by the way and in sort of my rose-tinted retrospect but I was like what a great buddy film to make of like to sort of Canadian Chris Tucker and Bruce Willis yes total Canadians totally sort of like in you know intellectual like like smart guys who end up going to the Philippines and just getting sucked into this abyss of like of you know the reason why we're talking about you if you need a location scout I'm down the Philippines is like one of the best spots in the world if you're a pool player there's like so many high level pool players in the Philippines like some of the greatest pool players of all times come out of the Philippines apparently I don't want to play fool after the war the there's a lot of American GIs that were stationed to the Philippines and and that apparently this is what started the billiards craze I may or may not be correct about this but there were like this guy named Efrain ray is like one of the top three pool players of all time he's a Filipino and there's like a whole bunch of Filipinos like Francisco Bustamante and was just like a million of them like literally like there's so many like sooo as far as like one small country and what the numbers of like high-level professional pool players the Philippines is like top two other all the countries in the world it's incredible my family Highlander is not actually a pool story it's a snooker story snooker being I believe harder than full but it's a the most successful here's well disrepute your on that is it it's very hard no doubt it's a little different you might have played pool to the best pool players I think stand up to the best hooker players you ever hear look this guy I'm gonna ask you cuz I might have been pool to I think it might have been poor he was a snooker champion than a pool champion which guy he's a is English dude big fat guy and he drank 40 pints of beer a day Oh Tony what the fuck's because he had a thing and he could take the pill but he couldn't play pool or he could drink 40 pints and and and he was the Rope I believe he is a world pool champion for like two or three years he was a snooker guy but he won the pool but he had to drink 40 beers a day cuz he had a murmur in his arm I don't know but I love that shit I mean it's like you're 5 feet to but you're gonna be like you know the best basketball player you have a fucking thing where your arm doesn't move well you're gonna be ranked like a pool player but if you drink enough you can do it yeah control over a spastic arm yeah I don't know who that is we looked at up there's so many working 40 pints a day full Aryan and from where from he's from the UK yeah there's a lot of snooker players that wind up doing really well in pool because they have really good fundamentals because in a smaller pocket it's really difficult to pot what they call the water yeah it's a bigger table smaller pockets it's a very very very very very difficult game but it's a different game here a bigger cue ball and moving moving the cue ball around for position ball the ball is slightly below where that's the guy and you what did he win though did he was he pool champion 2 or just he won Best Dressed dork January 1947 through 2003 he was Canadian professional snooker and pool player recognizable for his girth he nicknamed big bill how do you know this was the guy because that when I googled what like the 40 pints a day here alcohol consumption was he was noted for he up to 30 pints of lager per day city that he generally drank around 6 pints of lager before match and then 1 pint for each frame he said he did it to contract the familiar benign tumor that he had oh wow he had a tumor later his career he also took a propyl '''l a better blocker to cope with the effects of the did he ever did he ever win the pool championship [Music] ius pool and sucker there's a lot of those guys that come yeah World Snooker Championship four times this is a bunch of snooker champions that have become really good at pool they started doing really well unlike the Moscow and he cup and they start doing really well in the Pro Tour I know a few guys have won a Darren Appleton who's a snooker champion he played English a ball too he won the English world it's just a different different style of eight-ball what's happened eight ball after the color of money there's no pool band pool is people don't play it it's too hard video games are easier you know it's easier to run out a video game when you're playing especially if you're gambling or you're playing in a tournament when you're playing pool it's really difficult to hold your nerves together shot to shot and it's very challenging it's very challenging mentally if I was a ball so big well eight balls because you have more options and people got that suck they'd like there's a whole bunch of balls all over the place and they can pick any one they want to shoot at that's initially but a Paul's a very strategic game because when you deal with 15 balls supposed to 9 how many people want to slice their wrists right now and jump off a building Shane Smith asked me about pool when you when you have like a really high level player then it becomes interesting because then it becomes very strategic because you have to figure out what should I choose should I choose colours or stripes because one of them I there's a pattern and the other one it doesn't exist and so I have to figure out whether or not I can get out and when you play in a high level player it's it's all about the percentages that you can clear the frame clear the table it's that's what it's all about if you watch like the best players like the Efrain Rhea's or the Earl Strickland's it's all about if you give them a chance to get loose then they start clearing tables and we start they start running out racks and hitting you with packages or else trickling you want to know how badass this motherfucker was Earl Strickland there was a thing this guy CJ Wiley who's a very famous pool player and world champion real high level player himself was a promoter of this event and he got an insurance policy on the event that if anybody ever ran ten racks in a row they would get a million dollars the odds you running 10 racks if you live a hundred lifetimes or like a hundred to one nobody runs ten racks all right because if you break and run out even if you like you get a hit a guy with like a six pack like the odds you getting a shot on the one ball the first opening ball they're so small because you break when you break the ball scatter randomly you don't know what's happened so the idea that a guy could run out 10 in a row seemed impossible so they put a million dollar insurance policy on it or Earl Strickland's is crazy dude from North Carolina and he does not give one tenth of one fuck okay so he's in there and he's playing in his tournament and he knows that there's a ten rack 1 million dollar challenge so he starts blasting 9 balls in running packages he's running 7 a not he's making half table length combinations on the nine ball I could saying shit he would never do if you're playing for a million dollars he's free stroking for a million dollars and he runs 11 racks not just 10 11 following combos and just or just running stupid rags banking out for the cheese when it's like unbelievable pool plan and they don't want to give him the money right because there's a definition of like running a rack like if you make a combination on the nine ball if it's like a three nine combination you know is that running the rack you know what did you what did you decide is it winning the game because nine ball is a game where you run one ball to the two ball to the three ball you always got to hit the lowest numbered ball on the table everything is wild and so I would say it's a game of packages putting packages the guy the odds of a guy putting together 10 racks what happened they did they had to settle out of court they had to give him like a percentage of the cheese they didn't give it all to them but unfortunately the world you know will never know how crazy that is because if you've never played pool you don't know how insane that is it's like getting like 18 holes in one doesn't even make sense I got a fuck did he do that how the fuck did he run 11 racks in a row on tight tables for a million dollars it's like people reach those weird Heights and those weird Cassius Clay versus Cleveland big cat Williams Heights when you watch a guy perform and do Jesus Christ like we just hit some new level and just hit some some new revolutions per minute that's never been achieved before but people don't understand that shit so they to me pool is like it's an art form that the only people that appreciate it with people that do it if you don't play pool you're not gonna appreciate it and you think a lot of less people play pool yeah that's not true Joe I mean I I play pool the other day but but you need to take it to another level you take a look through this dirty level or no well my pool was my my Savior my bridge between getting injured and martial arts and becoming a stand-up comedian pool was my bridge because I had tore my ACL and I was still like I was still competing and then when I tore my ACL I had like a six-month downtime where I had to do rehab but on that chest and that was the time that I got addicted to pool was during my rehab because I can still walk around I got a pool wasn't a stress on my knee and I became fast but it's not easy to do and so I went from this this incredibly psychotic connection to martial arts to this incredibly psychotic connection to that so it became like a way for me to get out all of these ideas that I have in my head about like about like competing against things and about like knocking in things and controlling things it's like a vehicle no I can't like anything else is you see you ever see badass badminton players he was thinking some dude told me to check out high level badminton online my quads and he's like you'd be surprised like there's all these fakes and all these different movements I'm like okay yes yeah it's crazy it's but if you don't know if you I bet if you play badminton you like god damn bad mittens the shits right but if I asked you hey Shane Smith would you like to play badminton with me you play can I call you back which we playing badminton the fuck are you talking about that's a dead man's game what are you living in 1970 what do you have and a white man when was the highlight in this country never and never happened forever it's a golf game I mean it's a lawn game that's some shit you do in your backyard when was a croquette though if you wanna do some coke hey I'm down but when was a big I don't even know what there was nothing it's like tennis it's kind of tennis but with your ball who is this guy why is he holding up ten fingers he's trying to get me out of here what do you got did snacks what do you have to get woody where you going next I have to go have a business dinner what times that we probably missed it how dare you it's only 4:00 p.m. in Hawaii all right it's 7:00 I thought it was like I would have said it was 2:00 in the morning it should be this should be she should never bring these other people with no don't bring them anymore they probably cause problems they want control things hold up fingers tell you about schedules this is all nonsense you're done you done mushrooms you know what I'm saying don't fucking bullshit me here okay that's ten fingers and nonsense this this is eternity right here this okay this is encrypted some day this would be the project is on a cave wall no I always like that with the day Shane Smith drop science day we all figured it out the day we realized that we're like a couple of years away from getting our shit together I hope so do you or you let's be out of business bro will you do you know write stories about nice times flowers and shit blowjobs yes flowers and hand jobs and ice cream how to give the best hand job with a flower and how to go gluten-free all those things is that the future what is that why'd you play an elephant okay sometimes you have ideas in your head and what you need to do is you need to count to ten and at the end of that ten if you have any doubt whatsoever that this is a good idea don't do it okay that's my advice to you okay I like to work with restrictions I like to work with little landmines and roadblocks and that's what he's here for okay keeps me on my toes I know it doesn't make sense to most people but I think I have Toxoplasma I'm just dealing with it dealing with the best I can how has been husband stop with the sound effect was the Adam Carolla Show oh sure no he did no he did this is some Katt Williams Jamie Foxx type shit okay um how's hp/lb going you enjoying it yeah they're nice I really like the show man look a man by the way on-demand yeah oh cool HBO's the greatest they have the greatest the two greatest in the history of humanity the two greatest shows ever Wow The Sopranos in Game of Thrones yeah there's no second that's it there's not even a Deadwood how dare you dare you wire I heard the wires really good by wires you know what I never I never watched more than two episodes of The Wire and I didn't enjoy it but I never got into it but Deadwood I was like I don't believe they swore that much oh yeah I love Deadwood Game of Thrones is awesome awesome those are two best in my opinion my two favorite all-time but I gotta be honest it sounds crazy but that fucking Showtime show the terrorists guy what does that show a home homeland homeland oh yeah that is right fucking up there right fucking up there and Walking Dead is and isn't theirs episode of The Walking Dead you like is this the Six Million Dollar Man then I go back a fucking time and my watch is Steve Austin fighting Bigfoot this shit is retarded there's this episodes of The Walking Dead be like who wrote this one find him tell him to stop tell him to stop whose idea was this how did this happen but then there's other one we had a guy our in to watch just to me it's like they're making there's no more clothes they're making uh the woman from the Gilmore Girls Lord of the radio they're doing Lord of the Rings every week like they're literally doing it Lord doing something is better better than Lord of the Rings because but the thing about Lord of the Rings and I mean by the way I should state this I'm a huge dormer and our our Tolkien dork that's the name all right JRR Tolkien I know I had it wrong Lord of the Rings I read the moment I was a young boy and I remember them being like you know amazing amazing like just escapes from life and I was a huge fan of their work but the problem is that these books are incredibly long and to condense them into a movie and keep the subtle nuances of story like one of the beautiful things was like the-- the struggle of Bilbo Baggins carrying this ring and the whole that there's so much there's so much to it and hundreds and hundreds of pages that to try to condense that to a movie you're gonna you're gonna miss a lot of what made it cool yeah so that's why the Hobbit was to me a little bit I mean I had to see it it's my duty as a fan to see it but it was like and then this happens and then that happens like I don't I don't feel invested I don't feel it's like I feel like you're rushing this whole idea and I'm not I'm not connecting with it know what Game of Thrones are like here's a fucking dragon better and there's some shit coming now from the fucking Antarctica and they go gangster is all humanly possible they make the Sopranos look like Sesame Street well red wedding was goddamn don't say anymore swell our spoiler alert there it's just an amazing show and I think that that's one of the cool downsides to or cool upsides to the downside of the film industry yeah it's harder and harder for the film industry to try to what is that bad men that men it's harder and harder for the film industry it's harder for people with original ideas to get the main hold on that just happened yeah somebody made that yeah on mine as we were selling our are it's not like well yeah you'd not respect me if I was like one of my standard blinds you know dog I've been talking about badminton I've been talking shit on badminton since way back but do we find out the Golden Age no we never did it never happened just it was an idea but the pros like they are really badass if you watch like really high level ping-pong guys you'll be fucking impressed on is crazy fuck yeah how far do they get away from the table like I get really far away ping pong guys have to cuz that shit is coming and crazy you got to be able to dart in and dart out you got to have these explosive fast twitch muscle fibers and a lot of tech near the Howard Howard Cosell of the daedalic is you're like now calling the greatest ping-pong game I've ever heard yeah more retard that's what it is into the I don't like other sports oh come on professional people I said to you America versus China ping-pong championship you can I don't have enough things that there's too many things that I'm obsessed with already the last thing I want to do if it was getting pong North America versus North Korea for war war but they have to play a game of ping pong whoever wins you have to call it yes sure I'm the patriot yeah I would do that I think that would be interesting too but that would be that would be like full-on running man I wouldn't go no it's fucking wouldn't go well they'll probably pay more attention to badminton and they're closer to death so probably real problematic here going back to what material yeah I've been doing some old shit I was he putting them hmm the Badminton all those games that are like really old that have been around for a long time polo and shit like how much longer can polo keep going at a certain point I'm gonna run out a racer you know what the weird thing about is they don't actually play polo they don't know what do they do but if it happens they hire the dudes this is the whole thing I was like because we were you know Coachella's on the Polo Grounds right so we went out early to film this thing they're like oh this polo here and it's all these Argentinian ringers and Uruguayan ringers that the guys filled our teams with they pay like I don't know hundreds of thousand dollars to have the team and then they but they don't play themselves they hire a young buck to go out and play and you're like what are you doing so they hired a guy like a wild dude to ride their horse yeah and whack their ball yeah yeah so they're essentially they're the people that own horses and teams or they have someone represent them individually is that what it is yeah it's a it's a sport of ringers it sounds like doosh doosh central afterwards do people ever like how many how many more years can polo keep going yeah I give you like fine I'll do it was like super in Nepal I don't think you I don't think it can't keep going you know it comes from my cache or whatever which is you know with the guy's head or really yeah well that makes him way better or also they now they deal with like a sheep a sheep head or a sheep an actual she you have to like pull the sheep through the field Wow with like hooks or something how do you hook up you with your hand yeah you hold you resounding grab it and the horse runs yeah and then the other people try to get the chute it's like it looks like polo but with a sheep those people need the Internet but that's what photo came from they need the Internet but to your question I don't think it'll last much longer yeah there's a lot of those those old school sports you like come on son the decathlon really all right really Bruce Jenner what else we got what's to know the oldest poorly fook how about curling that shit they do in Canada you guys push those weird-looking hockey pucks across the ice brooms yeah and they they sweep they sweep the ice get it nice and clean so the thing really slides yeah HIGHlarious it's one of the most hilarious sports of all time watching that you're like God yeah the best what are these these people living up here where it's cold as fuck they're like it's got to be more cool shit we can do in the cold like look like when you start fucking with curling I'm like fuck you curling is awesome they're like let's slide smooth Rock yeah that should be way better than like animated movies or interesting books painting oh yeah how did that become like a big sport and get so big that it became in the Olympics cuz curling is in the Olympics I don't know that's pretty insane yeah how else does it it's like Canadians and who else we always win so let's just do it it you're winning one of the craziest games all of all time maybe Finland Finland fuck Finland man I don't really mean that so tell my Finnish friends I'm sponsored I would have said fuck Denmark if he said Denmark I don't mean that either I don't mean that neither are they good at it they're good at it Denmark is good it's a handle it's got a handle on a fucking I don't even know what's happened we're talking about curse no the problem is is there was this one drunk podcasted went south no it's perfect in DOS I have now it went south great people we love them which okay about this fine man to fuck America fuck fuck let's go I don't mean anything I'm saying we're just talking shit this is called talking shit if you love me I can talk shit about you you could talk shit about me we're playing yeah we're not being serious we don't really need fuck Denmark I'm I have no animosity den see jokes and I even good jokes we're just swinging at air folks trying to make you happy okay no one's trying to hurt anybody's feelings especially not strange people from some frozen country filled with douchebags I'm just kidding I made that part up smells like queefs did you just made that up he made that up I don't even support him he's never been there no shit you know what if I put C smells like fish that means there's old come inside of it allegedly yeah no I just mean she's got fish in her pussy you know no shit but you've all been with that you have a fight about this the last time I highly doubt that I think we did we have five kind of sperm so no no's actually there is no sperm fighting together sperm it was unfortunately disproved because it's a beautiful theory the idea that there's some sperm that serve the only purpose they serve is to kill a fighting I'm fighting that's not true apparently it was one guy wrote a book it's been pretty much as I've gotta say I don't want it to be disproven I don't want it to be disproven either that's the problem I'll do it with this new show I'm doing there's a lot of shit that gets just proven that don't really want to be disproven I goddamn it really I don't know if it was you but I told somebody I said there's two types of sperm one that goes for the egg and one that fights this firm they said now that's not true but the penis is shaped like a plunger to scoop out the sperm that's in there really yes that is true that is absolutely true I was about to say if you're saying that there's not two times it's firm but yet the plunger shits well same the shape that's in violent we not screwing with the plunger but the two types of sperm not right are you talking about dolphin come I can't remember was a dog shit I was covered in oh yeah you know that yeah you know god damn well I covered in dolphin come I told I actually touched a Dolphins vagina on mushrooms at zero oh that's that's frowned upon well no we were allowed to touch it and I didn't know that the vagina was shut like it like you can't see it when it shut just a line yeah and so I was like oh that would hold up in court except with like you talked about it before you went down fuck you creaver dolphin creeper he didn't remember what he talked about he like if they want to take him to court for dead Linum dolphin they would say we would like to take you back to the April 2011 party if you indeed say I wanted to do it also let's being inside their asshole no sir oh my god I can't remember that I think that was uploaded on YouTube right for a your honor it was at that time I bought the Kodak picture CDs so they want to have it so the principle behind this guy's idea of sperm Wars is that somehow another sperm were competing for them you know for dominance again and that some sperm were sent in to kill the sperm yeah but according to most interpretations of the work online what they're saying is that there's really like shitty research and that they can't really prove that sperm serve any other function other than penetrating an egg and then some sperm just died and like this is bad research really yeah yeah and there's there's never they haven't shown here here's a perfect one no evidence for killer sperm or other selective interactions between human spirit is OMA in spermatozoa in ejaculates of different males in vitro so there's no evidence of them actually trying to kill each other inside there which makes sense like how could sperm be so complex that can not only impregnate someone which is incredibly complex like conveyors of a genome right and then also they can kill yeah it's a good idea like for to write a book but it doesn't make sense but neither does anything uses eyesight how does it know how the ability to smell farts how's that make sense you can't see him you smell them it doesn't make sense how can you hear something wait it's Simon they're like what is it you're hearing what does it mean I'm not sure it doesn't make sense but it's real hearing things the idea that you can be tell in what direction you just drag that Jack Daniel's bottle across the table I could tell by my hearing that doesn't make sense nothing makes sense in my right how much talking shit could be both but I don't think this killer sperm thing is real all right wasn't it argue in you in this round Moriarty I wish it was true I believe in it more than Bigfoot do you believe in it more than Scientology no Santana he's legit if you have money you can buy rankings and some fake Church thing you don't believe in Bigfoot at all mm-hmm you don't believe in Big L no I don't believe in Bigfoot that's the dumbest shit ever I mean lik look at Charlie Sheen with his little nach Ness Loch Ness monster shit Charlie Sheen yeah he just went down to go find the Loch Ness monster guess why do you can't find it yeah they must have good crack at the bottom of the ocean you know it sounds cooler I believe that there is a Godzilla that sounds cooler hmm Island or something that makes sense Brian go slip know like that makes more sense than fucking Bigfoot why does that make less sense why yeah tell me just as a complete outsider because like it's been already but half the big old Bigfoot like videos and stuff I've already been just proven that it's been just hoaxes Wow and it's just everyone's just trying to make this bullshit thing be real when it really it's just a bunch of hoaxes well there's definitely a lot of hoaxes I mean yeah there might be a monkey that lives in the woods but that's not the put that everyone else is talking about everyone else is talking about all these hoaxes so like to believe and input to those two things together it's just it's just like all right move on let's worry about something else that's real like AIDS well I'll tell you what like doing this show that I've been doing and actually going and looking for Bigfoot I hear you 100% but I also go hmmm the weirdest thing about looking for Bigfoot is I went into it semi seriously I went into it for the sci-fi show and my idea was that you know what man I really would like for Bigfoot to be real Jane Goodall says Bigfoots real I mean she really believes he believes 100% she's absolutely sure there's no discovered primary said by the uniformity of the sightings by the fact that Gigantopithecus was a real animal that mimicked the size shape the fact that it was bipedal it only lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago and this is just the bones that they found they didn't find those bones to the 1920s so it leaves a giant window of possibility then you go there and I'm telling you man you go to the Pacific Northwest and you walk around you go oh no one knows what's up here I mean you get out there we went to Mount Rainier and we went into the woods you just take a road into the woods the dirt road you go a couple miles down and that's what we started to make camp and you go off in the woods from there you're in another dimension you're gonna goddamn avatar movie I'm een and it goes on for thousands and thousands of square miles but there's a lot of people walking those woods and I don't like walking the Bryan I'm telling you the the penetration by human beings is extremely limited you'd have to go there to understand it I joked around about it before we actually went there but once I once I was actually there and Duncan and I went wandering through the woods we're like oh well nobody knows what the fuck is up here like literally you we sent these drones with cameras above the woods to get a few and you're talking about just an inci like to the horizon as far as you can see and no one's there it's just dense trees like a box of q-tips it sounds so silly that there's a crazy monkey living in the woods it sounds so silly but the reality is no one knows what the fuck is out there so why again do you like chimps and gorillas so much and no sorry hate them so much but love I know I don't foot I don't hate any of them I don't hate or freaked everybody but obsessed with Bigfoot and where was well it's also I know that human beings are dangerous I know I know a lot of dangerous human beings physically dangerous mentally dangerous human beings can be very dangerous so the potential for destruction trying to manage and mitigate that it's fascinating to me right and then you see something that takes it to a complete different level like a gorilla and how about Sasquatch well I was gonna say one of the fascinating things is about they're obviously not as smart as us so and whether they get instead will they get the ability to swing from branch to branch and fly from tree to tree that's what a chimp gets what does the gorilla get well he gets to lie on the ground cuz doesn't give a fuck he's not worried about Jaguars Jaguars best step to fuck away from a gorilla nobody wants to fuck with the gorillas Lions don't want to fuck with a gorilla elephants don't want to fuck with a gorilla they look at it and they go oh Jesus Christ let's just go over here that's what they do so I think there's that you know there's the the there's this idea that there's this weird sort of balance to the world and these dumb motherfuckers eating what water roots and pulling them out there are the strongest things I've ever lived if you had a like a gorilla football team that could that fucking team would be undefeated throughout human history I love all of it I'm look I'm fascinated by everything they can kill me everything that's dangerous everything that's that's wild because I think that we're too used to these things we just accept the fact I went to the zoo recently I was in Colorado but like dysentery or limes Lyme disease is terrifying man I tweeted something about Lyme disease recently why disease is fairly recent it's only been the last few decades that people have either been diagnosed by this or contracted this but Lyme disease is terrifying it's also been connected to more gel ins you know more gel on says it's crazy disease or you have these fibers growing out of your poly it's been connected to hyper keratinization but that's what's that's what's terrifying to me is that shit yeah it's horrifying well the flu is horrified this is all stuff that we're covering on on my new show - there's a there's a whole episode on diseases and the idea of these these these 28 days later type scenarios right how possible is it is bioterrorism bio martyrs the idea that someone can you know give someone a disease and send them on a plane right these are all things that are being considered like I am not in any way shape or form in support of the government being able to read your emails if the whole thing is just douche tastic but if you really thought there was some 28 days later shit coming or the potential of stopping it was only achieved through monitoring everything you'd be interested in doing it sure I just think that the problem is is you the result is these sort of bureaucrats with just how i'ma call amounts of power yeah of course of course it's always at some point you have to say well there has to be some sort of privacy there has to be some sort of democracy there has to be some sort of something and and and sure like they should get better at at data gathering but they shouldn't watch all of our shit all the time it's also like who's who gets to do this like are these regular people or are they the most moral of of all of us have they been proven to be the most qualified to sort of dispense knowledge and have a gambling debt I'll just go talk to this guy cuz I know everything about is shit yeah it might be that yeah any 20-grand do that people people yeah but but some people know everything about other people but I think that I'm certainly not in favor of all this happening but what I what I am and what I am excited about is the debate I'm excited about the debate of information and distribution of information and the discussion on possibilities of controlling it and if they're even viable because that becomes a I think that becomes a real question so what do you think it's known I don't know I have these wit my ideas vary wildly and none of them are substantial like substantiate able whatever that word is you can't I mean you can't um III think you can't really make an accurate prognosis I think there's a lot of people that are viewing what this exponential course of technology is gonna take us to but all but I wonder ethically like wiki WikiLeaks versus non WikiLeaks so so they leaked it and we know but it's weakening us but they leaked it and we know more and actually it started this whole nother thing that we I'm gonna take it to a even crazier level oh I think Bunny itself is going to be invalid I think we're gonna reach a point in time where information is so freely distributed that money is essentially information at this point ones and zeros accumulated on hard drives and databases they don't really mean anything anymore we're not it's not like one dollar is one paper note is one pound of gold it doesn't mean that anymore right so you in this weird stage where everything's digital and the trend seems to be at least to me to the uneducated trying to follow it the trend seems to be for a dissolving of all the barriers between people and information and if money becomes information which is what it is it's just ones and zeros how are you gonna stop people from controlling and maybe dispensing that want those ones and zeros and if something comes along during that process of confusion of integration something comes along that sort of read distributes people's competitive edges and turns them into a social thing and it says listen the money thing we're gonna do out there my thing let's just like sort of evenly spread it out like that's a real possibility when what do you think of Bitcoin then um I don't know too much about it I don't know about how secure it is how how much it could be manipulated I wonder if idealistic people who get involved in some sort of a counterculture currency how much how much can that currency be manipulated by someone who truly understands finances sure how much of it can be just a new pawn in a new game that we fuck up and we hacked a new pac-man so it's or they shut it down yeah it could be that too they could sabotage it they can tank it there's a lot of weirdness to any sort of a new currency but it's exciting that someone's willing to entertain the possibility you know but it's scary too because the people that are in control of this world they're not gonna let go lightly and that's the problem you shouldn't trust Xbox Live currency more than a Bitcoin you know like I really trust it more like keep my money yeah Xbox Live Points yeah the bitcoin is like man where's that gonna go I don't know I hold the problem with it is that it's it's you know obviously an alternative currency so people are using it for a different shit and they're saying well how long till they shut them down but they're saying well we're gonna operate in such a way that you can't shut us down well it's it's very interesting anything that happens on the internet where you know you go all anonymous see you go all free ball and you go out there Bitcoin you know you just you realize that these people are coalescing and they have these ideas that make your plans okay here's a new currency oh boy what happens now what is it doing when is someone gonna just say hey let's all meet in Sweden we got a spot it's thousand acres and start building houses that's like that's one of those things I think has happened throughout human history there's there's a reason why America exists and these people that are like so Pro America but anti change have to understand there's only one reason why this spot is populated by white people that's because England sucked it was fucking terrible it was a mess and they've gotten to this breaking point where people like we got to get the fuck out we got to risk our lives to get on a boat we have to get through the ocean and survive plague we have to get over there this is not gonna work anymore and that that's a trend that created in my opinion is the greatest nation the world has ever known and that trend needs to continue it doesn't mean it's bad for the people in power it just means they have to understand that growth has to be achieved and we have to move on and when things are illuminated that show very clearly that there's inequities that things were all wrong they have to be corrected you can still make money everybody can make money just cut the shit you know you got to understand what's moral and what's ethical and what's not and when things become really transparent you can't get away with just fucking putting bulletproof vests on people and sending them out with guns you got to come up with answers you gotta you got to tell people yeah I know we're in control but we're trying to evolve as well we're growing as well we're human beings as well we've made mistakes we're on a bad path we've been following the momentum of barbarous people from the beginning of time to today and maybe we didn't realize the repercussions of our actions the fact that we would perhaps be even happier if we didn't engage them and then slowly the dust settles mmm that's the rosy picture that's the rosy picture of humanity yeah is that the crazy monkeys meet in the middle of the street and they go all right we don't need to do this anymore right okay how do I don't want this is not making me happy find another fucking outlet and find an outlet for that all those assholes that are out there blowing up the world they need you Jitsu in their lives they need to go around choking people you know they need to take a multi-class get their ass kicked stop trying to dominate the planet that's just ridiculous damn let's some preaching right there if I was me I'd download this podcast deleted immediately it's very important I'm like we all know this I know you know this somebody doesn't know that though that's the problem sir so if they did know it it's not happening at a certain point in time when you say things that you would like to happen but they don't happen people go we full good stop with your utopian bullshit I don't think it's a bad idea I think it's a bad idea didn't be nice to each other I don't think it's a bad idea to figure out a better way to control the resources of the world that's because you know you grow up you're older you're like you know not just fight let's just Hey look could you imagine if you imagine if you were the head of like you know some gigantic oil company or some huge bank and you're just making just ungodly sums of cash like you're strapped onto a roller coaster and you're flying down through a river of million dollar bills just covering you constantly you're absorbing money every second of the day just constantly buying Mercedes and Bentley's and private jets and getting your dick sucked and it's almost in time intoxicating and impossible to get off that ride does that right it's so fun you you no one no one questions you you're walking around you have a million Butler's and you just tell everybody what the fuck to do and you get in your jet and you fly to Paris and you do whatever you want that's that's that's the people that have the most money in this world that's where they're at they're at this ridiculous position where no one should have ever let them get to the point where they gonna have a boat that's 700 feet long like what happened there like what did you do you moved numbers around that's how you got a boat did you even sell anything hold on who's making the most out of it well it's a lot like India we said earlier on the show like there's a billion and a half dollar house coming out of a slum why are they fucking saying no no we'll be taking this now this will be our shit and it's the same thing here it's like okay you know what sighs a guy who does a hedge fund who's hedging against the economy who has a 400 foot yacht okay I know it's credit against us well he figured out a way to manipulate the system and extract money in some weird way it's legal you know and he's allowed to like be a baller dude I mean the guy in India how did he make that money what is he doing I mean but I certainly think that the Indian way of dealing with it is more appealing personally I'll just go home that's what he did you know I don't think the way to do it is to write up every time someone is more than trying to steal their Robin yeah that doesn't work she doesn't work what does work Shane Smith and all the years you've seen on Vice what what do you think works what's like the best system in this country in this world rather I'm Canada no I mean anywhere will you make a lot of money it's gonna be okay that's the best system yeah like if you go to Switzerland everything's great and works and is clean and nice and Germany toilets and stuff yeah but Switzerland in particular because it's small and it's rich so like if you go to a toilet there it's awesome if you go to like you know and you know I need something whatever that's awesome right health care or whatever but you know it's small and rich that's the thing is small and rich is good yeah well you know if you're gonna if you're gonna pay you know for for those things for a public benefit then it has to be rich yeah the solely you think like European countries like Switzerland like that well I mean I mean what I'm saying is is those countries are like where you see something that works like you know it works because it costs a lot of money to make it work and if you when it doesn't work when you go to countries that don't have a lot of money the system doesn't work because it breaks down there's a there's an also debate in this country about like how difficult is getting to Canada and I've talked to my friends about this so I'm like I think it's good if you were running a great country like Canada you would you want people to come in that have had it was in America is it I don't know cuz I only know one way but I know that Canada won't let you in if you have a DUI our friends that have a DUI they can't get into Canada that's the same with States is it yeah it makes it has any criminal record you can't even that makes sense so they're fairly equal but so smaller richer countries where like Switzerland where they get their money from don't banks Bank the many knives and make cool knife make good cheese what they doing for money really all right what is uh swingers okay we're gonna move wrap the side and I think I'm get you guys have to get you out of here yeah do you have something else to do you doing something else tonight alright yeah how are they gonna deal with the fact that you're all fucked up they're used to it that's what I'm saying yeah although like I'm like yeah I gotta go you know see my buddy and they're like what are you doing really and I'm like well I have a friend like you know I'm gonna do oh I'm gonna do Rogan they're like oh you're not coming you're not gonna make it better you're gonna make it okay everything's gonna be fine people need to relax about these silly things around our wrists okay these are just a suggestion a certain time in place when you get to a certain age if you really still have to listen to that you've made a mistake okay at a certain point in time unless she's catching a flight those fucking things and they know you got better they got people that have them that's even more baller than actually having a watch you have another dude who wears the watch like I don't want to be burdened by metal tell me when my meeting arises so I can collect more ones than zero watch can fart yeah there you go makes sense kids got knowledge dude look thanks for awesome whoever your friend
