so Jamie Vernon has some Facebook stock for sale he's got a he's uploaded at the Craig's old take it take it off my hands I think it'll bounce back if you guys don't know what we're talking about Facebook apparently Jamie you were the one who first told me about it once you filtered a well from what I saw there's something going on I think the company's called Cambridge analytic which what I've also then learned is that Steve Bannon used to be the VP of this company but that was before he was in the Trump campaign yeah they are responsible for scraping millions of users personal information I think through a couple apps maybe like a like a personality app if someone took a personality quiz right look at those on line clicks eight polls yeah so but let's be those are morons that answer those things right for the most part or people are super bored and that's how you get most of the time how you get your Facebook like passwords stolen is from those things oh yeah yeah or from sneaky emails to tell you your accounts been compromised please reenter your password well it doesn't say Facebook on the URL they they can be sneaky with their URLs to like put something in front of it and then Facebook and you're like God looks like Facebook you know so the FTC is looking into this case right now apparently as of yesterday and what I read is they face up to potentially forty thousand dollar fine for every infraction which would total over two million two trillion dollars I'm sorry the tea trillion so it's theirs their stock has tanked I think it was like 8% yesterday it's at eight and a half so far today it's down to one hundred and sixty five dollars a share was like a hundred eighty-five two days ago so and then a lot of people then are also now talking about just getting rid their Facebook account altogether I talked about this last night I'm on the actual offense of doing that just because I can't take it anymore that's the only place I go to where it's just I get annoyed I get in fights I have to see my sister talk about Trump every day you know like it's just I get it just upsetting out it's a very good forum for people that are into political arguments like political arguments gay rights arguments there's a lot of like that's like one of the last places where it's okay to say that you don't think gay people should be married yes it's like you know I know I just know some people that I probably shouldn't know anymore yeah and occasionally you know we're on my real Facebook page which I never go to look I go to it once a year it's a lot and that's where all the fake news stuff is like I thought Pam Anderson died the other day and it was just one of those fake news stories and that's always where you find it is on Facebook well whenever you go and read an article and those those things at the bottom they're like you should see what she looks like now and there's like 30 of them like wait a minute like they just throw and shit at you they just literally elect come on you're gonna bite on one of these come on what is it a Kevin Costner you can't believe what he looks like that remember that girl from precious you can't believe it does it work though you check so every so often no I don't need more I'd say got me a few times in the early days I thought that those were below see it's a sneaky thing because they took the place of real stories it's like it used to you go to CNN and everything would be CNN but now you go to CNN everything CNN up until a line and then below the line it's like sponsored content like wait wait wait this isn't this is so sneaky because this is barely an ad this is like an article on CNN that takes you to some new place and every page like you have to keep changing pages and every page is like one paragraph like one paragraph on what Kevin Costner was like in 1980 okay yeah what about 81 boom next page an 81 Kevin Costner started to gain weight yeah and then there's usually not the photo that you want to see you know like that thumbnail has like Kevin Costner his head blown apart right I want to see that picture right in there it's not even in there it's fake clickbait yeah that insists that in snapchat I think should go I might be out done with Walter does snapchat Rihanna Chris Brown thing is crazy the fact that somebody greenlit that it cost them almost a billion dollars like instantly weren't they down like some eight hundred million dollars or some fucking insane number yeah I mean I was yeah the second time that's happened in a couple weeks yeah one of them was like Kylie Jenner saying it sucks right yeah the hottest Kardashian so eight hundred million they dropped after Rihanna condemned ad making light of domestic violence so the question was in that poll would you rather slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown like oh gee maybe this look at that of course everyone likes to punch like what's the slap Rihanna there's a lot of dudes there's a lot of assholes out there there's got to be probably a sizeable percentage of the people clicked slap Rihanna just because they don't like their life bitch I would like to see that with the results where of this yeah well you would have to join the abandoned administration and they get you involved in Cambridge analytics and you gotta give up your fingerprints I don't know how anybody could say yeah put that on snapchat like that seems so fucking insane that seems like a joke like in a movie you know well like you talk about like a clueless executive you know like this is my idea what do you think lots of clicks lots of clicks you know cut to him with a sad face holdings boxes stuff as he's being kicked out of his office and stay out you know it doesn't seem like something that something is huge as snapchat how could they do that they've been fucking I mean the whole redesign they did recently it already was confusing and annoying to begin with but no news it at all now it's even worse and like everything even had a website where you know every repetition to switch back I think they got up to a million user saying we want the old snapchat back and they're right now it's it's better now we're not listening to you oh well Instagram listened right they went back to things being in chronological order did they do that they tested it I was like a beta test it hasn't happened for everyone yet but it probably will happen or it's gonna become an option soon yeah nobody likes this nonsense I look at my feed from real recent and it says I'll look at someone's post I was like this is yesterday and then I look at the time it says 26 hours ago I'm like what in the fuck is that hey why are you showing me something from a day ago yeah like or I'm gonna be here tonight and that was from like three days ago this concert I've never seen this Joe this way might recently just snapchat uh opened up their map it's called the snap map so these are where'd the hot zones are where snaps are taking place right now why yeah it's like a stalker map for people that don't have everything private but like this is Universal Studios so it's a hot zone it's the Hollywood and Highland hot zone over here and UCLA hot zone where all the kids are right so you can like watch where trends are things are happening while they're happening or whatnot makes sense I mean that they can track that in those spots I would assume you know like Disneyland right it's got to be a hot zone like anywhere there's a giant population area but what I don't even know what the fuck a snap is is it just like a picture just against a gram yeah it's like Instagram and second make sure video whatever but it goes away if you want it to doesn't have to anymore a used to that used to be the idea appeared yeah but everyone competed and so now they have to they'll keep it around right so funny how privacy has changed over the years remember AOL one or two where you used to have member directory where you just type in your address and we'll show you all the users near your house and then you could just instant message these people out of the blue and go hey you look cute I live down the street from you you want to hook up like that's how like they even showed where you were when we were talking about this yesterday with Kurt Metzger we were talking about Barry Crimmins how Barry Crimmins you know Barry Crimmins has a there was a documentary that Bobcat made for him about him called they call me lucky as it was called or just lucky call me lucky call me lucky anyway in the documentary it details his battle with AOL where a o L was allowing people to trade child porn and they had a policy where three strikes in your own so you could trade trade child porn yeah you can trade child porn three times like and it's fucking insane and he he actually was a big part of that trial and bringing it to trial Wow yeah that the thing is insane that that wasn't that long ago that was 20 years ago twenty years ago you could trade child porn on AOL Jesus like and if you got caught they just said hey don't do that again like now they come to your fuck in house and they lock you up like it's really interesting how much that's advanced you know this is what I was going to show you guys a second ago this I just saw the story yesterday that never before they thought iPhones could be cracked and now this company has this little box which it's not that expensive fifteen thousand dollars gets the police three hundred license unlocks and they can spend double and you have unlimited unlocks and it will unlock every iPhone and newer than an iPhone 5s it said if they're pricing structures weird because if you get the fifteen thousand one you're only allowed to do it at a location that it's like geofence ten you're not allowed to do it anywhere else hold on so you just said newer than an iPhone 5s you can five 5s and newer and newer up up to right so if you just have a five I can't do shit would be the older operating system I think people phones anymore it's just so convenient to do things on your phone that's part of the problem you know what I take you're taking their doing lately using Apple pay the grocery store what's so exciting it's cool exciting it's like I'm living in the future I double-click it sees my face you know oh I just bought one of those little square devices you know so like if you're selling shirts after a show or something and it has that built into it so you could just people just using your iPhones on it whoa yeah $20 device you get on Amazon that's crazy you know with your iMac is good too yeah it's a your iMac yeah if you buy something on your iMac and it's linked to your phone it'll just like you when use Apple pay and then you pull out your phone and confirm oh well my laptop ID is a fingerprint I don't feel like for Apple pay yeah yeah that's retina scan be paid with your Apple watch they're like a pimp yet jeez that's too much so I mean like this is gotta be escalated right so the people they're sitting back the forecasters they're looking like what is technology gonna be in ten years like what are they saying what's their predictions because this is uh it's getting into your body somehow it's coming in one of the holes it's like a dude right now rubbing his dick on the outside trying to find a place to stick it in he's got it on your wrist he's got it in your pocket he's he's trying to get it in your bodies got it in your ears they're putting you know earbuds in like those air pods are the best you do fucking Siri with a DoubleTap on your air pods it knows when you're taking them out of your ear so it pauses your music or yes that's incredible they're incredible and they don't fall out when you work out either I thought that was gonna be a problem we're not as good they're not as good for working out but the what what is is what's actually even better to me is that for the sound as those beats threes I got those wireless beats once those things hook over your ear with that little rubber thing and they they lock in place so you get a serious workout in with those on the air pods there they do fall off they do fall off occasionally they have these skins to to make it a little tighter on Amazon yeah it's just like just like generic thing that goes over its kind of tighten it up in your ear it's an awesome idea it's not perfect it would be perfect if they hooked onto your ear but then they wouldn't be fitting into that box so it's almost like they can't be perfect because like part of the thing is that they fit in a little tiny ass box you pop it open it's got a little green light on and it's a battery pack too and it's magnetic I mean shit that's slick that's slick no one saw that coming either that's one of those weird ones where nobody saw it coming you know I wasn't really necessary no one's thought into being necessary until someone made it everything I tell you it's not necessary that home pod they release that thing is just a dump it thing sucks I mean it sounds amazing but serious so stupid compared to Alexa it's weird is it Alexis just smartest fuck and so Amazon's Alexa Siri and then there's what about the Google home have you tried that one yeah I think I heard that one supposed to be better too I think I think it probably is I mean it's if it's the same as the Android phone line it's good series like that girl that was really hot but decided to stop working out you know and she's like she's still pretty hot but then all these other girls are going to the gym all the time yeah look at them like look at her butt though look at her legs and series just kind of series kind of sloppy it's it's pretty annoying now how many times my Siri and my Alexis go off just from people going hey Siri you know like on a podcast or something and it just ruins everything yeah if you have it set like that I mean when we've probably triggered a ton of people just you doing that right there people always complain when I say that and then there's the hey Google complaint too same thing say hey Google when someone's got their system it should be what is the thing you say hey Google is okay okay you should be able to put anything you want though by now right you know fuckface yeah yes sir it should be fuckface and that would be the best just call your computer fuckface my Alexa did one of those things were out of the blue I think was in the news recently are you just sitting there and she just starts laughing yeah I heard about that like a witch yeah what is that I would shoot that thing I would take it outside and fill it full of holes fuck I can't fucking sleep with a robot laughing in my house fuck you it's you have to get a drink Milla night she also it's so weird how many Easter eggs she has like she she also has like seven songs now like like you go hey Siri send me a love song she will sing you a little one Alexa block Alexa yeah seeing Mia loves me because she loved songs ready yeah that she sings well and she is like a rap song and she has one about technology I always wonder what Stephen Hawking never upgraded his voice you didn't want to I think yeah I think I remember reading that oh yeah he liked keeping it that way yeah I get I get it that's why he kept it that way but I mean what kind of logic behind that is that maybe he just wanted to keep it creepy like if you he didn't want to he wanted to keep it obviously electronic whereas there's some places you can get to with some of these new voice things there was that movie she move Joaquin Joaquin Phoenix there was an interesting movie yeah they could have paid anybody to be his voice I would imagine at the time the technology figured out he could have been Samuel Jackson I mean yeah for Stephen Hawking yeah but it probably would sound off like this it wouldn't sound like a real conversation you know if y'all you know what I mean it's like you've heard them do that with voice like when they take people's voices they chop them up and try to piece together some sort of audio something that they didn't really say if they're being obvious about it but you know there's technology right now like Photoshop that's going to allow people to stitch audio together I believe we've talked about on the podcast before yeah it's getting better and better there's a radio lab episode where they showed where it's at now and it's one of those things where it's right now it's not ready it's still like if you heard it you'd go oh that's not Brian that's a fake conversation put together from a bunch of shit Brian said it's like that porn that fake porn that was that's even more crazy yeah because they could just take your face like take pictures and pretty seamlessly stitch your face onto the character with emotions with an opening mouth long linking and stuff I've seen some really good ones too like the girl from Harry Potter yeah well it's what they're doing with snapchat right when someone pretends to be Rick from the walking dead like D'Elia did that and I'm like god damn that's pretty close it's pretty close like I know that it's obviously that there's a thing going on here but it's pretty close to what it would really look like it's Fox good enough it's good enough making a whoa this wasn't around before like if somebody showed you that snapchat thing that all the girls do where they put dog faces on and shit and barf barf and pretend to be a puppy dog or unicorns or whatever someone showed you that just ten years ago you would be holy shit you wouldn't believe it you wouldn't believe it you would look at like that thing that lets you become Rick from The Walking Dead and you would go what the fuck man this is incredible if someone showed you that 1998 do help mind-blowing and groundbreaking that would be now it's a part of an app that's on your phone that sits in your pocket like what happened and how quick did this happen and which hole is it going in it's probably going to be a suppository just so that the Ale it's like a ironic like that the aliens have figured out a way to mock us while defeating us and the way is just to give you the most ultimate bliss with this tiny little robot deck you don't even feel it just put this robot dick in your butt suppository and because your butt doesn't have like skin something same it's like open tissue that's why it's so good for getting infected so this little robot can just in seamlessly interact with all that open tissue and that's how you connect with God they gotta talk us in just with the way they did with these Cambridge analytics they sneak you in the door you think it's a personality quiz you're really electing a dumb president you know the same thing you think well I'm just gonna go meet God no you're giving birth to the robot Empire do a little tiny robot dicks it's not impossible to think look we were willing to put glasses over our face so we could see better why would we put little little metal bullets up our butt if you found out that it makes life infinitely better it's like we can't believe that this is the case the only way to do it is up your butt you know we've we've tried in people a whole come on I'm not doing that and then a few guys do it and they're walking around your neighborhood and fuck it sparkles are coming out of their eyes it's so happy they're so happy they couldn't be happier and you're like god dammit I need to try it people are flying they're flying around your neighborhood because they have that robot dick yeah like Andy stump from this in the wingsuit they're doing that around your neighborhood but they control themselves and so because this robot dick that then space and times you have to do it once there's it every day keeping your house when you take it out of your ass then you become a normal human and then eventually they figure out a way to keep it in there yeah they like to bolt it to the wall your asshole have your strap where's your butt strap yeah you gotta get cleaned out every now and then shit gets caked on it on the way out it does it always gets a full signal to your skin you know yourself you have to have somebody do it I could do it to myself I'm not a pussy I need to go some doctor let's take a robot dick in my butt come on suck you like bungee jumping and your robot dick fell out and then also you know sadness in the middle of the day that would be crazy look we're already doing that with pills right people that are addicted to xanax and I know a few that shit apparently makes you feel great it's at the upper a downer that's the there's no no problems in the world drug that's it's an anxiety reliever and the people that take it man they get hooked on that shit Dom our air is very open about it he takes that shit every day he's so great he's great you had him last night on kill town he's the best of that no one's better at kill Tony the dumber yeah he's so quick you know and he knows like the most ridiculous shit to say yeah but he likes them xanax I know a lot of Stanhope like xanax - he's just joking around about if he got out of a plane and kissed the floor when he when he landed in America because he saw his antics on the ground they love those things I'm scared of that shit I don't want I don't want anything that makes me feel like there's no problems I think the only reason why why a lot of people don't do it is because they don't have a friend that has a bunch of xanax that's constantly giving them xanax or something cuz I never see pills or you know I'm not round that road at all it like alone I don't even what a xanax looks like you know you know but I bet if we had a friend that always had xanax on him always great many ones antics you know I bet that's how you get into it I think somebody just tells you you need to relax you know so much anxiety I mean the world is filled with possibility the world is filled with danger the world is filled with good things and bad things I mean there's a lot of shit going on if you don't have some anxiety it must be because you're just choosing to not pay attention like anybody who lives in New York City you live in New York City imagine all the shit that's going on around you all the time while you're just sitting there you're supposed to be aware of it just supposed to hope everybody keeps together you're supposed to help everybody's cool you're you're in your apartment you're on the 13th floor of a 60 floor building it's filled with people there's another one right next to it there's another one right next to that they go all the way down the street they're filled with people people are fucking everywhere and you're supposed to just be chilled out that doesn't make no sense to me man I'm I'm with you if you're nervous you're anxious you're driving in traffic everyday and people are on their phones and they're not paying attention and everything you eat gives you cancer you're not you're not anxious I don't understand you you should be anxious you know this is the argument for not living the way we live it's not the argument for taking a pill that kills that party that makes you anxious do you audibly sigh a lot mostly for humor yeah I don't audibly sigh like by myself like oh but I'll do it like that like for a joke oh I catch myself more audibly sighing more and more the order I get like just like little things where I'll just like look at something oh that kind of you know yeah but I didn't used to do that like I'm gonna go to oil boy there's a good one it's like the things I grew up with or even is it culture appropriation I have to ask my Jewish friends from LA to start saying oh eh yeah cuz like nobody ever got mad at anybody wasn't Italian you'd say ma tone my own this girl nobody cares about those you like the use of like fungal it isn't Jersey go to these coasts go to where those old-school guineas who landed on boats and fucked each other on the rocks and made a bunch of them and they all stayed there about fungal what's the Italian horn like if you're Italian shows you're a moron I don't know I don't know where it came from we all had him in high school though it was like if you had a gold chain with a horn like wow look at stylish did not know that thing existed it's called the comma Sela seen that sperm before well that's probably what it is called sperm little horn or horn litt sometimes abbreviated to Como is an Italian amulet or talisman worn to protect against the evil eye or malechie oh and bad luck in general and historically to promote fertility and virility that's the last thing we needs promote fertility and kids in high school wearing those things so it is a sperm yeah Oh Neapolitans called Combe we sell o or mmm variants thereof my sperm that's crazy it is just it's just between jizz on your chest essentially right the golden jizz from the evil eye you gave me an evil eye but I still got my nod off oh wait dad gave that's to me the fucking evil eye over here yeah what you wearing it right wear a pearl necklace and land - yeah it's foul what a foul little amulet imagine they talk those kids into wearing golden jizz around their neck and all these years they thought they that fucking evil eye could suck my dick about that hey I'm gonna go out I got a good amount of gold chains I got a good solid fucking horn here look at that okay Catholic priest probably give them to you I mean it looks like cum yeah it doesn't even look like a horn what kind of fucking horn is that where it's round on the top like a like a sperm head horns aren't round at the top it's it looks like it's swimming upstream like to the guys guys it's going in your mouth if you go back go back to those pictures of different ones is there anyone that has a flat top that looks like a fucking horn no all of them are rounded at the top like jizz those Italian horns they're all rounded at the top like jizz this is insane I don't see any of them that that's not an Italian horn I think that's the wrong anyone that's um that's some like Gucci shit like someone some designer got ahold of it the new take on the Italian horn it's all the rage everyone wears it everyone wears it yes I've got three on [Laughter] they do they can't help themselves they grew up in those communities I did it too I wore one you around a bunch of East Coast Italian people they're all wearing it you're all wearing it it's like oh you got your tallien horn and when I said when I saw the guy that had it on he took I go yeah I got in and kissed it you kissed the jizz this is my good luck jizz god bless you god bless hear what Saint you should be st. Peter right yeah right I mean it's gotta be which ones attached to it that's like we're like there's always affiliations like certain Saints are attached to certain you know fucking ridiculous it's all those ancient immigrant cultures but is it any different really than like looking back at like AOL in 1996 trafficking porn people are just way different now they're just way different like human beings are way more aware of shit today even if they're misinformed they're at least more aware of a lot of things in 1990 then then they were in 1994 1996 it's like I would say it's like a several fold increase in how much we're aware of and what we actually look at in the world it's just it's a completely different thing now don't you think oh yeah like what are we doing today that they're gonna look back on and go those fucking morons how did they do that besides circumcision circumcision is a big one the one day they can stop cutting baby dicks and they're gonna look back and go what in the fuck people this is crazy you look nice you're taking a baby day you don't want to stand out huh no I don't like the uncut ones man they freak me out I think we've talked about this but the way they look right yeah just the look judge I don't really don't think that affects you I've asked you're out there sucking dicks on the sneak tip asked and I've heard they smell more than a regular dick well I think you should wash your dick basically overall though anybody's dick yeah yeah but that's still crazy I bet if you trim pussy lips would be easier to take care of that thing too still crazy told you that it's just nuts assistant it's a nutty thing that we've just gotten a really accustomed to doing cutting skin off your dick like why what and the fact that the majority do that what they're gonna look back in 2000 you know 18 they're gonna look back at this time period and they're gonna go how is that possible that they had the internet they and all this knowledge all they had all these scientific studies that have been done they knew about psychology and ideologies they knew about the health like what would health benefits both bogus fucking health benefit so less likely to get AIDS the fuck out of here wash your dick everybody wash it if you're getting AIDS or not getting AIDS based on the fact that you're circumcised or not circumcised you are dancing on such a fine edge in your life like um I want to see more data from that study I don't want to just see do you get aids I want to see how fucking how crazy are you the whole thing's crazy cutting baby dicks that would be one what else tax exempt status for religions yet that one cuz otherwise why can't I start a religion right now and get tax exempt status why can't you you tell me Scientology can do it how many people makes a religion do you have a number tell me give me your number tell me what your numbers are what how do you know whether or not someone's legit how do you decide no one should be tax exempt especially someone who's taking in shit fuckin ton piles of money if you're some sort of Church or whatever and you're getting donations in the millions and millions of dollars and you're like one of them Benny Hinn assholes out there driving a Bentley Amazon Inc paid zero federal taxes in 2017 gets seven hundred eighty nine million windfall from new tax law they paid zero yeah cuz I work yeah that's kind of shouldn't happen that shouldn't happen either but the idea is that a corporation now this is not my idea so don't think I'm supporting this I have to preface this but the idea is that corporations shouldn't pay taxes because all the individuals who are making money in that corporation already pay taxes this is the argument that I've heard and that made me go oh okay and the argument was why did Peter Schiff did he say that to me I don't think it was on the air might not have been him shit anyway sidetrack the idea is that a corporation is not an individual so why should it pay taxes it's not a person it's a conglomeration of people those people already pay taxes the corporation has money that it's that's piled up right and then like it's got a value and it's got its on the stock market and it goes up and it goes down and you know and they're always kind of looking to improve their their bottom line and universal constant growth but it's not a person but we I feel like corporations have gotten rights like people yeah over the last 20 plus years you're right yeah they have they gotten rights in terms of how much they can donate to charities - excuse me political campaigns and that used to be not the case used to have a limit and now they are like an individual in which they can donate as much money as they want to political campaigns and doesn't a corporation also act to defend itself sort of like yes can you do that make sure that's true that corporations they can donate as much as they want to political campaigns now I think I want to say this is like during the Abama administration Obama yeah I think this was during the Obama administration it's a disturbing one that's a disturbing one to me because that is a that is a that's a lot of influence for someone like a Amazon I don't think Amazon's evil what's the limit wanted to be I don't know me if the limits like well that's you know max $1,000 there's no limit gonna be a limit there should be a limit yeah but I don't think there is it has to be well I don't know how sad is it that I don't know I should know okay see what we got I've seen various things the one I'm seeing right now is that an S corp can deduct up to 50% of its adjusted gross income to be as a qualified no how much money can no there was a law passed and I'm looking it's not popping up how much money there was a law passed that stated how much money a corporation can donate to political campaigns there was very specific that a corporation is seen as an individual when I look up that corporations seen as individual for donation political campaigns it was just it's not anybody's good in anybody's interest that these huge companies like Amazon or anything that sighs that is fucking billions of dollars that they should just be able to get together and influence a politician with a shit ton of money and then the politician does their bidding and it helps them be bigger and stronger and maybe fucks over some people gotta be really careful about that because the politicians could find a way of arguing it well I could see but what is that how he would vote without that influence No so all these politicians are get into those positions are all just influence peddlers they're just peddling influence the saying listen you know if you help me I'll help you scratch my back I scratch yours they're not looking out for the people that voted them in at all they're looking out for the people that paid all the money to make them more prominent so that people would vote them in it's very sneaky like it should have been fixed a long time ago it's really if you think of all the shit like insider trading that is illegal like if if Jamie really did know something about Facebook and then he told us and like hey dude shits going down get rid of all your Facebook stock right now and you and I went crazy and got rid of it we ki get in trouble that's like Paul Ryan's in trouble for right now something thing he got I suppose it was he's told a bunch of stock so someone told them and he bailed yeah see how is that illegal but it's not illegal to influence politicians and and have corporations spend shit tons of money and then obviously get preferential treatment and obviously get laws pushed here it is Paul Ryan sold shares on same day as private briefing of banking crisis whoops that seems like a dumb move dude Wow you gotta take the hit sign move now you got to take the hit there fellow you can't do that that's terrible somebody told me you better sell your Toys R Us stock right now ha ha that's what I hear but this thing about this guy like when can he like trade those stocks I don't know how long have to wait that's what Martha Stewart got in trouble for it C right well she lied about doing it yeah she got like they found a note that had like the information on or something god damn my memories dog shit lately they just have worked real quick on the tax thing I think there is a limit but then that's why super PACs became a thing so you can donate to another organization that's not directly to them and then a group and give the money as they say and it's just work around you know what the limit is though it's I believe it's 2700 for an individual and then there's like for a company can give like up to ten thousand dollars or something so it's 2,700 for an individual that's interesting her election still a lot of money but not as much money as you would think it would being right like you would think it'd be like a million yeah you know there's a bunch of fuckin whackadoo is it would give a million the thing is man there's weird things that happen with politicians that you don't factor in when you think about bribery and one of the weird one says did you ever see that movie about the financial crisis which one was it called mmm inside job inside job it's fucking amazing but one of the things that it details is how many of these guys were professors that were making these suggestions like working as consultants to the government making these suggestions that why not to be horribly irresponsible financially and then those guys get giant jobs afterwards it pay fucking millions of dollars and you're like wait a minute what happened here you're a professor you made these sort of you know weird suggestions that if you looked at like in the in the movie inside job he goes over it with these professors like what how the fuck could you have thought this why did you push this like why were you why were you guys promoting that and then they go on to get these gigantic fucking jobs at banks and you're like oh this is crazy it's like a clear path like do the right thing here and then you're gonna make five million dollars a year here and so they all do it and this movie is really good because in one of the scenes he's talking to one of these big-time bank guys and in the middle of talking to him the guy realizes what's going on and he gets a real hostile but he keeps going he'll like his arrogance allows him to like keep battling sky but he keeps like looking dumber and dumber because guy was doing the interview is really good the guy who put together this documentaries really good it's an it's a fascinating documentary that gives you a real insight into how complicated complicated and fucking distorted this system is like it's very distorted for those people that are just like those rich banker guys all the doing is moving money I don't have all that money and what do you do I put money over here and I get it over think about aren't you glad you're not doing that though no I don't understand it I couldn't I I just can't imagine we still use it I mean I'm sure someone like Peter Schiff could come and school me and explain it to me but I feel like it should be like one goat equals one piece of gold as soon as you go higher than that it just as soon as you get into speculation and shorting and oh my god buying and selling stock and a company and a company can crash like that and that's like unfortunately what's happened to Babies R Us and Toys R Us is that they weren't getting killed by Amazon it was just them taking debt in and like this finance company that bought them just pretty much you know going crazy in debt from bad spending and oh right I had nothing to do it Toys R Us is business they were doing fine it was all about the finance company that owned them that's a sad thing man but the it might be a good thing for like mom-and-pop toys Shores toy stores because here's the thing about toy stores as a parent kids love to go to the fucking toy store it's a fun time it's like we're kind of that toy store whoo like if my kids would do something good or would make a promise like hey if you we're gonna do this project and we're done with this project you guys can pick out a toy so you give them like a work reward type situation do they get fuckin crazy they're running down those aisles there's all these stuffed animals and all these games and it's an exciting place for little kids you can't replicate that online it's just not the same you're looking through amazon.com or something like that it's great that it's very convenient you can just press press one click and sent to your house but for toy stores in particular this is a colossal there's a there's an opening for sure for another company yeah there's this is the time to start a new toy start because look look at all the toy stores are gone like KB Toys remember the in the mall that there was a toy store that was bought by that company that bought Toys R Us so that's gone too now like all the toy stores are gone there was a little place up here in Calabasas it was a real nice man real tiny little mom-and-pop place had real cool toys there kids used to love it but the guy was telling me like guy or girl mind woman I'm a sexist I remember was I'm thinking of my big woman um but they were saying it no it was a guy now I remember he couldn't keep it open to make money if he's only doing it for fun it's because he enjoyed it was just barely breaking even but it's probably one of those toy stores where it was mostly like puppets and like like you know educational toys and it wasn't like GI Joes they had everything oh they had a lot of stuff they had regular like action figures for comic books and stuff like that what are you doing I just what there's this documentary on Netflix right now called the toys that made us and it's very interesting you learn so much like I showed the history of Barbie Barbie started off as a hooker like it was a hooker doll that in Germany come on yeah swear to God like they Google please yeah there was this truth of Barbie doll there was a doll that looked exactly like Barbie that they used to guys used to like carry around and give to women and it was like a way of like flirting with a woman like hey this is what I want to see you wearing later yeah and so this person came over to Germany and saw this doll and modeled Barbie right after this hooker doll and so if you look at the original Barbie but what it was modeled off of it was just like a creepy looking hooker chick I'm sure you can find a picture but this documentary is so amazing because it goes through like all the voices your mind we like I just definitely got to look into the history of Barbie and know it's just a documentary it just goes to have toys yeah yeah the toys that made us it's so good it goes through like he-man and GI Joe GI Joe is interesting because you know that back in the day you know releasing a guy doll like no we're not gonna make no guy doll no one's gonna play that but GI Joe ended up being like one of the biggest toys in the whole entire world that's how you had to call it an action figure I used to have Steve Austin six million dollar man action figure you had to call it an action figure then and that's where action figures came from GI Joe that was the way around the doll thing yeah smart move cuz dolls yeah dolls are not for boys not funny but you could have dinosaurs right what is that I said a doll yeah it's a doll yeah it's a dinosaur doll one of them was which one was a GI Joe one of those was like uh they made a whole cartoon and just made the toy he-man yeah yeah yeah it was just designed as a marketing tool yeah yeah they decided how do how are we gonna fight Star Wars toys they're like let's make it bigger and stronger so that if you see a he-man doll next to a Star Wars twice it's like well here's this little pussy doll you know yeah so and then they made a cartoon around it and it's really interesting like you wouldn't think it would be that interesting but even the Barbie part was like wow this is fascinating and how they change Barbies look every year like mater sexier made her like her waist like she gets so much shit because her waist is really small and light stuff that's because when you put clothes on for it to fit and look right that's how they had to make her waist just it was more for like the style of the clothes she was wearing not of what it looked like it was more like just to have the doll work right yeah it's really cool it's gotta be fucking super hard to be a chick and look at like those dolls and look at your body and go what in the fuck this is not impossible yeah you know cuz a lot of those dolls they're not possible but what's really funny is one of the things in the 50s what is this a daylily dog yeah Lilly dog can be bought in tobacco shops bars and adult themed toy stores Gerber rights men got Lily dolls as gag gifts at bachelor parties put them on their card dashboard dangled them from the rear view mirror or gave them to girlfriends as suggestive keepsake what does that mean suggestive keepsake look at this but I want to see this proto Barbie was just shy of a foot tall with bulging breasts and platinum blonde ponytail made up for a night in the town with red puckered lips and blue eye shadow Wow interesting the journal German dolls heavy makeup and suggestively arched eyebrows didn't carry over to the American version that's interesting huh they tried to lighten it up a little yeah then they even go into like how her eyes are looking to the side not right at you and she wants a snoot see if she could fuck you in this alley yes is anybody coming comics for this little adult - what yeah the comic oh that's hilarious Lily was witty irreverent and sexually uninhibited once tripped summarised by Lord whose Lord Lord the writer writer okay shows Lily covering her naked body with a newspaper explaining to a friend we had a fight and he took back all the presents he gave me get it she's naked another shows Lily in a bikini when a policeman tells her that two-piece swimsuits are illegal she says oh and in your opinion which part should I take off that dirty bitch one interesting thing too is like you know how Barbie gets so much shit from you know being a fatter woman having it you know the body issues and stuff like that shit there was like a workout Barbie and she had a little scale and the scale was had a sticker on it and it was stuck at 110 pounds and then there was also a book that came with it like a cookbook or like a book that's like how to lose weight and on the back it says don't eat and so dude that's dark yeah and then it talked about how Malibu Barbie like what's the first one that like have the eyes stare right at you so it was like more sexual or someone was interesting shit dude you don't wanna you know I mean that's the thing about those dolls and all that stuff is like you're you're putting something in the kids head this is what an adult looks like but I guess you're doing the same thing with he-man right oh yeah like you're putting on a boy's head and then he gets in the mirror yeah that's why people flex and have their Italian horns looking at their muscles no like what in comparison to he-man I'm nothing you know that's the argument to about the rock or anybody who's like some beautiful muscular creature like that it's like how the fuck do you aspire to that but guys don't complain about that shit like you don't hear a lot of complaints about male positive body image you know you don't hear that like people don't care if guys are fat guys feel sad because they're fat nobody gives a fuck but you know what I mean I mean it's like it's a big deal like fat shaming men when was the last time anybody got accused of fat shaming a guy it's always a woman right it's always if you're a fat shaming it's implied you're fat shaming a woman because the only ones who care Tom at birth that was a different kind of fat check they got locked up and because people found it a target like oh let's let's figure out what we can say here oh it's fat shaming but just genuinely unlike a like with without ever being requested by someone like if you just on your own you decided to say that's fat shaming like you saw it you pointed it out and it became an issue about a public event or a public person or a public celebrity said I'm being fat shamed and it was a man fucking never tested it means it hasn't happened maybe it hasn't either I have been paying attention but I can't imagine that some guy would fucking complain she has a gut and someone's fat shaming him publicly he would just look at that gut and go fuck the right I've got a stop meeting you know like the Tom and birth thing people really did think they were serious that's where it got weird like people would get angry at Burt or angry at Tom yeah and they'd pick sides Burt was telling me about this the other day he hired me to like drive him on this golf cart for this marathon like in between taking Instagram photos [Laughter] that's crazy he ran 533 that's pretty good pretty good no it's an hour slower than Oprah but hey he's fast and he drinks a lot which interesting is like the guy that the first place guy the guy that actually you know one it was like two and a half hours and says no no no one's is it that that's can't be yeah and it's it's an interest so it's two hours that they can't break right and can't break two hours yeah I was thinking they like the outs to you just so like two 11:46 ago that's what he did yeah oh my no they say in what Burt was five and a half dude that's insane runs so so fast that's insane I can't have tried to run that fast for like a mile it's oh my god I didn't know they did it that fast I thought like I thought it was around if I was guessing when you said 230 or whatever the fuck we thought it was I would be like oh that's like a world record or some shit what did he used to be didn't used to be three hours like a big deal I know I was like a three minute mile is the big deal no four-minute mile right then easiest came out and changed it easy has changed the game you get so much more balanced how about says go back to the world-record marathon world record Boston Marathon 1980 I have a feeling it's like in the threes probably is I mean just would be world record Boston Marathon that's a stupid thing to say it's the Boston Marathon record who won it to someone in 2011 203 Oh - yeah but that's 2011 I want to go down 1980 right but not the record just like what is the result from 1980 Boston Marathon result 1980 yeah I wanted I want to say that was probably the last time I paid attention because uh I lived in Boston I don't give a fuck about the LA Marathon I hear about it I go oh can't drive there now but I'm not like oh what a smart things people are all running on the street I think the reason why you're remembering that is because that's when the woman faked the time oh that's right that's right I forgot about her oh my god that was 1980 that's right was she hopped on the tee and they busted her people saw her on the tee what was her time well just you're a terrible person who talked about this because you keep taking us down more and more rabbit holes okay Boston Marathon results 1980s put an ass on that bitch 1979 results here we go here we go okay what do we got Wow okay I'm way off what's still 10 G 56 the third place 247 the first place women's top results so women do it in 247 the man was doing in 220 220 is fucking crazy that is so crazy you can run 26 miles in two hours and 20 minutes woof I would imagine that would been like a world record I'm so off you know but it's I wonder what they weigh you know that's another thing like Bert what's really impressive is how big bird is Bert's like 350 pounds more than that probably probably yeah he's 800 pounds and he's running out there did he get a shoe sponsor and now not why don't you get a shoe sponsor sports bra should have got some Reeboks some tight reboxed we run around that track and they would they would have shot sent a couple hundred bucks as well oh yeah there you go that's right he said thank you Nike yeah good move they should he gave him that marathon shoe that they created just so that someone could break to ours and see if Burke could be the one it's supposedly shames like 4% off your time how's that possible percent is crazy it means you 100 miles you get there for miles quicker than you did without that shit's ridiculous maybe there's a titanium plate in there supposed to help to propel you mmm Springs you running on Springs remember those air shocks those Nike Shox you'd have Springs in your heels oh yeah look like frog shoes I mean I beating this dead horse many times not a bad idea to beat it one more time but I like barefoot running look I run with the smallest tiniest amount of soul and it's changed my feet like I used to get ice have completely flat feet so if I stepped in water and then I stepped like on the tile like next to the pool it feels like cement or something that way you could see my footprint you would see a flat cave band footprint saying but since I've been running with these those I use those Vibrams for finger shoes and I use a couple of different vivos I like those those are they have real good traction and them what about the impact on your knees though and your joints running on the ball your foot your foot is a natural shock absorber the thing is people change the way they ran in the 1970s when Nike came out with that really thick heel for those running shoes and the idea was that you would land on the heel and then go for but that's a terrible way for your foot to land that's all the shock goes straight to your knee there's no give there the only give would be the cushioning of the shoe but your foot is naturally designed to decelerate you land on the ball your feet your foot decelerates and you go forward and what it's done is strengthen all the muscles in my feet in a crazy way like I mean there's a big difference like a big difference and my legs just they just work better like I'm more balanced it's so crazy like it's it's changed like I think about this I'm like what if I was doing this back when I was like really involved in martial arts I think I would have changed my footwork it would have made my my movement in and out better and faster because like your feet strength your feet becomes so much stronger when you run hills with no shoes on I mean it's basically there's shoes there's a thin tread but there's no cushioning I mean it's all just the tread is like a layer of protection from sharp rocks that's it you're gonna try I have those in my ass right now let me pull it out go to pull up vivo barefoot trail running shoes these are the ones that I've been using a lot lately and the Vibram FiveFingers but the problem with the Vibrams is they don't have as much tread and when it's muddy you slide all over the fucking place and I don't want to fuck my knees up no I don't it's not those those are like ninja toes hey uh have you tried running barefoot on the beach yet yes I've done that as you guys it got better for you since you've done that yeah well it's everything's better what's interesting is that's what it looks like on the bottom of that school so it's a good tread on the bottom and it protects you from sharp rocks but that that shoes super super flexible do you have the trail specific one mm-hmm yeah because that's all I'm running on I'm not running on any hard ground I have zero problems with my knees zero zero sometimes my ankles are a little a little stiff like sometimes they're a little sore when I first start running but I'm like Bouldin no duh think about all the beating I'm giving them is they're cool yeah those are the ones I wear now but right now as soon as it dries up because it's been raining a lot out here as soon as it dries up I'll go back to those Vibram FiveFingers cuz those things make you use your toes like your shoe is in a coffin man like your your foot rather in your shoe is it's like a coffin it wraps it up it locks it down it's a cast and your feet don't move right they don't spread out your toes don't grip into the ground push off and Steve Maxwell was the first one to tell me about that one in in regards to weight lifting he was like you should weight lift barefoot and if you don't want to wait with barefoot wear those like five finger shoes and as soon as I started doing that I started realize like oh yeah thank you you push off those toes you feel them dig into the ground and and in certain exercises but if they're all trapped up in a shoe it's it's like it doesn't they don't move right it's just they don't expand they don't grip the ground they don't like they don't dig in but when you're running barefoot like my like I feel the muscles in my feet they like afterwards like they get worked out yeah like those kind of things that's exactly what those are city ones huh those are ones for wearing around the city look they look gross there's no doubt about it I mean you're used to looking at different kinds of shoes you look at that little tiny slipper thing on a dude's fit like hey get out of here what your weird ideas with your fucking slipper feet but it's just something you gotta get used to it I prefer them now and if I don't wear those I usually wear shit like this like converse all-stars because there's so there's nothing there there's an it's like it's totally flat you don't have a raised heel see like that she right there has a raised heat airmax right there fat right you like them but those those heels that raised heel it shortens your Achilles tendon if you wear those all the time and we're or wear high heels all the time think about it your foot is always in this weird position where your back the back heel is elevated so your tendons not traveling as far so then when you do something where it does have to travel far it can get ruptured like you have you can have issues with it it's just not it's not it's like you're heard of like people that drive cars a lot and they have a big fat wallet they wind up getting problems with their back like they'll get a disk slippage because you know they're kind of getting a bulging disk so they're always leaning on one side you're doing your body a disservice by keeping it in an unnatural position or in any sort of static position for long periods of time so when you have a static position like sitting with a big fat wallet in your ass it eventually starts to break you down the argument is that that same kind of shit is happening with heels so if you're wearing a sneaker that has like a heel to it that you are constantly especially be doing explosive exercises you're constantly limiting the range of your heel so make sense yeah my thing though is that because I also have bad flat flat feet that if I have like a converse allstar I feel like I need more support cause like makes me walk rough pig-pig you know pigeon or something like that I don't think that's true I think you probably just need to strengthen your feet yeah I think I mean it's just I just don't think that that's where you get support from I mean you do get support from that if you're going mountaineering or something you know you have to hike but if you're looking for like an overall solution should try to get your feet stronger yeah doctor stat dr. Scholl thing you can do it up like put your foot on it and just your walking gait and they give you the proper insole let's kind of help a little bit yeah those insoles will definitely help your comfort level right the thing is like what's causing the discomfort is it a lack of strength is it a lack of mobility like what are the issues you know so it's like if you're gonna go mountaineering next week alright you should definitely go and get some fitted insoles you should go get some stiff ass boots that you know I mean that's definitely the way to go even if you're mountaineering period but if we're not talking about that you want to talk about like a solution for your life like why do your feet hurt when you do things why it might very well be they're not conditioned well and they're not they're not being used correctly because you're shoving them into these fucking casts that we call sneakers hippie talk 101 this new material it's been on a lot of shoes for a while but this like Flyknit material so it's stretching with your foot yeah yeah I mean it you don't have to they don't need breaking in like she was kind of did for a long time in the eighties nineties River don't get me wrong man I'll still wear a pair of running shoes every now and then if I feel like it you know but I just don't think they should be worn every day I don't think it's a normal thing I definitely don't think you should work out and I'm like is in terms of like running in them and a lot of the shit that people do I mean there's they have some shoes like I know Under Armour has a show called the speed freak it's pretty flat you know there's a lot of these companies and making flatter and flatter shoes now but people like they sell good you see that big fat that big fat he like oh look at all that cushioning they like it sells good if there's hard ones for people that work out like it's a big CrossFit shoe like Mikey's metcon 3 I think is what it is it's got like the hard plastic you know I'm talking about oh yeah that's for squats right they want you to have a heel for squat people do them in Converse or barefoot though good question you know I've heard I know some people step on plates they'll put like a 10 pound plate on the ground and they'll they'll put their heel on those plates and they'll do squats that way I'm not I don't know who's right or who's wrong when it comes to that I do everything barefoot all lifting all lifting either barefoot or with those little five finger shoes on so I say aren't you worried about getting a ring where I'm all over your feet no why do you think you get ringworm aren't gems or I guess you haven't yet private gym but like gyms or just like their feet but here's the thing would you know ringworm and athlete's foot the same thing oh okay you know that yeah exactly the same thing yeah it's just skin fungus the best way to prevent against skin fungus is have healthy skin flora so don't fuck with any antibacterial soaps because when you're you unless you're a doctor obviously when you're using antibacterial soap on a regular basis you're killing everything you're killing all the good bacteria - what you want is soap that promotes healthy skin floor like defense soap they make this soap with tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil it smells good yeah and it but it's really healthy for your skin it's not there's no chemicals there's no bullshit it's just natural oils that promote healthy bacteria and and they deny the growth of shitty bacteria somehow or another there's a lot of stuff like that in nature that does a teacher oil is a big one for that promotes healthy bacteria kills off all the bad shit just I use it every day that and how it like just keeping everything dry you know like that's good too but what if you live in the jungle bitch just make sure you're circumcised - oh yeah that's probably right sweaty dick in the jungle a lot of ringworm everywhere your uh your body has like a whole system you know and that that whole system is fortified by you eating fermented foods and things that are probiotic and yogurt and like this is like strategies that people have come up with over the years to introduce probiotic foods into their diet and some of it was by accident by just trying to preserve things and they fermented and some of it was you know they figured out like hey you know we can do this and and I have a better result with that and you know that's that's really what's the cause of a lot of skin issues I mean you're gonna get ringworm anyway if you're exposed to it all the time and you have open sores you can't get to a shower in time it's totally likely that you could get it but I guarantee your recovery time in the instances that you get it will be less likely if you take acidophilus if you take there's a I like kombucha there's a bunch of different probiotics you can take and it's just very it's a very smart thing for your body that's one of the one things about diet coke I think diet coke as delicious as it is Rex your healthy skin flora Omega your gut flora yeah it probably does I just read the other day like if you drink one diet coke a day like something about Alzheimer's I think it is it where there's like a direct connection to mm-hmm fuck what it was but uh that's pretty pretty scary that cooks so bad took out Tammy Faye Baker yeah that's it took her out right that coke that's what they say just one can triple your risk of stroke meanwhile Donald Trump drinks 12 a day yeah that motherfucker's invincible is it just cokes are probably better for you what mysterious loch ness type sea creature washes ashore in georgia beach what come on apparently this just came out yesterday the but they still like marine wildlife experts quote-unquote don't know what it is that's the only picture of it yeah this video over let me see that again wait how big is that it's got five feet long i think it's like a Plesiosaurus what they said it that certain sea mammals can decompose to look like that well no no it just showed up on a beach you show me there's some in that video again oh there's the picture get bigger with that blurred out the part where is that guy's good whoa it looks like it's just a piece of seaweed and it's like one inch long that's hilarious they blurred out the guts they're gonna show you this dead body but they're blur out the guts no go back to the pictures of it no no just let me see it the flippers are very unusual like in that long ass neck that's a very weird animal whatever that is that'd be fucking dope if they found some new crazy-looking dinosaur type fish right off the coast of Georgia there's so much shit down there I mean you think about how many different animals and organisms they are constantly finding on earth right I mean that that new crayfish that they found in the ocean that's all female that uh reproduces by cloning you heard about that one there's they're finding these fucking things constantly that's in freshwater we but we have a way better account and understanding what's going on in freshwater than we do of the ocean there's so much down there that we don't know there's so many life-forms down then that we're not aware of do you know how much of the ocean floor has been less than 10% of than 5% why we work I don't understand why we're so concerned about going into a different planet when we haven't even figured out this planet yet that's ridiculous when James Cameron went and as his movie the movie he made to go as far down as anybody has gone I was looking into The Sitter day he didn't break the record in 1962 guys got into a submarine and went lower than he did by like a hundred meters or some shit whoa wait 29,000 feet or something down Jesus and it's still there's still more and I think they just discovered an area near where they were going that's lower than what they thought the deepest part of the ocean was stop there for a second 29,000 feet under the ground isn't a mile 5,000 feet mm-hmm so what what are you serious like they're almost six miles down 35,000 797 feet is the actual record what in the fuck band that's seven miles is that real yeah think of seven miles seven miles is like here to Studio City underwater how far can you see you can't see seven miles right now like the distance of the curve of the earth the curve of the earth like it's got a flat oh yeah but if you're flat if you're on like sea level and you're looking straight how far can you see on a clear day I think you could probably see seven or eight mile probably farther mmm that's nuts man seven miles is this the guy yeah there's two guys actually they're still alive Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard John I bet you never recover from something like that you go all the way down there and you just like what in the fuck what the fuck what in the fuck what in the fuck your DNA pride changes like that there's astronaut guy yes they explained that that that was exaggerated the that people were oversimplifying the the situation to say that this DNA didn't change the way you think it did it's probably just like one molecule off or something like that it's pregnant that bigger ideal it's probably off though I mean what what are they saying caused him see Google astronauts DNA didn't change the way you think it did I think we just don't understand like how it ya know Scott Kelly's DNA did not change in space and this is from waste calm the way it's a weight localization Oh wate coms practiced an AP story they put on yeah I think it exactly is cuz I know I saw it on something else get it a little bigger so after the internet was abuzz about astronaut scott Kelly's purported altered DNA after his year in space NASA has clarified the findings in their study his DNA did not change by seven percent he is still an identical twin to his brother mark I want my money back all those things I clicked you fuckheads NASA says University of Tennessee's graduate genes expression changed by about 7% gene expression is how your body reacts to your environment and stress fractures fractures they said this level of change in gene expression was within the expected range for humans in stressful environments like scuba diving or mountain climbing boom you fucks so every time you go mountain climbing you're not an identical twin to your brother anymore we're assholes we're just lying to ourselves we just line ourselves for clicks I've had enough it's like these people need to be punished for their clickbait yeah they're doing it on purpose it's worse on like YouTube I mean you could put up a little thumbnail and get people clicking on stuff and make thousands of dollars just for that that's true yeah I went deep on YouTube the other day have you ever watched somebody die from rabies oh no there's videos of people dying from rabies on YouTube it's the most fascinating thing ever there it like I didn't know people still died from rabies but there's like people that have rabies and if you watch it's haunting you pretty much are going crazy why don't they just kill them yeah they know why do why do we need people to die a hundred percent naturally like what is that about look I mean it's it's so interesting to watch these videos man like what year is this 50 60s or something like that and you just die rabies you don't bounce back right and right and it's very sad you can't hold water in so you just constantly spit out water I oh shit dude this is scary stuff man he's trying to eat yeah it doesn't it won't work he just puts it in his mouth and it'll spit it out probably what a fucked up disease meant rabies is so crazy because it really is like a zombie disease for dogs right yeah for dogs or animals they get it they oh my God look at me foaming at the mouth yeah now let me ask you this at what point time to just give this guy a lethal dose of morphine and get this over with right now like why did they let him get this far gone they're just letting him die on his own what is it about people that want people to die on their own like there's a certain amount we know about the human body right when he gets that sort of a stage let it I mean the guy's foaming at the mouth twitching and bucking was strapped to a bed and there's videos of kids just like little like like three-year-old kids having rabies like and you can't do anything just after and they should kill her but like it's they do now I think they just let him today suffer today I don't think you're allowed to kill anybody you know I mean I mean if you have rabies do they have a cure I think you like like as an example if you get bit by a raccoon you have to go through all those like a hundred shots right you know type thing I don't know how long you have till to do that anybody that thinks that all [Music] vaccinations are bad is a fucking idiot if you really think that it's all some sort of a big giant conspiracy to ruin people and make a ton of money you're crazy if people getting jacked by vaccinations that is an unfortunate side effect of one of the most spectacular things that human beings have ever created they created a way to combat diseases that killed untold millions I mean think about the fucking malaria vaccinations they can give you malaria shots a bunch of different shit that they give you or malaria pills you take pills and then you you go over there and you live where malaria kills everybody polio I mean they basically wiped out polio it didn't just recently come back because people aren't vaccinating the kids anymore yeah there's a lot of people that aren't mumps measles there's a lot of different ones that are making their way back yeah I mean they figured out look it's not perfect but there's not a damn thing that involves putting chemicals in your body that's perfect not a damn thing but what they've done with vaccinations is fucking amazing now I think I agree with you on flu shots I don't get flu shots I never had one I don't I don't think that they don't work I think they work sometimes but I know people that have taken flu shots and gotten sick yeah cuz it's the flu and you're not supposed to but you usually for a couple days you might be a little sick what's that what is this the disease express itself in two forms furious rabies whoa seventy percent of human cases cause hyper excited behavior a strong fear of water and sometimes a strong fear of flying this will eventually result in death by cardio respiratory arrest paralytic rabies 30% is a less exciting and takes longer to kill you with it your muscles gradually paralyzed beginning at the source of the infection spreading outwards what is this article from everything you want to tell about ray because that Gizmodo yeah well with extreme aggression that most strongly characterizes disease when do animals have it what's fascinating to me is if they want to bite you so which would help spread the disease it's almost like the disease uses the animal system and makes the the animal more likely to bite like it's like piloting the animal and getting it to attack zombie yeah have you ever seen the the rat with rabies chasing the cat I mean think we've talked about yes it's not rabies the rat has Toxoplasma it's a different thing it's a different parasite yeah that's the thing that's super common with cats and rats and people get it and somewhere around 50 million Americans have it affects your judgment makes you more impulsive in it there's a direct relationship to people or Toxoplasma infected and motorcycle accidents yeah they're more likely to get in motorcycle accidents Robert Sapolsky talked about he was on a podcast we did it's one of my favorite ones but it's really quick it was only looking at for us it was like an hour and Sapolsky is just world-renowned for his study of Toxoplasma and what it does to people but it affects the cat's well it first will affect the rats sexual reward system hijacks is brain gives it a boner to get erect at the smell of cat urine sometimes Wow and takes away their fear of cats completely so they go wander around cat the cats kill them and then they get into the cat that way because they can only reproduce inside the cat's digestive system it's crazy so these worms get into the cat's body so they can reproduce and then they shit out cat shit people come in contact with the cat shit sometimes even through their feet through walking around barefoot around cats yet the the toxo gets into their system and it affects the way they behave some crazy amount of people in the world habit like at one point time at France it was more than 40% of the people had it that's nuts yeah that's what's doing it the cat there's a lot of those things man how about that aquatic worm that makes grasshoppers drown themselves yes grows inside of a bug's body and then says hey faggot once you could jump in that water I will jump in that water and they'd jump in the water and they'd drown them it's crazy it's crazy they talk this organism and it killing itself so they can pop out in the water and live there's a bunch of things like that in nature we have to wonder like how how did this evolve like what kind of what is what's going on like what is the actual process that allows something to evolve into like a plant that can eat a rat you ever see that plant that gets real slippery and smells good so the rats come here and they fall into the hole and it's into this like this looks like a like a tulip like a giant thick tulip and it just absorbs the rat look how the fuck did that start and that's what it does all the time like it tricks the rats like what the fuck like what was stage one like what was that thing like in the beginning what did it like did it catch a bug and the bugs are cool but I like to get my furry fuckers it's always chewing on my leaves you know there's just so many different forms of life and this is all we know about Earth like we were talking about exploring the ocean you imagine if we found some crazy fucking half-human looking things I think I told you about this before but there's this plant it's on planet Earth too so I'm not really gonna show the footage but it has these seedlings on this specific Island somewhere that these birds come and land and they eat the seeds and then they also if they get stuck to the birds bodies and as they fly around that's how it spreads but well the birds can get them stuck to them so much that it gets stuck on the ground and they can't fly anymore and they end up dying and then beating decomposed and the plants sort of like grows out of them yeah yeah they're covered in these things like the birds trying to clean the things off them yeah the birds eat them oh look he's decomposing it and the trees growing out of them planet Earth and planet Earth too are both amazing yeah I mean when you see the very bizarre ways that nature figures out how to how to take advantage of a situation my favorite one is that cordyceps mushroom that grows in those those ants and the other ants recognized that this is a problem that this thing died with these ants these ants died with these mushrooms growing inside of it and the spores will build up inside this thing's body and then explode and spray through the air and in fact all the other ants around it like literally like it's like a bomb and somehow another the ants know this so the ants take the body and they drag it out of town they're like we got to get them out of here before the port blows I mean it's literally like someone throws the hand grain in your car you just chuck it out just in time it's fuckin nuts man I love shit like that it's fuckin nuts yeah it's fuckin nuts I mean it really is how does it know I mean how these goddamn ants know that they have to get this thing out of there so things dead right and then little spores start growing out of its head see the spore growing out of its head this is crazy that's nice yeah so the mushrooms grow inside their bodies and I don't know how the ants know this but the ants know they got to get that fucking thing out of town and they drag them away maybe it's like a smell I mean I don't think answer cannibals but look how crazy that is this thing grows out of its body how is that any different than like the Prometheus movie or alien movies you know I mean how is it different mean it's really not it's some crazy organism that eats its hosts and the ants look mushrooms mushrooms that thrive off of carbon monoxide or something well they they're just like us they eat oxygen and breathe carbon dioxide now here's a thing the cordyceps mushrooms that get harvested for things like on its shroom tech the way they harvest those things is off caterpillars really yes so they like this so that that that those mushrooms wouldn't be psychedelic like it was didn't try to take those little ant mushrooms no they're not psychedelic some of I mean there's a bunch of different kinds of cordyceps mushroom but what they found is that high-altitude yak herders or cattle herders thing was cattle forget what it was they noticed that when there are animals were eating these mushrooms they were more active and so they started feeding their mushrooms you know feeding the mushrooms to people and they had some pretty great results with it and they started noticing that it helps people and they did some studies on theirs you can go on it and he'd read the the studies on cordyceps mushrooms or just google it independently there's some interesting studies the Chinese see that's a little tricky though they say the Chinese Olympic team used them and they want a bunch of medals here's what's tricky about that it's entirely likely that they said oh yeah we were only using them mushrooms definitely no steroids right you know I mean in the interest of full disclosure I'm wearing a fucking on a t-shirt right right it's entirely possible they were doing steroids to most likely that they were doing steroids did you see Icarus did you see that movie I think they're all doing steroids I think like especially all those communist countries that rely so heavily on propaganda like Russia like Russia's been doing state they had a state-sponsored drug program 100% it's all documented in that that mo that movie so when China says that they won these track and field medals because they were taking this quarter SEPs mushroom I bet it helped but it helped I take it but guess what it doesn't feel like a steroid when I take shrimp Tech it's like a nice little boost I get a little boost just a little bit not speedy but a little boost I definitely feel an extra gear but it ain't like I'm not you know there's some L others shit too those guys were doing they fucking do everything they can man anything they can get away with whatever the fuck they can get away what they do and they're not testing them all the time they're just not if there are they're hiding shit people get busted they've already proven that people get busted and they let them slide there's a lot of influence peddling I mean maybe it'll be less now because Russia wasn't even allowed to compete now the people had to compete under the Olympic flag the certain athletes brush is so crazy you see that dude they killed in England the nerve gas is he dead yet this is him and his daughter or something like that or his wife the killed in England with nerve gas well if he's not dead he might as well be dead he's on his way to dead he's incredible horrible critical condition it's just like this is some spy versus spy shit and this is some really it's like some movie shit they're killing him with nerve gas they're killing him you know he I think he was like a double agent or something is that what he was supposedly Russia's now hacking our power grids oh no like I guess he didn't done this and if if it was a Russian military grade agent he would have died on the spot obviously is what Putin said oh that's what Putin said fuck we should definitely listen to him always what is a remaining critical condition what to pull up a story on him who is he and why why are they trying to whack this dude he's incredible condition well hold up scroll up Putin calls Russian poisoned X by nonsense and delirium oh well then they definitely did it make that bigger sloth doff the notion that Russia was behind the poisoning former Russian spy and his daughter saying any sensible person would understand that this is delirium and nonsense it is unthinkable that we would do such a thing the first thing that came to mind if it was a military-grade agent he would have died on the spot they would have died on the spot obviously said Putin speaking in the party headquarters in Moscow shortly after he spoke to a crowd in central Moscow Russia does not have any such agents we destroyed it all okay I don't believe that Putin also says he's never met Trump before the election and then there's like video from like three years ago the Trump saying I met Putin you know and like oh really yeah it's just like bullshit it's a fun time they'll hate it I think this is a fun time you like this yeah I'm okay I'm enjoying it because I think this is what's fun about this time is even with like and this is partly because we have a guy like Trump in office is that everything seems like there's nobody at the wheel everything from top to bottom these people scrambling to take the wheel I'll take the wheel and right this ship but there's no one at the wheel it's all craziness right now it's craziness culturally it's craziness politically it's craziness economically like none of it makes any sense it's racially crazy I mean people are fighting people are mad at Bruno Mars no Bruno Mars for cultural appropriation how's that possible I mean there's so many different things that are happening today that are so outrageous oh how about this one a guy got fucking sentenced or he got convicted and will be sentence in I think he gets sentenced in April for getting his dog to make a Hitler salute making a video yes it's on my my Twitter page i retweeted it the guy is in Scotland and he's a proud shit poster he's one of those guys Jamie loves shit posters it's one of his favourite things ya know but he's one of those guys that just he posts stupid shit to get a reaction from people and so just to piss his girlfriend off he decided he to try to get his dog to do the Hitler salute the Nazi salute and you know he gets his dog to do it on this video and he says gasps the Jews apparently you know like he's trying to like get his dog to do this like when he I guess you know he thought it was funny that he puts it on YouTube not only does it get him in trouble which I get people being mad like hey that's insensitive okay whatever he's trying to be insensitive they fuckin arrested him they tried him and they convicted him which country Scotland okay the UK I mean this guy's convicted and now he'll be sentenced it's fuckin crazy if you've seen the video mhm Jamie pull up that video cuz it's crazy to watch it's not that big a deal second thing has been pushed off up until April time yet next month yeah that's what I said what is the pull up the video yeah he's um that's one thing about United States man you forget about free speech like I was talking to somebody from a different country recently he goes you have no idea how big that is and we kind of take it for granted giant giant yeah its giant and it's it's everything okay it has been identified by YouTube community as inappropriate and offensive to some audiences I understand please proceed give me some volume to where he says why don't they just speak English gasps the Jews like pass the Jews mom gasps adduce son you are - the Jews do I gasps - juice juice juice morning guys so he's it's take it took them forever to teach this dog this is this the idea that's we're watching this over and over again oh god Wow boy it's adorable it is very cute taught the dog to do that it's crazy that's it sucks that he's getting well it's a classic shit post video it's like these guys this is the whole Pepe the Frog thing you take you down this is the hole it's all the same shit it's a bunch of people that are having fun saying shit that's totally inappropriate this is what it is that's what that is that's the same thing and the people that think that like anybody who would do that is a Nazi you're not correct that's not true I guarantee you that guy's not a Nazi I think I don't know I'm assuming he's not a Nazi I'm assuming he's a shit poster he's a guy who's trying to be funny how do % it's just ignorance yeah and that funniness is funny to them see here's the thing you might not like it you might think it's it's horribly inoffensive but here's the thing no Jews gotten met got gassed during the making about that video and the worst thing it did is get racist - laughs the best thing it did is get people to talk about what's appropriate there's nothing wrong with that I mean it's not good I mean I don't like it I wouldn't do it I wouldn't tell people hey this is the most awesome video ever come watch it but to put that guy not only to put him on trial but to fucking convict him and Scotland how dare you you people are supposed to be ahead of the curve Scotland's supposed to be a pretty fuckin badass place that's ridiculous isn't Scotland know like the like the like a place that you I think it's Scotland where you came and talked about sex on stage you can cuss you can like show you pull at it out but like if you wanted to talk about sex I think Scotland there's no boundaries Billy Connolly's from Scotland Billy Connolly is a pretty famous worldwide comedian I think that's sweet and pretty outrageous guy yeah cuz Connolly is pretty he's he's like in the line of like popular American stand-up comics of his era he was a very respected guy and he's from Scotland must be I think I'm thinking of sweet maybe I don't know I don't know jack-shit about those other countries that I only visit occasionally but when you go to when you go to these countries to do comedy do you ever have to be like hey don't talk about no I wouldn't go if I went to a place they told me I couldn't talk about something I'd be like well why would I go there well just go somewhere work and talk about anything I don't want to go somewhere where I only talk about certain things it's like I've done a few air-quote clean shows in my day where I got a gig especially when I was first starting out they're like hey can you do a half an hour clean I go okay yeah and I would just add it I'll just edit the shit out of something use words that you know there's like innuendo that you can get away with and I could sort of squeak by with a bullshit half hour set you know but I would never do that today like I don't want to yeah I don't want to it's just like I what about what I want to be able to do is to find out what's the best way to express the thoughts that are in my mind that are funny that the best way is never by censoring yourself the best way is by figuring out what's the best way to express yourself sometimes censorship can be a tool though for writing like if you know that you can't swear or you know like for joke writing one of the one of the cool things about Twitter it was that you had 140 characters now obviously have more have 280 but the 140 made you write a joke very concisely if you wanted to be funny you know you'd have to have set up punch line cut out all the Eli Cobb ten ten letters over shit and you back it up a little I'll just take this out and I could say in one word it makes you understand the economy of words better and sometimes that's the case with writing to like you can get out of a joke easy by just adding swear words or adding sexual innuendo or stuff like that but that doesn't but that that's like just an exercise like when you're actually depressing yourself when you're actually doing the work like going on stage doing a show you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want otherwise it's not stand-up and it's either funny or it's not funny I mean it's not funny you just weren't funny but it's not because it's the subject matter that's just fucking stupid that's stupid because anything can be almost anything could be funny I'm sure there's probably a few things that can't be but for the most part if you think it's funny if you have a point it's possible did you see what happened with Hannibal the other day another thing yeah he uh when he got a gig at Loyola Chicago and they cut his mic after he supposedly said some stuff that they mutually agreed he shouldn't say but what he slipped the email up on a projector I guess I was making jokes about Catholic Church Hannibal Buress sex stand-up set is interrupted at Leola after his sex abuse joke it cut his mic and then everyone started booing everyone was laughing apparently and all the kids are saying like they should have known what they were getting themselves into basically well you can't do colleges man I've been telling people you can't do colleges it's not worth it it's not worth it it's a lot of money though that's the thing colleges will pay you some serious cash when I was coming up in the early days I did one of those natura conferences and if you like National Association for college campus activities I think it is and if you get booked by a bunch of schools dude it is amazing it's amazing you make thousands of dollars it was great like I'm that was the first time I made good money I would travel and I'd go to all these different weird like fucking Oliveto ghen some university there and some weird university in the middle of nowhere and Ohio and they take you out to some local fucking country bar afterwards and doing shots with kids who go to school there because I was basically their age right you know or a couple years older this is when I was like 23 or 24 Mamie you know and they were all like 20 so we're all like in the same wheelhouse and then there's people that work the school that we're even older they come out drinking with you two different times man but you could make real money like you'd do a gig and you'd make $1,000 or $1,500 $2,000 on hold shit for one show was crazy for an unknown comedian so everybody like aspired to do those college gigs but back then man even back then they were real sensitive kids are real sensitive and they're always looking to they don't have a lot of life experience right so their life experience is limited to 18 years most of it's been under the care of their parents for most kids then all sudden they're at school and they're flexing their wings and their muscles and you know the objective things and they've decided that these things are inappropriate these things shouldn't be said and this isn't true they can't take certain they can't take a lot of sarcasm they don't know I mean they take you literally too often they think some subjects are just period taboo because they are period taboo in offices and in some schools and there's some things they can't say so they can't say they don't want you to say it it's a very weird time for kids you know that's why it's so crazy that you have all these fucking dorks that are stuck in that system that graduated from college then started teaching and have these ridiculous Marxist ideas and loony fucking left-wing ideologies and they're brainwashing these kids about gender neutral or gender fluidity and making safe spaces and all this stupid shit like what you're doing is is like further cushioning and coddling them and then they're just what are they gonna do they're just gonna join academia as well they're gonna get through their schooling and then teach in this weird insulated little thought bubble that you guys have created so when people look at these people screaming and yelling and calling people Nazis and on school campuses and all this fucking chaos that's going on this is what happens this is what happens when you baby people this is what happens when you set up this environment where they can never ever interface with the real world they just exist in this super hyper sensitive hyper progressive bubble where nothing is produced nothing is created you're just teaching people ideas and you're teaching people ideas and the ideas are being they're being promoted by a person who in a lot of situations has never even been out in the real world working like they're it's a bullshit fucking thing and then they have tenure so they can never be fired whoo crazy nerfing it's fascinating it's pretty fascinating know you know that this this these are these they're in a lot of ways it's kind of like royalty in a lot of ways it's kind of like like weird political systems that get corrupt like things ideas get corrupt as much as like finances get corrupt like people feel a way to extract social points for by promoting their ideas and by by forcing their ideas down other people's throats and having them accept it and mimic that as well and also reinforce it that they're doing their life right and everybody else is doing dare live wrong so it becomes this weird psychological wrestling match that people are doing with people you know in the outside world I mean I've had a lot of guests on to talk about this subject but I think this subject it's one of the reasons why it rings true to people is because I think we all realized this is happening in just in life in general and there's a lot of weird control battles going on in life in general and in telling a guy that he can't have his dog say see I can't say Sieg Heil his dog and have his dog lift his arm up telling a guy that he can't do that it's just stupid because you're you're making it a way bigger thing that it should be it should be a stupid video that no one cares about I mean it's still up on YouTube so that shows you how right oh yeah yangshin right right like what youtube you see what youtube did to Crowder when steven crowder went to this they went to lbgtq event in austin and he had a dude show up and saying that he identifies as a robot and he says all this really rude shit Twitter got him in trouble not YouTube YouTube was YouTube still have it up I thought they put it up there I thought it was do you monetize their Twitter bandim yeah but I thought YouTube banned them as well Facebook fandom no someone else did - it might be YouTube check either way people are trying to control what people do and don't say and I think when you do that you run into real problems like who the fuck are you who are you who you decide you know and even know Noam Chomsky said something about Sam Harrison Jordan Peterson that free speech does not improv does not apply to hate speech like what like yes it does yes it does that's crazy that's someone who's really smart can say it doesn't yeah okay so it's available on YouTube you say he put some post saying that he was blocked from something doesn't matter the point is one thing that's been shown is that they're trying to silence more they're trying to stop the spread of conservative ideology and spread liberal ideology like they're actively trying to do that I feel like there's a real worry that when you have a platform whether it's YouTube or something like that that you could get infected but like say shit posters if shit posters just they're more they're more prolific right they're like if you look just look at the comments on YouTube like in a lot of like really popular things the comments are horrific like way disproportionate to how they would be in the real world like the comments and the PETA anger that you find in a lot of YouTube videos especially if you look at like the comments of podcasts holy shit dude people are opinionated right they got some crazy wild fucking opinion now if you were YouTube you like we have to figure out a way to stop people from saying faggot or we have to figure out a way to stop people from doing this or stop people from from being homophobic we have to figure out a way and stop people from supporting Trump we have to figure out a way to stop people from talking about the wall you have to figure out a way as and as soon as you start doing that kind of stuff you run it to a real slippery well you're deciding what people shouldn't shouldn't be able to say even if it's legal that gets real weird because then you don't have a free speech platform you have a left-wing platform like your platform is now left-wing and I'm not saying you're wrong but I'm saying it strengthens the position of the people that you oppose because they they are being suppressed like you could see they're being suppressed even if they're wrong you put a guy in jail because his dog says listen pop when he says see hi like boy you you just looked real fucking stupid to most people and now the fight is on and now it's gonna be this swarm of controversy where people are freaking I just found out about it yesterday I just found out about it last night I think might not even it might have been this morning when I woke up YouTube is reported yes your kids what this famous conspiracy theorists his videos have been coming up in the YouTube kids app teaching like Flat Earth type shit and like planet where good stuff yeah getting in a lot of great you know where they can hold is too much here's the thing about YouTube now this is in defense of them because I talked the dinner with some bigwigs at YouTube and there was some of the stuff they said was very annoying and not recalling things hate speech that just weren't like talking about someone who got a Community Guidelines strike because they put a cup put a conversation up in their playlist between Sam Harris and Douglas Murray two intellectuals and they said that it was because it was hate speech and I was like guys the fact they could just say that just drove me nuts but they're dealing with who knows how many videos every day I mean it's insane how could they fight how could they possibly even know the videos ok the total number of people use YouTube is what is that number billion oh my god 301 billion 300 million 300 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute almost 5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every single day in an average month 8 out of 10 18 to 49 year olds watch YouTube one of the things this woman said to me that I agree with her on up I mean a believer because this is not about a about opinion it's about how the way YouTube works she said right now we have very crude tools to find offensive speech hate speech they're very crude tools sometimes the mr. mark and sometimes when you're dealing with like subtlety like humor like I could say hey you fuck and you know people go he was angry like obviously not you hear the tone you know like someone saying that they're saying it to friends and they're joking around they're being silly and everybody's laughing YouTube missus that they don't they don't know what's humour and what's not so are you saying that you can never make a joke about you know a guy's dick or you can never make a joke about a girl's vagina are you never making joke about heterosexual sex can you no no you can do that okay can I make a joke about gay sex no no you can't oh I see because I'm not gay okay can I make a joke about white people yes can you make a joke about black people no okay what are we doing here what are we doing you're deciding what people can and can't say and then they're also de monetizing things and we've had some D monetized ones that were just like okay there's got to be some sort of an algorithm going on here where there's a word we say and that word triggers some sort of a response and then they say that it's up for we we have it up for manual review sometimes but like our Douglas Murray one what we talked about YouTube D monetizing videos that one got D monetized Cesis so it's like okay are they doing that to fuck with us or are they doing that because the Douglas talked about radical fundamentalist Islam like what is it and their defense it's just their platform they should be able to do whatever they want should they though because what are they then if it's who is they who is they the people they hire the dunt doesn't that shift like the the assumption is that everybody who works in management everybody who works behind the scenes all shares a mindset that's crazy that doesn't even make any sense not even a society a group think-tanks like that like if they all agree and this was one of the things that James do more pointed out about Google it's like they don't leave any room whatsoever for conservatives like they absolutely discriminate against conservatives I'm not conservative but if I was and I worked at a company like Google you imagine how fucking on the outside you would feel like is it illegal to be conservative like isn't there a responsible ethical form of conservatism that's not racist not homophobic but but presumes that a conservative person in power would more fiscally responsible will have economic policies that they agree with interventionist policies they agree with I don't I don't think that that's outside the realm of possibility that a reasonable person could be conservative but if you work for any big tech company that's not in the menu you don't get to be that like you don't get to promote that you don't get to agree with that it's weird it's not good because it's not it's not open speech you're supposed to be able to talk shit through I like to listen to someone who has a very strong opinion about something and see if it resonates with me now if you stop the stop that'll stifle that I was just kinda monetizing a video though isn't censoring someone it's encouraging censorship this is why because you don't want to be D monetized if you have a video and that video can make you 500 dollars if it's um if it's up and it gets ads or it can make you $0 but that's that's a $500 incentive for you to not talk about whatever the fuck got it D monetized right but that's in the debt then makes your argument I'm like what were you making the content for in the first place no no no no no no no no no it's it's a motivation for you to censor your speech whatever you're making it for in the first place you presume that someone was just making it to make it but there's an absolute monetary value if they put ads on it so if they take away the monetary value and they do it specifically because you chose a certain subject that is in fact a form of censorship they will do what they're doing is encouraging you to self-censor in order to make more money they can say hey you can do whatever the fuck you want we're gonna decide that if you talk about fill in the blank that subject no money so don't talk about that subject name they're not gonna give you money because they're sharing that money with you though that you could still share that video on your Twitter channel you could still share it on your blog and still make money if you could find your own advertisers there see what you're doing I see what you're doing but it's not a good argument the reason why it's not a good argument is because they made a concerted decision they made a very clear decision to take away the ads on videos where they don't like what you're saying that just could be because they don't have advertisers that are willing to pay them that's all that's the way I would look at it the advertiser wouldn't more than pay them because of like Douglas and Sam Harris talk they just couldn't maybe they couldn't find the money for it they're like I guess what this week just not monetized okay you don't know this this is not you're just making a guess because he's doing this to try to reinforce your original opinion I don't I don't think it is censorship it's a form of censorship III think that D monetizing is not a good thing because of other ways other reasons that it happens I'm on YouTube because they then have an incentive to share monetize videos because they're making money on them I get that but it's just because it's D monetize understand the YouTube who has a YouTube has an incentive to share monetize videos because they're sharing in the profit of every single video monetized video doesn't a creators that get 100% of the money they get half of the money right YouTube gets the other half so for my videos monetize theirs they benefit sharing them right right right so that even reinforces more the idea that they're censoring yeah that's what I'm saying but like a third they're not they're censoring the ability for it to share to be shared in the YouTube platform not on the Internet that's true but they're not censoring what they're doing is promoting self-censorship by giving you a fiscal reward for following their line again that's just where I'm saying like as a creator if you're making content to just make money on YouTube then you have to play by their rules yeah I mean I understand what you're saying but what my point about all this is is what they're doing is like they're they're they're making their own they're making these decisions and who is making these decisions that that that also could be definitely said they should say these are the rules right I'm the person responsible for making that statement what are the rules here's they said they don't say this is what's weird about it it's totally arbitrary there's no like written law that you have to follow there's no like oh you can't say cunt because if you say can't you know Playtex doesn't want to advertise in your fucking video anymore no does not that it's weird yeah they don't tell you what the demonetised video is like when we get one they don't say it's because you guys talked about about YouTube no they don't say shit it's it's fucking weird Vimeo has never fucked with me in eight years YouTube fucks with me every day right but the thing about Vimeo is the difference in the numbers is so radical like if we have a video that gets a million hits on YouTube it'll get 20,000 on Vimeo but like I've been using vimeos live lately and you know if you have YouTube like you look at the chatroom and YouTube 90% just negative angry horseshit Vimeo community like I think we had like 400 people last night watching kill Tony everyone was positive just nice happy no negative trolling it's just like I just want popular yet it was a different environment like it's no town he's like it way and that's what I don't get like YouTube they don't have things like IP bans they're like if you get banned on YouTube you just get a new gmail address and now you have a new fucking thing where like other places like Vimeo and stuff like that you get banned you're pretty much banned banned you know that's how it should be right right who should be deciding if you get banned banned there's gonna be an IP ban that someone was at your house and now you're banned from using YouTube because someone was over or a neighbor's using your Wi-Fi and luck to you it's also your responsibility to know that I guess what are you happy and be I mean that's like looking at kiddie porn that go to a friend's house and look at kiddie porn you're you would get arrested you know cuz it's your IP address or if you go over a friend's house and watch his kiddie porn did you get arrested if you do it in a car wash you're not supposed to watch it right yeah what are you like to listen to it it's good question yeah right no I bet you're not I mean but that's one of those things where we decide that people shouldn't have that in their life you know but here's the question what are they gonna do when they have CGI that they can program to have very realistic looking pedophile porn but there's no human being involved in it it's kind of like those dolls you saw those dolls PD dolls had a $5 what do you think about those do you think those should be the sex doll kids sex dolls I don't know about that I didn't ease latest research project can turn scripts into virtual reality what is that something new that it's definitely not out yet but they just showed this thing that they can turn written scripts into a very crude CGI virtual reality experiences holy shit yeah so this is just the early version of it this might take off if they decide to continue to push money into it so they're nerds get deciphered by the commuter with computer which creates images I believe so I was trying to read it to understand it that's what sort of what they're saying that's so crazy it's sweet that's so crazy that's it but that's inevitable this is probably gonna be like the upper level CGI like you're gonna be able to write it then you're gonna be able to talk into it and it's gonna create things you're gonna have a fucking headset on and you're gonna be in a room and you're gonna say I want to be in the Avatar world and ride a dragon I want to be blue and I want to have a bow and arrow and I want to go to the Tree of Life and all that shit's gonna be right in front of you yeah they're gonna just be able to do it with virtual reality based on your suggestions and then they're gonna figure out a way to get your brain to interface with that thing whereas they've already figured out a way to get a kid to move his Kurt someone was paralyzed and they got this person to move their curser I don't know if it was kid they've they've had a bunch of different things where they've used the mind to control things I did a thing on Joe Rogan questions everything where I put this headset on and I got a drone to listen to me I could get it to lift up off the ground if I thought a certain way and that shit is coming it's already out but I mean that shit in like in your mind be able to conceive a whole different world right did you see annihilation no it's trippy what's that that's the new movie from the ex machina guy oh yeah fuck yeah that's good okay trippy trippy to the point where you go what am we're watching here Jim this I think I showed you this once before but this is a good video of it this is a I tracking thing that's built into laptops it's built in Alienware laptops now whoa it's guys just looking at those dots and they're exploding he's oh sweet eyes his eyes just mice oh my god and it works really well that's crazy yeah so your eyes control the mouse yeah you can play games with it no way that would be amazing for your eyes that seems like an awesome I exercise I bet it's like it's not there yet though very very new and it's already out and they just like announced the new vive pro if you try to play quake on this they're gonna fuck you up try to use your shitty eyes and some dudes holding a mouse it's very close to having this like with either in your phone so you can just control games on your phone and put that in a little they are VR headset I can't say I'm shocked we ready player one this Friday what is that that the book you know have you ready player one it's about the future its new Spielberg movie that comes out I think Friday about oh I've seen the ass for that yeah that looks crazy yeah whoo this won't describe is the whole future you keep bringing up with like everyone lives in a pod just locking into the vehicle yeah it's going to happen because I miss Ohio dude how many people do you run into that are just not doing good they're not live in a good life like everything's not going so well like I was just in Fresno the other day and when we were drive Tony and I did a gig up there where we're driving around the town there's streets filled with homeless people I mean homeless like encampments everywhere I mean there's there's people that just are in a bad place and they can't it's not gonna get any better where they live if someone comes along and introduces something and it's just like a cell phone everybody has it and you all lock into that thing yeah Columbus Ohio to 2045 this is what it's like all the streets puts this headset on I know is in the world yeah the real cool thing I think about the movie which is the plot which doesn't give away much because I have read the book so I don't know it sounds like something that could happen soon is that there's like a bug in the game and there's a prize for it that everyone's going after the bug prize whoever can find it get someone like Willy Wonka style yeah yeah and what's really interesting is that the movie also has because you pick an avatar just like a video game or Facebook so people are picking like I want to be King Kong certain Kong's in in like Back to the Future cars in it and Akira's motorcycles in it and you know the iron Giants in it and Oh Freddy Krueger's in it just you know they said they they've they got to use a lot of different franchise there's the Speed Racer car you know back to the future yeah I mean it's this is this is all inevitable I mean if they're gonna continue the same path that they're on now if you go back and look at the video games we used to see when we were kids I mean you play Mortal Kombat on a console that's kind of cool but compared to this it's like pong right and it's going to happen it's just gonna keep going it's just a matter of where where it's gonna leave us like we're not gonna be people anymore real soon within a hundred years we're not gonna be people anymore we're gonna be some weird new thing yeah do you think we'll be here I don't think so we'll be dead but like that thing that's on the bottom of the ocean that they found that dinosaur thing we're gonna be like one of those things like oh Jesus like that thing like it's crazy because we know that they used to exist right so if we find one today like wow not something still here that's gonna be like people they find some dude who's living in the mountains outside of Colorado is like catching his own fish he's 116 years old and they finally like look at this guy he's got no electronics in his whole body do you think I'd be like Amish people would still last through that for instance or would that be them we'd kill those eat them they would have to kill him the robot people would have to kill their moms people you can't have him around they would they would think they would say well are there like wildlife they like wildlife after a certain point because if we all started out as some sort of proto hominid back in the early days of evolution right we started some sort of primitive primate and then eventually evolved to be what we are now but they're still chimps around there's still monkeys around there's still a lot of primitive primates like did they evolve at a later date did they start later than us it is like that they get a different call time to the race like what happened or did some things stay the same while other things change and it's just the rate of change seemed so spectacularly quick but someone because of our perspective but really there could be groups of people and might be the Amish that stay exactly the same and then the new beings treat them like colobus monkeys in the jungle or like some fucking weird giraffe that you see when you go on a safari look look look the people that make their own butter they're real they're real and we'd wave at them hello I love your wagon I mean they could become wildlife they could become a very primitive form of wildlife they could become like uncontacted tribes in the Amazon what we just leave them alone we think their novel look look they're painted all red their whole body they have a bow and arrow that they made themselves this is amazing we get all excited about it but it's the same exact shit same exact shit to us like then when the new things take over they just keep the Amish they keep tribes people they keep the weird shit that's not gonna fuck with them anything that doesn't know how to work electricity all those people that are out there living without electricity you know like those Alaska the last frontier shows those people would have to all plead for their life look I'm just here however hmm just taking care of cattle and I'm not planning on getting any weapons and we like a simple life and we're happy for our robot overlords congratulations on your victory and just leave us up here with the river haha fuck that right when asking to my eyes looked at the doctor said how people's eyes are a lot worse nowadays and we know more when you're a kid your mom is like don't sit so close to your teeth at the TV but now we're putting goggles in our eyes like one inch from our eye what's the why are we doing that like what why does no one talk about eye health you know like because it seems like if my optician or whatever she's called is telling me about like how do you you should get these blue blocker things now and one's eyes are so stressed nowadays I think that's true I think eyes are definitely stressed biddings it's also that we're getting old yeah when you get old your eyes you go to shit everybody's always has except like my friend Cameron hands he's 50 his fucking eyes are like 20 18 or something it's crazy like I had a crack on my iPhone I dropped my iPhone and I looked at it I'm like I think it's alright he goes no you got a crack I go really hello he was wearing he was writing a little right-hand corner look motherfucker I'm like how did you even see that he could see it from my hand like my hand over here and he's here he's like fucking five feet away from you can see it I got this fucker inches from my face I can't see it I mean it's been three years since I got my eyes checked and I used to always be perfect this was the first time where that bottom row I was like it's an eight or a zero is that an eight or a zero if you get a menu in a restaurant like okay I'm gonna have to start a fire and see this I'm gonna have to bust out a lighter like a fucking concert yeah or use the that gets super obnoxious if you use your phone that light on your phone like Oh or there's a magnifying app on the phone now it's like zooms can't see this is dark my low-light sensitivity is way different I'm just I think it's probably because my brain is overwhelmed by brightness too much you know it's staring at a computer screen it's one of things that I like about that right room app I'm gonna sneeze unfortunately that right room app gives you a dark black screen right with green lighting green writing I guess that's what these glasses do they block the blue light it's kind of like night mode on your Mac or your phone where it turns yellow okay but that's supposed to way better on your eyes I'm sure it's better but we're still falling out we're all fucked we're going down it's going down they're gonna replace our eyes with awesome eyes yeah I can't wait oh that's what these drops yeah they have see some news new eye drops they think they're gonna be able to put in your eye and you never have to wear glasses again what do they do though is it a genetic thing that's nanoparticles so just fucking christ that's that's how they're gonna get in they're getting in through your eyes so how does it explain how I guess it's just a deprived to drop them in every couple weeks or every week or maybe even every day it's not Wow for sure yet but it's not even out yet obviously you there that's crazy just very new it works though that's crazy three-step process perform as a smartphone all the measurement of the eyes refraction Wow and you'll just be able to drop it in there apply to the eye for less than one second a laser though so then doctors create a very specific laser pattern which is applied to the eye for less than one second the laser creates tiny grooves in the surface of the cornea lastly special eye drops are applied whoa like a good idea so they get a measurement of your eye refraction which can then be performed with a smartphone Wow that can be performed with a smartphone the first part and the doctors create the laser pattern and they they fuckin stormtrooper your eyeball drop some chemicals on there and the chemicals get in through the holes that you've made in their eyeball what check on the right how amazing is that what does that works Ivan I think that's gonna happen with that hearing we'll probably get something for that soon too if it's one of those artificial hip things like an artificial hip is like it does work but I was like I'm always like man I feel like they're gonna figure out better way right you know like five years like how long can you hang in there I feel like there it's so close to regenerating tissue regionally they're regenerating all sorts of cartilage in people and then certain people that have had like an old woman had bladder cancer they regenerated an entire bladder for her made out of skin tissue they did this all with stem cells and Mel Gibson's dad mm-hmm yeah that dude was his dad was 92 and he was like on the door and got shot up with stem cells and now he's not even a wheelchair anymore yeah the whole story was like what like his hip was bothered him so bad he was in a wheelchair goes gets shot up with stem cells then all said he's walking around yeah yeah this is and this is like without being able to be fully explored in the United States like this is they have to go to Panama to do this there really were that guy dr. Neil Reardon is working at try to bring it to Texas and if anybody would be like we don't give a fuck let's do it it would be Texas you know because this is all adult stem cells there's no issues with like fetal stem cell so religious people wouldn't involved in it and there's a lot of folks that have like some serious fucking injuries this shit could really help hell yeah even I heard that you could do two things for the mouth now like teeth regret grow like gums and teeth and you could pretty much do anything now I believe the stem cells I think this is only one step I think when you know we're thinking back like 20-30 years ago you never heard about this shit and now you're hearing about it like how much better is it going to be in 20 30 years from now I mean much of it is going to be nanoparticles mixed with stem cells and they just fucking regenerate your whole body you know I think that's what's gonna happen I think people are going to be able to not just regenerate limbs but I think they're gonna be able to regrow your BOTS like refresh your body like whatever your old bullshit ass cells that you have in your body they can figure out where the memories are actually stored that's gonna be that's gonna be a trip if we find out that memories are not just in your head but also in your body it's like what if we to completely redo the body but keep the brain and you don't remember shit if your brain your brain is just a conduit for these memories that are stored in your soul and you've kind of replaced yourself with some fake zombie body with nanobots and the brain didn't remember shit our shadows memories that doesn't make any sense they do think that the people have neurons in their heart that they might that this idea of like following your heart of thinking with your heart apparently is more neurons in the heart and there are in the brain why is that true and gut and gut the heart and gut and they're on the brain well that's no just neurons but that makes sense right trust your gut like always heard that says trust your heart race 40,000 neurons in the heart whoa how many is in the brain trust your heart trust your gut trust you mine boy your mind is the only thing that controls your perspective well that's the thing about eating healthy food that's a big thing is that you you're changing the gut bacteria which literally changes who you are you have to think about it that way like it changes the person you are because the person you are it's it's all those things have to be an order your head has to be an order you know you have to like have the right amount of certain healthy bacteria in your system otherwise it does it's not even you anymore it's just some crazy takeover of so the candida according to the article I just found about 40,000 in the heart a hundred million in the stomach Wow 100 billion in your brain why iliyan oh well that's wrong who ever said that there's more in the heart that's so wrong boy glad I googled that one both it's in the heart and stomach just not there's not more what I'm fuckin how did I read that then how could someone be that off that I read it or it's just my memories that bad I'm gonna go with my memory whatever it is imagine that those memories in that heart remain in the heart and you transfer your heart into somebody else's body like that's what happens when people get heart transplants and certain people have said that they have certain weird cravings and they think about things you know that they never thought about before it's like you might be literally interfacing with someone else's memories imagined in someone else's memories in your body like people that get kidney transplants how'd you get some memories along with that like this is a dream this is a dream or do I remember some shit I did when I was five but it wasn't me like think about your memories of being 5 how fleeting how how like barely visible how like in the darkest darkest darkest corner of what you could possibly describe as a real memory in terms of like being able to describe all those everything around you it's like almost nothing there almost nothing there don't give that to somebody else give that to somebody else and they have that shit just bouncing around their head and like it my crazy don't really think this this is a dream or I believe in that shit somebody else's DNA mixing with yours well I think it's because of the heart thing because it has neurons yeah I mean they don't know right where memories are stored do they do they know that for sure the question would be every cell in your body reproduces right every cell in your body changes and over a course of seven to eight years you essentially don't have any of the same cells in your body except your neurons is that a urban legend or exact 100% real light I think that's a hundred percent real I think your body's cells change over yeah I've always heard the neurons do not you have the same neurons forever apparently yeah which is one of the more interesting things about some of those neural protectant plants and then some certain fungus is like what is it lion's mane that it promotes neural neurological health yeah there's certain there's certain mushrooms that actually are really good for your brains development it's really fascinating but up what's up I was just looking around they're all every part of your body it grows at different rates hmm but it over the course of eight years no they said that yeah I mean that every eight years the whole thing's changed over it's like you're a new person every yeah but except your neurons now if your neurons or where the memories are stored that would kind of make sense but I think my theory and I'm a fucking I'm no scientist but my theory is that memories that you have are really just memories of how you remember your memories mm-hm that all of our memories are like these weird whispery stories you know it's like a copy yeah like I I just there's certain things that I've done in my life where I'll look back and I'm like I don't even really think that was me you know like the martial arts stuff particular I do not think that's me I think that definitely wasn't me or like even when I watch myself on Newsradio I'm like that isn't even me I go watch like a YouTube video my cousin even me i coat that's weird that's that that this is captured and for most people most of their life right up until like the last hundred or so years that was never an option there was never an option to go back and look at yourself from 10 years ago or 20 years ago or 30 years ago but now it's super commonplace how much is that affected who people are because you become so much more self-aware right remember that bit that I was doing last year about like I was doing my last Netflix special about the selfie I could like somewhere along the line people change the way they pose at pictures because look at the first pictures people just stood there looked hungry pictures from the 1800s they just look skinny I'm gone and hungry and if you saw a picture from like 1860 and there was a girl with her butt out and she's doing duck lips really that bitch is a time traveler there's no way there's no way she could have been there like there's no way someone at that time knew to pout make kissy face and do the peace sign and stick your ass out just that's a pose that's a modern pose and it came about because of being extremely self-conscious because so many people see images of themselves every I mean each odd you mangy the girl in Jumanji the really pretty girl was obsessed with taking photos of herself that's fucking really shit man yeah kids do by the way one of the best movies surprisingly best movies I've seen in a long trade fucking movie what a great take on it yes I loved it lose escape I'm traveler cousin funny is he yeah but that's how they lived back then he's probably drunk like I do shit like this okay yeah that's how they look they look hungry Maja's sticking it to her or him she's in one of them right looks like that one actor that's in all those imagine being in a small cabin go back up please imagine us being in a small cabin with that dude just playing that stupid guitar and singing these horrible songs just rotten shit breath they didn't even know what the fuck a toothbrush was alright your teeth just fell out of your fucking head like everybody else that guy below the boxer it looks like it's not even like he's trying to like like be tough he's like he's doing off defense I'm coming at you dick first that's what they would do they would come at you dick first Wow look like you guys had to fight at all well look away they it would hold their hands up too they held their hands very differently but those fights were very different fights because they had real small gloves you couldn't get hit as much you couldn't hit each other so much either like you couldn't just you like modern boxing we just flowed with punches and got crazy with punches you couldn't do that you'd break your hands you had to be much more judicious with where you hit people and they clinched a lot those old-school boxers they would grab each other and wrestle each other a lot punch each other in the clinch that was there was a lot more of that and there is now it's a different world so I guess they just because in heaven like tiny gloves or no gloves they just decided they're gonna try to lean away from the punches more and just kind of jab at each other with knuckles you can't just wade in like I'm I mean you could if you're Mike Tyson but they just didn't they didn't know how to do it right back then either like even if you watch you go look if you watch modern boxing like you watch like Canelo Alvarez versus Gennady golovkin and you see like the two two of the highest level guys in the game go at each other it looks so much different than watching like old-school boxing like old-school boxing was like you had Sugar Ray Robinson it was could have fought and been a world champion today and then a bunch of guys he'd beat the shit out of and then you have a bunch of guys that have like one kind of style and there's like inconsistencies in the greatness like some of them look like like Marvin Hagler could have been a world champion today and then other ones you go back like way far back in you go hmm this guy's got like this weird fucking style you wonder if his style is just derive because of the little gloves and they just didn't know as much about boxing then like watch go watch it like an old Jim Jeffries fight and then imagine what Lennox Lewis would do to him you know if there's there's levels that guy's got to whether they're just in there on another level like clearly who's that referee that boxing referee David's been like in a video lately on that is like the funniest remembers name but I know what you're talking about like loves his job he's just in the background like smiling yeah it's hilarious I forget his name this is a great video though yeah his expressions are fucking hilarious yeah dudes get popped and he goes no do boxing referees ever go to the UFC or Dan Scott ladies name Steve Willis oh just reek I usually just reload and shit that the whole video is just still video oh it's still video oh that's probably what it is anyway he's a hilarious guy he is very excited yeah but he's a good good referee he's great not just enthusiastic man that's a good thing to do to give a guy a real clear eight-count oh he's got the best expressions oh shit Terence Crawford Terence Crawford beats your ass and then talk shit after you get stopped yeah you know Terence Crawford is just one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world Bryan you better learn I started my I've learned what is that open boy Mayweather applying for mm a lot license once six to eight months to Train he's screwed this is a in my opinion this is a 40% proposition which means it's 40% likely that he might actually do this the reason why he might do this is because I think they will give him an ungodly sum of money I mean an ungodly sum and I think they should I think that if the UFC can talk Floyd Mayweather into going into an MMA ring first of all they should give him everything they can get their greasy paws on to get him to fight Conor an MMA fight just say look we can give you CM Punk will give you CM Punk for half and half a bill half a billion there's a lot of money but you can go through that in five years instead how about we give you Conor McGregor for a full Billie and we'll give you six to eight months to practice jiu-jitsu six six to eight months to just figure out how you're gonna get fucked up screwed he wouldn't just be screwed that's like that's unfair to like four people that have been screwed you would need a way more way more outrageous example it's not just getting screwed what he's he would like someone said it should be a thousand to one that's not high enough it's not high enough if Conor McGregor was gonna fight Floyd Mayweather in MMA it is as close to 100% as anything ever gets ever because if you think Floyd is all of a sudden going to become this fuckin one punch destroyer like John the Beast Mugabi in the 1980s or whatever the fuck that was if you think that's gonna happen out of nowhere you're crazy that's not what's gonna happen what's gonna happen is he's probably gonna punch Conor that face a couple of times it's probably gonna suck but Conor is gonna get a hold of them and then he's gonna be like a baby and if that doesn't happen he'll kick Floyd's legs out from under him he'll kick his legs sideways he'll kick him from the outside I'll kick him from the inside he'll stay way the fuck away from any sort of a range where Floyd can punch him it'll be a completely alien range for Floyd and every time Floyd goes in front kick to the stomach boom front kick to the stomach boom front kick to the stomach how many of those can you take ok boom inside leg kick boom outside leg kick he's laughing at you now now he's talking shit you realize you got to get past those legs you could try to close the distance boom spinning back kick to the liver fuck what are you gonna do now what do you do now you're gonna be picked apart until he decides to take you to the ground and cut your face open with elbows how about that how about he pins your right arm down with his left shin gets on top of you and just starts smashing the edge of the elbow into your eye sockets into your nose cuts across your forehead slices you open like a fucking melon you don't have a chance no one has a chance that hasn't had a long history of grappling and getting kicked it's like you're a regular boxer is like especially the best ever like Floyd it's phenomenal at what he does but if you put takedowns and kicks into that it changes everything changes everything he'd be fucked I wonder if he's done any training at all well I know these talked to Tyron Woodley and tyron woodley was apparently willing to help him prepare that would be very interesting because woodleigh's had some issues with Connor I don't think he's gonna fight Connor though I think if he does choose to fight MMA I really believe the move is the correct move is he fights someone like CM Punk cuz with CM you got a guy who's he's been training in MMA for a long time now it's been a few years not a long time but a few years now he had one MMA fight in the UFC but was very overmatched it really wasn't fair like for him didn't make it that kid I mean it's just the difference between the two of them you know Mickey Gaul is a real professional elite fighter I mean he can be really good guys and he's just not in that world like CM Punk's a 40 year old guy who was a professional entertainer who is basically a beginner but he knows enough where you'd we would bet money on him he knows enough for you like imagine if CM Punk who is a big guy he cuts down to 170 in compared to Floyd Floyd's fought it like I think he fought it started this career I want to say 130 135 what go to Floyd Mayweather's beginning fights see what but at the very least he's definitely fought at 145 as a grown man he's fought at 155 see I'm Punk's way bigger he's just a way bigger guy so if he could figure out a way to get to fight to the ground and like lock in something simple like a guillotine if he has a good guillotine that's what I would say if I was gonna work with a guy like that I would say you're gonna queer gonna concentrate on one fucking choke I'm gonna get that thing down to like laser beam perfect precision so just if you just spent all your time doing like one marcelo garcia style choke just figure it out one good choke one where you know that if you get that chin down you tuck it in and slap it on one choke whatever it is that you know how to close that fucker up ninety percent of the time I'm people that know how to defend there's a lot of guys that have that like maybe they'd have a or maybe they have a head and our head and arm chokes a good one that's a good one to master some guys just finished most people with like that one choke if he just had that and just got Floyd to the ground it just got his neck it's super super possible that he could win like it's possible that he could win but it's also possible that Floyd can win that's what makes that interesting because Floyd is still one of the best boxers of all time if not the best still a fucking elite athlete still light speed in the in there like with its footwork and its movement as head movement he's so fast he's gonna be way faster in CM Punk so if CM Punk can't get ahold of him and every time he moves in he gets his face lit up a lot pop up with a dude who's fastest fuck with six ounce clubs now he's got four ounce gloves on very little padding and he's catching you right on the chin and you can't do shit about it you're trying to close the distance and he stutter step in and move it in front of you and CM Punk is not like the best kicker in the world I'll buy it I'll buy it but you have to fight me whether if he'd come same I made I would just no no you mean you'd have to fight her Connor Connor no no you wouldn't you don't think so Oh he'd get killed he would literally get killed I know but that he would get smashed she ends up doing MMA you know everyone wants to see it though that's what everybody wants to see for shorter Ronda in him fight yeah um I don't think he's gonna do it I don't think he's gonna fight McGregor ever in MMA but I think he might fight CM punk I believe that I believe that could happen I know they're not even that's not even like official talk but I really believe that can happen it sounds crazy I know but the whole thing sounds crazy it sounds crazy to think that he could fight anybody in MMA that he would be willing to do it he must know something because he could just go into boxing he must know that he's his time as a boxer is just done who cares you have enough money to do what you want to do dude you don't understand you don't ball that way you know ball like you balls he's balling on a level that neither of us could ever understand how much money you have to spend just fly everywhere in private jets and have limos everywhere go and have five Bentley's and six Ferraris and all the shit that that guy has how much money it takes to maintain that lifestyle and then he's got a strip club and he's got a giant mansion he's got a bunch of people working for him all the time and he spends on everything that dude 1/2 million to our watches he's just always buying shit he buys the most ridiculous shit and puts it on his Instagram and Gamble's like crazy crazy gambling like bet a million dollars on a fucking basketball game yo Dewayne no no I don't pay attention dude I got shit to do holy that the money team timepiece oh shit look at that TMT Hublot timepieces will only appreciate in value go to your nearest Hublot boutique and shop right now for my limited edition Hublot hashtag Hublot a hashtag TMT the money team go back to that again please look at that fuckin watch man look at diamonds in that bitch oooh if you want to let bitches know do you got some real shitty taste in jewelry and a lot of disposable income look at that thing that's pretty actually that's not that's better than the other but the whole TMT thing who the fuck's buying that who's gonna buy another man's like braggadocious logo I see on a watch I don't watch but I when you go to sporting events I said let me see it a lot whereas a t-shirt maybe I get that big fan of what the guys done you see this selfie he posted it's a nice romantic that's beautiful yeah handsome what kind of hashtags to say on there or early morning selfie alright thank you Hey look man he's a silly fella but he's also the greatest boxer of all time he's also unbelievably physically talent isolation or sensory cry oh yeah yeah he's kind of he's got to learn about the woman your whole head goes under yeah is that better though better yeah it's way better okay seen enough money team jewelry but he's got millions of dollars in just jewelry so it's very interesting man it's very interesting because what he is is like he's the most like braggy showy like rich rich type got and because of that people go to see him fight hoping he's gonna lose and he always wins it's genius way to make yourself exciting because he has a really smart boxing style like his style is extremely defensive like he's one of the best defensive boxers if not the best of all time it's very hard to hit so when he's boxing and he's like hardly ever getting hit and winning decisions like there's got to be a way to get people to keep coming to these fights and this is the way everybody like rooting against you ever I should show everybody look at all this money you ain't got shit look at all my money look at this car look at this house ooh it's kind of funny Brian red BAM Peters out at about an hour and let two hours and 40 minutes in that's about all you got now everybody everybody gets tired except Kurt Metzger we had Kurt Metzger on yesterday he had a hundred and fifty Red Bulls he had 16 different caveman coffee nitros how many did he have while we were here he had at least two I think yeah you walked in dragging one I think he had two more really yeah he had three total in a poor Owen Benjamin got talked over so go to huge pianist calm and check out Owens new special that he released he shot it filmed it himself and released it on his website which is huge pianist cuz he's huge I forget how big he is he said he came in here he gave me a hug yesterday I was like a little kid I'm dick Hyde on him he's six seven yeah he's six seven he's almost a foot taller than me that's crazy he's a giant human and a big barrel fucking in net I think he's gotten bigger since he's moved to the woods oh yeah he's been upstate New York I feel like he's grown it just seems like he's like fitting into the environment you know this is a thing that animals do in the colder the colder parts of their reach or are there the weather or where they roam they get larger so like if an animal in their range that's the word I was looking for like if an animal has a winter range or an animal has like a like say like white-tailed deer like a white-tailed deer in Florida is a real tiny thing the only 100 pounds you go to a white-tailed deer in Saskatchewan they're like 300 pounds they're huge they're giant ass fucking deer that's like as big as a white dear guests they look massive they're just a different animal it's because the when the colder climates they have to have more body mass to stay warm that's why polar bears are the biggest fucking bears polar bears and then Kodiak Grizzlies I think are also they're pretty close but the Kodiak brown bears just because there's salmon everywhere they're just feasting these fucking monsters do your feet grow the older you got so I've gone up like from like 10 to like now I'm almost 12 - maybe so dick pills yeah generic viagra that's a good move - I think that uh when you're carrying around a lot of weight you know you think about what you weigh and how many times your feet are walking around I would imagine but you didn't yours didn't I am I did a half size half size I used to be a ten and a half and then somewhere around 30 ish my shit was like getting cramped in a ten and a half then I moved to an 11 yeah although I have found recently that ten and a half fits better for me in those five finger shoes for whatever reason I think I had one I think one of them I just getting stretched out a little bit they just get I beat the fuck out of those things you know I'm taking those things on these serious hills and they get stretched out you're working out now mm-hm what are you doing 30 to 40 minutes of cardio and then about 20 minutes awaits but I just did this new step cardio thing by mistake the other day and killed me I think the ones where you're kind of climbing up stairs while doing they live that's that that's I did it for like thirty five minutes which is normal but man it broke me like I'm in so much pain right now yeah your muscles get sore but that's good that means you're doing something that's difficult yeah you know what we just say in general under out birds doing today birds dead walking around yeah he's hurting he was saying these super sore oh I mean he's yeah he's a silly boy but hey that was great that he did that good that he did it and he really didn't I mean it didn't like specifically prepare for it where he's doing like half marathons all the time just got over being sick for two weeks just went to a cryo place looks like for some help out of control oh he saw you went to cryo healthcare that's now I probably 20 minutes ago oh okay which one that looks like I don't know which one that is there's a few of those places now do you think that is a fad or do you think this is gonna you know what Bert no cry no there's real benefits it feels good it feels really good when you get out like your body feels good yes because of your brain produces really strong chemicals when you're in there because it's you know it's going holy shit we're dying the produces cold shock proteins what they call them and and it also produces norepinephrine which is like a version of adrenaline it's or as a cousin of adrenaline there's no how they described it yeah epinephrine is adrenaline Joey Diaz just did it the other day so this is about the kind of air conditioning I want in my house yeah we would go in his hotel room when we would go on the road with Joey and we'd open up the door be like Jesus Christ fucking penguins were waddling around inside of his room fifty degrees he would whatever that when there was a slider and you can get over to the blue that shit would be pegged like it the coldest it could possibly get that thing never shut off yeah those in room ones that would kick on there real loud no the worst is when they go on and off intermittently in the night you just wake you up in the middle of the night when we were at the Detroit Fillmore they were talking about how men used to come in there during you know like whatever the fuck year it was when they invented this where they built this amazing theater in Detroit but it was one of the first places in town that got air conditioning so people would buy a ticket just to come in and sleep because it was so hot in the summertime and then they go there and they'd be like we just did snore that's how like my gym is 24-hour fitness if you have fucking homeless people who live in there oh yeah sure there that's what people do right if they want to live out of their car get a 24-hour Fitness membership yeah so I like going late at night like sometimes we'll go like that one in the morning and then you just like wise or so many people here oh all these people are homeless sleep yeah yeah what do you sleep if you're homeless car cars yeah like I have a car but that's not let's see I think there's homeless and there's I've got a car homeless hey it's like tan that guy's a pimp you know think that's next level this is a great video that's out right now about this guy was an ultra marathon runner he's 76 years old see if you can find I found it on Digg it's called the most elusive man in North America and this dude has a school bus that he lives in he parked this school bus in the woods and he just runs every day and they're all like looking for this guy I want to say he's like 78 years old does it say 76 years old he's 76 years old and he runs ultra marathons and this guy lives in the forest you gotta go way till they find him these they had to go and seek this guy out and do these interviews with him there he is right there and so all he does is drink beer and run and and eat food and I think he lives by himself and he lives in this tiny little thing and but what's fascinating is when you talk to him when you sit and listen to the guy talk you go oh well this is a very intelligent man and he just finds what he likes what he likes to do is create trails so he makes his own trails in the woods he knocks over sticks and moves stuff aside and and creates a path so that he can use it over and over again and and just runs all the time he's just constantly pushing himself but he's talking about challenging himself and the things that he does and why doesn't he doesn't need anything more than this bus to live in and he's just it's he's not see the thing is you would see someone like that and you dismiss them and you go well that guy's a fool but he's not a fool and you listened to him talk and you go okay so this is his philosophy behind this he's got he's really thought this out to the point where he's become very comfortable just living in this bus in the middle of the forest and he looks good forgot 76 who runs hundreds of miles I mean he looks sexy Anna yeah he doesn't look like you know he's gonna enter in any bodybuilding competitions but he looks like a guy who's got vitality you know he's got he's got energy looks like a she's muscles outro creepy old dude he's got a lollipop down with that skin Oh Matt sun damage dude this guy I've never even heard of sunscreen he's just running out there with no shirt on he's out here with no shirt on just running yeah it looks Mountain nourished well he's definitely not eating a lot like I mean where's he getting his food I mean I don't know where he's getting mine from I don't know how he does this yeah I'm not really sure what he does for funds or if you know tries to live off the land and what man lets you just Park a bus in there and just hang out and live it's a good question I mean there might be places where you can you have permanent parking he's got to watch watch watch it no how much is that watch cos of those GPS watch it's it's like five six hundred bucks really yeah so is like one of them Garmin's yeah that's so like so he creates these paths that he runs so he runs he'll break a path down like create a trail and then run it over and over and over again which is kind of interesting right cuz he's like following his own footprints he's got Oakley's on but he doesn't have Sun Tan Sun lotion right he doesn't give a fuck about skin cancer he tells skin cancer to suck his dick look at him he's like you can't they make leather cancer why you had all those flags er did ya British Columbia you know someone the mountains of Vernon British Columbia lives a 76 year old man by the name of dag ABI how do you say that ABI he has no cell phone or email address revered by locals for having escaped from the shackles of modern society he's the champion of the 80-mile ultra marathon aptly named the death race ABI is the oldest person to have ever finished the race very fascinating men but this here's a thing the guy seems content how many 76 year olds do you run into that are depressed that don't seem content that don't seem to have any vitality I mean we have to accept what life is going to give all of us and it's a fucking an end where your body's failing and you and I are starting to see that now with a shit vision you know I see it now with my my ability to recover from injuries like special especially this tendinitis I've had this tendinitis in my elbow it's really shocking because I never had like real tendinitis before I didn't know how long it takes I figured out it's like a pulled muscle give it a couple months of all right no no a couple months later I still feel that fucking thing I've done a lot of shit to it to stem cells PRP regen akeem it's getting better but shit is not quick to heal it takes forever and you got to be real delicate with it I have that with my hands also if I get out of shape now I get out of shape it takes way longer to get back into shape takes like double the time like when I did that a hot yoga challenge I hardly ever ran I didn't do any and I lost like a big step it took me a solid two weeks to get back to our was before doing yoga what going it's going down just like that old man living in the forest but he's got it right he knows it's going down he's leaving behind nothing Jeremiah walking has just lost all the way to gain during that weight took him three months to lose it we should make Tony get fat we should force-feed him we should possible beat him that dude just can't get fat he's one of those guys I mean I think its whole life he's been had that problem where he can eat as much as you want he'll never get fat that's not true he will definitely get fat especially the eat sugar but Tony eats pretty healthy he doesn't need a lot of sugar it doesn't fuck around with anything stupid you know he'll occasionally put like sugar in his coffee or something like that but he's got a pretty good diet you know I just think that he just you know that contest was bullsh it was bullshit it's bullshit he wasn't really trying to gain weight he was like trying to let Jeremiah win look at that how it was before and now after he lost it all good for him it's not easy to lose weight right I'll tell you yeah you did you lost 70 at one point yeah well now it's you know I'm so happy with the relationship me and my girlfriend cooks so nice it's um it's it's more of me just going hey wait there's a new quarter pounder I know it's hard and your quarter pounder though whoa this is that good yeah they're usually good about it they're doing what Wendy's has always done they're using real meat you know I just go to one frozen yeah but it's a heavy burger like I was like oh this is not like a bitch-ass quarter pounder anywhere this is mmm it feels different yeah it feels heavier mm-hmm that's like PO got more moisture yeah well you know those places like in and out five guys they're always gonna be a step ahead but you can't just pull in and grab one thing about Wendy's is you pull in and grab one like it's like whoa it takes two minutes and all of a sudden you got a cheeseburger Shake Shack have you got a Shake Shack yet yeah I've been a Shake Shack it's okay shut the fuck up there's no way it compares to black in and out oh my goodness yeah Shake Shack is wasted as the chili with the spaghetti no shaking Steak and Shake okay you go hi Otis I pardon me Shake Shack I wasn't even thinking about dating shake I'm thinking a Steak and Shake which also has cheeseburgers I thought you were saying those little thin patties that are like right I thought you were saying dozers good okay my bad I fucked up oh yeah Shake Shack I like way better than I'm not a fan in and out I'm a five guys fan I love five guys if I'm gonna go off the rails and cheat I'm gonna get a double cheeseburger with bacon and jalapenos whoa they call it to their burger is a double burger by ya default yeah by default if you want a single you gotta order it now if you're neither fries though I mean a lot of people love their fries at home well I don't know if their fries ass fries bullshit you got them spicy Cajun ones yeah I got that yeah yeah two of them time like that's good it's just two SEC rally fries it's just I don't like too much those are actually supposed to be pretty good that's not food that might as well be a stationery store to me when I pass by I'm not eating anything in there McDonald's fries all day I'm not a McDonald's fries fan I'm an in-and-out guys fries fan I'm habit burger McDonald's fries I think that it's in my world it's five guys in in and out or basically neck-and-neck I bet if I didn't live around so many in and outs I would prefer in and out more than I do but I'm only around like a couple of five guys so five guys has some novelty but five guys also has jalapenos there's a lot of good I like about five guys so you either fries I like better you don't like Wendy's as much as as much as in and out no no chance not as good if I were to take ten burgers here and blindfold you I wouldn't use you know I would know what's the difference you'd be able to if you just got it from a regular store you remember I used to do a joke about actors being a lot like cheeseburgers because they never look like their pictures especially actresses but you never get a cheeseburger from Wendy's that doesn't look like it's been stuffed into one of those fucking foil things and pressed down but you say pickles on the side so it makes fresh every time oh you're tricky pickles on the side tricky boy yeah you sure they don't open that bitch up and just take some pickles oh they're so fast at Wendy's somehow that's a hack that's a hack the pickles on the side a hack by ready they're fats because they're never frozen Jamie they're good I think they're good I mean I like Wendy's don't get me wrong but I just don't think they can ever fuck with this doesn't taste as good as like five guys or they don't really cook it right when you ask like when you ask for it at five guys they go what do you want okay and you see the guy take the patties put it on the grill and start cooking it that's just a different experience yeah yeah I mean burgers are burgers for the most part but I just don't get in and out shit at all you know what the best is that nobody nobody respects anymore Fuddruckers Oh used to go to Fuddruckers again ostrich burgers holy shit last week man it's still good they have the nacho cheese too yeah I think it's sorta that she's down why does Fuddruckers not get more love I think there's that many of them are they need to expand urban Eddie Bravo and I used to go to 24-hour Fitness in where the fuck is that one in knots dude on the way to Encino in that area what is that it was that call Sherman Oaks and the Sherman Oaks Galleria that's where it is 25 we'd go to eat there we go with lift weights and then we go and eat at Fuddruckers and get ostrich burgers dude they're phenomenal so in ostriches you do not feel bad for ostriches they I had an ostrich pecked me in the fucking head once they're they're ruthless little cunts ostrich tastes like I don't think I've ever had issues it's a red meat which is weird ostrich is a red meat like it looks like buffalo or something it's a dark red meat it's really good it's supposed to be really high in nutrients - and ostrich eggs as well ostrich eggs like this fucking big - they're huge what made people to eat them on fear factor they had to eat a
