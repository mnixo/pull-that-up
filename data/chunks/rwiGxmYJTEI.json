and we're live what's up how are you what's Joe junior roller coaster ride what does it like to be the champ oh it's feeling like this is fresh for you oh well first of all I just want to say man it's such an honor to be here the honors mine I never I'm gonna be honest I'm I'm my things I'm just gonna be 100% totally transparent I was never I never really watched the show I never really kind of heard of this show of course I heard you and all the things you fear factor guys you know but I never really heard of the show until like after a like a fight or two in the UFC and people are like tagging me and shit like yo Joe Rogan's talking about you're only talking about you in pocket I'm like fuckin podcast because I never listen to podcast and it sounds like what are you talking about till I finally started listening oh this dude is for real this dude got some some pool you got some people watching this shit random people would tag me all Joe was talking about you today on the pot guys I'm like oh man this guy's for real and then every time after that that I see you I'm like sub Joe yeah we've been talking about you for a long time and we were just with your friend out there we're watching a video of us talking about you back when you were ranked number 12th and I was saying I think you could fight for the title right now yeah man um and I like to attest it too I think because I went back once I started kind of researching you I like to go back Nuala research and I'm like fucking Joe's been with this the sport for the beginning but you were in the back with hair your hair freakin interview and the guys yet that were during the tournament that were fighting multiple fights at night and you were interviewing those guys and I was like even back there Joe had skills Joe was the beast at interviewing these guys there was no shaking behind it cuz I you know one thing about me I've gotten into come you commentating and things like that now and I'm like dang Joe he didn't seem nervous you were just like a freaking natural at it and the sport was just growing at that time was i watching back then it wasn't as much pressure you know it wasn't like coming into it today yeah ESPN pay-per-view all that deal it would be a lot of pressure but back then it was just fun yeah it was it was weird man the first one I did was in Dothan Alabama and it's weird like I don't know if it was a high school gym or something some small auditorium tiny little place it's very weird they have a you made it look like a freakin certain little walk in the park many ways I was like damn show is good they don't been doing this shit for a while well it's uh it's an interesting thing to see you know to see it progressed from 1997 to where it's out of 2019 the biggest difference is not just the amount of eyes that it gets and the amount of people that are paying attention to the real difference is the level of athlete it's a it's a giant giant leap like in no other sport I don't think there's another sport from 1993 to 2019 where the athletes are almost it's almost unrecognizable how much better the fighters are absolutely uh you know they it's now back in the day was like okay you finished your college career you finished all this you've got to the height of whatever you know sport you could be let's start fighting and so guys are coming in at 28 27 starting to learn the tricks now you got freakin ten-year-old kids Europe sparring you know there's all these crazy videos and like little bitty kids fighting in like Russia or other places like they're full-on MMA fighting yeah so totally there's like a whole promotion I'm I mean by the time these guys get to 16 17 they're gonna be killers you know if you go back and watch like a boxing match from like 93 about a world champion boxer or Marvin Hagler perfect example Marvin Hagler from the 80s could absolutely hang with middle weights but like he would fit right in with world champions today absolutely but a UFC champ from 93 I mean it's just not the same it's not by any stretch it's it is such a back then it was like a it was wild it was crazy but nobody had endurance and you know there was a few guys that had some skill and certainly Corvette poins Gracie there was guys are really good at their individual arts but there was no real complete fighters yet yeah you got the transition because it was everyone came in with their special skills and I was then that was a big thing I think UFC even sold that oh yeah you got the wrestler fine calm the combo the the you know Sambo guy in the jujitsu and so that was the thing everyone came in with their one skill and they put it to the test see we just no watch matter it's freakin crazy Joe my first fight first time I ever watched at UFC fight I was visiting John Jones in college freshman year this was our freshman year true freshman year I was visiting him because I went to a small school you know William Penn University which is about two hours away from him he was at Iowa Central in Fort Dodge Iowa so I went to go spend my fall break a whole week with him just hanging out because we had met the previous year in high school and just you know his two brothers and wrestling it was like hey two brothers what's up man well you go to school next year he's like I'm bi was I show me too and so we kept in touch and I want him to hang out with him and during that week I was a fight on someone like a friend of the team something like that invited us to come to his house and watch it then we went over there to watch the fights I never really heard of it I never really cared I was just a freshman he's trying to hang out with John and part it was this room this was 2005 I think yeah 2005 so it's like first season of The Ultimate Fighter yeah 2005 so we go I think you might have been Randy Couture's somewhat John just reminding but I forgot who was fighting and we went to the house party and watched it I really didn't really remember the fight alright cuz I didn't really care I never paid attention to it I never thought I would ever do something like that so I just watched it and and then I remember the guys saying Amen you guys can do this I want you guys try this and I was like me and John kind of looked at each other like oh no ain't no way we gonna do that shit wrestling is controlled you know the rule you know certain things you can or can't do there's no way we're doing that so we kind of laughed it off and left that day never knew that I freakin years later I'll be doing this no not just doing it UD thrown the guy who many people including me were saying as of is a very good argument for the best welterweight ever I felt like Tyron is like you got to give it there's like to this legendary status right there's like Matt Hughes has legendary status for being the original he was one of the first wrestlers who really knew how to submit guys and then George st. Pierre was of course many people's eyes the greatest of all time in the welterweight division went on this long run but I was like man when you if Tyron beats us Manos like there's a real good argument for him being number one of all time beatin wonderboy beat smash and darren tail beaten Demian Maia and knocking out Robbie Lawler to win the title absolutely I considered him I put him in that conversation he's in that conversation for sure for sure I put him in that conversation I you know nothing but respect for tiring it was nice to see afterwards it was there's a video of you and tyrants mom and tyrant and tyrants mom after it is a beautiful video yeah man it's a tearjerker I I frickin I let it go cuz I'm one of those guys I never really sit and stop and smell the roses and things like that I always I always have a chip on my shoulder and I'll explain why that is but I always had this chip on my shoulder with everything that I do so I never really sit and celebrate and say oh honey I accomplished it so I did that or did that but I had known I known his mom I've met her previously too that the fights I fought in st. Louis one time and of course I'd seen her several times at his fights but I was fighting in st. Louis and I was there early and she was at the hotel Tyler wasn't fighting or anything but she just came to the hotel I think she was just hanging out and I got to sit with her before like all the fighters even came into town I had to sit with her I think we sat for a couple maybe three four hours just talking I got to know her as she was she was just such an angel but at the same time she sees a gangsta - like you - you can you know she sees everything and the only thing the biggest thing I could compare her to is if you ever seen that show four-way Beck's called touched by an angel and I forget what her name is she's like the famous like black actress and to remember that woman's I could go get her what is it Maya Angelou it was no I was in my Angela it was that late I mean she's my Angela status how big as she was and inspirational but that's kind of what I compared her to and so we got we got Chloe you know I knew her and tyrant obviously wasn't who I would have chosen to take the belt from but as how long can you hold yourself back because being a chant is a huge and tyrant sin himself there's a huge difference between being a challenging and a champion yeah and of course I need I needed to have my family in that yeah I'd argue my I need I need to get them to that status to where now I'm setting my daughter of I'm setting my everyone up for you know life better life forever and I couldn't continue to hold that back so yeah it was unfortunate that I had to take that from him and I kind of in a sense I felt like I was taken away from what he was doing for them so when I saw her walking backstage I just couldn't control it I just let I just let go and I just can't help but cry on her shoulders this is a great it's a great video what is her name was woman's an actress is Rome at the videos amazing cuz she's hugging you and she's telling you congratulations and she's telling you that they're coming they're gonna be coming for you so train hard yeah and just like her attitude meant it's it's beautiful man it's it's um it's amazing her character that she handled that I mean this is her baby her baby just lost and lost every round and it was a you know pretty dominant victory by you and for her to treat you that way afterwards just shows amazing character yeah and it's there it is right here see it up here look at her she's embraces you open arms it's all good it's all good baby look at that amazing that's an amazing woman right there oh wow that's amazing man yeah and even Tyron the waiter in here that's crazy right it makes me cry cry when saw it's making me cry now yeah man huh and in the way she treated tyrant to the same thing I mean she's just that's and that that's that's kind of that's how my mom is to that so I felt such a connection to that to her you know my mom is the exact same way my mom weren't done the same thing too tired and um it just it was powerful man it was moving and because it's and it goes to attest to how the sport has abated sport is as well yeah like it's not all man just a regular fight you guys hate each other and you're fighting no this was a competition yeah you know this was two men that went in there to for a competition and one guy won and you know you saw the aftermath they see the family receive each other people love that man they love when people put all that bullshit aside I mean you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of that going on but that sells tickets and it's good for everybody and it's it's natural and normal but after it was over it was nothing but respect and it's what a lot of people think is wrong about the trash talk of this era because there's this is there's an error right now right is we're in the trash talk era absolutely some people are really good at it and some people are terrible at it but it seems like everybody's trying to meet mahse Vidal recently when he just beat dare until it was it very interesting because you know his take on it before the fight was why am i white trash talk like what are we doing whatever you know why we're gonna fight like what is all this bullshit about like he doesn't like it he was like I don't like where this is going I don't like where the sport is going yeah I mean it was it's one of those that I had to adjust to hmm because I wasn't brought on those principles I don't I'm not you know you're come here yeah I wasn't here for salesmen like people ask me all the time why do you do this and I chose to do this like I'm college educated I can get a fucking job and sit in an office and punch numbers and all that but I chose to do this because of my burning desire to compete that's what when I even now when I compete with guys I'm not competing angry I don't want to kill this guy I'm not rah rah rah and all that shit no it's competition for me my mind is I'm gonna beat you and which is partially which it would go to test due to how I fight and how I compete I'm not like that this is not the only thing that I can do and so this error came about where now everybody you gotta talk change you got a sale you got to do this and do that and so do you feel any pressure to do that initial at some point I did because it was um I was fighting the way I was fighting I was dominating guys and I was getting nowhere right it was like no notoriety they were kind of like just kind of putting you on the wayside they would always tell me or you get a top ten guy you'll get a top ten yeah but they wouldn't happen it was like oh you fight this guy and you can't really argue with them because this promotion is giving you the opportunity to even really make money at all for the career path that you chose so fry for a while I just felt like man this is not I guess I just got to do this because you saw it the other clown in Covington he had to do that he actually had nothing has changed with the way that he fights he's done the exact same thing since he'd been in the UFC but after the first cup of fight no one gave a shit so he felt you know what no I'm just gonna have to start doing this well everyone knows it's fake right because he just one day woke up and started doing it and that's that's it they know you have to do people try to say you have to do that but for me is what I'm not gonna do is I'm not gonna just sell my soul just oh yeah I'm just trying to earn a couple bucks because I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna do it the right way George did it the right way and I'm a firm believer that when you do it the right way you will earn what you it will come to you at some point I don't think that you have to I really don't mean Kobe coming to does because he in that dude he show a bit like you gotta give it to him he did beat those on Joe's that was a big victory he did beat Demian Maia that was a big victory those were those are two legit victories over two very dangerous guys he did beat those come yes Absalon top of the trash-talking but the trash-talking bumped him ahead of you in line and a lot of us were surprised you know how it surprised me that he had to do he had to do it and I mean it's gotten him where he yes and I mean look what he did last two weeks ago when I fall mm-hmm his whole his whole deal was for me to create an uproar get my name back in the picture and he did a wonderful job this is one thing that I will I would say that he has done a wonderful job and having people talk about it what do you hate him which and even the bosses have said the exact same thing is no one has done what he's done no one has ever created the persona that is unanimously hated worldwide like unanimously there's not even he'll like literally like those guys who were they still had fans you know that wanted to see him succeed like nobody like he's not safe anywhere no you know you don't even have to be there's fly weights that want to hurt this guy so if unanimously has he's done a good job of creating that which I love and I appreciate that it's gonna sell a lot of paper yeah I'm not a hater I'm not a hater like I give credit where credit is due I appreciate the fact that he has done that and that's one thing that Rashad taught me over the years is that you you have to appreciate certain things like it and I do I always wanted this moment I always wanted that Conor and could be that meant that adversary that was shot and rampage that Hughes and George st. Pierre like yeah I always wanted that and and he's done a good job of creating that so not just an adversary in terms of like a legitimate worthy opponent but a dude that you want to fuck up absolutely I mean I have it I haven't been in a fight yet where it was like a malicious like I was maliciously trying to hurt someone right I haven't been in that fire yes I don't that's the thing about me with my mind my mind is strong I don't compete oh yeah I'm trying to kill this guy and then you swing five punches you miss now you're dead tired yeah I don't compete like that this one I'm still gonna compete as myself but there's gonna be a letter extra oh these these elbows now I'm gonna fillet your face with a little longer cuts I'm trying to this woman is gonna be one that I really enjoy well there was the same we could be even Conor what he said I want to change your face yes when he said that I was like damn that's deep I wanna change your face and you saw that even when kabhi was like that his uh cup he was never had a character could be never was like oh yeah I'm just gonna go out there and try to kill this guy right there's a certain level there's just certain mentality then certain fighters have to have and Kabir is another guy that I've seen that competes similarly to the way that I do as far as his mind mm-hm where it's at like I don't give a shit what you do we talk about me do all this try to distract me like they tried me this will come leading up to the tire fight they did everything what are you gonna do and then you had his his little sidekick that looked like Sideshow Bob that was was talking and doing this trying to distract me in this and then Colby popped up trying to distract me that didn't change anything that's not gonna do nothing to me like my mind is on competing I'm gonna compete to the best of my abilities and I'm gonna embarrass you and then this guy is gonna be even more worth the big change in your skill set from your first fight in the UFC to now as your striking your wrestling has always been outstanding your cardio has always been excellent but your striking is much more fluid and much looser you're you you're much more efficient now so he was you were always powerful but it seems like now everything's falling together like you don't have any holes in your game anymore anything yeah Joe I've been with my I've been with my same team since to start the same guys that I've been with unfortunally Robinson started our gym fortunately he passed away you know rest in peace to Glen when did he die you know he died last year yeah he died last year I did my head oh yeah he had a heart attack man and it was sad I couldn't really believe that it happened you know but it did and now I'd say he's in a better place you know but um he passed and he was the he started all this you know him and Rashad Evans Rashad needed a new place when he was leaving Jackson's and and Glen was kind of like they they got together and decided to to start this and so Rashad Evans at the top of the game who doesn't want to train with Rashad Evans right and so it kind of spread like wildfire to where everyone started going down there but yeah I've been with the same guy Henry who just came down at that time and roof was a striking coach I mean with him since you know phenomenal coach - amazing coach so it's a good striking coach those Dutch fundamentals me yes got it down yeah and a lot of you know there's a I've seen a lot of different coaches different styles I don't you know I like I like a lot of different things but the thing with Henry is very basic because at the end of the day when you're fucking tired and you can't even hold your arms up and do certain things you're just gonna do basic regular shit yes Yeah right - one - that's what you're gonna do now he's inhuman simple stupid yeah he's very like that he keeps it simple and that was a way for me to learn it mm-hmm it's just from the from the bottom up I just I learned it nah I don't get it wrong Joe I can do some of that quotient like in practice I'll do a cartwheel kicks I'll do that all that cool shit yeah that reverse looky-loo frontside taekwondo kick I can try it like ever about like moments and fights there are moments and fights where a fighter will do something to bet the best example is Chris Weidman versus Luke Rockhold Chris Weidman tries this wheel kick out of nowhere and he misses with it Luke gets ahold of him drags him to the gown and beats the shit out of him and it was a Luke has a nasty top game absolute op game is crushing and he just he just Ruth was ground-and-pound and it changed the course of Chris's career in a lot of ways that beating went on I mean he lost the title and then he lost other fights afterwards but before that he was dominating he'd beaten Anderson twice he crushed Vitor he was a different thing and that it just there's these moments these pivotal moments and fights when someone just try something I mean most the time you just get away with it yeah but sometimes like in that is my go-to when I tell people don't try some shit that's not your thing this is the best example Chris Weidman throwing that wheel kick against Luke Rockhold yeah you got a and that's part of everything that's grouped in with fight IQ mm-hmm you have to be able to assess risk rewards and certain things like that and that's kind of at some point it was a knock on me he's like all this guy never gets out of position he never does any of the cool shit or any of that you know it's kind of giving you that knock fucking people come yeah like I was saying a long time ago it's like this guy's not fucking up yeah like he keeps running through guys and he's beating guys like a world champion already yeah a lot of people always kind of you know like Holly didn't do all this he's not doing all that but the thing with me it is it's being able to assess when when I can do that I wasn't when I can't do that right like when I fought already here I threw a freakin axe kick in the fifth round right you know I and I was I practiced that in practice I I catch guys with it all the time and it's just being able to assess you you're warm yeah I knew that there was you know it was an opportunity for me to start letting go yeah and so I started letting go and I mean already is a tough tough dude very tough tough dude he's a tweener hardhead he seems like he's a tweener to me like he's not quite a 170 I mean he could beat a lot of guys at 170 but it's almost like you should be like 160 or 175 yeah the 155 is too hard of a cut for him these days yeah but that's that's just that's nature yeah because if we if we started saying okay which we're gonna accommodate everybody it's never gonna stop do you think there should be more weight classes well you don't care you don't have it I mean 70 works for you yeah it's still hard cut doesn't know what's harder 190 180 180 88 - one tiny believe it or not like for most people that are listening to this that's on the light side yeah no absolutely I know it is but the thing is I'm Sony and I'm 180 I'm walking around below 6% Bach who do you or who do you use to cut to 4 wait for the last couple of fights man I've been working with Clint Clint Wittenberg up at the PIO in trifecta yeah and trial Clint a lot yeah it clipmaker trifecta food system traffic essentially you know the meal delivery meal prep style okay and they do a phenomenal job phenomenal and Clint the reason I chose to go with him is I've always did it myself I like to cook I cook for myself I always you know when all those fights earlier fights in the UFC every one of my fights I II was in charge of my whole diet I cook for myself I do this because I've done it so many years in wrestling all the wrong way hmm I can look at myself I can wake up in the morning look at myself in the mirror and tell how much I weigh and I'd be right on just because I'm so used to my body so I know what I can or I can't eat what can hold food what could hold water and it's just it's a discipline thing for me as well and so I saw I decided you know what I'm getting higher up now one thing that I don't understand is that I haven't done the research is is what foods to eat before certain practice at certain times to feel me the best to make me help help me feel the best because I'm getting older and things aren't the same they you the way the old you know I'm 31 and I'ma be 32 in May and I'm like man I just don't what differences have you noticed a lot of difference yeah like I 24 I just fucking wake up at 6 a.m. I can go for a freaking five-mile run like that with nothing now I can't do that anymore do you think that is age or do you think that is miles like all the hard straight to come it's accommodations 31 you're in your athletic time yeah it's a combination both because in wrestling years I got to be in the late 40s he's wrestling years I'm late for us I mean back is a shot my you know my shoulders are shy my knees oh my god my knees I've had five knee surgeries Jesus Christ yeah I saw you limping did you have one recently I just had surgery actually had surgery on Tuesday that's right I had a double hernia Jesus so did you fight with the double hernia I tore it before I like five weeks before the fight and but I don't know if it was completely off you had a hernia and a broken foot yeah fucking crazy the funny thing is Ali makes fun of me about this my manager is uh like all fight week like if you saw me you would think this guy was like a zombie like I limp around I freaking light game patches on me and I'm in a boot or sleeve and on all I do all day is I go do the media rounds or whatever I need to do training come back and I'm just in my room either game ready on me or something on me but when I walked through that door to fight the 19 your nightmare wakes up I flipped the switch and a lot of people would would they go back and look at videos of when I walk into the cage I step right before the cage I press in my prayer for protection and when I walk in I just frickin don't know if it's like you flip that switch you have a prayer that you say every time yeah the exact same thing yeah what do you say similar long those lines I just I basically just a prayer for protection prayer for me to be able to display the best of my abilities it's never I cuz I'm not selfish it's not I'm not getting in that prayer please let me win no it's please protect me in here so I can go back to my family safe and sound and protect my opponent as well and give me the strength to be able to display the best of my abilities and that's it and once I frickin walked through that door I am the freakin Nigerian nightmare I just feel like a different person I am on to the King I am and you see it in my face I'm good and Danny but when I walk in it goes away I've I just I transform into that person yeah I think a lot of people would be surprised at how friendly and easygoing you are outside people can't tell and that's the thing now is there's really I haven't I don't there's no change in me I'm still the same freakin guy since I haven't done anything since nothing people are like asking me have you gone on parties in this Nair with the belt not having shit no my daughter I bought it for my daughter but I didn't I didn't do anything I just sit on the couch watch TV go back made me go to the shop that I like to take my daughter to get a get french toast she loves this one place so I take her there come back that's it or maybe take her to a date night the only difference is now a lot the people are starting to recognize me more so like I'm walking out the movies people stop me hey can I get a picture can I picture yeah of course you know but nothing changed I'm the same freakin guy I haven't got a chance to do anything I had surgery last Tuesday I've been in bed for a week so I haven't done anything but I don't think anything is gonna change I'm the same guy well you sound like you have the perfect attitude like the idea that you're having making a prayer to just do your best and not be hurt and not have your opponent hurt and protect you and your opponent that's that is a beautiful attitude and the fact that the way you're approaching this I mean you just you're just here to compete and to do your very best although that you you're free of the burden of a lot of bullshit that some people carry around with them you know and I was thinking about this on the way up and a lot of a lot of those fighters a lot of those champions like after a while you you they feel this certain pressure you know to to be able to do this or that and and and some of the examples that I gave is there's so much pressure Anderson silver I almost felt like he couldn't wait to lose yeah he was just like up it's like a pressure the way you just want to put it down your mouth yeah when BJ Penn beat oh yeah it was just someone actually and I feel like believed it was so much pressure George ampere ran away from the sport because that pressure yeah you know some people for me I don't feel shit I was just thinking I was like I don't care like look at this fight now they're coming to fight right everyone's already bringing making a big deal out of it it's another fight for me I don't even think of myself as all you're the champion I don't care I just want to beat this guy up do you think that you will care though when the media obligations and all that shit happens or do you think you just be able to Zen your way through all that shit um I would be lying to say I would never care I would be out I think that would be doing it any justice but I feel like I go to certain people like I have some of my go-to people that I I get to there I call him my mentor coaches and like Rashad the biggest thing with her that I learned I talked to a shot about it is Rashad was always pouring into me like man just enjoy him and enjoy the ride you'd be okay with that feeling because there was a certain time where I was a little more nervous than usual I was I was nervous for what one I think I can't remember the fight and I was nervous and Rashad was like man just make friends with that feeling be okay with it make friends with the feeling hmm of being like understand that it's okay to feel that way yeah and just be okay with it and so that I go back to those feelings and even there was an exercise when I was wrestling I was living at the Olympic Training Center I was training and I started feeling all this pressure or that that a lot of people put on me all your division to guy you can't be Olympic champion you can't do this you can't do that and my coach at the time Brendan slay was like yeah a lot of people may you know made put that pressure on me when I was competing too and said that how are you sure you you can't beat these guys you can't be Beauvais Society of the you know the most famous Russian wrestler of all time and and they were saying you can't beat him you can't do this you can do that and he said one exercise you should do is he'll think of all these negative thoughts cuz people start saying in your mind it's you goes into your mind you know especially now with all these fans tweet shit and say stuff to you you read it if you read it it's in there and so one thing he said you should do is just put all that thoughts into just imagine this vision this glass jar you just put them all in the jar shut the lid grab a big sledgehammer and you just smash it and it sounds silly but I was like huh it was until a little while after I started kind of doing that so when I started doubting myself man can I do it can I do it in this guy he can beat me I mean what if he knocks me hard and embarrassing me in front of everyone then I might slap the fuck out of it put it in that job put in that jar and smash it like have fun with it man you're supposed to feel like this we're shots how you're supposed to feel like this yeah yeah and I just take a deep breath I smile and I just I snap back in and Eddie Alvarez also is a like someone I consider brother these are the guys that did I go to for when I started to feel down and I talked to Eddie quite a few times before this last fight when I started feeling a little bit of pressure I talked to them and they just kind of they snapped me back well you were you getting frustrated that you weren't being considered amongst the top contenders when you were undefeated you were dominating all these people and he was seeing like when the when wonderboy got two shots and then you know you saw the Demian Maia fied and these all these other fights was that was that hard for you yeah it was it was a time where I'm not gonna lie Joe I was like why the fuck am I doing this I'm you know I'm gonna keep fighting for 25 and 25 30 and 30 right what what the thing is what a lot of people don't understand is they think all man's that 15 minutes that you're out there that 25 minutes you're out there training and fighting and that's it you know you got paid tenant ten bro you just did I just did a five-month training camp to where I had to eat right for five months for $20,000 yes if you were if you win and on top of it it's that's society so backwards nowadays to eat clean food is more expensive so for me to just eat clean for five months I'm already five ten grand in the hole on top of it you got bills coming every month that's not going anywhere yeah you know that just to train for these fights I was spent more than that and you have taken more damage than that because that's when you really take damage I'm sparring and when Iraq sure my foot that happened the last week in training my last sparring session I kicked someone in the face boom my foots gone I was the first it was it was bad it was at first I just figured you know it's like more tire you kicked shins and elbows all the time and you you get the little fractures but that you know you work on it and that's gone in a week but this one just wasn't on the way the swelling kept coming back and coming back so I'm starting freaking out my oh shit I think I really broke something and and so I started freaking out and then a day or two three days four days I get it worked on I have a really special compression socks that I have on it the hole at all time I'm icing this thing four times a day and it's not going away I wake up this one would be bigger I'm like oh man I did damage so and then I kept walking on it and I haven't because I have to practice because I got to keep that weight on I gotta keep that metabolism going and so I'm gonna psyche man there's no way I'm not fighting like you only get an opportunity once if I call and say I'm pulling out of this I might not ever get a shot at you right and so I'm like I'm gonna fight and there was no doubt in my mind of what I could do I was just like it's gonna happen I'm already dealing with the hernia situation and and so I'm like screw it and and thing about me is I have a ran in three years Joe I have this your knees yeah my knees are so bad I have not ran how the fuck do such good cardio what are you doing for Cardinal everything I do I do freaking hard I guess I do a freakin heart I'm on that air Diane man shout-out to my strength and conditioning coach dr. Corey peacock man he's also on it too I mean doc Corey's uh we put in we put in some time man and inside just ham it's it's my coaches with Greg Greg Jones when we wrestle we rest I wrestle freaking hard and when I I can't do it often anymore but I I wrestle hard when I close hands yeah when I hit pads I had passed hard with Henry everything that I do in my mind I try to do it at the speed that I would want to do it in a fight anything greater because my whole mentality is when you get tired when people get tired that's your threshold that's where you're at so that's why your body feels like that oh I'm tired there's as far as I can go I try to get to that as fast as possible boom because then everything after that is extra right I just push push that conditioning more and more and more so I just freaking go hard everything that I do I do it hard of course I do it smart but I'd do hard but I haven't ran Joe in almost three years that is crazy because one of the most impressive things about the fight is you never let your foot off the gas and in the fourth round I think it was when you had Tyron her and you really started pouring it on I was like okay he's trying to finish this fight how how much gas is he gonna have left in the tank cuz you know that sometimes when someone tries to finish someone and they can't they're done you know you poured it on you took a couple of deep breaths then right back on him like damn that's some serious fucking cardio see I just was sprinting my mind I watched that bag I was like what the fuck was I doing I was swinging like wow wild man just because I saw the light at the end of the tunnel yeah and I was like you know and I'm just like I was sprinting towards it but then it caught me getting dimmer and dimmer I was like oh shit fuck it slowed down sirens you're still gonna get there man he was tough because I was 48 some big shot and people didn't really see it what happened what started that transition we were in the clinic I had him in the Thai clinch and I think he was trying to work on my body and I hit him with the knee I hit him with another knee and in my mind I just remember some of the trainings that I've been through I've been in that situation in training and I used to train with a Cosmo Alexander oh my god yeah freakin amazing and one thing that he would show me is how more Thai guys would sneak in elbows and so I'm in there and I'm like I'm Tyron is not really getting out of this so I'm like freaking let me try it and this elbow that you throw it's a sideways elbow and I'm in there I throw knee and then I just do the sideways ah board and it doesn't look hard it doesn't look crazy or anything like that but it was I side of the head and I just felt that land and I'm trying to cuz you got to read fast and so I'm trying to read him I'm gonna trying to assess him I'm like he hurt because he kind of stumbled back but Tyra has a very good poker face so he has this nonchalant face on and I'm trying to read him on my way way so I kind of fake a little fake at him to see if he's trying to set me up for a big shot and I fake he doesn't throw anything you keep stands on my old shit so I throw a jab and I throw a a right hand I threw it across his guard they hit him and he really didn't have looked and chained he didn't look like he was out there I was like oh shit he's hurt freaking let's go let's go Todd and I remember I talked to Eddie Alvarez and I asked him why did he freak out like that when he had already ate her and Eddie was just like man I saw that light at the end of the tunnel and I just frickin I had to empty the tank and I'm like fuck it empty the tank let's go this is my moment empty the tank so I'm throwing like a madman and tyrant is taking it all and he's tough as shit I'm like damn he's not going down and there was a couple times he was right to look like he could have went down and all I had to do is really settle back and hit him with clean shots but I wasn't even fucking thinking about that I was just like get this guy out of here now this is what I wanted to do put the stamp on it let's freakin do it it was a hell of a barrage yeah and I'm throwing I'm throwing I'm throwing I'm like red line the gas tank is Oni it's on it's on II which is the only reason I even shot in for a shot I was and then I heard my coaches saying take him down what they realize yeah I wasn't freaking knock your mouth they were like take it down oz and I grabbed his leg and tried to but that was the thing I could recover pretty quickly so you recovered very quick because it was one of those pivotal moments in the fire world's like man if Tyron doesn't go out here how much does he have left I knew I was I was scared because I was like I know he knows he's probably down three to four rounds yeah and I knew I was like I was I was in a sense waiting for him to just not let go just snap out of it but that's the one thing you never really give yourself enough credit with your game is with my games I feel like I I put people in the trans and I like a certain stage to where they just no getting out of it and I not that's kind of been a knock on me people are saying oh you're not finishing fights you're not doing this you're not submitting guys you're not knocking it mal this is my mentality on that and this has been since I was a wrestling they were wrestling you could pin guys really quick do slick moves and pin guys but then the guys would get up and say oh man I never seen that move before he caught me in this slick move that's why he got mean imma get him next time I'm gonna do that imma get him and the same thing with a fight it's like man I had my hand down and he caught me sleeping so he caught me - I was a lucky shot he's not never gonna do that shit to me fight next time I'm gonna get her or a caught mood is slick submission I never seen that before I'm a trained for next time he's getting got mom stop him my thing is even the wrestling what I always wanted to do is I wanted to Tech fall guys and wrestling and Tech fall what that means is when you're beating someone with my 15 points you have a 15 point gap they stopped the match because it basically a skunk like you skunk this guy like he sucked that you beaten him that bad they had to stop it that is my mentality that is always what I strive for and in 2011 I believe I'll not 2011 2009 I led the nation division 1 2 & 3 any eye or whatever in Tech Falls I think at one point me and Brett Metcalfe was battling like every week I would look and see who had the most tech fault it was me behind me me him and I had the most because that's what Mike was my goals I wanted to skunk guys because in their mind what it says is you can't fuck with that guy there's you can't hang with him there was nothing you can do it not even it wasn't a quick pan of lucky pan or or this like he destroyed you he just set levels apart and that's what I do even I'm fighting now I do the exact same thing is I would much rather dominate you from start to finish I want to break you I don't want I want you think about fighting me again it's not you know I don't want you to I want you to say fuck no I don't you know and shit no he beat me everywhere he broke me he took something from me because you're gonna think about you only remember the fights you lose you know and I got beaten so many guys and rest I can't tell you maybe thirty guys that I beaten wrestling I don't have no idea but the ones you lose you can almost tell everyone and that's what my mind take on it I want to dominate you so bad when you think about fighting me again you don't you say fuck I'll pass on that fight and so people are like oh man this guy doesn't really finish guys but how many guys want to fight me again not a lot of them do you have one loss in MMA yes I do one loss right yeah I have one loss in my second fight uh casseras I forget his name forget his first name it's the cassette Xhosa is a hole Jake cáceres there's no real excuse errors I like yeah it's Jose because his name is jose coceres Alistair's old I think it's older brother oh yeah and oh man it was I took the final knockout two weeks notice or something like that because it was like eight months in between I fought my first fight and I thought see that's the thing with Emin fighters coming into MMA now this is a lesson to you guys everyone feels like oh I'm just gonna jump in and it's gonna be peachy I'm getting fights every other week every other month No so I fought my first fight I thought okay it's great my career's kick-starting I'm gonna be doing fights in every year so often I went through 2022 opponents within my first fight before I got the second fight Wow because now you know it's Google now everyone all four he's a national champion wrestling I don't wanna fight that because everyone wants to get to UFC and they figure all its the best record you want to be undefeated to get to the UFC so nobody wants to fight anyone that's hard right and so of course at that point I was a wrestler I could take anyone down and hold him down for three rounds and win fight so everyone no one wanted that fight so it was months and months went by and then that fight came about was just like shit I'll take it and I'll be honest I never grabbed hold before that I never did you Jitsu and so I figured I can wrestle my way through all this shit like man fuck these guys and these guys are low-level guys you know look who I trained with the Train we were shot evidence in these guys those guys can't touch me I get in a fight I throw a one-two his legs are there I hit him with the one-two boom boom double leg I live within fifteen seconds boom threw him down full mouth and I'm kind of throwing punches I didn't really know what I was doing I'm throwing punches and I'm trying to elbow him and jose coceres died I think six to six I don't he's well taller than me long limbs he throws his legs I mean full mouth he throws his legs around my body mmm I never seen no shit like that right my mind at that time was I what is oh shit what what's this shit I I didn't know what to do so am I so I start kind of panicking in my mind I don't know what to do I'm like fucking get out which is what you don't dude right so I turn my body I'm trying to like get up and walk out which is what you don't do and so he just basically climbed up my back boom we're not even sweating yet boom he's on my back I'm standing up with the backpack on he's six so something he has a foot on the ground one foot wrapped around me he's fighting for the choke and I think I hold him off for another like minute and a half I'm standing and I'm fighting this choke all the while I'm thinking like oh shit I can't go down because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing down there as well right so I don't really know the defense down there so if I go down I just might make it worse I don't know the defense and this dude looks like he knows what he's doing behind me he's got a few more fries out of few fights and I'm I'm kind of scared and I'm fighting it now I'm standing up my feet are getting heavy it's getting shaky I'm like I'm a strong guy I wanna fucking my feet shaking because they're starting to fill up with blood my adrenaline is pumping and I'm just like Joe if it is this moment in your mind to where you start to come to realization when certain things yeah I'm like oh shit I'm about to lose and what and then I started thinking about random thoughts and one of the thoughts that I thought thought about was before the fight we had a commission meeting in the back and the Commission said if you get choked unconscious you're suspended for six months so you can't fight for six months because in my mind I might fuck this I'm a tough guy I'm you got to put me sleep I never tap it right so I'm like if I get it took me eight months to get this fight and this is short notice fight I haven't made money in eight months I'm broke as shit I sleep and I live with Rashad I live with another man I'm broke as shit I have no money I need money so if I can't fight for another six months I have no money so all these thoughts are going through my mind and I hear Alex casseras on the other side of the cage screaming he's gonna tap he's elbows out and I'm like fuck my fucking well played Alex now I'm thinking about to happen just for that show hell man and I just saw it going down and I'm like you can't be suspended for six months bro I know you wanna be tough right now you want to go to sleep but you can't be suspended for six months bro you have to you gotta you know you gotta make money you're broke I fucking tap job i fucking tap I never felt so I don't wanna say emasculated if that's the word I never felt so like my god just that's why I said like win or lose it takes something from you and I walked out of that fight I went to the back I paced for like maybe two three hours in the back all the fights fists finished up and I finally went to lock room got my stuff and and came out but I just paced back and forth and the feeling in my mind was I am never gonna feel like this again I do not ever want to feel like this and ever since then I got a fucking key I never had a key before I got a key I started training with Jorge Santiago my jiu-jitsu coach build every fucking morning I was like brah so I give your black brother my back bro and this is the thing is I never I never worried about that I never worried about like yes I was freaking beaten up blue belts before I was even a white belt like yeah cuz I never did that skill train did you cheat your skills but like I knew how to grapple through certain things sure you know I've been grappling at a heart high level but JT wasn't just jujitsu so he kept challenging me like I was always cuz I want I want to be that guy I want to be the freakin blue belt that freakin works all the brown and black belts but he would freaking promote me he's like purple belt because you've been training you're training the geek I'm gonna promote you so he kept challenging being challenging him so now people knew I felt like all I was doing was alerting people of what to expect when they went with me and for them to try to really fuck me up and so he promoted me I think a couple years ago I was brown belly proponent I think maybe two and a half three years ago and then he promoted me to black belt he just asked me to come in and jam I didn't really even know I just felt like okay man he wants everyone to take pictures with the bell and a freakin gives me my black belt another thing just floored me all that shit I never knew I never expected all this I just wanted to fucking compete right I just wanted to be a martial artist learn all this stuff and compete I never knew that I'd get a black belt I never knew that I would win the championship belt be the best in the world at this at that time so I never knew all that how much did you adjust your training to incorporate jiu-jitsu did you add more training sessions or did you substitute Absa freaking lutely I would do is because I was living with Rashad at the time so what I would do is I would somehow get to the gym because Rashad was traveling a lot this is at the height he was doing a lot of different shows and stuff and so I would go to the gym at 7 a.m. we'd have 7tm practice I think Monday Wednesdays and Fridays George would have a class and I would go and take that class and then I would Pro class was I think it was at 9:00 so I would just stay at the gym while the pros came in for the practice at 9:00 so I would go through that class as well and then after that weather lift on my own strength and condition and right after that and dumb asked me that's what I'm saying I was 20-something at that time I wasn't eating in between all the sessions I wasn't doing anything else I was just freaking going going going go so you'd eat breakfast and that was it I didn't eat breakfast at that time you didn't even eat breakfast I didn't even eat breakfast I would get a cold go to the gym workout then we're gonna roll into the next session work out then roll into the straightening condition whatever I did on my own workout no food no food and then freakin go home eat a big meal snap then go back for the night session night practice and that's how it was for a long long time and Rashad was would always come home and say hey man why don't you come out with me this weekend let's go out let's go do something and I was all like nah man I train on Monday man won't do all that I wanna go out or shot be like bro there's you gotta have balance in this it's got to be a balance and I'll just thought at that time like I'll fuck that you say that cuz you're the top you chair he's the best so you say that my whole day was I'm just need to work I need to catch up I need to catch up to these guys I need to work so I was just don't over time over time over time but you know now I understand what Rashad was saying there has to be balance yeah when did you just you're eating I think um we got a strength and conditioning coach Jake Bernard Bonacci and Jake amazing coach man he worked with a lot of the Xtreme Couture guys work with like Randy and those guys back in the day and he's kind of started that you you got to fuel yourself he kind of started you know let me in and I see that's the thing about me I seek knowledge like I'm always I always want to learn I always want to learn whatever I can and I started learning like oh shit no wonder I was dead tired in that session no wonder I had nothing left because I really didn't eat I had no fuel so I started kind of putting things in and and the more and more like I said it wasn't until my last two or three fights that I started working with trifecta and then couldn't Wittenberg and just you know I seek knowledge if whenever I can get knowledge I I gotta take it so these trifecta folks what kind of stuff they prepare for you man they prepared my meals and they sent it to me they send me that like I said I like to cook for myself but so they send like a cooler or pre-pack yes they sent they send me the prepackaged too but I'm not so much into the prepackaged stuff like you know just thrown in microwave Anita I'm not so much like that because I like I like hot food I wanted to feel fresh so they'll send me like the packages like the protein and the chicken and the steak or the fish and things like that and basically I've taken out my response me to take it out I think it's precooked but I take it out and I put it over to the stove and make some you know veggies with it and other stuff that I want with it and and I'll cook it that way so it seems more like a fresh meal even though it's kind of pre-made just for my mind well I get it so um did they have it broken down with a certain amount of calories for each meal depending upon what kind of working out you're doing yeah man Clint Clint broke it down I give him my schedule for the week and he breaks it down like this is what you need to eat four servings of protein four servings of carb that's and this and that before your weightlifting session before your sparring before this you need this amount of sugar and this month is this amount of that man made a big difference because I would there'll be certain practice Ikes I would lift and I'm not fucking yeah I feel good I wanna get out of there - where usually I hit a wall like boom mmm fuckin this is miserable you get by - yeah yeah I guess I just go on through it a UFC Performance Institute is amazing it's just incredible what they did when they were talking about building I was like what is this gonna be like what are they doing they're spending a lot of money yeah yeah who knows what the fuck it's gonna be but then I they took me on a tour of it I was like this is literally the ultimate training facility in ten years it is still be up to date and still be like this thing is now catching up nothing more I literally live there so a lot of people relocated to Vegas just to make that the center of the trainer oh yeah yeah I see like Claudia go Delia's down there Francis and his luxury course but he trained for his last fight in France I believe yeah his last two fights he did it in France and home yeah we you know like that's my boy we do we talk all the time and that's the scariest heavyweight of all time like I don't understand what people are people OTT of people like especially after those last couple of fights the Derek Lowe is fights people really like these fans man they were condemning in my disguise is and and yeah one of those things you just got to give you got to give him time to recover from the steep a fight he had a psychological yeah yeah got over it with with Curtis blades yeah I mean stop Curtis blades it was one of the best guys in the heavyweight division Curtis is a big guys courses B's and and even for this fight everyone's like Oh Kane's going K he's gonna do Kane's gonna do Kane's a better version of steep a and and I get it like I understand Kane Kane is the greatest with ever heavyweight whoever is really seen you know I mean you know DC right now is that's an argument to you know but Kane was great but Kane's been gone for almost three years to ha a long time and people are putting all this pressure on him that I expected him to come back and be the same old Kane like nothing happened well and I'm like guys I and then not to come back come back and gets these scary is heavyweight we've ever seen ever ever I'm always friends with you a little bit the first time he lifted weights was with me what Francis never touched weights ever and that's a scary thing you go to Africa and they there's millions of guys like like that walking around I was saying that his story is like it's like that Conan scene where Conan was like pushing the wheel yeah he was he was working in a sand mine just didn't sand yeah and becoming this tank of a man he's crazy yeah I'm obviously superior genetics on top of that because you don't get to be 265 naturally yes just I mean you have to have fantastic genetics he's got that too but his ability to land punches that just put people away with like he can graze you and fuck you up absolutely and and his speed Oh like I tried to Hollister over I sparred with him I tried to spar with him once yeah 170 he's far with him I mean it was just playing around that's the dam in our room like everybody spotted that right and he loves sparring with smaller guys he loves it because it's yeah because it's not he's not trying to hurt anyone's not trying to hurt you but it's just he likes working on his speech he's so fast I think he's faster than me forced like I mean it's and I'm like he's that fast that like an hour I mean if he even and I said what I say if he touch anyone near this circumference right here you're gonna wake up and ask what happened well that's what King was saying that he was he didn't remember what happened when Francis Francis apparently grazed him with the first punch near the back of his head and came to remember shit after that and then he lifts him with that uppercut on the inside everyone was saying oh he hurt his knee that's what happened no he got hit with a punch in there is small you start pints all it takes with that but yeah yeah what's what's amazing that steep a weathered the storm that's what's amazing was goes you gotta give credit to steep a it means because deep a was weathered the storm when Francis was convinced he was gonna put steep a away after the Overeem destruction I mean he put over him into orbit yeah to watch that it was like holy shit and you think the striking credentials of Alistair I mean Elster's glory heavyweight champion Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion k1 Grand Prix I mean he won the three of the most prestigious titles and combat sports and to have Francis clip him like that was just like Jesus that goes to attest to MMA and this is why the sport is so great mm-hmm it doesn't matter where you come from what you look different good it's what you're good at it it doesn't matter don't be with those four ounce gloves and then being able to rest on grapple and do all this everything changed and even playing field for everybody ya know if he just gets his wrestling on point I mean it's crazy he's only been doing MMA all told for what five years now yeah five six years that's crazy yeah I mean I made this switch around the same time we had her first official UFC fight the same time Wow yeah and what was your first year of your first fight was your first fight my first fight I think was in 2013 or 2012 so seven years ago which is crazy yeah and how much striking had you done before you first fight no I mean I mean the thing with me is like I used to watch videos when I was convinced myself like I was gonna start doing this and this is hidden years in the making like I was I coached on season 14 on the ultimate fighter with Bisping and mayhem Miller I was a May hams wrestling coach so and that was the season with TJ Dillashaw John Dodson Dennis Bermudez and all these guys and so at that point I had started to shout out to Ryan Parsons man dr. Parsons the one who brought me and he was managing a him at the time and I love Ryan yeah Ryan's good dude super good guy man I loved Ryan and uh and I was you know outfitted with ice you know throw up my hands a little bit like yeah you know I just kind of playing around and playing around with it and so I loved boxing I loved watching all that stuff I was like man you know maybe I'll do this stuff one day but when I watched those guys go through the Ultimate Fighter being here in Vegas being in Vegas and in the house I was like yeah no way I'm not doing that shit not doing it even back then you were thinking I'm just gonna wrestle yeah because at that time I was living at the Olympic Training Center I was training for the Olympics right I was I yeah gonna do this shit no that's what was it that flip the switch Rashad really Rashad the same time I think 2011 I still at the Olympic Training Center I had gone back and I'm just training and I was friends with King mo I've known King mo ever since I was in high school and funny thing is I man like we were so connected because we were from similar walk in similar paths King moans from like African descent so am i and he wrestled in Texas and so was I in high school and then he's Division two guy I went division to he's a national champ I was a national champ and you know walking the simular path I was I just felt connected to King mo so I would always talk to him I looked up to those guys Kingman and DC and they were like you know the the black dudes that you look up to because they want a lot of black wrestlers so they was to do that we looked up to like a man King moon so he's been doing MMA I think at that time he was the Strikeforce champion mm-hm and so King mo calls me and my friend Jake Fisher who's a world team member at the times I hate you guys want to come down to Denver and train with us you know me I'm gonna train that night of course i'ma go yeah at training with King mo my boy I get to see him you know so we go down this is first time I've ever been starstruck in my life and this was now I've been watching them and me now you know I've done the show and all these things so we get down there and we're in a dressing room I'm you know I'm just thinking King mo is coming in and we're gonna work out with them there's Meade Fischer TC Dantzler and another kid named Bo and we're in the dressing room we're changing and it was Joe Warren's gym will change dr. Joe water out to Joe warm and badass it's a funny dude yeah and we're we're changing and all of a sudden you know I'm changing I look back shot Evans walks in the fucking dressing room uh-uh I never been star strike in my life I was so of course you not had to play cool I mean I do you know I ain't no fan boy but I'm thinking my motto shit that's fucking Rashad Evans I just watch these do fight rampage and they did The Ultimate Fighter and all this joy like so we get we get back out and I was training together we're wrestling I just can't believe how you know good to this day he can fucking lie and say he took me down I'm gonna get one takedown in that training session i frickin took him down several times ran him off the mat but the one thing that I couldn't I was impressed by how good of a wrestler he was then I started doing my research oh he actually wrestled he was a wrestler at Michigan stage the two times JUCO champion he was a wrestler that couldn't believe how good he was but then after that session we sat on the mat and we just talked and they keep in mind my whole mind is like shit I'm talking to a superstar here right and he was at the top of the game and I couldn't believe like we talked like we were brothers like we was homies I we've been best friends he's a great guy man I mean I could he floored me and I was just like shit I best for shot evidence gave me his number after like Kimmy's numbers like brah yeah they hit me with you but you don't what you gonna do tonight I said oh my god we got to drive back to Colorado Springs you say okay well I'll be back in Denver I'll meet you up you know talk I we were boys and of course I'm like it's like we each of the piece of paper his number I go it's like do I wait two days detects him do I do I do i do I buy it a look at it he a week goes by and he freaking texted me he just texted me on the booth like yo what up man what's up I'm gonna be in Denver this nice you know next month or something like that once you come to your chair with me it's like yeah yeah for sure for sure so I went train with him again just you know hung out for a little bit and then he started night it became regular you text me regularly like hey I got a fight coming up about the fight Phil Davis I'm gonna bring you down in Florida with me to train with me for two weeks fuck you gonna fly me to Florida to train with you yeah yeah of course I'm down so now I became like part of his training arsenal and every time that's the thing we're shy every time he'd make fun of you like you know like brothers do he'll poke fun at you you know you want to do every man you know you want to do this you should be doing this shit over there busting your buttons wrestling like you would train all through these whole race Leslie camp go all the way to Russia I wrestled a tournament if you won the tournament you got 1500 bucks and this guy's I would help these guys train those guys go out beat somebody up make seventy five hundred thousand like what the fuck let's support am I in right now we're just going and so he kept poking at me like me you know you wanna do this you know you want to do that so he slowly started to shift my motivation and my focus towards MMA instead of when in that Olympic gold hmm and then of course I was dealing with a lot of different injuries here and there tore up my knees throwing my back and I just I started it felt like my chance of winning an Olympic gold started to diminish more and more and more and then I started falling in love with this sport here and there and then I talked with him talked with Kingman chemo was just like man don't straddle the fence man because I straddled the fence and look what happened because chemo is supposed to be the Olympian and he was like I straddled the fence and look I lost in the trials and no I mean I'm amazed so if you gonna do that I just do that Irish I was I want you to come down to Florida I just freaking I was like man that said I'm done Wow you know when we were talking about Cain Velasquez earlier Cain has had a series of catastrophic injuries knee injuries knee surgeries shoulder surgeries back surgery when you think about your style that's kind of similar to his in a lot of ways in that you rely on pressure-volume mental toughness and wrestling all those things you're constantly attacking you're constantly bombarding your opponent with with technique and with pressure when you see that you've gone through all these surgeries and you see like what happens with a guy like Cain where his body just can't compete with his mental toughness anymore it's almost like his but his mind is too strong for his body and his body just breaks yeah I mean it's does it fuck with you it's a little bit because it's um it's like man you got to switch out because you want to have longevity yes I've had seven surgeries now so what's what have you done my fucking knees at for meniscus on each for four do you want to left two on a right and then I've also had microfracture which is probably one of the most the biggest serious surgeries that I've had my right knee now is that one those ones where they try to regrow cartilage yeah it's who I guess the process is they they make brake State they make fractures here on that condyle to hopefully I guess you scar up you know generate a blood supply scar up so where he creates a little cushion mm-hmm but fuck it didn't work I feel like it set me back really yeah man big-time who ever heard of dr. Neil Reardon and what they're doing down in Panama with stem cells no I mean no no I've never heard it I've heard of stem cells and I've actually had a round of stem cells and they're doing down and parently you just talk to do you know TJ Dillashaw yeah don't you talk to him about it man cuz he has some phenomenal actually sent my mom down there really yeah I might they were trying to give my mom a knee replacement surgery I was like we hold on yeah let's let's see what we can do so I sent her down there to Panama they can do his office is in Dallas yeah and I had him on with Mel Gibson Mel Gibson's dad when he sent him down there was 92 and he was in a wheelchair now he's a hundred and he's walking around and according to Mel I didn't ask but according to Mel still getting hard-on he said yeah I mean Mel's gone down himself and man I would go down if I had anything really wrong with me to I mean I've gotten a lot of stem cells done here in the States yeah but they can do some shit down there in Panama they just cannot do here in terms of regulations and shedding there they're doing phenomenal work with regrowing cartilage and meniscus and all kinds of shit yeah I mean I was basically right now while you're in recovery phase anyway yeah you should really should get in contact with them yeah for sure I'm gonna I'm definitely give that a try cuz they've they've helped TJ quite a bit I know other fighters have gone down there as well yeah that's something that definitely I'm gonna look yeah cuz I do you know I mean when you're dealing with bone on bone like I'm sure you probably are that I've been on for a long long time fucking hard to train a long time that's why it's so impressive your cardio cuz you can't run so you do are you doing plyos as well yeah I mean part of what like like I said my strength and conditioning coach Cory we do a good job of adjusting to what I can or can't do and you know obviously back squats are not the big it's the best thing for me to be doing so we modify we do different types of squats and things like that and we still get pretty good results did you do any swimming yeah I play in the water a lot too and that that's I do a lot of footwork stuff in the water because it takes a lot of people off yeah I was forced like I can't I mean I'm not gonna go in here and do back strokes and for all this crazy swimming techniques but you know I get in there to get that workout you know sprints in the pool yeah big into um you said your shoulders are fuckin with you too shoulders are me I'm a wrestler you know shoulders always ganged up you know but I haven't I've been fortunate no surgeries there yet but um yeah knees I've had surgeries five and then I tore this my index finger that tendon right there and I tore that my junior year in college and I told that I had surgery with that to replace that repair that and then now this frickin whole apparatus that I have going on go to mesh they do um they did a little bit I told them because they didn't the doc didn't want to work with mesh that we're all cuz he said that you know there's good and bad results with the mesh so you know I got this freaking drain coming out of me right oh shit that oh my goodness look at that this is busting stuff it was blood like it was basically the blood it's like a vacuum I think I called um draining blood but now it's a coming down it's not that much blood coming out of there and how long it was a Tuesday Wow and the worst thing is the burning cuz it's obviously sticking out of a hole there's a hole in me you know the burning sensation around it the third day I told the the physical therapy I was like you almost cut this shit off of the scissors because I'm not big into the painkillers right you know so I'll take it me the day after I'll take it and you know maybe an but I they just don't do much for me doesn't kill the pain I'm like why do they call these painkillers it doesn't kill the pain it does it just makes me a little loopy it makes me stupid as fuck I don't know either yeah I saw I just have a bag of them and I just I don't do anything what about CBD Deva I do man shoutout to I'm sponsored by love hemp beautiful love hemp is a UK company very good company yeah amazing they're doing some really really big things and I'm big into like the oil I have and I have the rub and I yeah I use those a lot so that's in my repertoire yeah that's huge for anybody that's experiencing any kind of inflammation plus for general anxiety and overall health CBDs fantastic yes and no psychoactive effects to you know yeah because that's it that's it that's the freakin stigma behind it no it's marijuana it's weeds yeah we're talking about marijuana before the podcast no what you watching loose it here don't want you going at all the problem is like when people don't get high and then they get high in a pressure situation like this you're just like yeah go into that tunnel oh my god yeah I've tried I've smoked four times in my yeah how did it go not good the first time is my 24th birthday 24th birthday I smoked with uh who was a couple of friends of mine at the Olympic Training Center and it didn't do anything because I don't even know how to I don't know hit the blind or not right I didn't inhale yeah so it's like man this stuff don't affect me dying I did it so so I didn't know you say screw that if you want to do it again and then the next time was a year after with Jason Miller mayhem Miller Oh mayhem knows how to hit that we had I wasn't really were doing he was doing an Ultimate Fighter when we're doing that and uh one thing we do at night a lot of people expect like man when he's not on it's a mann's super cool guy this is a very good dude I mean there's always like kind of like being around Mike Tyson there's always like yeah there's always that edge to where you're in the room with the freakin lion like yeah he's been cool is lying ever but you still know it's fucking lion right you know and Mayhem's like that you're gonna ruin everything's cool but he still has he can snap only so we're sitting on the balcony at night and we'll just talk and he would just talk about these in the weird thing about mayhem is he always watched like he watched nothing but like smart shit like the news like the Colbert Report like things like that you know he wouldn't watch I would think he'd watch like 902 100 shows like that like no man he you know he was very intelligent guy who would just sit there and talk at night and he gave me the nickname that night too and freakin is like bro your first name starts to decay your last names Bush man I'm gonna freakin call you Kush I'm calling you got ha ha ha frickin the next day on set everyone calls me cush till this day people call me cush you like the Nigerian Nightmare free and at that time it wasn't born yet you know the name wasn't ready because I didn't start fighting yet but so I've had nicknames all through all throughout my life my career which is that whole Ben Askren shit that he's trying to run with Homer Nebraska Marty for the holiday Marty from Nebraska say this is the thing is when I started wrestling I started in high school my coach is uh this big marine dude you know was in shape buzz cut why dude and he comes up to me I'm 5 foot 2 100 pounds soaking wet and he's like oh these I what's your name kid and I tell him buddy I don't even think he paid attention and he's right what you tried wrestling I've never heard of wrestling all I've heard is WWE like nah man I trying to get hit with chairs and stuff I taught you that shit okay yeah-oh I will give it a shot and our assistant wrestling coach was the assistant football coach so they kind of would poke at me yeah you come try wrestling come try resting I'll do the football scene then the next year i freaking i nutted up and I freakin just sign up for wrestling I went in and he looks at his reason roll she callin names and he goes come come on rude who the fuck this kid and I like as me coach he's like that's your name he's like I'm not saying that because my whole full name is Kumar Dean come on routine Kumar Dean he's like I'm not gonna say that like come on commodity and Kumar Mart I'm gonna call you Marty and I'm just like yeah sure coach I'm fucking five foot three hundred I'm just scared of this guy and I'm like sure let me you're a kid you don't care you're gonna have nicknames all growing up so why is the UFC shortened your name to come art no I that's that's what you just called me scum oh yeah my parents call me komaru but the photos like my name is Joseph my parents call me Jojo exactly yeah so the you know so that it's gets komaru that's what my parents were always calling me that's what I got myself okay you know but my full name is like Saint Joseph is a he knows Kamal Dean so he's all Marty yeah he's like I'm gonna call you Marty so fucking all right now the whole team is calling me Marty man I love those names I love that coach man he essentially changed essentially changing my life change the course of my life that is such a funny thing though to do ya know you Marty that's not even close totally different letter I know but it uh it seemed to work it works so well the way um this is thing about nicknames if you're fuckin if you're a guy like just a regular average guy you suck your name dies with you you move on on cares right you know but if you're doing something incredible some spectacular name lives on right so now Marty went from just now everyone on the team call me Marty to where people know about the wrestling around the wrestling circuit yeah you know in high school calling me Marty or that Marty guy that did kids good and then how college coaches are calling like I want to recruit this kid you know this komaru teen kid and he's like ooh Marty so now they all know me as Marty so now I go to college and the coach is calling me Marty and now the college team is calling me Marty now here's the situation with this whole badass thing is like I just mentioned if I was just a regular guy whose son no one cares no one knows your name you die all right but because I made waves like I was that Marty kid that wrestled at Nebraska that's beating the shit out of everyone Division one two three NAIA JUCO doesn't matter Ben knows of me so you know he's trying to cling on is something to bring it back like all this is funny I'm trying to hide from it no I really was Marty from Nebraska Nebraska I really was that guy so enough for him to bring it out I was silly but you know these fans fans wanna they cuz band is a representative of the trolls like most of the trolls look like been asked if I can give you any of that's hilarious yeah give you any advice please don't pay attention I don't shit don't pay attention to comments you know that glass jar yeah once you smash that thing just don't even put anything in there anymore man don't do nothing I know I've heard you say that so many times like I um when I started paying attention to the show I started watching the show and I watched the one you did with tyrant when tyrant was up here and and you so right like some because that's one thing that I always felt like so unfair about tyrant is a lot of people just gave him shit because and I think it started because he didn't take that belt they didn't death row in Georgia here so I think a lot of it stemmed from that I don't know about that man I know it does it stopped Robbie Lawler if that didn't give anything I understand but but George st. Pierre still looping around as there wasn't a champion but sort of not he retired he said I'm gonna step away yeah but he stepped away yes I mean the obviously you know so much about the sport you you being in the sport for so long yes but for these fickle fans don't know shit that's what he can't listen to all they know is it's George st. Pierre worship here was a champion he never lost Isabel so I felt like Tyra never forgot his fair share necessarily I feel like the same because because you never took the belt from George and you always wonder boy fights I think the Wonder Boy fights were so fucking hard yeah but even after even before that fight Wonder Boy that way that is the weakest fight that guy yes you know unless you know someone like me comes in and doesn't would you do it I don't know I'll just do it I just do me cuz he's still in the mix how would you do me you know I would eventually get a hold of them I would eventually break him and you know eventually make it look easy and then people are gonna just complain so you know it is what it is yeah the the problem with him is he's so difficult to get close to he's a different guy because his style so different he'll stand totally sideways on you his hands will be down and he can wrestle I mean he in terms of takedown defense he's got good takedown defense and his strikes come from fucking weird angles man he moves like a snake yeah like he bends at the waist then pops forward yeah watch him kick box yeah and a frickin wall but I saw that you know I knew his problem when he threw that one kick that came over the fucking shoulder you haven't smacked yeah question mark kick yeah he's not the front leg he's very good with it he just you don't even know what's going on he think maybe he's gonna kick you in the body yeah surround comes over the top and smacks you in the face no he's very talented like I like wondering what lot you know but like I just felt like you know I saw that show at tire and I said you said the exact same thing to him and that's what I said too and that's what I was thinking too but it's easier said than done because partially what I got into this and why I appreciate the platform that I have right now is the fact that you can affect so many people at such a rapid amount of time because there's been instance to where I don't know if you ever remember that movie what women want and then I'll gift my twat Mel Gibson I didn't want and basically he could hear woman's thoughts and things like that and then there was a there was a girl and the office girl in the movie who she was planning to kill herself because no one really paid attention to her she's like no one would care and she just walked around with books i applied for a job everyone blew me off no one cares I'm gonna kill myself this day so she was planning to kill herself and he hurt her because he could hear what women think he herded thoughts but initially didn't really pay attention to it until later on he realized she was missing from the office and then he like ran to go find her and essentially saved her life but my thing is and that's a quote that I live by with great power comes great responsibility like what if there's someone that's dealing with something in a certain time and yes I didn't ask to be put in that position but they Ino and they just decided no I'm just gonna reach out send a message before I kill myself this day no one's gonna respond no one's gonna care and I happened to read that message and talk to that kid off the ledge and that kid becomes fucking you know when's the Nobel Peace Prize later on in life like that's a responsibility that I have that not in I didn't put that on myself but that I have with the the gift that I've been blessed with to touch so many people and so how am I gonna know that if I never read any of my messages or comments and things like that yes of course I you know the negative ones yet bloom and blow it off but how do I know it's negative if I don't read it you know so that's what I'm saying it's easier said than done it's like I read this if now what I do is I read if I even feel like it's to get negative dilly dilly dilly I can't read them all cuz after that fight fucking I got thousands I'm sure so you know I can't read them all but every now and again when I'm bored enough and I have time like I'll read some of it cuz sometimes it is good good Young's but you know you know I shit you not it was yesterday I posted a picture there was one guy that responded to maybe 40 to 50 people all negative shit oh yeah come on like we give out his Instagram you were gonna die in this you know I just block is like oh man you the fuck out you're gonna do this I'm just like oh my god like bro really you literally took you the time out of your day to sit here today just knock door and he open so your face imagine oh my god I wish we could do that and he answered guess who answers the doors Ben Askren he looks like that just fucking bail you out like this never traded day in his life did you think of the Robbie Lawler fight with Ben oh man like I mean come on they got to run that back i I was thinking when it was over the Herb Dean made a mistake but the more I watch it the more I think he didn't I think what happened was I think Robbie went out I think his arm dropped and I think when herb came over this is what Ben says to that he loosened up the choke a little bit and Robbie came back to it and Robbie probably doesn't even know cuz Robbie's such a fucking savage he probably didn't even know he went out yeah but no Kay said yeah you know this is the argument and this is why he has to be right back yeah there's a good argument you know this is an argument because first of all when when when Robbie ran that truck through Ben's face hmm like he was out it's funny way to put it he he was out and welcome he recovered I mean he got hit with some fucking bombs but were freaking wrestlers mm-hmm the one thing about wrestlers at the elite level is you can be out of it but your body will naturally go through certain emotions grab a leg pull up the gold when Robbie was bombing on them Robbie ran a Mack truck through his face like that under pull that fight up truck through his face like I feel like Robbie knocked him out woke him up knocked him out like yeah I Robbie was just savage mode and that's the one thing about rah and knowing Robbie now because I trained with him is probably such a different guy like he's so well he you know the way handle the loss was classy but that's Robbie man and that's so classy thing in the explanation this was the thing with the explanation is you can argue that fight should have been stopped when Robbie was in order you know bombing on him you could argue that yeah for sure but at the same time Robbie explains it is Robbie has so much experience and it was a bulldog it's like big brother choke so you know it could have not been doing anything but Robbie explained it as I put my hand down because this wasn't doing shit chill relax you know cuz I don't want to panic Robbie has that much experience he should know what to do they maybe that's what he was doing could what the way he put his arm down it looked like it was out yeah but then when rock when Herb Dean came to check on him while he was given the thumbs thumbs up Herb Dean didn't really give him a chance to put the thumbs up it stops the fight right then and there but as far as oh I loosened the choke that's why he came to know so fucking leave don't loosen the choke until this the ref pulls you off of him or you pop his head off I said he lightened up when herb came over cuz he thought that herb was gonna stop the fight because he felt Robbie go limp you don't lighten up because you think someone's gonna stop a fight you don't you don't point you don't let you know because you think you squeezed harder because you want to make him stop the fight I see a point and also there is a difference between squeezing someone out and beating on them when the referee is coming if the referee comes and you stop punching because guys yeah that's one that's one thing but you don't you have them in a bolt you're here in survival mode you can't like really your survival mode that's sorta but bulldog chokes are legit man I mean they really do work yeah lost the title yeah lips I'm not gonna stay and caught him in a bulldog choke yeah I'm not gonna say that don't work I'm not gonna say that I'm not gonna you know he could have been a Lee couldn't Naaman out but the only way to to put that all to rest is to run it back but what what kind of sucks is when you're not you know I pass I I mean on my past watch you what come on bro he said he didn't want to fight him in the first place well no shit yeah well Rob you look sensational and Robbie Rebecca fucking Saturday we're gonna watch it right now here we go we're gonna watch this shit Ben look at the body off you laughing I do my combat sports body look at this but it is amazing that he's able to get a hold of Robbie I was stunned no I knew he was gonna get a hold it Rock I thought but right away this sad I was crazy I was going boom now eat that eat that eat that oh he's a big shot huh huh go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep I'm out oh he's still there man he's got no evidences out no no no I don't think so I think he's eating his shot and then he's got the clinch I don't think he was ever out know there was there were certain moments he was well he definitely ate some big shots but I don't think there's any evidence at all the whole dance to me that lives out this is the thing like man his toughest shit though like I give credit where credit fuck yeah yeah it's tough as hell man he's tough as hell and right now he's just drunk driving right now he drunk driving he's a walking bag from driveway to put it well he's just driving right now look at that drunk driving now Robbie breaks free see I forget the actual strip scramble that led to the bulldog choke yeah it happens from Robbie tries to get up because he does get to take down oh look he's drunk driving oh my god man a lot of blood you caught him with a nasty left hand there yeah like Robbie just looking for looking for a bomb and Ben is just moving for like zombies you still grab a hold of him was interesting interesting that he was able to grab a hold of them because I would have thought that Robbie would avoided that shit at all cost yeah but that's why he's able to grab a hold of someone he's when someone is so you know worried about you grabbing them and they kind of shuts them down a little bit couldn't he's the body there by Robbie yeah there's another thing you did in the tyrant fight those fucking body shots good lord I was trying to take that home you hit him with so many right hands to the body so here we see been a clinch yeah he's doing a good job here trying he's trying to come to it he's trying to you know recover doing a good job keeping it close now you can't get really get hit with big shots you know and he does get to take down at some point hmm yeah I do not remember how it happened or what was it here it is here it is he reaches down so he's got him in the clinch here he's got the under hook on the left side and so somewhat okay he grabs the leg I dunno is this interesting I don't remember this all I remember is the open exchange and then the final exchange yeah - OH - on what he see right now he's trying to go two on one yes good job so he's got a single so you know Robbie doing a good job no I said the hands clasp together it's amazing to me how good of a wrestle he is I'm gonna be honest with you that but it's just funky because it's like not really muscles there yeah it's just like Gumby but you know it's not going anywhere but it's tricky yeah yeah yeah very sneaky very calm down and now Robbie's on his back he's incest yeah sort of inside control okay so now he's got an arm yeah typical Robbie see Robbie is just chilling boom he circles out he's got the headlock okay now he's got the headlock and now watch that right see this position yeah but this position Robbie puts it down yeah it's moving yeah yeah no yep see my mind again yeah I see that's that's what's tricky about this what's tricky about that I changed my mind again I don't think he was out no see cuz you back it up - just to the arm going limp cuz the thing about the arm going limp is the way it went limp looked it really looked like he was out okay but this is it this is what I'm saying right here is initially in the situation wait wait till he turns wait till he turns when right right wait to pull his arms out boom right here see this is uncomfortable yeah this is very uncomfortable yeah you're spread out here and the guy's choking on your neck you got to bring one down to relieve pressure either that one down or take this one inside yeah Robbie did the appropriate thing or the arm fell down whether he was out so it man it it's a tough go man one more time let me see that arm drops just back it up just a little bit here yes any way to drop seed like nobody moves it moves it immediately yes so hard to move yeah he's been dealing with the choke yep no and that is my mind a typical Rob man cuz lobby says Robbie says man yeah experience he said man I knew that that was uncomfortable so I just put my arm down chillin yeah that's that's it now no I'm on your side fuck bro like this only one you have to run that back I would say I would say so but the how much between the UFC tell him what to do like what could the UFC what he said to Ben Askren listen this fight has to happen again yeah that's you like that's the sport were in us he's the judge the jury and if they want the execution what is Ben would it uh Dana White say after the fight he said he wanted Ben to fight him again right yeah Dana said we're gonna run that back and Ben's like not past man I don't know Robbie he's like yeah we got to do it again well I know Robbie was angling for a fight with Darren till but after Mazda all starts tearing till which was nasty man a steam people sleep a Mazda though they do do not know why I don't understand it go back and watch those backyard fights that guys been going out in a long time a man any man that's he'd to better both backyard freshman one day he just had again this weekend yeah I know that was crazy it's about um you know it's like you can't just talk Pete like now it's this era you could just say whatever you feel like you could say what you want because he's a social media you get fans on your side and this and that and he just happened to say it to the wrong guy at the wrong time yeah like that's that's the situation and you did it backstage Massa don't give a fuck like it's you know mutual I think I I think it's a mutual respect with me a mass with all like I respect him you know I mean if we have to fight we have to fight one day but you know like we feel the same when it's like if you're gonna talk shit online when I see you keep the same energy like when I saw Ben Askren backstage right the only thing that stopped me from pushing his head through that wall back there was the fact that I almost blacked out blacked out when I was walking towards him then I realize Dana was right behind so you were angry it wasn't that I was angry it was the fact that bro like if you're your met me online like you had a problem with me right like you started talking mad shit to me like you had a problem like saying things putting up memes and all this to me that means like you have a problem I don't know what I did to you but you got a problem with me so when I see you now like I want you to still have that same energy don't just act like we're cool alike what's up bro yo you want to hug it out don't look like that act like you still have the problem same problem well you think he's just trying to mark it I mean Ben I never fucking Gurr that's how to towards but that's what I'm saying that's the thing like people are kind of letting them all for certain things no now what happens if master doll would have starch him like that backstage because he did talk shit oh yeah at all - yeah what happened if that was him master doll starts like that what happens yeah you know so that does my thing is I when I saw him backstage I almost wanted to push his head through the wall you know but then I realized data's behind me Brian's mom what happened all now in in in England because they don't like that shit over there I don't know I think he got away free scot free really I think I haven't heard and everything's fine isn't he back already that's hilarious if that's the case cuz that's assault yeah but I mean I guess it's wrong yeah it's hard to say assault when you're dealing with UFC fighter right right it's already played basketball off absolutely you know it's hard to say this it's a tricky tricky situation right but he struck him out in the parking lot yeah but I think data and what didn't Dana put out a statement saying that that can't happen anymore we got to do it better something like well but they really should do a better job of having security around two separate guys they deal my father didn't let me near Ben Askren or core cold in Weiss there was one time not before this fight but before previous fight where you were backstage which actually was it a press conference it was a press conference and you were trying to talk to Colby like what's up man I was sketch it yeah I was scheduled to fight Santiago Ponce Anibal that's right and we were doing a big press conference mm-hmm and they happened to have like I didn't even know he was there cuz they hit they had him hidden away time it wasn't until you were gonna get on the bus to go to the press conference he came downstairs like we were all meeting in the lobby and I saw him and right away I told I don't know what it is I just I start my board and I just started your blood my blood you started boiling I started Doctore now as I read man that's not gonna work it's not worth you yo you got moving Reeves like or getting him right now we're moving come and read but they puts him in a different car and every other other fighters ride together and this is what I mean he's already isolated that's so we get there but we have to line up to walk out so he's lined up and he just happened to be my vicinity and I just freaked I was trying to I was yeah I'm not gonna say no I'm gonna say no I'm not gonna say no I just look at him yo I see you talking all that shit online now now in person you can't talk what's up with all that shit she was talking online you thought she was tough what's up with that was that tough guy now and he's just like I think he was reading his lines like what he was gonna say when he got out there and Prescott mean and he heard me and I could say all those thoughts was contemplating and Whitaker was standing next to him and Whitaker does one of these joint like look round fuck this new talk--i to because I had to watch the video over and over where it could look bad like he ain't talking to me and then saw Kobe as I always talkin to Kobe so Whitaker just kindly slid off to the side you know and I'm like what's up with all that shit she was talking and then he's like quiet quiet and then he sees the security Conner cuz then they heard me mm-hmm and security kind of walks I didn't even know there was a camera back there and then security walks up and Security's like you know no no we don't need this we don't need this and this is what Prescott god Kabhi was about to fight this was after that Conner Habib's bus situation yes and so they're like yo who don't need this this week we don't need this and now once this security he goes he goes stick to stick to pick stick to a network television junior stick to this boy you know network television what does that mean because I guess he was fighting his first fight on now on pay-per-view oh but this is the thing you run Fox yeah but this is the thing is he had never headlined a car to this day I don't think he's ever headline a card yeah no he had line a card did he not a pay-per-view but when he fought half el dos Anjos yeah that was the main it wasn't it no how's the co-main event under Yoel Romero and and Whitaker Oh Chicago he's never had a card Wow never never headlined a card well you might be right and I thinking about it yeah and and he's like he's like 16 that worry I might I'm fuckin you've never done shit and so he's trying to play that angle and all this and that and I was just yeah you were right look at that wooden Romero - yeah he's never said I was Covington he fought Demian Maia on an undercard well I think he was like on the main card but you know CM Punk and Michael Jackson yeah tremendous fight no it's it's man it I was impressed with him feet and toes and rolls I really was I thought that was impressive in what way well because he beat those ankles yeah because it's yeah like I give that yeah you beat RDA RDAs a name like that is tough as hell former champion yes I give it but our to get one rounds out here one fourth and fifth round RDA was taking him down like you saw the RDA took him now numerous times well he didn't let me just clarify it he didn't beat him as impressive as you did that's yeah I mean I said I don't really care I don't really care about all that stuff like man it's my thing is all over all in all Jo like I've been on such a journey man my whole life I've been on such a journey I've dealt with so many things that I internalized man and now I don't really talk about so I don't really care what all these guys are doing man I've had a hard life not the hardest I'm not saying it's the hardest life but I've had I've had a lot of things happen to me in life to where I'm just I'm at this point in life for a man on I don't do I don't want to deal with all the hate I don't want to deal with all these other stuff Stan's gonna come with the support that we do but man I got bigger shit going on in my mind that I haven't worried about rather than all that little things man good for you that's like I said your attitude in so many ways is so good that you you're there to compete that you're you're there to do your best you're not getting caught up in bullshit and petty nonsense and you know you know you're just putting pressure on yourself to be the best you could possibly be that's that's where that's where you see real greatness yeah and I mean that like and like tyrant was man there's a there's just staying to where you you get to a point where you have to you're the guy who has to provide you're the guy who has to hold up and it's not not necessarily people saying you have to do it well you you feel that sense of responsibility you know and in my family I I felt that I feel that sense of responsibility like there's one thing your family when you were growing up yeah you know like I can when I say I come from humble beginnings you're like being raised in Nigeria like and it wasn't like the village village where we lived in huts and we had a house but it wasn't really we didn't have plumbing you know we had to go to the well or get water we electricity was rare that's a scarce thing you know and it's a way we even when we came here when we immigrated here yeah life got a lot better how old were you when you came here about eight years old and it was hard to adjust to the school system you know because kids were kids kids are mean yeah I have to talk with the funny accent and kids would tell you hey won't you say this to the teacher say hey bitch call it and I was always in the principal's office because I had no idea what that means and things like that the kids are cruel I had to I you know I dealt with all that you know in English when you came here yeah we spoke English but it's it's pidgin English so we knew that like you know we'll colonized by the European so the English is the word root of the words root words are from the European so we knew English but it's just our take on it and so how much different it's pretty different you know it's very different like if I was talking with another Nigerian I was speaking pidgin English you pick out words but it's a little different but can you say something in pidgin English yeah and I said nothing right now we just down here just talking on you you know so she's not just did talk just a yeah each other not be anything that sounds cool yeah it does if like me and Israel a lasagna was talking like he'll it'll be mad you know like we speak it to each other so going from that to you know being essentially raising and then going through school and and one thing that uh man I haven't I I really haven't ever shared with anybody you know very very few people know is that my father has been incarcerated since 2009 and this is the first time really I'm you know ever talked about it like been in caught my dad was uh it goes through tests is just the justice system here man and so is so so crooked and it's so backwards yes of course we're fortune and like there's so many things that were thankful for living here in this country that you know you can sleep at night in your house and not worry about somebody breaking in robbing and killing you you know for the most part and so I'm we're thankful for that would thankful for the opportunities but my dad was a businessman and my dad built one of that want a very very big business in Dallas he owned like an ambulance company and you know it comes to a certain point where people just don't want him to be you're an immigrant and you were succeeded in a certain business that way it's kind of like people don't care about it people don't want you to be there and you know it's one of those situations where my dad hired the people that he thought were the right people to do what he didn't know the job to run his company why he could tend to certain things like us like his family day-to-day different things that I cared about to where they run the company into the ground and not because my dad was the owner of the company they put it all on him even though the people that were doing you know the things that were wrong in the company admitted to doing the wrong things but what the court is saying is that oh because you own the company so ignorant it's not an excuse so because of that we're gonna sentence you to 15 years so he got sentence when he did no crime yeah I hate to say the thing it was the business again hit my dad owned an ambulance company an ambulance company yes so it was a transportation for emergency and non-emergency you know and one thing that they he hired these like it the the paramedics to him you know a max to run the company because these people that know the business so he had people that he hired from that acquire he acquired from a different company but you know one thing that I would say is my dad's ignorance is is he didn't really do his research well enough on the guys that he hired so you hire certain guys and now these guys are running the business and these guys are like yeah we're gonna make you were gonna help you grow this business like any business man fuck yeah I heard the right people yeah help me grow the business so now they're helping he's they're doing that if he thinks ok I trust these guys they're taking care of the business and though though the most disappointing heartbreaking thing about the business is my dad they're not they're not the one who does the billing the billing for the business they contract difference as an outside company to do the billing so it's not them doing it so they're doing the runs they're sending the notes to them this is the runs we did to you guys build the government or whoever else to pay us my dad's the owner he has people that are doing all this he's not there running the day-to-day so eventually they go under investigation all we're investigating like I think maybe like 15 patients or something like that I don't know the exact number like 15 patients were investigating for these runs or whatever that would build this billing on them and so they put it all in an investigation and they're like okay after a while they they come back and they said all right we'll give you your stuff back like we didn't really see anything but we'll give you your stuff back after they shut it down for a little while so damn now I gotta go back to so my dad's I got fucking I'm getting out of the business they already killed my business for me so now I became one of the biggest company but you shut down for so long you've lost you know what you've worked for now he's getting rid of and getting out of it then they come back later few years later for the same thing that you've already said you're good here to have your stuff back they come back and said no we're gonna prosecute you for this so now those guys I and I've seen that this is obviously how the feds work now those guys that you caught the EMS and these guys that were clearly did rose wrong you gave them a deal and said hey we caught you guys because those guys started their own company doing the same shit so they get caught now they're like okay we want that guy so you guys basically gave him a deal to say okay that I got it was in on it and my dad's I and I guess they offer my dad a deal a plea deal which his lawyer didn't really tell him about because he had a court appointed a lawyer lawyer so he said no I didn't do shit wrong why would I take that deal which would have been I think maybe like five years was the deal or something like that what does I know I didn't do shit wrong why would I take five years so he goes to trial and broke we've seen murderers we've seen all these people that are defraud the government and like stalk more hedge fund guys billions of dollars get bail they said no they wouldn't even grant him bail my dad's a citizen like turned over his passport and everything they said no I'm not gonna give you bail we're gonna hold you what if we saw your accounts you can't really fight the case so you're stuck there and now your family's left with nothing we're nothing no money in the account nothing and so my dad had to deal with that and they just threw the book at him no here you know we'll give you 15 years and this was 2009 he's already been returned he has been in for 10 and and one thing I really killed me was a one thing it was a point a part in a trial where the lawyer were basically telling the judge like this guy's an upstanding guy no cred you know he has kids look at his kids and how well they're doing his older son is in college the second one is in college the the youngest is about to be in college these kids are all scholarship student athletes great student athletes and the one thing that killed me was the prosecution was like the reason that is is because he was defrauding the government from this money that's why they're in college and I was I go wait my dad's not paying for us to be in college we're all student athletes we earned these we worked hard earned scholarships as far as to be in college the defense didn't say that they didn't fuckin say like yes did he have a court-appointed attorney I think he did bro my dad just got railroaded man and it was like and it was so heartbreaking to where you you're telling a man that has raised his family raised his kids to work hard get to a place in life and you're telling him that the only reason he's there is because he cheated and it was just one of those things that added the chip on my shoulder and all man like so there's been so many moments that added to put chips on my shoulder with everything that I've been through so much that I just internalized and I compete with all this energy and so forth at you telling my dad that yeah like you're gonna sit down and I just and obviously of course I researched more and more into that because I was so heartbroken after that like money like you're just gonna for what for how much you're saying not even up to almost a million that what this day just piled a lot of money on there oh this isn't that for a little over there saying a little over a million total which is nowhere near that you gave him 15 years when these guys had fun guys that that you can found guilty for manipulating these markets for billions you give them six months house arrest if that and you're saying you're gonna give him 15 years not started research time like a lot of these judges have stakes in these prisons and to what they do is they give a lot of time because they get paid for prisoner that's and you know that story about that guy and Pennsylvania it was a it was a judge and he was doing that he was sending kids to jail he was extending their sentences and giving them sentences for like nothing and it turned out he'd been getting paid by the way a lot of the river yeah I heard a lot of them get kickbacks and different things from that and so to put people there well hasn't become more and more famous you can shed more and more light on this yeah many and this is your dad due for parole man I don't I don't even know I think soon listen to this podcast alone you talking about this could very well bring someone forward that wants to help you with the appeal yeah yeah my dad actually wrote because when during the Obama administration they were sad all clemency deal when they were doing it my dad actually wrote a letter I'd she have that letter I don't know where I put it but he wrote a letter to him and it was a when I read the letter man I I can't help but cry about it because my dad it's my dad cares about his family so man when I go and see my dad because my dad is so proud of me and I'm so proud of him I mean he raised us so well and to go see him in there and I mean it's not like he's sitting in a maximum-security but for someone to tell you that you can't go home to your family at night for tell you've got in here you got to sleep when we told you to sleep we got you got to eat when we told you to eat for ten years and when you know I didn't do anything wrong because I chose to say no I didn't do anything wrong I'm not gonna take this sentence you give me they said okay fine then you're gonna sit in there for 15 years and there's nothing you can do about it it is a man it broke my heart man and then when I think about it some I just hold it in because I don't you know I try not to cry about it which I I'm just like screw it I've have different situations that happen in life I'm like you know but I ate that one up on the shoulder I put that chip bones I you know what they're gonna say that the reason I'm here that was scholarship is because my dad they're saying my dad got money a little bit of money are you serious what about the freaking hard work that I did to get here what about all the times that I sat in a freaking hot box my bathroom upstairs which is trash bag because I knew that I needed to get a pound off the next day in order to be able to wrestle at this JV tournament what about all that you know that didn't make any difference you know the reason the only reason was there is because of that what about all the times my brother ran worked hard to make national team when he was playing soccer or my little brother getting numerous scholarship for a division one football everywhere like that what so all that put a chip on my shoulder Joe that's where I was like man I gotta succeed at all cost I don't really care and where where did this happen where was this trial in Texas in Dallas Texas not the best place to have traffic but uh it happened in a man I put a sour taste in my mouth but uh cuz he filed an appeal how many fathers appeal one time they look at it it was like one of those things where it's like that judge they put you there you're there that was his domain they didn't even look at it like who cares does it feel like you're using the system you're a UFC welterweight champion but I think that they treated him like that because you're immigrant in front in the system um get in there and that's you know Joe to wrap that put that on that's part of what this next fight symbolizes to me is the attitude that a lot of people have towards immigrants as people are forgetting that Americans are immigrants I just having that conversation last part people are forgetting that yeah and to where our countries yet to where they people you have this attitude towards more Americans go back to your country you know you know go back this is a free country or this and that people like I always heard that growing up I always heard that and I owe you the more I research I'm like what are you talking about first of all this this whole attitude when you walk into a nail shop and get your hand feet nails done who the majority of the people that run those nail shops Asians I'm not saying all of them in the world in the country but the majority of them in Asians but there's a lot of people that look down on it like I'm not washing your feet I'm not gonna do your nails no less people I take pride in that because that provides for them you know they do that you know but people people condemn it that's not a job people want to do when you go to these hotels and certain things who are the main people that are the maids that clean up the hotels a lot of them immigrants would take pride in them because now we're in the country in a better place where we can provide for families those are jobs there are a lot of people so-called Americans the whole Coby Covington whole persona are like I'm above that I'm above that that's the persona but then at the same time people not want to cry all they're here taking our jobs let's build a wall let's keep them out there taking our job no they're providing they're helping this country get to its height the fact that you could come here and have someone do your nails someone clean your house someone wash your car someone do all this for you it's part of what makes America so great one of the greatest nations in the world and the fact that they won't want to build a wall you want to keep these people out you can't come here you can't bring your culture your stuff here it's just it saddens me and it upsets me it's part of what this fight when it happens this fight represents for me because I feel like that's the attitude that this young man has he's entitled to I mean I should be UFC champ your SOI boy you know you don't deserve you can't hang with me boy that's his attitude you can't do this boy first of all who's your boy I'm a grown-ass man don't fucking talk to me like that and that's the attitude that he has I'm entitled to this I mean I should be the champion because I am this way I'm American I'm this and that bro we're all American here and so that this fight is greater than just me beating up a guy that's talking a lot of shit there's this fight means a lot to me so when I get the chance to put my hands on that guy let's just know this the wrath of every immigrant that I've stepped foot in this country that I'm gonna put on him was you and your family are the ideal immigrants absolutely overs over achievers I mean this is what like first of all what is it about Nigerians that do so well in this country that's one of the thing if you look at like Nigerian immigrants like successful ratios of of different immigration groups Nigerians in particular are extraordinarily successful upon immigrating to America I think it's a family a family thing it's like when when no families decide and we get the opportunity to move to a better place the thing is that the whole persona is we're gonna be able to sustain this forever so my kids are now gonna just play around in sports because that's not guarantee right what is guaranteed is the fact that you're gonna go to school and you're gonna become a doctor because you're gonna get a job anywhere in the world that you want that's why a majority of them are doctors right majority of doctors engineers because these are jobs that high demand jobs you're always going to get a job anywhere yeah and so that's all that's all we push you're gonna be a doctor or you're gonna be a an engineer none of them are saying you're gonna be a professional athlete my parents hell no they didn't care for that like I lied to them the first couple years that I was wrestling I didn't tell them that you know my brother is a doctor in pharmacy in Dallas my little brother you know could have got in the NFL it was a stellar football player play the University of Houston the University of Arizona you know my sister now is in college she's in nursing school in college like that's just what we push we want you to get a job that you can provide for your family forever yeah they remind me of Koreans in a lot of ways it's absolutely you know super hard-working and appreciate once they've gotten to a place like America where there really is no ceiling on the possibility you could do anything you want once you get here if you work hard absolutely and then this is that's another thing that's dear to my heart is linear nigeria like when you're in a situation that we were sad my mom was a teacher my mom owned the store to a little convenience order and we we did little jobs on the side which told certain things on the side and on top of it raising three boys rowdy boys like that that's what we and in the school we would it wasn't like oh there's the car the bus is gonna pick you up at 3:00 7:00 a.m. to go to school no the school is two miles away three miles away you walk in you better get going don't be late because if you guys if he was late he was gonna get a whuppin before school started that's how it was and especially the education system so because you miss you miss a couple answers on the test you had to go out and get a switch and you were gonna get whipped in school for the answers that you missed I was beat you in school yeah absolutely the teacher the teacher the teacher was um first of all it's not teacher it's uncle and aunt and that's your uncle your aunt in school they knew your parents to be your family they were gonna whip you in school if you decided to mess up and that's how it was so that's why there's a lot of these smart Nigerians they get out and if there's no freaking job look we got to somehow make money so fucked up cause I don't want people to be kids but goddamn when you put kids into that kind of pressure my parents put me in Catholic school for one year and I got excellent grades and afterwards I was fuckin terrible terrible man and I remember stepfather said something me said your grades were only good when you were in Catholic school I was fucking terrified down like I'm like it ain't a good move I mean it's like they were threatening me all the time they wanted to beat me and make me sit on a nail in the closet but it's this I don't I don't I would never want you to go through that but the fact that you went through that is probably one of the reasons why you're the man you are today that's humanity that's what I call humanity because as human beings when we're growing like and you hear this all the time with parents I want a better life for my kids yeah I want a better life for my kids yes absolutely that's what we want we want to present them with endless possibilities but you can't forget the fact that the reason you're the the champion or like this upstanding person that you are today is because you went through those hard things all these hardships molded you and and and that's part of the the situation now is like everyone's like oh no I don't want these kids to play these sports it's too tough it's rough you know they could get hurt they could get that or that kid could turn into a freaking champion he can get knocked on his butt 50 times and that one in 250 one time he gets up and says you know what screw this I'm gonna be a champion today there's also that you could do other things you could I think a guy like you could do anything like once you've achieved what you've achieved in in MMA and in wrestling the kind of mindset that makes you push your body to the limit like that and it allows you to get your you're just just your body into the kind of condition that made you fight five rounds like that against tyrant that's an extraordinary mind yeah I'm thankful I'm thankful for and this one thing that I always say is I'm thankful for every individual that I've crossed paths with because when I really look back in my life and I internalize a lot of things like how did I was a little I mean I was a freakin pipsqueak in Nigeria carrying this hot plate on my head to go sell you know up and down the street how did I never imagined that I would get to the point where I would run into all these different wrestling coaches I would pour knowledge into me even if for every and this is a shout out to every coach if you ever saw me I was drilling the move and you came over and just corrected me or you said no I don't do it this way you know even if it's just moment an inch in my life you did all of that contributor to the person that I am today to all those coaches all those people all my mentors that given me advice each and every one cuz I never knew that I would cross paths like look how crazy my life is I crossed paths with John first time I ever seen an MMA fight was John John I won my belt on the same card as John Jones you know I state when I went to visit John Jones I stayed in the same room that Kobe Covington stayed in the following year when he went to school with John Jones how fucking crazy is that that's pretty fucking crazy John's roommate was Joe soda who also in the UFC yeah like you know went to the University of Nebraska at Kearney became a national champion Sheamus traveled wrestled with traveled along him Joe and Jake Ellenberger Jake Ellenberger and you see Joe elenberg in the UFC like the I cook at the past that I've crossed in this life to get me to this point here I'm an extremely thankful man III at the end of the day there's nothing that I can do that I gotta give it up like this was a plan I didn't this wasn't me I didn't control they say you know what when I'm 25 and when I'm I'm gonna do that I'm do that do that and it all come together like that hey I've been blessed I've been very very blessed to cross paths with all these guys and and it's gotten me into this moment so I'm so thankful well I think it's both you definitely been blessed as all of us have but not besides just being fortunate it's you you went through the work you went through the work and you completed the process you know and that just the fact that you fought Tyron motherfucking Woodley with a broken foot and a hernia and still dominated him for five rounds is crazy you don't you don't get to that without having you built your mind in your body in a very crazy way and in a way through the fires of hard work and discipline you forged a champion yeah I mean thank you Joe like that that's it's all it all goes back to everything like this is how my mind works it ever since I was little I'm one of those guys I sound silly but I'm a one trip kind of guy when I go to the grocery store and I'm bringing all that shit in the house I'm a one trip carry them in one trip I'm gonna do it all I don't matter I don't care how much it is I'm gonna try to do it in one trip and this is what thing that I say to myself when I'm carrying all that stuff inside yeah it hurts yes heavy yeah this makes no sense the house is literally 50 feet from that from the car but my mind while I'm carrying all that heavy shit I am breaking yeah one trip one should get tough baby get tough bit tough I've been doing that since I was a kid get off get off you can do it you don't get tough or what I'm doing sets of stuff reps and you know the coaches like all right four sets of ten I'm doing town when I get to like ten I can do one more 11 let's get 11 boom get an extra set in I've been putting in extra set forever forever to where I feel like all that has built me up to where my mind is today your mind is there but do you do you have a concern like what we were talking about before with Cain Velasquez that your mind might be too strong for the tissue too strong for the ligaments too strong for the joints I mean this is what I worry about with a guy like you yeah there's got a mentally strong yeah I have no fear of that at all no I my concern was with the guy like Cain Velasquez got this there's certain people that are worried that they might do too much or push too hard but the fucking problem is the only way you become a Cain Velasquez or become you is to have that mindset to begin with Joe how else can you see Cain Velasquez fighting can't say it can't see him trainer that's what made Cain yeah and I think that's all part of the plan like there's a time for everybody there's a time there was a time designed for tyron woodley to become champion to be champion there's a time for me to be champion and to reign as a champion there's a time for everybody of course I'm and like I said I like to take all these different knowledge that I get and I like to put it all together so of course my coaches aren't now that no one to tell me y'all just go home like you you look great if teach my mind I want to freaking go harder than you do you've done great go home so when I'm listening and I'm giving them the lead on that but the way I train is what's gotten me here know the way Cain train is what's gotten them there now it's the responsibility and not just came but everybody else that's around him that he really confides it to let him know when it's too much and when it's not too much yeah well with Cain there's so many issues now because the the surgeries have been so extensive and back surgery and knee surgeries and reconstructions not just meniscus like you but the actual structure the knee itself one thing that I yeah one thing that I would always say is Cain you can't always with with can with anybody else's the human body and the human mind is so powerful you can never say oh man that's it's over for that guy or that guy's never gonna be the same he's never known you never know I can't you know much respect can't can come back and be a savage and still run through guys for the next year or two first you never know that so if he gets his knee fixed I don't know what the extent of that that injury was but yeah I'm you know I'm hopeful and optimistic that he's gonna be back soon you know but there's I feel like there's a time for everybody and if Cain doesn't fire like that can you imagine Cain fighting any other way of unconscious point fighting oh no I mean you can't no you can't no that's why there's an argument that is the best UFC heavyweight ever he's in it for so for sure one of the best UFC heavyweight Samer absolutely no not even a question yeah now when do they have you fighting Colby when is that supposed to take place I don't know you don't know I think it's uh I have to get healthy first mm-hmm for a long long time I've been fighting her but I just like I don't contact dr. Reardon give it to you yeah I've been fighting her for so long know like whether it's me or there's been training cancer I can barely walk like why not train him walk walk for I think the last two years my daughter laughs at me I come down the stairs backwards really I go down the stairs backwards because he leaves pressure on my knees Jesus Christ and my daughter laughs at me but I it was a time when I couldn't walk that's crazy before the Leon Edwards fight I fought Leon Edwards years ago before that fight I could walk I mean I shit you not so walk down to him from the house like from the car to the house he was in pain I walked on grass I couldn't watch on concrete because I felt like that relieves a little bit more stress like that's the extent of the pain that I've been in some of these fights thought I was fucking insane oh this is during the camp I'm doing the camp just didn't make it to the fuck just walking on grass instead of conquer it walking on grass instead of concrete cuz it's a softer it's cry and it doesn't it's not as much hard the hard surface to walk on so just when the fight came on you just put it all side yeah when I walk to that cage fuck it let's go this is a matter of me getting maybe ten thousand dollars let's go I chose to be here instead of sitting in front of it instead of sitting at a desk made earning money so providing for my family is how I'm gonna do it and like I said Joe like my daughter later freaking fire on me Joe yeah man I when I does adorable moment man and you had her he carried her I can't put the belt but I want her to uh she's looking around when she yeah when she grows up I want her to remember that forever because uh she lit a fire I part of him remember we're talking about that the tank that you have in there part of why I'm a little scared to be locked in those tank it's because I've never been claustrophobic ever in my life I never was but there was a time when I found out that I was gonna have her that my girl was pregnant with her at the time I I'm freakin live with Rashad Evans I have no money in my bank account I'm broke as hell and I'm having a child and I'm not married yet and these are especially these are these principals your African parents are you gotta be married and things like that I'm not married yet of course her mom's phenomenal woman phenomenal and I'm not married and all these things happening I was fuckin my mind I was panicking and I fight before that I just lost this was right after I lost the second fight now I'm getting ready for the third fight and there was this doctor doctor's office that we go in and sleep in the hyperbaric chamber because we heard it better for your body and stuff like that so I'd been doing it here and there once a week I go in and sleep in the black the plastic ones they zip you up and then it compresses up and I was in there and one time I was in there and I started thinking I usually pass out and when I it starts to decompress I wake up I'm in that thing and I wake up you know but it hasn't decompressed yet you know so I never really thought anything of it I don't risk on it in there and I'm in this office in this room it's dark because they're the nurses they flip the light off and then go on about their business tending to other patients and I'm like I'll fight this fight I got I got choked out my that's fine well okay it should might happen again let's do like they say this dude is tough these days they saying this doing stuff he gets crap oh I might have a daughter shit I'm broken I got no money oh I gotta win this fight cuz I'm fighting for like $2,000 wanted one if I went in $2,000 all this shit is going through my head now this tech hasn't decompressed the room is dark no I'm hearing nothing no nurses so now I start to get hot I mean the thing and I started getting a little hot in the tank I'm like okay so now my body's getting a little high I'm laying there now I started dripping my forehead is dripping sweat so I'm trying to control my relax bro you've done this so many times relax you got this you got this thanks good I can't see the clock so I don't know how much time is going

tank so I'm tapping on the day I'm like you know trying to ask my a i'ma Tommy got left just saying at least hear another voice right nothing nothing they can't hear me because it's loud that tank is loud and I'm relax I'm full-on panic attack in there full-on panic attack and I'm trying to bring myself back I'm calming myself down and I'm sweating heavily like profusely now I'm dripping and all of a sudden I'm tapping this thing hard and a nurse walks in as soon as she walks in and flips the light I hear the machine start to decompress oh fuck you thank God and I'm like she opens it you okay oh yeah I'm good I just get a little high but I had a full-blown panic attack in there I have not been in a whole and hyperbaric chamber since I tried it one time I probably could have done it but helping you I couldn't really tell my body is so damaged at the time like I'm so crazy on my body it's hard for me to tell it's supposed to heighten recoveries yeah and supposed to heighten it but I I after that day like i certain things kind of make me feel a certain way like I've had tons of MRIs after that but they freak me out because you put me in the MRI machine especially when you got to do the head one I gotta go in headfirst I don't like those I have to give my life to give myself a pep talks and calm myself down and go in there to do those now mmm like I just didn't want the other last week before I got my had my surgery and the ladies trying to put me I'm not yo I just got an MRI I got the disk from the last one that I did last week yeah the doctor said I could just bring this disc in and I'm good she's like the doctor wants us to get a new one I'm like you sure about that like I already got this yeah like no we gotta do one my hollow is gonna be 40 minutes fuck 40 minute

minutes in that I'm just fucking halfway panic attack through the rest but I'll get through it yeah it's scary but you know since that day you know um and it's crazy like I at that point when I was i pregnant we were pregnant my daughter I was just like fuck am I gonna survive I can't keep asking this grown man Rashad that works hard to support me I can't do that I got making my own I gotta do this so I was scared I was scared you know what's gonna happen and then all of a sudden you know right when we're having her we have her boom boom the opportunity comes out we're gonna do the Ultimate Fighter I said no I don't want to do the Ultimate Fighter and there was AI was like you know buddy bro you got do this fucking end up doing the Ultimate Fighter boom I when the Ultimate Fighter boom I fight for the finale boom I do this like rollercoaster boom boom boom boom boom all the hard work everything that I've been putting there boom starts paying off paying off now I'm making ten and ten okay you feel like that's that's enough to be able to you know sustain me until I got to fight again you gotta find it you gotta fight it yeah boom this happens this happens I get with you know amazing manager Ali Abdulaziz who freaking you know helped just transform the career take it to the next level you know and get with him and now things are going the way that I you know I've been wanting them to go boom boom boom but everything's ma'am and it was just it's just motivation to keep working like and every time I look at my daughter how innocent she is how sweet and wonderful she is man he just freakin it transforms me don't worry I'm and there's a video and I even have a video of her because she's been coming to the gym with me ever since she was six months old I should take her to the gym moms at work she'd come in the gym with me and when she comes to the gym she knows when I do she watches me do it all the time this is video where she she has she has a gloves and she hits the bag to when I and I was doing a circuit I was getting ready for a fight and she's running around with me and she's chairing me on she's like let's go daddy I'm so proud of him and like talented my coach and she said come on daddy like uh and I watched his videos and I'm just like I was always one of those hard guidelines then I don't be no sucker when I have kids like that I'm gonna be acting like that I can't watch a video with her and I smile it's the craziest thing to me and we don't have children will never totally understand no it's a different it's a different fire that they light underneath you man and I don't get motivated once you have kids you're never gonna get motivation know that you probably shouldn't have just been doing that anyways it changed my life for sure yeah she is uh and she's my little she's my little rider she rides with me she I love her to death man I can't nothin I can't explain it I can't explain it she is she's my she's my plus one that's like last month last month no matter whatever I do in life from now on she's a plus one she's with me that's amazing yeah I gotta find the video but it's so funny it's so funny when I'm doing like a circuit and I'm running around and you could see her run around like come on daddy I'm so proud of him so she's just hanging out like no one's watching her know she's a girl like I was into six months a lot put her in straw in her car seat just put her by the side of Matt bones she just watched me train for two hours Wow two hours to when she got to you know a certain point where we had a like a daycare in the gym and she would go in the gym she would go to the daycare and she was she was good there and then to the point where now like the kids that are in our gym around similar age and our coach's wife Henry Pookie she does a good job and she just watch them you know but they govern themselves they just play around on the other side to run around but it's not like they're around harmful things in the gym you know they just have a good time that's great that you have that environment yeah and she's like I said like a lot of people like a home and she's so beautiful you I'm not worried like my daughter's gonna have a nice one - and a hard low cake and you know whoever can deal with that Hey yeah man but yes she lit that fire and uh and I dreamt about that moment so it's so surreal Joe I think about that moment like when you interview me like I freaking forgot your name I'm like Joe wait your name is yeah your name is Joe fuck it's gotta be surreal when they put that belter on you for the first time yeah because I imagine that so many times no ABI let me ask you something honestly do you like the new belt of the old Bell initially I used to talk sounds like man not because that's all you picture that is and we're human beings people don't like change right you know that was the things like oh man she look like a spaceship but that fucking thing is phenomenal that's your belt phenomenal.i that new belt now is phenomenal it's amazing you've won beautiful it's beautiful of course I always wanted that old belt you know but now it's like comparing to know like this new belts kind of those colors and this country flags on and it's tones it's amazing like you know the people that all the ones that are still hating on it and said oh no don't change wait till you put that belt on you which can hold that thing and it's super heavy and it's amazing it's amazing I love it what did you think about that uh the deal today where all the paper views are gonna be on ESPN Plus fucking the UFC baby these guys are they is always a way to cut out the middleman yeah I guess so yeah hopefully this is the thing is my hope is now the pay-per-view scale for the fighters bumps that's what I hope mmm but I hope the numbers stay high people have to subscribe now oh yes I believe I'm not sure like that can't be because if you're paying your money like unless you get it free like because if you wait it is chamber it says you have to subscribe to ESPN plus in order to get a pay-per-view well how does that work with people that are out of the country I believe it's cheaper though I think it's this same price you're paying at the end of the day cuz I think it was like 65 or 70 yeah but now you get a subscriptions D instead of 65 right and comes at the subscription right so you have but you have to subscribe and you can cancel at any time so you can subscribe so you have to read what if someone wants to buy one or two pay-per-view a year they Bri subscribe every time I guess yeah I mean yeah I mean it's yeah it works I mean if you really wanna I hope it doesn't mess with the numbers but wish I was in here so you could talk some shit shit about this but if Shaw was here Brandon Brandon other guys I think Brendan's do his shows got big huge like doing phenomenal yeah I I went to one of his shows down and uh Florida West Palm yes Florida and uh I gotta fuckin spread the shop didn't think he was funny he's pretty sure I was bored and I like let's go to a brother's job show and I go he was freaking funny like he told the whole story man and I was impressed man man hats off the branch table like he was funny he just basically all he did was tell his story what's going on and what went on in his life in his career but the shit hit the twist it was freaking funny so I went backstage towards the end I was like man that show was funny anything you were funny but that was I was amazing I loved it well he's showing fighters that there's a path outside of fighting absolutely he makes way more money now than he ever made during fighting times and he's doing well and he's happy and he's he fulfilled he's got two great podcasts that he's doing he does comedy shows just did just film to Showtime special he's doing that's amazing and which is excuse me part of um like all this whole shit people giving tyrannous and giving him shit for you know doing music or doing movies and all this stuff like that man nah man I'm more power to him I'm glad that he's doing that because that's what we want you want all these different revenue streams we don't have to get punched in the face you do 50 you got an excellent strategy yeah and I and I love that and I appreciate that that's what I want to do like you freaking it Imaginarium Francis in the next black panther you can see it right like what perfect yes you did what perfect we should definitely whoever is making that movie casting for that Hey yeah Francis in Ghana you don't need to teach us accents at all like and from from Nigeria there's no team you have to teach me I have my own accent you could teach them you know yeah I could teach them sell off entick yeah so you know yeah I commend them for that man you know you learn about being an exit strategy absolutely yeah I think I'm gonna do all that like I know I've been commentating i work with titan FC down in South Florida it's amazing show - you know I commentator game writers come out of there very good I mean they sometimes I'm watching these guys fought each other for one in one yeah I'm crazy like good they want to get into the big show absolutely yeah man yeah my commentate for them I think that's that's how you have c5 pass right yes if I pass yeah and so yeah I want to get into movies I've been you know practice and I I think I could do it like I'm not in no way saying what they do is easy like those actors like I know they work hard to being able to transform and make people feel a certain way and evoke certain emotions from different people with your characters that's a real art so I respect that and I want to learn more about that and yeah I definitely what I want to do movies to get more famous richer and not get punched in the face off for sure absolutely what about doing a podcast you ever thought of that yeah I would love it you know I just like this it hasn't been approached with the right you know with the right situation beautiful thing about podcast you don't need anybody yeah you don't need shit you just need a fucking tape player you could use it on your phone you could record what you think there's great little tiny microphones that stick in the bottom of your iPhone and it worked great and you just sit down and talk about shit yeah well you have to give that a try when I don't want right now is that distract me right because I'm not one of those guys - we're all here I got to find I got to be in training camp right now and if I don't have a fight I'm just doing it fuck the father want your own I freakin practice every day I'm gonna practice I like my life right now does you know I don't know what to do if I don't practice right so so why are you recovering from the surgery yeah I'm gonna try some different names does it feel good though to just like just just slow down a little bit smell the roses not really because this whole week I couldn't freaking train I wanted to go to the gym and at least yeah hit the back excuse me hit the bag of something or just you know cuz I think I'm an addict of that burn of course that that that burn of Ana workout it's lifting or push-ups or doing some pushing yourself yeah I'm an addict of that and so when I don't have that is kind what doing is you you and that's what made you the champion I mean that that engines inside you is what made you the champion it only makes sense yeah well if you if you really could just relax and kick back I'd be nervous yeah oh using this person now you know you don't get Hollywood on us you don't I fucking hate when people say that yeah it's a gross thing people say people just love to come up with some excuses yeah for why they don't do as well as you why oh why I was gonna bring up two is I I saw you do because when I started research and you and watching your stuff I saw the podcast you did with freaking Jamie Foxx years ago she's amazing fucking I I I mean I was such a huge I'm a huge Jamie Foxx Oh like fucking Talent me talking to it with Triple Threat he could do any how many people can do he does stand-up comedy mic shakes are in trouble sings incredible yeah you can make you laugh he can say her name she with his voice yeah and he can freaking impact and I gotta do the Lucky's not gay amazing man he's he's such a genuine guy - yeah like his is I've known him for a long time but he's a fucking Academy award-winning actor when he comes in and hangs out with you you would never imagine it that's that's what I grab the energies like that is what I he's so normal it's like it's like we shot Evans yeah God is the same way yeah and those energies I got really gravitate toward yes and I love there are people who don't take themselves seriously yeah but they do they do worse like they do but they don't pretend they're better than you or anything like I ran into Jamie at a fucking gas station like six six seven months ago what time was this normal time like he's actually with his daughter she was coming from a martial arts class and I'm getting gas and this guy pulls up in this crazy fucking car like I never saw one of these things before I forget what it's called some weird SUV that looks like it's from the future like oh the Lamborghini yes you know no it's not a Lamborghini is some crazy he knows the guy who makes some crazy I mean I don't even know what the fuck it is I never saw one before much what is this thing and I'm looking at this thing and then the dude rolls down the window goes what's up Joe oh what's up Jamie is this man yeah so normally he jumps out of the car starts talking people just start coming up to him and he's like hey what's up how you doing it just totally normal you know what I can't I feel a little bit of that yeah because it's taya cuz I still do the same shit like I'm still still go to the same little nutrition shop that I go to get a protein shake here and there and I still go to this and like I took my daughter to the movies before I left yeah so go to I pick and I just roll in it's just me I mean her perfect you know we're just freakin wrong as long as you can hand people or I and people ask for pictures and and I think one guy one time tonight bro I can fuck I can't believe you here bro I broke you serious bro like this is one cause I bro you you here bro like whose mom bro can I get it bro can I get a picture with you bro like he almost like crying I was like oh yeah bro of course you can get it yeah you want me take it which angle you let me take a couple of in the picture and I'm kidding but they just couldn't believe the fact that I'm normal yeah you know that your people are just normal people are just normal people are just people there's just well you in you know I think one of the great things about someone who accomplishes something is pretty spectacular is that you didn't just do that and win the World title but you set a lot of people in motion you know many people watch that it must been pumped up and excited about it and then started doing things it's probably a lot of people who decide to start fighting because watch I mean millions of people watch that fight so stop and think about how many different people must have been inspired by that how many different people saw the highlights on Instagram and on Twitter and on YouTube and how many people got fired up because of that and that's what I'm thankful for Joe I'm thankful for the opportunity shout out to the UFC for creating such a business and a market now in two words you can touch so many people all across the world because yeah that's and fighting is one thing that's a universal language it doesn't matter if you fucking speak Russian you speak English you speak you know II Bowl or euro by doesn't matter yeah you know fighting right this this right this you don't lose everybody it's not like cricket yeah it's universal so it's one of those things that that's a sport that's connect gonna grouse only gonna get bigger and bigger man shoutout to the USC Dana you know 100 all these guys Lorenzo Fertitta all these guys that created this and packaged it to the way it is now because it's given us platforms to be able to touch people and yeah and that III totally AMA I'm aware of what that could have done for certain people certain people yeah might have not thought of individual person but someone you know I might have inspired so I'm gonna start fighting that come from where I come from or somewhere in China Indonesia anywhere any world yeah yes I'm thankful I'm very thankful for that yeah I mean that is a big part of what a champion is I mean we were talking earlier about Marvin Hagler or different fighters that I watched when I was a kid coming up those people give you energy you know this is something about watching someone do something spectacular they give you energy and when you hear a story like yours you know a kid who immigrated to the United States at eight years old and goes through all the shit that you went through and becomes a world champion people hear that man it makes it gets them off the fucking couch man it gets them to do things it does and I'm a thing about during that fight is there was two other guys two special guests that I had come to the fight and they were both Nigerian nightmares you know in their respectful right is sports and right Christian Okoye yet you know Kansas City Chiefs running back was called a Nigerian nightmare because he was a fucking terror you know Christian you can the whole Christian Okoye I don't know anything about football yourself babies laughing man yeah he was a fuckin monster man he was like uh I think he was 200 like 260 pound running back like I'm talking Mack truck running through boom boom boom and you know and he had speed and power so he was considered Nigerian at me so he was one of those first guys that people really resignate us a 99 man in American sports and I never watched him play live of course not but these are the guys that they create such a legacy didn't wear when you're growing up somehow you hear about that legacy and that inspired me to want to be great bearing that nickname and also Samuel Peters aren't a few no sure piece and your people have WBC heavyweight champion the war was at the fight oh no shit and man these guys are man nothing I never saw him fight live but he created such a legacy to where I heard about him yeah I had to research them and these guys inspired me to we're now having that nickname you gotta you know I have to hold it to the highest regards I haven't you do the best that I can to be able to inspire many many kids that are gonna come you know in the future so man I'm thankful for the opportunity and just grateful I'm I'm a humble little kid from Palestine Nigeria you know I just walk around barefoot step on nails glasses you know things like that and now look where we are now we rock eschewed is that is baby welterweight champion the world undisputed yeah man it's prettier edible yeah does it feel real no I mean I still feel normal I don't feel anything but you know you're the champ yeah I mean but I think part of why it feels the way it does it because I've known for a long time like I've felt like it for a long time I've I've know nothing's gonna change the way I want to train for these fights nothing's gonna train change in the my mentality how I'm gonna approach these fights all the same still as FISA fight it's not oh I'm trying to defend this or I'm trying to hold on to this I don't give a shit I'm still going in there to dominate you from start to finish to break you mentally so you never want to frickin fight me again that's my approach to every fight so nothing changes I don't feel different everyone the only thing now is that's cool it'd be everyone's I treat me a little different people kind of you know people hold doors for me now and shit like that hopefully you're making a shitload more money well yeah hopefully uh hopefully that but um that's the only difference like I don't feel different I don't act little any different no when we were talking earlier about guys who like to trash talk and what trash talking is kind of doing for the sport whether it's good or bad you know what some guys are really funny with it like Connors fucking hilarious with it me something about that that is like when Jeremy Stephen said something funny it's like who the fuck is that guy in shorts yeah I mean it's I mean man I mean how many times that been repeated shout out the Jeremy Stephens yeah like larger and I was like Jeremy scrap always yeah but I think that that's not the only way a guy can sell a lot of pay-per-views a guy can also sell a lot of paper views by being exceptional and that was the case with George st. Pierre like Georgie beer was never a trash talker and still sold a shitload of paper views yeah I think I think we're as human and human beings humans can kind of tell the energy yeah it's a fake energy yeah see people can tell people put off by it well people who are also enamored of people that are exceptional yes if you just accept you can just be exceptional you don't have to just be talking shit all the time and stop pushing each other at press conferences it's not the only way now but then you get those you know you get the majority of the the the shitty fans who who likes that stuff nice to see you too yeah yeah there's a few too who even though they know it's fake they just still like that they just really want to see it you know so they put that pressure on people like you know you got do this you have to do that because those are the guys that are gonna tweet you don't you know they give you advice on how to talk no no no yeah I mean Dana's never once said you gotta talk you got it do this you got right no they don't do that do you feel though that sometimes they show you that by favoring guys who do do that and like like when Colby got a shot at the interim title before you yeah because it this is the thing is when someone starts doing that and they're starting to trend a lot more of course the company gets behind them because the company's about money it's about grain like they gotta make money right I know that's one thing that I understand more than anything right now they about green like people say oh Danny hates me cuz this at Natalie they don't erase Danny cares about is green like if you don't make money Dana cares right and so nothing that once that someone starts doing that and they're starting to create a little they sort of have a little buzz of course Dana's gonna push because that guy's might bring in money making more money so I understand that aspect of it but it's not I don't think it's Dana necessarily saying oh man you gotta act like this you got to do this because this is what sells no Connor did it and if Connor Connor became who he became so yeah Connor is gonna be favored because Connor brings in millions and millions of dollars Habib did it his way and now Habib rings him when he you know he's favored so he's gonna bring in money and things like that but Dana's not going around saying you know you got to be like this guy you got to be like that guy you know bitch being did it his way right you know I'm pissed being brought in money George did it his way it's just as long as you want to be real what you choose to do you're gonna be real with yourself because at the end of the day you have to look at yourself in the mirror yes if you can do what you want to do and then at the end of the day look in the mirror when everyone's gone it's just you you take a piss in the morning and you wake up let yourself in your man you're like I'm alright then that's fine do they do you beautiful beautifully put you're a bad motherfucker tomorrow my man thanks for doing this man thank you it's a pleasure thanks for telling people your story and inspiring people and I wish you nothing but the best thank you thank you very shaded tomorrow who smile ladies and gentlemen the champ [Music] [Applause] [Music]
