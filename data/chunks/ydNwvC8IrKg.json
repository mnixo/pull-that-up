[Music] so how long can use my ice personally now like to go a week without water from my cuts in 1:55 so I know I could do a week yeah and that'd be after that I'm online I'm on my death yeah dude let's talk about that let's do that more don't I know you keep talking about like fighting Eddie Alvarez cuz you already beat him and now he's the champ but goddamn you're looking good at 170 yeah you say I didn't look good at 55 sensational 55 947 world beater man it's not just that you look good it's just the way you look it's like you you you hit a whole new level and I always wonder like is it because obviously you keep training obviously you keep getting better obviously you work hard all those things learning from experience all those things are a factor but on top of that there's also the factor of you not having to cut that fucking weight man so this last fight against Rick story against Rick story we looked like you in the fucking matrix that was some Anderson Silva shit I ate five guys three nights we were in Vegas Five Guys Burgers hamburger double doubles I'm a bacon out of those do you know you're helping your son of course yeah you get to help in yo get the season of the season fries of course yeah my trainers are happier yeah I mean I think I had six pounds to cut it wasn't easy yeah no brainer yeah but when I saw you before the fight before that you were a 176 when you're at the Comedy Store yeah that's nothing nothing yeah look how good you look at this way I feel good for damn sure but it's not a factor I mean look at fast you are like the coat a fight dude you were on fire you're on fire at that weight yeah I don't know what's the thought process I don't have one do 155 right you can do it you have like 60 or 565 word class that be cowboy class but it's just that last five pounds is death for me looking brutal you know from 6255 I just feel like I got nothing left man I don't know if that carries over like like I want to ask you see Pettis looked a little tired Danny in his last fight I don't know if the 45 cut if it has something to do for sure if it tastes the real art of your gas tank a little higher percent However said it has to it has to mean I feel great out there that's what I'm saying love fighting this is my favorite thing in the whole world to do like a in the whole world like I wish a motherfucker when I leave here pulls up in the parking lot shit you know me people tell me like I posted me flipping people off right so they're like cowboy you're a fucking role model how dare you like no I'm not I'm a I'm a bar junkie that fights all the time and you guys now on TV and you anything is cool see I'm your favorite fire you know but how do you not be in the UC I'd be the asshole trying to take your girlfriend if I'd you at the bar just so you know you know you know how many people sent me and the animated gif of that final combination you landed on Rick stories talk about that up on the screen well let's talk so everyone says how great these calm boys oh it's beautiful okay here it is Oh frak that's the end of it let's watch it from the beginning well you know what I'd love about it man what I love technique look at this this is what I love pop to the body to the head boom you know what I love about it not a single one of those techniques is wound up not a single one of those techniques is full power look how you doing this pop bank crack so everyone is listening all that is the jab cross hook kick yeah but it's not because here's the thing about it the way you're throwing all these things is the way everybody should throw every punch you're there's no wind up everything is perfect technique the execution the timing the the accuracy look how beautiful this is man see this is use I bet it's hard for you to appreciate but for me as a person who calls MMA as a person who watches fights do when I was calling that fight I was like this I was like oh look at this oh this is perfect Gina yet I missed the triangle I am with myself tough guys good submission defense so last time we talked we talked about cowboy watching himself I can playing a video game I was in the mode yeah for sure that in that's a matrix shit I mean this to me is more impressive than when Anderson Silva knocked out Forrest Griffin because when Anderson Silva knocked out Forrest Griffin what I know about Forrest was that Forrest was compromised going into that fight he'd been knocked out twice in training camp he had a real hard time taking shots I probably shouldn't have been in there in the first place and so he had a lot of doubts and he was having a real hard time this is a big powerful Rick story who's a nasty motherfucker he throws vicious body shots he's a hard wrestler he's a guy it was the first loss that Johnny Hendrix got people don't know Rick's story Rick story's a tough dude and for you to tee off on him like this in this perfect way not with big wound up fucking heavy shots like he throws when Rick story likes to do is he pressures guys and he fucking digs in room to the body takes you down beats you up he's a tough tough dude and what you did is you just use perfect technique that angle when you throw that left you throw the loo you throw the left the jab you throw the right hand to the body and then you take that watch this jab you adjusted you adjusted perfectly what that left me try to be nice okay trying to be nice about yourself look at that's a beautiful combination thank you have reach that's a matrix shit and I feel like a big part of that is you not depleting your body absolutely another big part of it 170 pounder don't think you can just come take my body shots anymore because I don't got a little more biscuit now Yeah right you don't know if their body jeez what did you body feel like when you fought 155 like when you compare yourself to a normal a training session like say you're several months in between I walk around once I used to walk around them about 174 right that was like my deep training camp and I noticed when I started to cut I'd get down to you know 168 170 but I had nothing in the gas tank man I would always be like it would all mental at that point you know and I didn't have like my body felt real thin and brittle and 170 I feel good I don't feel the I got the I got the extra tank you know yeah I don't feel like a big part of it oh my god it's a big part of it man [Music]
