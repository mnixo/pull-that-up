ha ha ha hello freak bitches so before they started modifying genes how did they select like say how do they because before any genetic modifications were done in laboratories they had turned this geo sitting what I say a toc toc a or maize as we used to call it right that was the indian word for even know you had Carter that commercial yeah that's me yes yeah well they mazes kind of a general term for everything from field corn which is what we think about which is fed to animals right eighty percent of GM crops go to animal feed right and we differentiate that versus what is typically eaten by humans which is usually sweet corn varieties so how did they turn it before there was any genetic modifications done in laboratories how did they turn that corn into what we now which is delicious and sweet and you put butter on it it's fantastic oh sure how do they do that yeah actually but it was all just random mutations DNA random yeah DNA replication is a sloppy process and funny things happen when you from environment so in the process of replication of DNA itself you can make errors cosmic radiation just chemicals in our environment natural chemicals that are out there can induce changes in DNA and these kind of mutations sometimes very rarely result in a change in the plant that's beneficial and at least or at least from a human perspective so in all the plants that we've had all the plants that we have the significant amount of change has come from random mutations that change genes in ways we don't understand pieces of DNA that get up out of the genome and sit down somewhere else randomly they do this all the time viruses and the plants that get into the genome and sit down in places that we have no idea where so genetic modification is something that's ongoing in constant and a factor in every genome including our own and so what we're seeing today is just the the long term effect that of humans who've been able to put all the good traits in one place so when you see those tomatoes that are in the supermarket that are pale and you could play basketball with them those hard tomatoes and then you compare them to like heirloom tomatoes the only difference between those two is that someone had found some tomatoes that had grown extra firm and selected those and use the seeds from those to create more similar tomatoes and only selected those right so you at you frame to cool things here so heirloom what is an heirloom in an heirloom is a tomato with outstanding eating qualities that can't work in production commercially because it's too mushy it's too mushy they don't last long and it break down but on the other hand so this is what the problem is with our food when you talk about tomatoes strawberries blueberries things that these are non-gmo by the way there's no GMO tomatoes or strawberries not at all people would say there are the problem is is that plant breeding over the last 50 years or say over the last 100 years the objectives of the breeders has been bigger fruit uniformity big yield disease resistance nothing about flavor and aroma so to meet production characteristics which is what we've been selecting for breeders have been looking for these kind of characteristics that don't involve the consumer and so our decline in the flavors and the quality of fruits and vegetables is directly related to the mass breeding not anything to do with GMO so when you say genetic modified in that in those terms they are kind of genetically modified but they're not modified in terms of being in the laboratory and human beings doing some funky stuff with jeans they're sort of modified almost naturally and just selected for those modifications exactly and some of the things that we've selected for have been the ones that didn't kill us when we ate them or the things that didn't make a poison that or something that tasted horrible plants make lots of funky compounds and so this was an opportunity for so what we've seen in our stores right now is the residue of thousands of years of human selection and we can call it genetic modification if we want to but we can differentiate it from what we do in the laboratory which is now we can call adding a transgene where a transgenesis moving a gene from one background of genetics to another via laboratory and these selections that people have moaned about and I have as well it's horrible when you get a sandwich and has a pale tomato on it because they just taste awful this so there's there's no science involved in me of that other than selection there's no there's no there's no like injection of some alien sort of genetics into those things alien to the plant no there's no there's no syringes nothing like that and actually you know it is more an art than a science being a plant breeder is the most kick-ass career these days and has been for a long time plant breeding is essentially inventing the next generation of food and all we're talking about is mixing pollen from things that maybe normally wouldn't cross together like something that nature would never cross but you got this cool tomato from Europe that has great qualities and we can mix it with this great production quality tomato from that grows in Florida where nothing else can grow and now you mix these two together and you get this beautiful tomato that works well in everybody's garden that's where we're going now but that's not GMO that's just using other types of technology to facilitate this net dis breeding process that breeders do but I think masculine aggression has also given us so many of the goodies you want to go through the list of heaps of fresh vegetables in the middle of the winter time all the inventions that push us beyond our biology it takes it requires a little aggression I think sometimes and even god forbid I say it competition ruthless competition that's things progressed right with that is that people are going to lose and people don't like losing because they think losing is a bad feeling so they think of competition and competitive people as being negative okay so that's what that's my worry about the feminization quote-unquote of our society I think that we have to be very careful that we we don't forget the positive aspects of what you'd call unoriginal macho energy I think the problem is that it's not masculine energy that's a problem that people are upset about I think it gets misconstrued I think the problem that we all have is with assholes yeah that is the problem across the board whether it's women or its men when you see like these crazy radical feminists who attack speakers because they you know want to support men's rights in divorce court and whatever the fucking reason is that the really aggressive like this is archetypal video of this super aggressive feminist outside of this thing in Toronto and she's got red hair and she's screaming at people like what she wants and what she doesn't want for men when they can shut the fuck up and you know and and she's telling people in the honest shut the fuck up look the people that that exist like that then they become the problem the problem is not like the idea that women deserve everything that men deserve and that we should have equal treatment by law the problem is assholes yeah his assholes representing a point of view that I probably don't disagree with yeah but I disagree with her right I disagree with someone who is generalizing about an entire gender because that's ridiculous course of it or generalizing about a type of person that is in that gender like you can't if everybody is entitled to start from zero and as soon as you're prejudiced whether you're prejudiced against white people or whether you're prejudiced against men or whether you're prejudiced against gays or transgenders or whatever the fucking is as soon as you stop treating that person as like an come at them from a totally even spot then you're the asshole right and I would suggest that you know we benefit also and enjoy a lot about life based on people who created things whose motives their motives may have been less than stellar sure a lot of people are driven by just pure ego domination greed and those things are not those things do not always create bad things in fact a lot of times they create incredible innovations better ways to do things you know so much what is what's another word for innovation another word for innovation is destruction you're destroying how people used to do it when we came up with the combustion internal combustion engine and put it in a vehicle and turn it into a car people that made a lot of money making buggy whips went out of fucking business as I need your fucking buggy whip because my car doesn't respond to buggy whips in response to what i call rock oil which turned out to be oil so you know that's the other thing to keep in mind innovation is it is an aggressive it's competition thing it's competition its destruction you
