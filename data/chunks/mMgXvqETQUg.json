the gyro can experience I I decided you know I try to work on this calmness and all that and for me driving in road rage was the worst they'd have the worst road rage ever really I was terrible man you would not I'm so calm you not recognized me I once got taken to the police station because someone someone who accused me is this is a while back but they accuse me of exposing myself while driving and what the truth of matter is that someone cut me off and I got pissed off and I said you wanted to you know Hong Kong Bobo here and so on Bobo here like you made a you made a like a blowjob he said to people while they were driving no I mean I made that I made the the graphical motion to have them blow you exactly yeah like basically you know blow me a few and what did the same exactly anyway I was kind of like I'd forgot about it in this police officer leaves her business card on my front porch and apparently whoever cut me off was just a complete idiot of a driver and like really apparently thought I did this so this this little police officer woman is like hey I know you at the beginning of a porno no I swear to God look in the police station she's like I know I know you did it and and I started laughing I looked for cameras I thought it was a joke like I thought some friends wanted really seriously hook me up on this cuz there's no way it was so far from my reality she goes no I know you did I have witnesses and I'm like you can't have what assistants didn't happen like you're lying and we went back and forth for two hours about this this is how bad my road rage was two hours you choose full-on I'm gonna go to the DA I'm like you can't go to the a there is no evidence and furthermore anatomically okay this is my lap this is the side of the the car and this is where the steering wheel is so unless I'm like hung like a horse it is not possible to drive and expose yourself at the same time just a car next to you it's not I'm like you can't do that so finally I did this lie-detector test and I passed out I do a lie detector volunteer - I'm like I got there's nothing going on here it was so good stop oh I can't even tell you but that's how bad my road rage was like now wait you had to go to the station to get it right or did they have a lie detector test in the car James got one Oh No this is a month after it happened like it was scary actually I was I realized I was absolutely guilty and there's so many girls that I've turned down the $25,000 offer from Sun King that just like just goes hits all the ladies like 25,000 weak you know in there but I know so many people that have turned it down but I also know a couple girls that have done it and that's just fucking crazy I think there's quite a few of those guys out there well I've been to Dubai a number of times and there's 50 dollar ones there fifty dollars for a prostitute yeah but what I'm saying is that these guys that get girls from America and have them shipped oh oh yeah that's me that's crazy shit that kind of money is that's a whiff there's a weird reality you know when you have like trillions of dollars like there's people who are like I think as far as private wealth is concerned like what we know and you see like the richest man in the world yeah not really okay because what you're getting is the richest man in the world who has assets that are measurable like in the stock market yeah when you're dealing with kings you don't have any fucking idea how much those guys have you don't know why should you know I got a buddy who they have a bank I got a buddy who's a billionaire real live billionaire and never knew he had money for years he was just uh my friend's friend and never knew we hung out in New York and everything and then one day I was reading about his family in the newspaper and I went holy fuck and I called him on the phone like you of money and he's like yeah I'm like no no no you have like fucking money his family does yeah and I said this is bullshit we have never gotten to take advantage of this I said you have like crazy fuck you money so years later he came into the money like where it was his oh that's so creepy just sitting around lazy waiting for it to happen waiting for some well no he worked hard but but someone did I don't wanna give away who he possibly is but okay but in one year he went from fucking zenith the nadir like he he straight to rehab like in a year in a year from when he like took over the money -
