five four three two yeehaw bill burr and alive you looking very slick you look like a professional man oh I was doing television this morning as I mentioned to you I just did Colin Cowherd show and I run out of button-down shirts that I could wear on TV because I was go button-down jeans and whatever nice pair of shoes I'm not a sport coat guy but I was just like I had to like go back and google image myself on the show going what did I wear last time I couldn't tell what black shirt I had on it's like oh god I gotta throw a sport coat on so I'm sure I get trashed for that like what do you all Hollywood now man trying to look good so yeah that's why I'm dressed up here I'm the best-dressed man in podcasting today you are right now for sure at this moment I'm amazing you actually looked to check to see if you were wearing the same shirt yeah non-stop shit it's like why help them out I'm it's like if you're gonna trash me at second I'm gonna make you work for it I'm not gonna give you the layup it's such a mild trashing I mean it's coming from me I dress like a fucking idiot now I mean it just you know it just it's just is what it is it's just like for whatever reason I mean I I don't know I get a kick out of doing stuff like that like which way they're gonna come at me today just make them let make some better at it oh I said I don't want to do the your bald-headed blah blah but it's like I every fucking day it gets it's that's but just get somebody to come at your inner you thank you to get you in a unique way if they get me in a unique way it actually makes me laugh and then there's entertainment for me but if it's the same old tired shit I don't know they get me lately for my socks I didn't know that you're not supposed to have socks that kind of cover your ankles like these are acceptable these socks are acceptable socks see that because it kind of those women's socks when we were kids and they had a little ball on the bunny rabbit tail on the end it was they were the Chris Everts what happened remember you should have calf high socks those shit can't hide socks and your shorts barely covers your junk exactly now everybody shorts go down there their socks are non-existent yeah but the shorts are coming back up and I don't like that you know like it no there's there's I've there's been a lot of that and then that's that that's the ante man man who's so comfortable with his masculinity no those hipster douche bags so they're like literally wearing like the old running shorts with the slit going up the side like macho camacho really oh yeah who the fuck's wearing those hey a bunch at but I've just seen enough and you just look at the whole thing it's like they literally look like they're gonna go do some Ron Burgundy sketch or something but it's how they walk around then they act like oh no just I like these shorts I put a picture of my sneakers and my socks on Instagram the other day which is not a smart move anyway like why did I even do that I just went running for three miles and my sneakers and socks were covered with dirt but the amount of people to just shit on my socks it's like what's wrong what's wrong with if they cover your ankles that's it what's wrong with those socks I don't know but I don't know but there is something wrong with them yeah ribbed for her pleasure at the top and then like your sneakers too that you know if you're gonna go run in dirt like those are the ones that do it they look very like artsy though that looks like some shit my wife would appreciate if it was on a canvas you know the socks know the design on your you know that Modern Art thing yeah the lights go this way and then they go that way much like life and then they intersect you know that type of shit and it's just like why don't you just draw a house do you ever go to LACMA the LA County Museum don't go you'll go crazy now I I I don't I I you know I think the most important I would enjoy the tram ride up this is fun this is cool yeah there's a lot of like chic we dress older women with like ridiculously weird glasses like the cut the color the frames is always some you know some statement you don't I mean some splash of color to let you know that they have a personality yeah I'm probably just intimidated no you're not intimidated it's nonsense I went there and there I mean we've talked about this before but there's there was a box like a plexiglass box on the ground that's it an amber plexiglass box and I thought it was like some sort of a like maybe a stand then like the exhibits going in on no no no the box was the art that's it right nothing in it every art form has that every art form has their plastic box like no this is standup there it is right this is a stand-up comedy special oh gee well it's kind of amber look like uh I mean I get this delight I guess but it's just a fucking box I mean looks like something you would go get at a Crate and Barrel I could build that you easily could you give me some glue and you give me the pieces then well it's probably worth 30 grand I know and it's just like I would literally put my feet on that in a second you should do you know you got this book in for me here dear reader Kim jong-il he looks like the kind of person you'd run into in a museum if he had like sexier glasses that lunatic will probably somehow hear this and actually go out and get some you know that he's skinned I got the dog he's dead that's not his son no that's the dad what's his son's name Kim jong-un oh well it's definitely his kid they look just alike did you see that Chou and how many dumplings do they have a fucking day everybody else in their countries fucking emaciated look like they just finished the Tour de France these guys are walking around plump yeah like they are on the sixth kid yeah dad bought this so smooth and hairless - that just fucking creepy I love them did you see that what's that guy's name baski eight how do you say that guy's name Basquiat that Basquiat painting that went for a hundred and ten million dollars no let's see what yes it did you want to see one hundred ten million buys you when I get grossed out this Japanese gentleman who bought is some super billionaire character who apparently has another one that he spent fifty something billion or million on honey yeah that guy yeah that's when you're like eating endangered species that looks like some shit I drew when I was a kid and my parents put it on the refrigerator like yeah yeah it's great there should be like notebook like they know that that confetti that hangs off the side yeah what's with the tic-tac-toe on his head - what's that about tic-tac-toe Hey Joe it's whatever you want it to me man it's art it's up to your own interpretation I like the blue I always find blue to be soothing the guy looks a little disturbed look was that him to find his place within the blue skies of white America it's like the left one he was a little kid and he fucked up and he just scratched over it like the a and the B but he made the B backwards and went shit and so he just scratched over it they just left it there like look at that what is that it's whatever you want it to be 110 million dollars that's what it is and there you go that's Lac my right there they would kill to have that piece hanging you know and there will be all kinds of women with weird glasses riding that tram up there to go look at it rub the chins with their gay friends look at him leave that guy lost bastard now he's killing it dude you think so yeah look at him he's in great shape with that haircut no definitely no conditioner huh I can't off his hair's just starting to go gray like a billionaire genius like you're such Q so good at business that you forget to put conditioner in your hair yeah and you get like sleep coming out of your eye and some hot hottie just like fucking hoses you off in the morning just wear this I can't I just keep thinking there was a video that I watched the other day of Elon Musk from 1998 when he was first becoming a billionaire and he bought a million-dollar car and he had his million-dollar car delivered with his girlfriend at the time we got rid of let's say at the same time and you all my girlfriend put her in the trunk but it's it's so funny to see him as this young dork who's you know just making shit tons of money and his hairs all goofy and he has this million dollar car delivered who's this Elon Musk a guy owns Tesla saw Tesla okay did you see what you see what he's doing now but the videos hilarious have you seen what he's doing now the boring company didn't know what that is well they make like electric jets or something no they're boring holes underneath Los Angeles he's gonna bore these earthquake proof tunnels and they're gonna put sleds on these tunnels that go 125 miles an hour so you drive onto the sled it locks you in and it shoots you from like downtown LA to wherever the fuck you're going and you know is this it Jamie so this is how it works you drive on to this sled and it drops you dig this guy just gets it leave this it drop drops you down below the surface of the earth now one of these others others these aren't sleds so your cars is fucking amazing I want that to happen it's gonna happen this crazy fucker he's gonna make it and these sleds I mean you can't crash into anybody so they can go stupid fast so they're going 125 miles an hour now now now they're created by men so at some point somebody's going to not tighten something down well those Tesla's don't have the best service like record as far as or reliability record Sam Harris is broke down twice already and I know other another guy who got one and the handle stopped coming out like you know you go near it and handle comes out you gotta break into your own electric car but look at this another guy gets to get in there there's gonna be a line traffic jam to get onto these fucking things but look at this passageway system that he's devising this is gonna be crazy there's gonna be these passageways all throughout the bottom of the earth so underneath the surface of the of Los Angeles will be all the streets but of course it's gonna cave in right it's gonna it's got it and somehow compromised the structure of the city right bubbles building sitting on top of it I don't know if anybody can figure it out I think that's beyond my background I will you know it's most more even more amazing than that is that japanese-built billionaire looked like the Japanese Charles Bronson if you go back I love Charles Bronson he does a little bit yeah he looks tough like Charles Bronson in the mechanic like that one I've seen always fucking movie I love all that he I've even watched his cologne ad that he did over there oh yeah he saw he saw the you saw the softer side of money he's like taking his shirt off he's spinning around this realignment yeah it was very not Charles Bronson that's back when stars would do for some reason only in this country it was it hurt your career if you did a commercial but you could always overseas you know do something like that you could just it used to hurt their career but it doesn't seem to anymore I know not only does it not now it's like a move now it's like why aren't you just going up vacuum vacuuming up this cash yeah like now Matthew McConaughey look at him look at that I'm telling you I nailed it he's got a Charles Bronson he's got to work on the hair though he's got the fucking mustache he's a little too humble with his smile needs to be a little more solemn just just accept the fact you're a baller billionaire pays $110 for a stupid painting he doesn't you know what going back to what he does look a little lost or maybe he just doesn't like his picture taken I'm always looking to give somebody the benefit of the fucking doubt here oh maybe he's realizing they just spent a hundred and ten million dollars on a stupid fucking painting he's like what what did it sell for the last time I don't know that's interesting it's a good question I wonder what he's watching see if you can find that commercial the Charles Bronson cologne commercial I want to say that it's gotta be online well how would you tell people that you bought that and then that's in your house like right didn't nobody learn anything from both the fucking Kardashians jewelry I got next thing you know you're facedown with a fucking gun to the back of your head you got to watch out with that this guy's fuckin he's got 110 it was like a million dollar ring he's got like a hundred ten million dollar piece of art well the crazy thing about the Kardashian thing was that it was in Paris and she brought security with her she had security with her and they figured out how to get past security yeah but everything's better in Europe isn't what everybody says the criminals are better than our security and so there's Charles Bronson oh this is Charles Bronson laid in his life too this is like death wish Charles Bronson yeah Paul Kersey [Music] yeah [Music] it's like a mini movie yes what was this for what what a country somewhere like in Japan really yeah he definitely didn't do it here what a weird drive the guy that Kate good night mr. bronsen sleep tight now he's driving off drives like a man now all of a sudden it gets here we go wow it's true a witch gets that hypo [Music] what in the fuck is this this is a man getting paid he's got his pipe on at his shirt off he's by himself yeah I realize how Jack this guy was oh yeah but back then not only then he was probably like 60 at the time like Charles Bronson I believe when you watching him too Tarantino shit here with his shoes and guns and stuff this is late in his career too I'm telling you he might have been 60 here because when he was in hard times he was 50 bandim man it's beyond that's the kingdom of a man what you putting on him there mandible 1976 it says find out when hard times was Oh Japanese hey man dumb and him and that works over the hard times was what 75 so he was 51 and when he did that watch act and the range yeah well get him in hard times he was I've been rip I bet they sold a ton of that look at that that's a 50 year old man no HGH no testosterone just fucking push-ups sit-ups and drinking milk he grew up in him then he liked working mines and stuff don't Poland or something yeah those guy all those guys back then you know what I like about those old movies so many of them is when you watch an army movie from back then you're watching someone who was in the army and shot at people so it's like they actually came you know Lee Marvin like he was like one of two people to survive in his platoon yeah yeah I got shot and stuff yes I think this is a psionic nerve issue was something from where he got shot or something like this guy like like actors weren't you know what they are now where it was a lot of pretend I mean Jesus we've been over in Iraq for 15 years I'm sure you could you think there's gonna be the next Lee Marvin's are gonna come out of that maybe maybe I don't know do you remember what I just say thanks Joe I do too who is that one guy that was like one of the first original movie stars and he was a World War two veteran Audie Murphy is it was that his name there was a guy who I mean most most of them a famous war hero yeah most veterans because of the level of the draft but then it becomes what did you do when you were there where I was like ah some of the some of them you know they they were in like you know infrastructure or whatever and then there's other people that were actually like up front yeah this is a guy he was he became a movie star well look at all this stuff on his coat he must have something over that he was a who was a decorated okay this is one of the most decorated American combat soldiers in World War two and then single-handedly held off an entire German that's a guy ran up with three soldiers for an hour yeah Wow so then he came back and became a movie star and like people knew that he enjoyed a 21-year acting career and then it just stopped well he wanted anyone like the Congressional Medal of Honor as they like yes people don't win that and they're still alive right so back then like that was like a celebrity yeah like you you had to hold off an entire platoon for a German platoon to makes Porsches and and in Mercedes like they let you know their level of guns that they had over there like our machine guns overheated and theirs didn't so if you killed a German guy you threw you threw away the Americans shit and picked up their stuff isn't that crazy yeah one of my favorite quotes ever one of the German tank commanders was saying every one of their whether they had Panzers is that what this was called and I was with the Sherman tanks a German tiger a tiger was worth like four American tanks but the Americans always had five we just totally McDonald's dumped Lincoln billions and billions sir we just kept cranking it out it was like we got it right then it always be that last one coming over the hill well they had some massive cannon in World War one that apparently you it took like a hundred men to move this enormous fucking and Dan Carlin was talking little art man hardcore history what's a hundred blue-eyed men to move it they would let anybody without blue eyes move to think weird he was a dark-haired guy no he did he looks like a cab driver in Germany he was everything he hated that was the funny thing about him was not a good dancer if you ever saw him do his victory jigs that he was afraid of dogs really I'm just repeating shit the shepherds it is amazing the kind of engineering that German people have come up with I mean you think about Mercedes Porsche Audi BMW woven out of this one part of the world no and they evidently a lot of the leaders felt oh my God look at that fucking cannon what is that thing called most powerful gun ever built heavy Gustov railway gun so they put this thing on it looks like it's on tractor tires like it looks like a tractor right and then I guess they drove this thing up but uh it just had just this the way Dan Carlin describes it as incredible like this unbelievable shockwave everybody you have to run a mile away when the thing was going off and plug your ears up just cuz it'll blow your eardrums literally apart Jesus Christ yeah they show this thing going off what's wrong with people oh how is war still legal I just don't get how that's legal you know I mean like I can't walk into a bar you know and punch somebody in the face or if they punch me be like fucking go to jail but like this shit is like can't these leaders just kind of solve things amongst themselves no they can't carve it up a little just I listen you take the Philippines and you give us Guam for the like like yeah you know owners a football team isn't it amazing that I mean that we even have what's legal and what's not legal I mean what does that mean wrote it down on paper we all agreed I mean think about the shit that is and isn't legal and what the fact that wars on that list at all I like laws do you yeah like what ones you can't beat the shit out of me can't come into my house to take my stuff what am I gonna do what am I honestly gonna do about it I was thinking about that when I was watching the UFC this past weekend I was watching this frightful beating that Alexander Gustafson put on Glover Teixeira and it was just a ruthless knockout just fucking vicious beat down and then eventually stopped him and I was thinking it's kind of crazy that these guys agree to do this they agreed to do this everybody signs away and then you go do something that anywhere else in the world you would get lock day he arrested that happens in hockey every once in a while where somebody goes too far and then the government gets involved really yeah like what do they do if you hit somebody in the head with a stick that goes outside the boundaries of setting the tone that seems like a pussy move though hitting with a stick you're supposed to punch well it's so weird when you got this stick in your hand you know it's just the shit that you sometimes think of doing each other in the balls they fucking whack at the bet like there's no padding behind your legs and just man I just taking a wood stick it just with NHL level strength and just given someone a two-handed of the back leg they break people's finger Crosby almost took somebody's finger off this year if they get too far look if it gets really if they just open the rules up a little bit you know what's gonna happen they're gonna bring in figure skaters they're gonna teach them Taekwondo I'm gonna cut people's fucking heads off with the skates you ever learned how to skate you'd be fucking dangerous if you ever did that with skates on that would be it that's what I'm saying if you teach that to somebody teach that to somebody with skates I mean if you could hit someone with a hockey stick why can't you hit him with skate I mean we're working on the line you can't hit him with this like they do it somebody does it to you no no they slash and they do stuff like that you can't Club somebody over them in slashing so okay I'll just slash your leg out what would you rather have it would you rather take a get hit by a piece of wood and you know and have a bruise there or have somebody slash you with their skate I would absolutely rather get hit by the piece of wood but I shouldn't get hit by the piece of wood I don't I don't play hockey but if I did play hockey I'd be pretty pissed if somebody hit me with a stick I'd be like you fucking pussy and I'd want to hit it we'd be like the second coming of tide domi you're the sex build he's a fucking guy who somehow was like my height and was considered a heavyweight fighter and he's the guy according to him he came up with the grab him by right right underneath your collar and then turn all the way sideways because he didn't have the reach advantage and then he would he would wait for them to throw he duck under and then come over the top and dude I I met him one time great fucking guy and he's got these hands like your hands you know your hands you make like that it turns into a hammer it's the same thing he has like these inexplicable like bare fucking paws and I might be a little taller than him - and I remember when he tried to show me when he grabbed the front of my shirt to show me like I literally felt like an adrenaline like a flashback I hope this guy doesn't snap now he's one of the liked he's one of the toughest guys that ever ever played well you know when Rocky Marciano was a heavyweight champion he was only 185 pounds here's 185 pounds and who's 510 he was a heavyweight champ that's because it wasn't tim horton's on everybody every fucking corner they were feeding cows to other cows like I need it see what happens do you think kids hit puberty like eight now yeah nine you gotta like teach him how to shave I mean I don't know what is in hormones who knows what it is but it's not monsanto changed their their name you know me what do they know I don't know what shit that's that's the genius of it cuz then you don't know it the same way Halliburton changed the same way anymore Nissan Nissan changed from from Datsun oh that's right yeah that's right wonder why they did that Datsun do made some good cars no there they always go over the cliff Toyota did that too with Lexus right they got tonight we can fuckin sue Honda and Toyota in this country they both do the same thing they have this weird division where they they make a luxury brand for Americans you know they don't do like Acura and Honda they don't do that in Japan like if you buy an NSX in Japan which is the top-end car it's a Honda it's a Honda NSX okay but in America were like no you need something you need a better name no but we have the space are you saying that they can't get a luxury car over there no no they changed the name in America because we don't we don't want to buy Toyota we assume a Toyota is a cheap car so they go okay well we're gonna make a lift Rand of Toyota and call it a Lexus and everybody's like okay we're in as long as you change the name okay always looks literally gonna make up without any research that because they were on an island they don't have anywhere to drive so they don't they don't let him have fast cars even that guy with a hundred ten billion dollars to buy a picture it's got nowhere to go now he has like a civic he can't spend his money on cars so that's why it buys the art you're a car guy though you know they have pretty fast cars I mean they have ridiculously fast cars they have the GTR it's one of the fastest cars in the world I know but I've never been there so you can yeah I just was started to listen to what you were saying and then that whole theory developed in my head Japan is small but it's not that small no it isn't can I mention it was for family that it came out today that's why I'm here that's why I dragged you out of bed or whatever you were doing knows it do the special podcast here which I appreciate is season 2 season 2 of f is for family is available for to stream all of it it took us a year to make it and you can devour it in five hours Wow if you have food delivered and then you can ask me when season three coming up which is what I hope you asked me because that would mean that you enjoyed it I love this fucking show it's a hilarious show I'm looking forward to the season it's fun and I work with great people thank God because if I didn't the amount of work that it was it would actually be misery but it is it's a lot of work though how much work does it take you like it takes a year to make but how much does it take longs to take you well I mean the writers room is like a you know like a 10 week 11 week thing and then you're recording as you go and then you're looking at you know the first drawings of it where they sort of rough it out be like no no I have Frank standing over here and Sue's over here and it just kind of you just keep then you have rewrite and then you're watching stuff and it doesn't play and then you rewrite it and and it just yeah it takes a year dude it takes about ten months and then the last two months is just going okay deciding on strategies on how they're going to promote it which amazed me because I'm like well well fucking do what we always do but like this business just changes so rapidly that even how we promoted it when it first came out in December 2015 you know which was almost 2016 so now we're in 2017 like it's it the budget other stuff has changed since then so I don't know like what what's changed like when you man I fucking knew you were gonna ask me sorry I just let you go I can't what was it no more questions no they were just going like they brought they brought me in well maybe this is my stand-up special that's why they brought me in and they showed they basically showed me how everybody's Netflix screened is different like yours is different than your homepage is different because it's all they're just watching you watch TV right or they got this fucking thing that watches it so the only way our screen within our top whatever be the exact same as if we watch the exact same shit at the same time and maybe even the same age group I have no idea but I was blown away by that like I just thought like you know I would look and be oh man my specials on on the cover of Netflix it's like no it's on the cover of yours and whoever else is in that that vibe of like you're gonna like this I have three different profiles I have one profile and then I have one profile for each of my kids okay so I see different stuff so I see that so if I go to my kids homepage like if they want to watch a show that they watched and I go there I see just a bunch of little kids show I don't ever see when I watch I go to mine I see house of cards I see your special I see other people's specials so yeah that's what they do they're very smart with their algorithms but what I don't like is this fucking thumbs-up thumbs-down bullshit can't do that what's that I was joking about that on my podcast it's like Adolf Hitler thumbs down orange juice after brushing your teeth thumbs down it's ice cream thumbs up threesome with supermodel thumbs up yeah it's like what the fuck did they really do that because Amy Schumer that's the no no no that was that was that was already yeah that was a behemoth when you're that fucking big you can't make decisions that quickly but everybody wanted it to be like they did it for her big dinner for her well you know they gotta bring it back the star system is a perfect system everybody's used to it yes who's been using it forever it works yes but what does this start this estar somebody told me the star system only applies it's like geared towards what you would like I'm like how the fuck would they know that that doesn't make any sense and then I heard that that's not the case that it's basically just an average of all the people just like on Amazon go to Amazon and you look at something you see five stars and you see 175 reviews that's what it is right but somebody told me that wasn't the star system wasn't that see if you could find that out Jaime somebody said the star system was based on whether or not you would like it I'm like that seems ridiculous because I've never rated a fucking thing in my life on him on Netflix I don't get any of these places and I don't understand how any of them fucking work I just I go old school like I just tried it whatever I'm doing I try to make it as funnies I possibly can and try to work with the best people I possibly can and then just hope it sticks if it doesn't I can always just keep telling jokes other than that I I don't know what to tell you I I have no idea and I have I was fucked when I took that meeting with Netflix I wouldn't in there like this is a jerk-off meeting why did I Drive all the way over here to fucking have a meeting on how to promote this shit and when they sat down and they were done with the presentation I was like am I allowed to leave like you don't do the men and black thing to me before I walk out of here so I forget all that was fucking amazing it was fucking amazing like the level with which every goddamn like there's not one drop of water that rolls off the table they like they're they're catching at all I don't know how to like that uh you know I'm just not wired that way well that's probably good though there's only so much time in the day like just to think about being funny and just concentrating staying in your lane is probably the best option anyway yeah I I mean it's working for me yeah it's working for me and then there's also worried about algorithms Jeff and then there's also a certain level of known that you don't want to get to because then it stops being fun right and then Tom Cruise does yeah well early Tom Cruise it was fun to be that famous but before social media and everybody had a camera that they could pull out like Charles Bronson on that alone mercial then it just becomes it's just something completely different in this business like being famous was courtside seats and I don't know look at the shuckin mountains a blow here's an it says Netflix star systems stars star ratings were personalized and had been from the start that means when you saw movie on Netflix rated four stars didn't mean the average of all ratings were four stars and instead it meant that Netflix thought you'd read it four stars based on your habits and other people's ratings but many people didn't get that so how the fuck was Amy Schumer's one star everybody gave it one star how's that how's that working out who's Sandin Eastern rebels they just all got on and then they threatened the people that liked her special but that's how it went down well I guess in that case what they did was they just said look Greenpeace attacked my so many yeah they just ruined all my chances for the rest I did this joke about trees and they just didn't like it and that's it for me it sound worse now there's a whole new world that seems weird though to me that what they wouldn't like let it actually be rated that they the ratings were personalized based on the shit that you like but how the fuck do they know what you like you just know what I watch it's a it's a riddle wrapped up in an enigma you're not gonna figure out a fucking worldwide I don't know how they do it I don't know how that all I know is I went and I took the meeting I was like this is fucking unbelievable well they're on top of shit you know the weirdest one is Alexa do you know Alexa the Amazon one they're using it there are Neil's like a porn star yeah it does to the stage like they're trying to use that Alexis a thing that you talk to you like Alexa playbill burrs album and you know I have no sympathy for people that bring that in their house and because those mouth-breathing fucking morons will is someday will be mandatory that I do and get microchipped and then that's going to be the end of any sort of rebellion and whatever the fuck they want to do that's it the Emperor can literally fuck a flounder on TV at that point and they will be able to stop any sort of like fucking any dissent any dissent they'll turn off your chip which is your money what are you gonna rebelled against the slip with a slingshot Oh it's a fucking rap but there's too many mouth-breathing morons been like well what do I care somebody if I'm not fucking doing anything those people yeah I've had that I had that argument with a very smart person when the NSA ship went down they found out they were listening to all the calls guys like go ahead listen if it keeps the fucking terrorists from attacking go ahead and listen I'm not doing anything wrong like wow that's not that's not what it is like anybody could find out your email they can go in your email look at your emails and decide whether or not you're doing something wrong or right decide they don't like that once they have that jurisdiction they could even if it didn't have anything they could say you did yeah well they definitely could they get all to your emails they could do whatever that's why nobody gets whacked anymore people used to get whacked you don't get whacked anymore and and you killed yeah you don't well they think that south rich guy got killed pay attention that shit I just talked say you could just kill him in the media one dick pic and be like that is his dick I'll give you the conspiracy theory and I give you what they know there's a guy named Seth rich who's apparently a Bernie Sanders supporter he's working for the DNC he found out that the DNC was the Democratic National Convention natural yeah master national yeah he found out that they were fucking over Bernie Sanders and so he supposedly was giving this information to WikiLeaks all that information got out it hurt Hillary because it turned and hurt the DNC the DNC head of the DNC left and went she resigned and immediately went to work for Hillary Clinton anyway this guy who WikiLeaks said it was no follow up because once she resigns in mainstream news that's the end of the fucking story yeah there was no follow it was pretty rare outrageous that she immediately got hired by Hillary Clinton right but anyway the kid who was his Bernie Sanders supporter his name is Seth rich he was murdered outside of his house four o'clock in the morning they said it was a robbery they left his money they left his wallet they left his phone they left his watch nothing was taken from him but he was shot in the back at four o'clock in the morning so julian assange from wikileaks said that there are consequences for working with us and providing us information so there's an you saying this guy provide you information he said that's just what I'm saying there's calm there's consequences to working with us and then there's this other guy kim.com was this famous multi millionaire internet character that's hot I was gonna say after he lets the information out what is the purpose of killing the guy cuz you're not gonna stop the information what it is is to stop other people from doing it cuz they're all get creeped out by he to stop is that what you're saying here to stop other people from doing it 1 & 2 so that he can't testify on the depth of all the corruption that was going on in the DNC and who would organized it and who had orchestrated it that's what they think but what the fuck but there's a lot of people that dispute this and also there was a redacted FBI report that people were touting out that turned out to be bullshit and so now they found out that that was a fraud that the FBI report was a bullshit FBI report so they don't know what the fuck's going on but this guy's dead so my point is he he got whacked whether or not he got whacked because he was working with there it is federal prosecutor found dead the second act this weekend apparently oh Jesus when you work for don't know exactly yes just blew my clear out of the water days like 37 year old federal prosecutor and went for a jog in South Beach and found with a gunshot wound to his head I believe whoa well he might have fucking put somebody in jail though that that it was pissed off and waited for him and alter your behaviors what when you put someone in jail no when you yeah when you have jobs like that oh yeah you can't go home the same way every but how to fuck people live like that yeah to ever get to that level of society well it's just a intense way of life to you work with criminals all the time you constantly work with people that are breaking the law you constantly trying to put them behind bars I don't this is freaking me out when did you start smoking a pipe oh I only have done it a couple of times steven crowder brought it in for me that's right how is it it's not bad it's not bad it's not amazing cuz you get it's not bad I'll do it right now I'll light up for you I thought it would be amazing it's okay both my grand grandfather's smoked a pipe so I am a you know I like what it looks like it's there's a place on the west side the tinderbox that I've been known to go into that place on Wilshire right isn't it yes yeah I know that spot there's a place over there and I've been to go in there and take up pipe them I like I like the smell of it madam just go in there and throw your shirt across the room start smoking a pipe well Lee why you like that I'll tell you a little bit about emphasis family for people this season Frank's looking to get his job get a job I should say after getting fired to see some good active listening oh Jesus is it weed you're putting in there now it's tobacco oh I thought you fucking inhale inhale do you know you just sort of put in your mouth okay okay Kevin's trying to get his band going we got Laura dirt on the show Justin Long Sam Rockwell Haley Reinhart Debi Derryberry I think I might have been hailed the first time to me I thought you did I might have we'll see how David Koechner no that time I did David Koechner is a funny guy yeah he's one of those silliest people I've ever met and I love him yeah you guys got a great cast yeah do you like doing a cartoon is it is it as satisfying for you is doing stand-up or is just something different that's equally satisfying it's just fun just it's you know what my fate no no no it's it's yeah you know like look stand-ups my first love so but the thing that I love doing is I love writing for all these other people you know and I should say we when we write for him cuz everybody's in the room and Mott the biggest thrill I get is at the table read beyond making you know the powers that be laughs when the actors crack-up and they can't get through the line like we got mo Collins this year a couple of times that she's just a she's a beast man she's just does so many characters for us and a couple of times like it's it's just one of those things like man if we're making mo laugh like I know this is a good line and we got this guy Trevor Duvall is another guy we got him one time and Koechner is hard to get to laugh though he's such a pro you know what I mean and he'll say afterwards this is some of the funny should've ever done but he to get him back kind of a goal of mine to get him to crack yeah I've been in the booth with Laura and we've gotten her a number of times and yeah it's Sam Rockwell we've got him laughs I just thought that's my favorite my it's like making another comedian left/right to say it's an extra level of like alright you know especially you know a lot of them the caliber actors that the material that they've looked at so for them to say and you can tell you know anybody can say oh my god this is great when you really make them laugh you can't fake that so I read the table reads a fun because I think that's more like a stand-up show and I really rehearse my lines and I make sure that I you know I sell the shit out of him because I don't have to go back and fix him you know if they don't work at the table reading that's something that I did accidentally early in my career and then I learned what a you know I learned what a big thing that is like the first acting gig that I got was doing some small movie or something they had a table read and I got there and I was overly prepared and the lines worked and then there was more stuff for me and then this guy said hey man the writers love you man you just selling the shit out of your stuff and I'm thinking my head is I was just trying not to get fired and then I wrote then I I was able to receive our game works because there's there's actors that'll go to a table reading if they don't like the material they don't sell the stuff and they I don't think they understand how hard people work so at least give it a fucking right yes swing out of your cleat see what happens you know what I mean but to go there and just sort of move mumble your way through it that's it's not a good position to get yourself into as an actor of the whole writing room writers one was like oh fuck this guy yeah wasn't that an issue one what was that girl on one of those cop shows not cop shows one of those hospital shows Grey's Anatomy was that girl said she wanted to be removed from consideration for for the Emmys because she didn't think the material was strong enough that year and they were like oh why oh god this yeah I know and how how writers yeah command their money is through win and shit like that yeah obviously being on a hit show but if you're an Emmy Award winning writer that's huge for them that's like their fuckin HBO special so yeah - screw that if they're gonna get they were nominated and she said I want to take that back Wow I didn't want to be she didn't want to be nominated here it is star shuns Emmys Katherine Heigl this week said she had opted out of the Emmys races here because she was not given good enough material to work with last season that is fucking 29 years old on top of the fucking world just disappearing up your own fucking for jungle back to that real quick so that was I don't know who that is exactly is she still working not really no she dropped off the face of the planet ten years ago she was a big star she started doing movies she did that movie with Seth she probably didn't motive what she was oh she's fucking dropped off the face of the planet now she's 40 and no 38 let's be honest here she's 38 well basically ten years ago 40 is 38 I mean I'm 49 I'm 50 trust me that's what happens though that 10 years flies by and nobody wants to do shit with you anymore and now she's got a tainted word she's got a tainted name yeah oh yeah she's apparently soft understand sand she's you know apologize for her her youthful exuberance but hey we're dumb she got her 20s wit dumped yeah I give her a pass Thomas fuck yeah I gave her passed poor girl good for you yeah we don't do dumb shit oh yeah in your 20s is pretty dumb though huh that's pretty dump that's ferocious I could beat that with a few things in my 20s don't you think that's not like a rash decision that's something that was thought over decided reinforced set it more than one time and then yeah but there's a certain level of like not only ego mania with celebrity but there's also paranoia and I think that like you just fucking that all squirrels together in your head and like you know like maybe her thinking about an old acting am i doing the work this is worthy like he got that fucking going on when if you're just remotely a pleasant person when you get to a certain level of Fame people just like you are just the most amazing like I sneezed and you said god bless you I mean he is so down to earth like the level that you have to just fucking barely even be a fucking decent human being to just get this avalanche of compliments if you got that going on and then you got this fucking paranoia thing like it's just a move it's just what I wanted it's just what I want to hang my and on with this Emmy and you just start fucking having your own Inside the Actors Studio with yourself I think it's just a diss on the writers that's what I would I would say what she's doing is just dissing the writers she's just saying so in your world it's a sketch for me it was a was a trilogy of a movie I was really going somewhere with trilogy three three parter I was just joking of how I built it all up in her hand you just like yeah I think she's just being a cunt they call about brass tacks Rogan just gets right down to it and that is my method I'm more of a browser I'm not really I'm not grounded pumped you grabbed and pounded you don't feel about the first round you take them right back yeah when it comes to people I thought of like I've seen that before I know what that is you go double leg takedown and then that's it especially with actors I mean I met a lot of nice actors don't get me wrong but maybe it's 50% of them that's a bad number like 50% of actors are pretty fucking coach you worked you worked back when they could be a douche through now you can't that's right now you can't yeah people tell yeah no no it's it's just because everybody's stole all the movies and they stole all the music you know those people like we're all the good music Oh would you is born during the grunge era it's like well if this model existed back then you would have ruined that too because you cunts don't pay for anything so you get what you pay for you get shame movies you know about superheroes and all that so now that's what it is it's gonna be superheroes or you know some sort of whatever fucking oh my god am I 40 now one of those comedies and yeah what the fuck was my point what were you pay for anything anymore that's what I mean and that wasn't your thing I was talking about oh you can't be a douche now because the works dried up there's not as many of them that's why there's like like all these stars piling on like the Golden State Warriors every movie back in the day like to make Ocean's eleven happen when all of those people could have had their own starring vehicle and make all of this fucking money god I hope I'm right on this one you mean the original Ocean's eleven no even though even the one like in the 2000 when I staff you times I did movies everybody told me you just missed it you fucking missed it it all ended in O 506 and I started getting working like 2:09 2010 they were like oh my god they fucking pay for John Travolta's jet fuel fucking you know you do like one of those hogs movies like riding on a motorcycle he'd be okay you got to pay for my 747 I got John John goes without saying it goes saying I'm gonna fly it back and forth from the set on the weekend in my own 747 12 hour apps whatever you want we'll build a fucking airfield for you right next and when we do stay alive will fucking do like like when you hear something I mean I'm obviously exaggerating to a certain level but like some of the budgets that were around in the way that they burn through fucking money and now it all just it's like it's the Serengeti during the dry season and all the fucking lions are fucking everybody's drinking next to each other so don't they still make big movies now I mean don't all these like blockbuster they do they still make no but if you notice but this like it's not just a Tom Cruise movie they'll be like fucking all these other people pile like those superhero movies this like of this there's someone who used to be able to carry a movie in each slot right I'm not saying they still don't get movies it's just like justjust dried up and I like this people in the industry told me man in black 3 star Will Smith forced the MU forced to move his huge two million dollar trailer as New York residents complain Jim just for working out that's just as Jim yeah he had another trailer - holy shit out or whatever Kevin James had a trailer just for working out when we did a zookeeper together he had a full gym in a trailer that you rent I mean it was a full it out of fucking tanning booth in it that was one here comes the boom here comes the moon he had it get in shape because he was playing a us a guy yeah Kimmy yeah he did a great job yeah he did he lost a shitload of weight too started drinking kale shakes in the morning and working out constantly so we had a full gym nothing will get you in shape like knowing you had you're gonna have to take your shirt off in a movie motivate you like fuck this yeah definitely I know y'all the green shit you got off drinking I will fuckin drink that if you could somehow if there was an app that you listen to when you were asleep and it convinced you that you were gonna have to take your shirt off in a movie like the level of shape that Americans would get into I think would be crazy do you what about Bert Kreischer Bert Kreischer is a rare animal he's like a white tiger you know he's very valuable I cannot buy no deer like if you ever get to the level if you get bored with just you know and you want to go for the ultimate prey like that's the head you want on your wall you want Kreischer Bert is like yeah he has I don't know I don't know how he's wired but like he does not I I would love to add that's that's a cool you have to ask him that ask him Bert what humiliates you like heat Victor that dude is really just like fearless boy he's definitely fearless and taking his shirt off takes his shirt off every show like immediately takes his shirt off and the fucking chaps on yeah chaps ayiti did that at the goddamn comedy gym no he came I remember I had to follow him he went out and he fucking did a Red Hot Chili Peppers give it away now and came out with just a sock on his junk they convinced everyone else in the band to do it and they did it most of them didn't want to do it he's just he's fucking Burt he let him over the hill like in Braveheart they all walked out with this socks and I'm sitting there like kind of fuck am I gonna follow this and what did you have to say why don't you play the drums I just play drums we cannot go wrong though and you're back there with the drums you could follow that it's not the same ah dude you're talking to level of energy and the level of the crowd being like dude what the fuck the show is over to the show the show is over why didn't they have them go last I think that's the exact question I asked Josh Adam Meyers also does a voice on does Howlin Hank the DJ he had the problem we came over the DJ character I'm like I got the guy with the perfect voice but uh yeah I don't know why I should have been going online I think it's like they view that show more like how many years have you been doing stand-up it's like no this is not a stand-up to say music show who has the most musical ability or like it's going to make the crowd go the crazy I mean come on dude even if you didn't know anything about show business guys with these guys are gonna come out with nothing but socks on their dicks that's that's going last right yeah that's that's it that's what I would say if I was scheduling it I can't remember what I did after that played the drums well I did something I did enough stand up to try to make them forget about what they saw before that but I don't remember what song I played so that show I stand up to like you do a little stand-up as well yeah well what used to with the way it started out which you would come out and just talk about how much you love music and then you talk about the awful band you played in or some of the concerts you went to or a rock star that they meant something to you and and what because what inspired to do there you go that's maybe trying to be Steven Adler tattoo the heart tattoo so I probably played either welcome to the jungle of Paradise City on that one it's funny shit dude and that's and the reason why I dress up like the drummers is because I don't want people to think that you know I play drums good enough where people would be like wait does this guy think he's good Burt yeah there you go baby find a sock see that was before the weight-loss challenge - yeah he put most my weight back on though Tommy didn't I went to Tommy's house the other day to do this podcast Segura he looks fucking great he's lost more weight oh yeah he's disciplined now they see is exercising constantly eerily quiet sometimes when you stand next to Tom yes really yeah I just peer into his head sometimes like what's going on in there what do you say what is I don't know I don't know this I love Tom but the I'm telling dudes just saw something have it in there huh I would love to bring him on here and interview him well he's definitely intense he's in a way that he doesn't show a lot of people like the way he prepared for this weight loss challenge I'm a dark dude and I when I go into room you can see if you're a psycho you've you spotted another psycho and it's just like this there's a fucking movie going on there that I would love to finance I want to see that movie made

into this circular cube maker circular ice ball maker you know you pour it in there so it's smoky water and then he drops that in a glass and pours his whiskey over the smoke infused water yeah that's

to apologize he kept saying apologize and they go are you trying to say Trump you're trying to say apologize I guess no I would never do that [Laughter] I gotta say I've been just busy so I haven't been watching on satellite live I gonna start watching it again yeah I don't watch it either I just watch the clips online I don't have time to invest Senate life is like one of those things were I feel like they're gonna hit 50% of the time and missed 50% of time I can't do that so I'll just I'll wait for the hits they great main it's very efficient way digesting your art so I do a bro inefficient all right well we efficiently we have 10 episodes this season I got to keep steering it back as last year promoted it I just went on things trying to be funny and then in the end they'd be like oh by the way you know I got to make sure I promote it plug it plug it I think is for family on Netflix and if you don't have Netflix how dare you how dare you try to live your life without Netflix does everything on it sit yeah kids like my new TV I got a new TV doesn't even I mean you don't even need something to get on Netflix get on Netflix right through the TV the TV hooks up to Wi-Fi BAM you know what's kills me is you won't be satisfied with that and within 18 months because your neighbor will have something else I don't know my neighbor oh you're gonna know your neighbor I had to meet my neighbor the other day cuz my daughter's drone flew into her yard yeah we got a drone it sucks how high up does it go that goes high it doesn't listen to you it's just if you could spend 150 bucks in a drone it doesn't listen you guys spent like 500 then they listened $150 one it's like so a vague suggestion and once it gets more than like a few hundred feet away from you that fucking thing is not listening anymore it just it sailed right into her tree to go down and get it amazing video on those things oh yeah you can if you get a good one not wanting to be video it is fucking weird man I mean there was a town in Colorado that passed a law letting you hunt them so if you see one in the sky I'll shoot it down I love it yeah I love it I like that too I just have a bit about that when Amazon was going to start delivering packages I go that's gonna be like in down south seems like skeet shooting with prizes did this machine yeah just absolutely fucking shoot those things out of the air that's one of the I one time I was over a friend's house we're at a pool unjustly here was just hovering over the pool looking at it's like a book fucking perv my wife's in a bikini and shit so what are you doing and like I was like you know I had my usual overreaction like it's just how it's gonna be it's just the future I will get a fucking gun I don't give a fuck I will have a cardboard cutout of me so I could sit in in the in the video or some shit some I was gonna get away with it just need a good bird gun you know good 20-gauge just shoot her out of the sky something that scatters good right you know be great is if you knew whose it was and you could have somebody filming their face when you shot this shit out of the sky how despite their invasion of your own property how wronged would feel what's weird that's not there's no law above your house like if someone flew that into your house would be a problem if someone drove it into your yard it'd be a problem but if they hover over your face yeah yeah its airspace that's fucking weird right how does that work with like say if you wanted to fly over Kim Kardashian's house in a helicopter and take pictures of her are you allowed to how's that work yeah there's noise ordinances or like you can only fly so fucking low how low you know usually it's like I wouldn't go lower than 700 feet especially in Santa Monica those people they hate that Airport there and they want all of those people out of there they're killing that Airport don't know they hit they've been trying to do that for now though they're gonna turn into a park all right yeah they they just passed it it's gonna I think it goes out and I think it's 2020 goes under oh yes three more years of Airport almost pissed though all those people that live in like Marina del Rey and all those places around there with a lot of cash and they will park their jet there they're fucking pissed the mountain yes want to fly right in there and just oh my god yes yeah that was perfect well now they have to go to Van Nuys torrents yeah man dies it's wrong you go to Torrance you're gonna be in traffic for two hours yeah no that's all kind of amazing that they passed that you know that those people couldn't figure out a way to bribe their way I'm sure in that Airport but it's three years is a long fucking time do you member in New York City when they first had those videos you know advertising in the back of cabs and everybody's like these are making me carsick at these things to fuck out of here people had such a reaction to it they went away and then like few years later they just came back just came back now he loves them but they're fucking gross just touching that screen all that it's bad enough being in the cab and you just see the fingerprints it's bad enough opening and closing the door but I can't see the fingerprints those screens like I don't I don't like them well it's always loud too they're always loud and they're playing you ads and some entertainment news TV show or something like that yeah I feel like a hypocrite cuz I do advertise on that podcast so how mad can I get but I do draw the line when I go to pump gas like hey it's gas tv1 they're just pumping it super loud you do ads on your podcast but you're shit in the ads like I heard you doing an ad for me undies whether the new one what they're doing with the gay pride thing and you're like it's very hard to get I think straight guys to get into like or animals you don't to me we don't have we don't have the sense of style maybe you get a couple of metrosexuals but yeah I just felt like that was a great like what can we what can we pretend to care about that will get us to sell more underwear and that was that was the way to fuck and go item or I just say things I don't feel like that was do you know you know what you know what it really is I have two pairs and they're very Greg Louganis I'll tell you got little ones they're little ones and I put him on to make my wife laugh and she did laugh but she goes no I kind of like him I'm like these are just too little I get the boxer briefs oh they have boxer briefs it's all I wear I'm wearing them right now I'm joking show you I thought you know what some reason I thought you and have like the tearaway fight ones the polka-dots that's great that looks like the yogurt shit that they have sprinkles TCBY sprinkles in your Froyo all right have I kept you here long enough I think I have this guy man there's gonna be traffic you gotta get out of here I don't know I just I just wasn't sure if the point you're showing me your underwear if there's anything else you want to bring up although what did you shot lately yeah animal wise shot a pig a couple months ago oh well shit fuck the animals what else did you shoot though just animals okay yeah there was something oh no no no no so you were interesting tour cry sure I'll give you some pig meat damn I don't have it here she and motherfucker I always get the elk I give you l Ken Pig no I still have the elk left over from the last year you okay I have plenty out but uh I want the wild boar I'll give you like a quarter like a fucking real a real like leg like a boar leg yeah hey I live in a house man I don't have the fucking the fucking serial killer meat freezer that I know that you have you just got to tell me when you're gonna cook and I'll give it to you the day you cook it alright that's not gonna happen no I'll go on YouTube and fill out it now go to fucking and how to cook a pig leg yeah we just got a slow cook it just slow coat your brine it first I like to brine things you know I get you ever use those Yeti coolers you know what a Yeti coolers it's like a super really cold it's a very insulated cooler like you could put ice in it and leave it outside in the Sun and five days later I'll still have ice okay so you take one of those put some ice in it and some sort of a bucket fill the bucket up with salt water and June and sugar yeah a bunch of shit in there garlic stuff like that and then brine brine the meat and let make it extra Tennessee why because she's a witch it's just like brining is just such an old-school thing ty somebody do a steak and then at that point the you know I heard they never really they weren't really burning witches at the stake that was bullshit they would drown them I'm like well that's just as terrifying why not you got to go drowning ya gotta go with drowning why's that for fuckin minute that's it you just pick a big inhale I think what they would do is if if they would figure if you didn't drown you were definitely a witch and if you drowned they fucked over like my bed which somebody's doing something cuz there's a lot of weird shit going on you know how do you get out of that one that amazing know that that's what they used to think they used to think that someone was doing witchcraft when things would go wrong I don't think that's amazing because I think that's that kind of thought has just slid into other shit that people think you know do you know what the root of it was and the Salem rich witch trials who was they got a late Frost and their bread like apparently when you get a late frost and wheat you can get some weird mold that grows on the wheat and this wheat was growing this type of mold called ergot and oh god has the same properties as LSD so these people were eating the bread and tripping their fucking balls off and they thought that no you Tommy hats really freaky with a belt buckle on your hat cause the belt buckle in your shoe at least they have those stupid buckles on their shoes I'm sorry I did the gum go I did the comedy comic thing oh dude go ahead there's no anyway so they're tripping on this shit and so they thought that these people were bewitched they thought they were getting which they were getting hexed by witches and so they had these people that they didn't trust and they were freaking out because they were on acid and that's like one of the primary theories not crazy you imagine being on acid in the 1700s how much should be freaking out yeah I mean there's no information on it what I actually I thought some of the the original people whatever you're supposed to call them now indigenous people you're not supposed to say the natives I fucking said that Rhiannon and somebody kvu the the oh geez and Canada of the animal some original First Nation personation yeah they have a different name for we can first responders they got weird rules in Canada do you know they can go out at night with flashlights and shoot deer and moose they flash flashlights on them and all year round they don't have any any rules they have that in America too like they they don't have like game laws for the Native American reservation areas like they can just um I'm actually doing a gig for the cops tomorrow are you what are you doing - something for the California Highway Patrol where it's a good move I don't know yeah you can never know enough cops never know never know enough cops you'd get no idea when you're gonna snap and you're gonna need a cop to show up Oh Joe yeah get out of here come on you're not hurt that bad buddy walk it off walk it off you'll be fine I think they're all the motorcycle guys I want to talk to I was hoping I was going to meet some of the helicopter pilots because those fucking gay flight like 300 feet the balls those guys here really yeah they're a lot of people's houses and they guys sit there in a fucking circle yeah for like an hour not just looking at first moved to LA this girl I was dating right outside of her house someone broke into someone's house and they had the helicopter flying over the head it was fucking creepy like you look outside the window you'd see the spotlight moving across the city Street yeah I seen that going down to the improv this the building still exists if you park just east of Crescent Heights there's a building and on the second floor they have ceiling to floor windows and something with somebody broke in there and they had like the helicopter spotlight was on it and I watched two cops like a movie walking down that hallway with their guns drawn slowly walking and just sitting there like what the fuck is this yeah I was like probably like four months into moving here the crazy shit I ever saw with cops live was on TV during the North Hollywood shootout were you in LA back then I was in Vegas but I was living in LA yeah those guys that had the head to toe body armor yeah they had head to toe body armor trunks filled with guns they were all steroid up out of their fucking mind crazy probably on meth and just gonna sound that yep that was that was crazy that was crayon Newsradio it was uh we're in the lunchroom like our break room watching on TV going what in the fuck just they were live shooting from there dude I would have retired the next day as a cop I would have been like is this what the future is and I mean you're gonna give me this little fucking peashooter like this is what I'm supposed to do I'm done yeah a lot of them did I'm sure I would I that would have been it when they were fucking crouched behind their car in that guy that guy spraying yeah you know I love how people going like oh they did one open shot the guy who's clearly hurt there I mean yeah they wouldn't pull him away they let him bleed out he got shot under the vest you got like took one under the vest in the gut and they let him bleed out people are complaining good yeah exactly good that's what you get my mother would have said well you should have shot at the police that's what you get you know value low maybe there's the incarnation you'll learn next time you're supposed to be above I got more kids love that if you're a peace officer for whatever and no that's stupid I agree that's like an athlete's when someone says fucking crazy shit to your face you supposed to be above that now if I am right and I've been in a perfect world in a perfect world some woman on Twitter laid a lady some lady on Twitter was harassing Donald Trump and Donald Trump blocked her which is hilarious so she showed that Donald Trump blocked her and then she said she's contacting a lawyer and she said that the president shouldn't be able to block her and everybody's like what the fuck are you talking about and then people started harassing her so she started blocking people and they're like listen you fucking crazy bitch this is what's called a hypocrite picturing him in the White House you know when you scroll with both your thumbs just sitting there and typing like mad this is what he's doing blocking people on Twitter yeah he blocks people it's hilarious you know what else he does he watches five hours of TV a day how the fuck does he have time I don't have time to watch five hours of TV a day people know how to delegate that's what he's doing he's delegating his time to the vice president I bet he looks at him like he's his ward and just you know military codes are over there and just I mean I don't have to watch he yeah Hannity still on our team talking about me he's bad I got I don't know I look I couldn't handle that fucking job dude Howard Stern had the funniest fucking take on him on Donald Trump was saying like why the fuck would you take that job at your age yeah he goes you got you got like eight good summers left because you're gonna spend that taking all this shit he just kept going back to that you get eight summers left he kept yelling a good take dude it was fucking hilarious and was it was perfect yeah why would you do that the ending like you're a fucking billionaire just go enjoy your money ego you could do it all I could do it all burr I could be the fucking press is that because they trashed him at the brunch a hundred percent he was like fuck you I'll show you because they mocked him made fun of him because I was during the put him right in the middle of the room yeah do you know every roast there's always that raw meat guy and you don't realize you're that guy until of a sudden the roast starts is just like oh fuck I'm the guy I'm the guy for when everybody runs out of jokes for the guy that they're hosting that that they're roasting yeah yeah that's it's brutal yeah and he was you know and he said one thing to him that was hilarious like but I'm one thing that you'll never be and that's the President of the United States that was one of the things that Obama said yeah and he shut them all and he had the fucking hand over the keys to the house I mean that had to have been oh my god we never saw it coming there's no way no way this guy's gonna run nowhere this guy's gonna win no and in a weird way it was sort of like a reverse like bully movie cuz it was the Liberals doing it to him and they were totally bullying the gap a hundred percent what he was bully and Obama with the whole fuckin thing yeah birther thing right so I don't know they're still going after that birth of shit I saw something yesterday on some website that was showing how they have all these different confirmed sources that are showing that the Obama birth certificate was fake and I hope it was fake so I would be I do his presidency it already happened what do you know what can you do but I hope it was fake I hope he scammed the country listen that the fucking the NBA had that mobbed-up ref and he said that he fucked the Warriors out and I mean the the Kings out of that series against the Lakers no one's gonna take the fucking Lakers title away what idea really yeah is that real yeah what is it he was a referee who's fuckin fixing games no yep really that's how much you don't watch sports you don't want smore no no it would fit him Donaghy a hundred percent of NBA refs gamble what what that's gone but he's also like he's in jail now he's just trying to say shit but like I know this is the guy that was the ref that was in jail yeah but like he he set him right there yeah he fix game he used to say from in jail he goes you tell me who was rough in the game and I'll tell you who went Wow he spent 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges of case he's four out frita how much did you think he made he joined kalanchoe Colin Cowherd Wednesday afternoon had a fascinating answer when asked what percentage he said 100 Wow that's no no no no that's just a fucking jailbird talkin I used to gamble on my OC fights way back in the early days when I first started working for them I was like who gives a shit I can't really affect the outcome it's not like in many many years ago like I would write they would bringing these guys like they'd bring in some guy from like Brazil that I knew about and I would look at the line I'm like you guys are out of your fucking mind this guy should be like a 10 to 1 favorite and you got him an underdog I'm like oh I'm putting some money on that and I'd put some money on it for a whiles like this is probably not smart you know I don't think it's illegal because I cants not good for the company no it's also not good for me if I come off as biased anyway you know I've been accused of being a biased commentator anyway even worse Tapout yeah but um that's a that's a different kind of thing though gambling when you're a referee is a big deal yeah and that's a game that's easily fixed how do they fix it what do they do because you can you can take stars out of the game by giving them fouls oh is that what they did yeah you just sit people down it's just like if you're the best player on the team in the first quarter I give you two quick fouls I'm not gonna see you again until the second court and I've never fixed a fucking game but I mean I'm just you know I'm just I give you another one in the second quarter I don't see you to the next to happen at some point you're gonna get mad if I keep calling bullshit files I might get you in a technical file that saves me a ticket Act file and that counts towards your files and then to files to technicals you're out of the game you're ejected so was it obvious that this guy was doing fouls that it was great cause Bobby said the NBA was kind of fixed for a while like I was sitting going like yeah I just I went to a game one time the Celtics first Utah Jazz and I'm watching the fucking game and like just like the game starts they're letting them play and then they're calling it tight and then they're letting them plate then they're calling it tight and it's like there was never an ebb and flow and how they were calling the game it's like a an umpire you know you've seen the first inning they got step out of the box going okay that's a strike tonight okay cool just finding out where your strike zone is but like an umpire if you start changing the strike zone kind of changing sports on you here it's like people are gonna know like what the fuck's going on you got to be consistent so like with NBA refs it NBA games you would watch it's just like oh they're calling it closed tonight ah he's letting the boys play and like that was the game they wouldn't just keep obviously if it got really out of hand they would tighten down but I never saw a game where I was just like you're pulling back on the range you letting him run you're pulling back you're letting him run and it just made me feel like they were shaving points or something I remember for years I said the game was fixed and everybody said I was out of my fucking mind and then they find a guy who's all mobbed up and I go there vindication they go I was just one guy now when you say mobbed up like how was he mobbed up what was the issue with that guy it's just an expression I don't want to get in trouble with anybody but he was basically working for other people that were part of a gambling that took you know bookies or whatever right and he did something to make sure that the game leaned in that direction but you couldn't totally fix it so if a team was favored by eight and they want him to win by eight he'd make sure it happened I probably probably easier to make sure they didn't by fucking over their offense and then they would just you know they try to get money like look if you're a legit bookie all you're trying to do is get an even amount of money on each side right okay because with the combination of people teasing and plus the juice and all of that you're gonna end up on top you don't want a bunch of money all on one side and losing your fucking shirts so what these guys would do is you get greedy after a while it's like I'm sick of this ticky-tack shit let's go for a big fucking score they wouldn't do it every game they just every once in a while be like all right listen here's a game probably you know I don't have that fixed a fucking game I'm just guessing how they would go about doing it to fix this one all right make sure these guys don't win by eight so this guy admit that he fixed it yeah yeah he went to jail he went to jail for gambling on it right no he was fixing her fixing it so what did he say he said like he made fouls that weren't really fouls well yeah yeah you do you we do whatever he had to do this is what his attorney submitted saying the manipulation that happened during one okay so as officiating a playoff series between Team five and Team six in May of 2002 is a six game of a seven-game series and a team five victory that night would have ended the series however Tim learned from referee a that referees a and F wanted to extend the series of seven games Tim knew referees a and F to be company men in quotes always acting in the interest of the NBA and that night it was in the NBA's interest to add another game so the NBA wanted to fix it yeah-oh the NBA fix it referees a and F heavily favored team six personal fouls resulting in obviously injured players were ignored even when they occurred in full view of the referees conversely the referees called made-up fouls on team fluff the highlights of the Lakers Kings game it was ridiculous the files that they were called but that's my thing is when they said it was just one guy it's like how long could you be on an officiating crew while looking in one of your guys is dirty before you'd realize like what the fuck is this guy doing yeah well what about the guys that were betting on the other team I'd want to kill that fucking referee do you imagine if you saw him call fouls that weren't really fouls and when they're all son you knew your money was going out the window but I think they're really susceptible to it because like the amount of money that NBA players make is fucking insane right they make like you know some of the contracts that they have coming up and there's in Soph there's so few guys on the team and there's like every year the draft is like two rounds on the draft like fucking NFL goes on forever there's 40-something guys on a team in the NFL there's 20-something in baseball 20-something in in the NHL and I think I think basketball it's no more than 11 or 12 guys so it's a very small group of people and the income that they're generating like their revenue share I don't know how that's all that's all like super sports nerd shit like I don't know how that works but some of the contracts that they that some of these guys have been signed in like they can afford to fucking pay that guy that so now you're a ref and you're running with your fucking black aerobic Reebok sneakers up and down the court yes and you're seeing the cars these guys are getting in and all the women hanging out and you're on the stage too running up and down no one gives a fuck about you and I don't know what the pension is for the NBA but like if I was in the NBA if I was running I'd be like we got a fucking triple these guys salary is this the salaries of the players of the referees NBA player salaries for right what about the referees though so look at that way less 35 million a year for LeBron that's just that's just what he makes the play hoop right not about what's most important sneaker contracts are like more than what they make it's fucking nuts it's not a lot of cash good for them I'm not I'm not like saying they should make the money obviously if people putting it out there earning it for but like fight it can you put up what a ref makes do you know who Mike Conley is that's what's hilarious I only know like the biggest guys like that might count some who that's Mike Conley well you know the fucks I don't know who that is either guy made thirty million dollars last year highest-paid player in the NBA he says cuz the contract is a guy named Mike Conley yeah he was is the starting point guard for the Memphis Grizzlies yeah matter of time like his contract came up at the time last year and the when the rest of the guys are gonna get more at this coming year and the following year the TV contracts have gone up and there's a percentage they're going up each year based off the TV rights and that's why it I watched almost every Celtic game last year I never heard Mike on Mike Conley that sounds like a fucking politician which IO state Sam years Greg Oden who was going to Boston yes is he still playing in China no no he's actually Ohio State assistant coach right now he went back to school for playing in China that's when he gets weird right and you got to go overseas to Europe you're playing for a hundred grand a year I don't know sometimes you get famous enough they'll give you a little more I don't know how that works either I don't have a lot of shit works I just know I have a show coming I'll call that family that's why I'm here the average salary of NBA revenues from a hundred fifty grand a five hundred fifty grand that's a big spread what about the guy who's making the extra four how's he getting extra for average salaries have spiked considerably since 1983 when NBA officials made between 18,000 and 78,000 each season 550 grand is not bad that's a lot of scratch so you'd have to give them enough money where they don't feel tempted to cheat right yeah that's the problem with politicians right you make 550 grand a year you're making 50 grand a year more than the president so you're kind of like those guys are like set up to be like here's a job that cost a hundred million to get and you're gonna get paid five hundred grand so if you're just setting them up to have to cut deals with people what do you think is gonna happen Trump I have no idea I don't even know the bet highest-paid guy in the NBA I have a few that if you had a guess though do you think this is gonna gonna last yes you don't think he's gonna go to jail and I'm in the middle hell no no I watch Clinton get impeached he stayed right but Clinton got impeached for just not telling the truth about an affair Nixon should have stayed I think so he should have just stayed and just be like you know all right American people and that's it I think this dress is too much for them though when the whole world comes after him like that everywhere you look every newspaper I I think I think he'll be fine he's fucking watching five hours of TV news on Twitter fluff another sandwich I mean he's living like a fucking kid well it's hard to see when you read articles about him it's hard to know who's right in the article and why they're writing it right like are they writing this article because they really believe that he's gaining weight and he's solemn then he's down in the dumps or are they trying to just put that out there like how the fuck do they know he's down that's trying to sell papers how they know he's sullen and comes home upset and he's gaining weight he doesn't even like gain weight though simply get a little fat a little depression well I mean there's obviously most of people it seems in the media fucking hate the guy so they're gonna be just he's just yeah but that's how you chip away at you're right start talking about how you're coming home when you're depressed and you're despondent you don't listen to anybody yeah how do they know that how do they know that our sources say how do they know that our sources say negative things about the guys we don't like well you were talking about Tiger Woods in your podcast I was listening to it on the way over here and I totally agreed with you well you sound like when Tigers world fell apart like how the fuck do you know like woody did you talk to him like you don't know him like didn't have a conversation sure that was a brutal couple of years but it was 10 years ago yeah and in 10 years he hasn't fucked up other than this DUI so I mean yeah he fucked up but it you know yeah that shit in 89 so I'm gonna judge him right the DUI apparently he's on some back medication that's what it is he mixed his medication that's what he's saying but they said he smelled like booze but I don't know just take the hit yeah you know I fucked up I was angling the tellers and blah blah blah I'm not gonna I'm not condoning what the guy did but I'm not gonna sit there and judge the guy and be like I was watching some guy and he was trying to say that you know you know he let us down he sold himself as a family man it's like you built that whole fucking narrative yeah you built that whole NER I just watched him play golf all I ever want to do when I watch golf is watch those guys fucking crush it like I love John Daly and I love that he's like fuck you I like drinking he just kept drinking who's smoking cigarettes big yeah when he would hit a fucking mile and I loved watching it well Tiger always had a very bizarre style apparently I don't play golf but apparently people that I've talked to that explained to me the way he would hit the ball like it's not the way they teach you to do it but he could do it so well that way but he would put like ridiculous amounts of torque yes on his ball on his by and they they said from the beginning that his body was gonna break down if he keeps doing that there was a period where he adjusted his swing and he stopped he stopped winning and then he came back again and I just think that what they said there was a bunch of guys Earl Campbell they said if he keeps running like that he's wide open he's going to have problems Bobby Orr the way he played hockey which you throw yourself around he really beat the shit out of your body like that happens and it just coincided with his personal life falling apart so everybody goes oh that's the reason why you know somebody wins that's the reason why somebody loses like look I'm not saying you don't go to a couple year for calf you yeah your life falls apart in the parcel area but it's just like the rest of that shit you know that was I mean that's just a bunch of hype like for him it's like a double dump though you know I mean the thing happens personally with his personal life and it happens publicly where everybody gets to see it and then on top of that his body's falling apart at the same time no man yeah no matter what at church every fucking week he was gonna fuck up his back and his knees and they'd and it did but then they're trying to equate it to you know whatever the I think what he did was none of my business it's none
