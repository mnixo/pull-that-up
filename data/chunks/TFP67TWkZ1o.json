the Joe Rogan experience that's where that comes from I mean that was just fucking intense well it's the it's the practicality to me right like yes exactly we have a referee we have cage walls we have whatever you know fans it's entertaining people but like I need to know I need to know that like would that be in nature you know that'd be doing whatever that'd be self-defense that'd be fuck us fighting over a territory or food or whatever like I need to know what would happen like if we had like that's why I want these finishes we only get 15 minutes to be able to tell ourselves what would have happened in that situation you know and and when it goes to a decision I'm pissed because I don't know you know like you don't know especially these three round fights where I'm waking up like these last couple fights like late in the fight I'm I'm pissed cuz I'm like I don't know if that would have been another 30 minutes or another two hours that were scrapping in the woods like who gets the bone you know I want to know and so that's us it's crazy and it's your practicality and it's your survival and this is the way I get to know myself the way you just put it not only I've ever heard anybody put it that way you need to know that the problem with vegans is the problem with people it's not veganism it's people if you get a room that has a hundred people in it the odds of one of those people being a fucking idiot is a hundred percent it's almost a hundred percent that one of them is a fucking idiot yeah so if you get three hundred million people you have three million fucking idiots and some of those folks are vegans and that's the problem with veganism it's not it's not veganism itself it's there's a certain percentage of human beings that they don't have to do anything to become vegans right they just join this group it's not like you have it well we're thinking about allowing you in to the vegan culture but we want to know what your philosophy is are you a hateful person are you a person that's looking to be a vegan so you could just talk shit about other people are you looking to be angry are you looking to be in a group or a gang a plant-based gang and put the word vegan in front of your name and just start talking shit because that's a lot of the people and so people read all these angry hateful things that these people write and they go well this is vegans but it's not it's not most vegans are not like that at all yeah people most people are not like that at all yeah but there's a certain percentage of them and they claim veganism and they usually put that name the word vegan in their fucking screen name that's how you could spot those assholes yeah they're you know proud yeah they're into it they're in a plant-based game yeah that's really what happened yeah and so what it is is not necessarily even a problem of diet it's a problem of human nature is that people love to stand on the moral high ground they love to point down all the other people whether it's a religious issue like you're not eating halal or you're not eating kosher or you you're eating meat on Good Friday remember the fuck it is they just decide that they have this moral high ground that you don't have so fuck you I'm doing it right and it really comes from our own questions of our own existence and this messiness that we're all inherently aware of that life eats life so it's weird my whole life I thought like you know I'd be scared of death and most people we all are we're all terrified of fucking dykes we don't know but that's the closest I ever came and I wasn't scared like suddenly the fear just went away and it seemed logical like of course it's over like things end and I didn't want to die I wasn't didn't have a death wish but I was like if it's done it's it's kind of it's done and count your blessings and be happy and don't be a bitch like don't if if the fucking ferryman shows up tonight don't fucking hold out don't be the last asshole at the party go no like just fucking pay to fair man get on a boat and go we'll see what's next and stuff and then ultimately Laden Haim did a good job and I fuckin wound up living and stuff so I I know this much I got to read a bunch of shit like after I nearly died it was all nice people wrote very nice things about me and shit and I expected you know them creature of the internet that some people would be like I wish he had fucking died fuck him to death and shit I wish he'd stay silent but generally it was like very nice things people were kind of positive and stuff so I was like fuck man like you know again I didn't want to die but like if I had like that would have been okay now I'm back at it you know what I'm saying like now until it ends like I've got a you know and it's kind of easy as long as I don't wake up with a fucking dead girl or a live boy I don't think like they'll fucking broke me over the coals when I die in the future and shit like that but it felt weird to be so close to the completion and having something that normally terrifies you suddenly be like oh it's okay like and and I don't if you walked up and put a gun in my face I'm sure I'd feel threatened but like I kind of lost my fear of death I'm not like death-defying I won't go out and do anything differently put that that dark cloud that kind of kills any good time the moment you start thinking about like the fear and anxiety or gonna die one day like you know it's gone and I will sudden I'm like yeah I'm gonna die one day and it's gonna be awesome but not for the reasons that you think I'm saying it's gonna be awesome just be awesome because a finish like it's nice to finish things we know how good it feels in life to complete something and that's the biggest fucking thing in life you'll ever complete is your journey so I didn't walk away go on like I got to do more like I got to fucking live life to the fullest I just got to keep doing what I've been doing like living life the way I enjoy it trying to do things sometimes they work sometimes I fail and shit sometimes people are on your side sometimes people like you fucking blow and just do that fucking time have good conversations in the process meet interesting people hear new points of view and shit like that and keep at it but it's nothing to be afraid of from my perspective they were just calling me more names and trying to set up straw man and is this egyptologist who was in that documentary who dismissed everything it was mark still around oh yeah and as he amended his position at all not to my knowledge I haven't spoken with him for years and years and years did you ever speak with him off the record personally alone yeah yeah I'll tell you this is but he didn't say was off the record house I guess was off the record I don't think I was said this years ago but I'll say now at that debate at that debate reply yes debate he I just suddenly found him myself in the hall with him and there was no one else around so he could totally deny this but it's true my perspective at least he said something to me like you know you don't really believe this I know you don't really believe this you just want to be on television and you know be famous or something like that he said I said no I really do believe it or you know I really go by the evidence and I do think the evidence says this and he serve was telling me that no you don't you know he was like I don't know I know I see ye magnetizing you yeah yeah yeah and then easily then and then and then what he does is he starts asking me a question some detailed question about the geology and well if that's the case how can such and such and I think it in hindsight might have been fed to him by some geo archaeologists as they call someone who does archaeology but knows a little geology ah and I realize in hindsight it was meant to be one of those gotcha questions I guess they say nowadays where I wouldn't be able to answer it but no I of course I thought about it it was to me as a geologist very obvious so I start giving him this detailed explanation as to why that's not the case and why you know my evidence stands up bla bla bla and we're standing there face to face I'm explaining this to him and I see his face sir turn and it goes blank and I'm in mid-sentence he just turns around and walks away he says when I realize he couldn't he couldn't refute what you were saying no you can't refute what I was saying and he wasn't really answer my takeaway is that he wasn't interested in discussing it rationally or ants you know he just wanted to win the debate or whatever but so when Charlie and I met and I like I told him like my plan to sort of help black America and to wake them up because I understood how we had fallen victims of his brainwash whimpering washes the leftist dogma there's this idea that because we're black we have to vote Democrat in any way that is not a democrat is racist and against helping us that is like what so many black Americans believe I believed it I believed it you know what I mean so and I'm a pretty smart girl you know I've always been a very smart girl though I've always been you know I've excelled in in academics right so how did I fall victim to it the exact same system right these three verticals the first being the family the breakdown of the family the second one being culture which then to me like growing up it was like jay-z like jay-z was God to me like I like would throw on like I was you know I went through a lot of stuff when I was a kid I didn't have a great family you know but I would throw on a jay-z album and like whatever he said was like it was like going to church you know and then and I can't stand him now but the third one oh no because he he knows exactly what he's doing and he's a traitor but third vertical being education which was what casual side trader yeah it's like like Beyonce the underneath because he knows what's happening to black America and he's somebody that built his entire career off the backs of black America you know of being the guy who started in the hood in in you know Queens and worked you know as a drug dealer and worked his way up and it became the idol for Sony fill in black America and then he stands on stage and endorses Hillary Clinton he stands on stage and tells black American to put the same people in in the White House that locked up more black men than any present history the United States Bill Clinton right the person that stands on the crime bill of 94 is Bill Clinton but because jay-z is now focused on getting a piece of the pie the globalist piece of the pie he doesn't care about black America that's that's my opinion so why I think that's what it was or do you think that maybe he thought that Donald Trump represented a lot of races white people know he doesn't want that office not even kind of for a single second because jay-z's very smart did you speak to him no I didn't speak to him I just I know like it's there's a certain thing where like I just I know that jay-z and beyonce betrayed the black community like there they are so you think they did it purposely for a financial gain yeah I I think yeah I think that they they were interested in having they want to be the people that control the world and they felt that Hillary Clinton like you know they were working with Obama very closely and very clearly now we know that the administration worked very hard to get Hillary Clinton's office and they wanted to stay in that group and so they supported Hillary Clinton who was selected behind closed doors forget the American people see the next president United yeah [Applause]
