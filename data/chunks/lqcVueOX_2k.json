trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day they come in they weigh in then once we record it make sure they're cool they can rehydrate they have many many more hours to rehydrate so guys were rehydrating six hours earlier most guys showed up at 10:00 a.m. they made weight and then they had way more time so when you saw people stand on the scale I was saying official weight when I was announcing it they had weighed in at 10 o'clock in the morning so it was already 4:00 in the afternoon these guys were hydrated and thick no one looks sick so at least visually no one looked like like Conor McGregor looked when he fought Chad Mendes when they weighed in he looked like it's a different person does he a dead man cheeks were all sucked it looks horrible I mean look he did good in the fight yeah but he really did cut he cuts a lot to get to 145 he's a big boy yeah he's a big boy he's way bigger than like Choza Aldo and Josie Aldo was cutting a lot at one point his career I by the way I've never had a hardcore fan I've never enjoyed a fight more than I enjoyed Nate Diaz Conor McGregor's I've never lost my mind so much at the end of the fuge Diaz fan yeah and that was just incredible I mean I'm ten days notice yeah well that whole to card or that to fight event the two fights the final fights the Holly Holm Miesha Tate was one of the most exciting endings to any fight ever when Misha took Holly down in the fifth round a fight where she was losing it took her back and choked her that's insane yeah I read an article today where someone was saying that it was that me she'd lost virtually every second it was from a guy respect a writer and I was she won the second I what are you talking about the second round she took her down and pounded her I think they did they give her a 10-8 yes they just gave and they should she dominated so I read this article this is ESPN writer Rhoda and I was like wait a minute man come on you can't say that like why are you saying that like that's that's silly hyperbole right it doesn't even make any sense um and me show it was threatening in the third and fourth after that Holly was on her bike she's like fuck this yeah like she's fighting perfect and super cautious with no chances and barely winning those rounds you know just winning them but barely winning it wasn't nothing nothing big happened and definitely no threat so that victory when Miesha Tate choked out Holly and Holly's punching in the air like a fucking dramatic is that going out cold punching in the air while she's going out and then Nate beating up Connor in that second round after he gets fucked up in the first round beating him up in the second round and then choking them they're insane probably the most exciting finishes to any fight ever and the and the Connor thing was just insane because he was on a tear that was a you know one of the biggest tears in MMA history and to watch it go down like that especially like you said like he was winning the fight and the Nate turns it around yeah and it was almost like on a drop of a dime like Nate Nate like came to life in that second round and starts talking shit this is really fun in a home for the jab yeah headed with that big one too it was only has a snake like one two two he like what and then he like slithers around you can't find him with a counter he's really good and there's no one worse than a Nate or Nick Diaz to get hurt by in a fight because once they hurt you they just like they push a pace and then when you get hurt they like pick it up and pick it up and then all the sudden I mean before you know it Connors hit like 25 fucking times on the beat and he's shooting for a takedown those guys are always doing triathlons so even though Nate is like it was taken at fight 11 days notice and he wasn't in shape he's still in way better shape than most people so like him going five rounds is not unfeasible it's not it's not outside of the realm of imagination he's in shape there's nothing yeah the kind of shape that he's gonna be when they have a rematch and that becomes a real fucking problem is I think he's gonna beat him up again well wouldn't need sad he's if because I fired a camp you wouldn't fucking touch me he goes my plan was to go out slow in the first round and he came out fast enough in the first round so I got tagged a couple times but that's so cool that's cool stick to the plan stick to the plan and then the second round I starts loosening up and opening up and Connor was just dead yeah well I heard I mean people were talking to Nate about because you know going into that fight like Connors power was what a lot of people were talking about like you know he put one punch on jose aldo's chin and he's out and right no he's talking he's like they can't handle my power I don't do as well but he's Guevara and Nate was saying in one of the post-fight interviews we was like look I'm sparring with Andre Ward and no shelling it like heavyweight boxers I'm doing rounds with heavyweight boxers yeah there's nothing you're gonna hit him with that he hasn't seen were kind of dealt with when he split I like talking like Andre Ward and Joe Schilling like strike you're saying literally the best the best yeah the best in boxing and the best in kickboxing well Joe showing cuts weight to kickbox at 185 pounds and knocks dudes dead yeah dead with one punch so that guy is sparring with Nate on a regular basis Andre Ward who is one of the best fucking boxers on the planet earth one of the slickest said that Nate gives as good as he gets when they split yeah that's crazy and I think Joe Schilling I might beginning but I think Joe Schilling said he's never hurt either one of them in a sparring session I think he said that on a I'm fighter in the kid I believe it tough fucking dudes man tough fucking dudes but what what's fascinating to me is that he wanted to jump right back in there and do it again and that Nate wanted or that Conor wanted to just run it back and it's like wow that's interesting it seems weird that he gets to do that not so much that he wants to but it just seems weird that they were like like you know when Dana White was talking about in his like look man we tried to convince him to go down to 145 and he was like Nate's field I was like he's the matchmaker now he just gets to go wouldn't you let him if you want if you want to make a ton of money right man I believe in the market yes and that guy's that guy's what people want to see he can do with you he can do whatever he wants to do it needs a big payday often but it's not just that the emperor has been stripped down okay so now he's exposed so now someone's beaten him so here's the thing what do you do now you want to make money okay because if you want to make money make the biggest fight you can right now while he's been exposed and the biggest fight for sure is when I say expose I don't mean he's not talented I mean exposed meaning he's a human and he can lose and that happens with every fighter they lose and once they lose people go oh you can be beat you know we saw it with Anderson Silva you saw with Mike Tyson when after Mike Tyson fought Buster Douglas it was a different world everybody was like oh oh he's human so I say exposed not in a disrespectful way but got exposed he lost get choked out he got beaten up on the ground and then he got choked out quick so this is not an invulnerable perfect fighter who's unbelievably durable right who can take punishment like no man there's a lot of those guys in the UFC there's champions like that in the UFC that like Robbie Lawler unbelievably durable you can't put him a way it's fucking hard to put that guy away we're not talking about that we're talking about a guy who got dinged up shot for a shitty wide open takedown got taken down got demolished on the ground and got choked unconscious quickly afterwards so all right what do you do could that happen with dos Anjos fuck yeah it could dos on just could do that too it's possible I mean Conor might not come out you never know Conor does have that punch but you gotta put him in against Nate again because that's the big-money rematch and if if this guy turns out to be a guy who's gonna win some and lose some and the beginning of his career this unbeatable wild Celtic Warrior character right that's all gone but he's champ he still got a belt at 145 yeah so it's almost kind of a right a weird position for now but I mean here's my question is when I say for now can you really keep making that wait that's what I'm saying well I I've wondered about that too I've had some people have argued with me saying like no he can make the weight because he was he was was in 169 against Nia so they're saying he basically that's what he starts at he can just cut down from there that's a lot but look what he looked like at the at the weigh-in so maybe you can I mean he kind he definitely can do it it's physically possible I was so looking forward to the press conference though just because I can't you know you've got this guy in Connor who's like the ultimate shit talker and then you've got Nate who I mean the first the dynamic at the first press conference was amazing yeah it was amazing and at that moment when he was just like kind of talking circles around Nate and they just broke and he goes how about this fuck you fuck your belt fuck this press conference like they just went to hang stir on him yeah but now like how can Connor I was so interested like how can he show up and talk shit like that yeah when Nate's got the perfect rebuttal that anything he has to say I beat John this today's cosmic saying all kinds of crazy stuff like the first eight minutes were easy yeah oh by mmm yeah but here's the difference between the first day the last three minutes the last three were a lot worse yeah they were awful like you got fucked up man you got to just accept that but that's part of his thing is that he has to like look at things in the most positive light possible and man I don't know I think stylistically it's a troublesome fight for him because Nate is a very clever boxer and his ground game is a world away from where Connor is right now and I've seen Nate roll with guys he's a fucking legit very high-level Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt under a very respected camp his cardio is outstanding his boxing is nasty so where's Connor shining the only way I think I mean I guess there's a you know it's really hard to like fight a Diaz brother and beat them usually when people beat them it's kind of like they're they really stick to a strategy you got to kind of take them down and avoid submissions or like leg kick and circle like dos Anjos beat them up in that way but you know what there's also different show up well there's also you know different camps you know you're coming in who knows what kind of fucking injuries you're dealing with you know you see a guy like Nate come in and look really kind of lackadaisical against half of those on just den you see him come back and look shredded against Michael Johnson and look sensational so you go okay that's what he's capable of when he's on and focused you got to be ready for that guy and I think yeah that's the best he's ever look at Michael Johnson fight yeah you can't think that the guy who lost dos Anjos is showing up you got to think the guy that came out swarmed cowboy in the first round is coming like that that guy is a clever fucking boxer so where does Conor shine knockout power that's where he shines like Connor can dead dudes yeah but but he couldn't do is yeah they're tough to hit they have great head movement and green chins and they they roll with punches well the only guy to ever stop Nate was Josh Thompson and Josh did it with a brutal head kick and Josh Thompson to this day I say is one of the most underrated guys he just the stars did not align for him but he could have easily been a UFC champion he was champ in a start horse yeah and with Gilbert and him and Gilbert went back and forth you know Josh Thompson's world-class fighters so when Josh Thompson head kicked him you know it's like Josh to do that to anybody in that division if he catches you you know you're fucked he sees the older now and he's just yeah I think he's a guy that like like I said the stars didn't like perfectly aligned for but like skill wise and technique wise he's a fucking world-class fighter so when he knocked out Nate Diaz it's not necessarily an indication that Nate Diaz is done because just you know that's how good Josh Thompson is yeah and at the time and then so Nate rebounds from that and I think people you look at like the losses the dos anjos fight and you look at that the Josh Thompson fight and you go hmm how good is he you know I could beat that guy but then you look at the Michael Johnson fighting Oh whoo that that guy's fucking dangerous Jay Miller Cerrone exact a lot of these fighters just unbelievable yeah uh and I think uh it's one of those things where styles make fights and you know kind of really got in people's heads by talking shit and I felt like going and I was like I think you're gonna get Nate's head by talking shit he's not that guy yeah how about this Mike will fuck up your whole crew that's the most gangster thing you could say by the way that's the most gangster thing cuz he's literally just going will fucking jump you dude not like we're not playing around here yeah and all those guys even the guys who seemed like kind of nice guys and his team like Jake Shields if you like he'll fucking jump you like those guys are a vegetarian it'll kick your ass [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
