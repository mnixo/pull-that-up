Oh three two one Tim Poole you mad man how's it going dude the ride that you made to get here you drove from the other side of the continent in a blackout van well I mean you've had guests on who've driven here yeah I mean I drove here you drove here but it took four days it took four days it's a different kind of drive have you ever done that before oh yeah yeah yeah not in the van but I've driven around the country too many times the Vans pretty dope yeah I told you last year yes I was getting the van and I got a bunch of people on Twitter making fun of me like who's gonna get a bug up van he's crazy I got a van you got a bug out van was living that thing Oh totally dude this the solar power on it yeah last you forever that's pretty amazing I didn't know that you could power everything so you have a solar power roof panels that is is it less effective in like Jersey where it's cloudy right now you know Tom yeah how much difference is it ones cloudy I mean several orders of magnitude yeah yeah it like barely work I mean it works it works it works well enough but right here works great right here the Sun is so intense and just gnarly you go outside you can feel on your skin hmm yeah my solar things like your good forever don't worry like turn the a/c on full blast really if so if I run the a/c on full blast it will probably last if I start when the Sun comes up and it may be like I don't know 14 hours wow that's that's that that's intense though man AC if I use just the fan ticket circulation I can play playstation I can watch movies I can turn the music on full blast and you can probably with AC you can probably turn it on and off as the temperature goes up and down yeah and the fan is is it insulated at all oh man like crazy yeah yeah yeah these guys I was trying to find somebody to help me modify this thing for a while I think when I was here last time I had the van but was empty and then I found these guys in in Jersey they do like they do police modification stuff like gun racks and you know like seats and I guess because the van life thing started getting big they III did a Google search I couldn't find anyone man life thing yeah van life man what are you talking about so on YouTube van life was this big trend I think it's kind of waning a little bit but there was one woman who got like two million subscribers and one video because she in her van with her pet snake or something like that oh she's probably hot is she hot she's younger I think so I haven't actually seen the video so I'm like making the assumption that you know that makes us make a YouTube video you're a single female in a van you know and I think the video was like here's how I shower so naturally oh you go good move yeah but there's a four million views yeah yeah these guys over where I live I guess I couldn't find anybody to do this the wait lists are crazy like they're pro companies that do van modification eight-month wait period really yeah so I went on google maps of all places just because I was like maybe maybe that's my problem I typed in van modification and two miles from me boom this guy pops up and he does him and his company they did modifications for local police departments unlike SWAT van surveillance vans and things like that I wonder if I'm supposed to be saying that probably not finally not but I tell you to keep your mouth shut no actually he was like yeah I'll let people know we do this work you know what's the name of the company diversified vehicle systems I think man if I got that name where I'm gonna feel so bad well CPU fine Jim yeah diversified vehicle system sound or or services yeah and its he's got cool photos of like SWAT vans and stuff I'm stuck too dude you know he ought to be out that thing's amazing it is interesting that you can power everything from the solar panels you can power your monitors because you have it set up in there we have monitors and lights you have cameras what kind of did you have an internet connection I use my phones but but there is there is on the roof this thing called a wine guard and have 5g on your phone right yep oh yes sir here it is diversified vehicle services that's him that's quick that's master interior before the van hesita okay yeah you're making this guy's week good cool good for him he's cool dude yeah so how long did it take for them to trick it out I think it took like a maybe three weeks to a month and then melt super confident to drive that thing all the way across the country totally was he weird at all uh no I was pretty awesome was there any spots you stopped in you're like what in the fuck like hour Barstow Stipe type areas there was just because like the pandemic and all well the pandemic and they're weird already I've driven across this country too much and I've purposefully in the past have driven through really weird parts like off of interstate highways I've been at some pretty crazy place I've been in one motel that once looked like used to be a prison or something you used to be a prison they turned out no I'm just saying it looked like like there's no windows there's just like those block windows you can't see through with like the weird wavy glass I had no idea what the building used to be but it was a motel now it looked like I was in a meat locker or something but there was there's one town I think it was in New Mexico I don't want to say the name cuz I get it wrong but they put up a sign saying no one's allowed in no but a whole town the whole town was because of those and damn it yep no one's allowed can you do that it said no visitors no business something like that it said it's like residents only it's not legal I don't think it is that's weird right a lot of this stuff is like what what is legal as far as like as far as lockdowns what's legal is it completely up to the their this is a debate right now right whether or not it's completely up to the governors whether it's the mayors have individual liberty in whatever town and I mean I'll tell you what sounds like the Constitution doesn't exist right now well I wouldn't go that far there's definitely some protections let's put it this way let's be as generous as possible protections that are in place to shield the vulnerable people from the pandemic but a lot of folks feel like there's some overstepping and there's a problem with Powerman if you give power to people they do not like to give it back they always think it's better with me in charge yeah that's what there was one documentary I saw a long time ago some activists went to like the the CEO of shell and he talked to him and he was like listen you got to understand I'm trying my hardest with me at the helm I'm doing such good things for the environment they always think they're the benevolent dictator that's why I think decentralization is so much more important in in so many different aspects like yeah that is a weird trait that human beings have when they get into a position like that right but the type of person who would want to be a governor to begin with the type of person that would want to run the entire state yeah I don't I don't I don't trust any individual to have good intentions well I should say they do have good intentions but I don't trust them to actually know what's best for everybody there's no way you can I mean just to be able to be accurate about all the different predictions in this this regard you know when you're talking about this pandemic thing I've one of the biggest problems I'm looking at is who determines what's essential and what's not essential yeah weed stores are essential so we heard it like in Michigan for instance they were closing off certain parts of certain stores did you hear about this No so a lot of people took it because there were photos of seeds at Walmart or something where there's like tape saying you can't you know this part of the store is closed and so the story went out that you weren't allowed to buy seeds anymore no story actually was that stores over 50,000 feet had to close off non-essential areas like flooring and gardening and things like that and who's to determine what is and isn't essential about any of those services particularly gardening I mean if there's a time where you want to have your own food readily available in your back yard and at the time well even think about just general hardware if they're gonna shut that down what if you what if hole breaks up in your floor you know your kid falls through or something yeah that fixed yeah I mean that's that's a serious safety issue so you've got these governors determining what is essential and what isn't I heard a good argument for keeping liquor stores open because I was like come on liquor stores but someone said actually it is to prevent people from going into detox from having problems detoxing where they would take up a hospital bed that we need potentially need because of the virus I that make sense I also think about the reality of you take away booze in a time of a crisis yeah and you're gonna see people's nerves snap real quick have you seen the video of this guy jogging down the street he examines everybody's recyclables it's all filled with vodka bottles and tequila and whiskey and wine and so it goes from house to house he's like let's see what they've been up to oh well people are so stressed out they're just getting hammered yeah that's me liver damage when this is all a lot of horses - yeah I heard that's that's going up Oh your people and domestic abuse and /or and suicide here's here's the prediction I made you know very early on I was talking to my friends actually I think I said this what they're gonna do they're gonna say we're only gonna keep things closed until April 12th and that's what Trump said at first Easter we're gonna come open up and I said about a week before they're gonna say no we gotta push it back sure enough April 30th then May 15th now it's June 1st they're even first for who we just I think New York just announced they said June first yeah but I think they said they're gonna start May 15th with outside of New York City right there's not that Cuomo said I'm not entirely sure but feel like you said there I do know a lot of jurisdictions have slowly entered you know the phase one there was that Trump argument with with camp and in Georgia about going too fast and stuff like that yeah so I guess you know people starting to realize if you don't open things up there's nothing to save right right what's what's freaking to me about all of this is the tribalism behind whether or not we should reopen the economy or stay locked down it's connected to everything right what do you mean the tribalism it's can I totally yeah it's it's it's so you know I had a friend messaging me saying we're stupid people who want haircuts are gonna get us all killed and they're going on protesting and and the first thing I'm like you really don't think just because one guy was holding that dumb science what everyone is thinking right now that's not the case but what's crazy to me is you had the UN a UN adviser come out and say we're looking at a hundred and thirty million people are going to starve because of the economic shutdown and that's gonna be much worse potentially than the actual pandemic itself and these kind of facts are ignored because of the tribalism but what's happening you know Trump tweets it out therefore it's an outright left you know conservative whatever I don't think they know exactly what to do I mean I think there's some educated decisions that are being made by medical professionals and then they have to adjust those based on new statistics that come in and I don't know if they have adjusted like the the initial idea was that there was an X amount of people that were infected in California yeah it turns out there's many many many more and the most recent thought is that there's somewhere around 400,000 now there has been some dispute about these studies you know whether or not these studies are accurate whether or not the tests are accurate whether or not you could get it again whether or not even matters if you've already had it you might be able to get it again but there's no adjustments and no one's saying hey this is way less deadly than we thought it was going to be you know there is this sounds like the problem of government yeah I've never been one of these small government types I'm you know as much as people might want to argue it with me I lean a little bit left and a lot of issues like government programs I think are good things it just seems like whenever the government something it's so slow to fix it if it goes bad or when things change right so slow to adjust if they need to shift back they tend to just dump more money into it if it's not working properly I want to know why some people just shake this off that's to me the most for this it almost seems like you're dealing with more than one virus it's like you're dealing with a bunch of different versions of a virus I think you are I think they've they've said they found multiple strains like that it changed a little bit or something hmm I don't want to know for sure I know they did say that about India they said that the the strain that they have in India is apparently very different than the strain they're experiencing in Europe yeah I think some I heard something similar about like Washington they found two strains liberal and conservative strains yeah yeah yeah it's the crazy thing to me is the people a lot of Trump supporters I don't want to blanket every single one but there's some high-profile ones that are really acting like since the beginning they've doubted at every step of the way and I'm like have you looked at the spike charts if you know here's what I say if in New York City we're seeing thousands more dead what are they dying of if not some kind of you know infection I mean you can call whatever you want you can act like nothing's going on but we're seeing huge spikes at camp attention to them there's fools no matter what you do there's always gonna be fools so you know it's obviously a real virus it's obviously real dangerous it's the little tribalism yeah it's foolish but it's you know you know you got to just dismiss that stuff you can't even debate or dwell on it but what's interesting to me is well there's a bunch of parts that are interesting but what's interesting to me is like who like George is opened right and then parts of Montana of opens there's things that are open in Texas yeah like it's gonna be interesting to see what the response is going to be whether or not they come back online quicker and their economy builds up quicker or whether or not they get a second surge and they've shut down longer and it winds up being that maybe should have waited longer and when add less infection like we just saw a city of 10 million in China enter lockdown again did this to what degree I'm not entirely sure but they've announced they're you know reopening all the social distancing measures and certain closures and stuff like that and they're saying it's because someone a student I think they're saying a student from the u.s. came back course they're saying that right right right reignited but there's also a bunch of studies now about reinfection you know it's water we don't know and everyone's freaking out whenever there's a new disease and everybody's got a scramble in real time to try to figure out what the fuck to do about it and well just weird it out everybody's weirded out you know no one knows like what is normal now what is what is reality the reality we live in like you see movies now when people hug or shake hands and you're like ah what are you doing I've been watching these commercials you see these commercials they're all the same where it's like it's like we're all in this together and then it shows people banging pots and pans and it's like we may not be able to hug anymore but the love is there it's like all identical but then all of a sudden older commercial pops up and I was watching this the other day and it's like a guy walks up shakes his buddy's hand pat him on the back and then like gives his wife a kiss on the cheek and I'm like that's an old commercial that is I can tell it's an old campaign yeah cuz they would not do that most of them are old because you can't shoot anything anymore yeah you know I don't know how i'm curious how they're doing these commercials where they film new york i guess they're going out in new york and filming people actually you know cheer from their balconies and stuff huh look you know i think there's a real there's a real tough question know that a lot of people want to ignore i think there's a lot of trump supporters who are pushing it because they're in favor of reopening the economy but there's like that equation of it what point is having things shut down more damaging then you know so at a certain point we have to recognize people can die no matter what we do well there's a bloomberg not not the mayor but there's a bloomberg statistic on the economy that measures the downside like when when the economy goes down how many people die because of it and you could kind of trace it it's it's very disturbing and when we're talking about deaths we're talking about there's something that we can immediately deal with it's right in front of us it's a disease it's happening right now go after it stop it but the secondary reaction to that in fact because you're closing the economy might wind up killing as many people as you're trying to avoid being killing in the wall yeah so I don't know they you went the big story on the UN was that their advisor said 235 million starving you know in the next year so unless things kick back into gear well hopefully they are going to take back in the year California's supposed to open up on May 15th but the governor has been I don't know if he enjoys it but it seems like he seems like they they definitely are comfortable with being the person they get to say yeah this is shut down and we're gonna keep it shut down the authoritarianism is scary we're the resting people for fucking going to the park with their kids yeah you see that tweet from the UK where they posted the shadows of the two cops and it was like think going into a rural area to have a picnic is you'll get away with it we're gonna look out of the shadows and find you know where to god yeah yeah when do I run what you're in the middle of no having a picnic go for it here's the thing man they told fucking China shit in totally that is like fuck man well now there is another story Bill Gates apparently said you know trying to did a bunch of things right and now what they're doing is they're taking that quote and putting it next to pictures of them welding doors shut and barricading and when I'm hanging out with Epstein Oh probably that's the latest thing is begin really don't like okay well these people are sending me all these videos about Bill Gates now I used to party with Epstein a lot of people did yeah I wonder how many of them knew apparently traveled with Epstein after Epstein had been convicted oh man yeah he apparently like a couple years after he'd been convicted it wasn't like you didn't know about it right right have you seen Bill Gates Instagram no all the comments just flooded with people saying like globalists and Illuminati kind of stuff that's gonna hurt about that I hear it's a lot of pedophile stuff too right there I don't know I don't want to I know this is gonna be really touchy because you got a lot large with really angry people but they're saying things like take your vaccines back we don't want them we won't wear the mark of the beast you know a man he's talked about you know what China did they're they're giving you these codes on your phone mm-hmm and you got it if you want to leave if you leave the town it becomes void I know so if you're in the city then you can go to a building they scan it to see if you're clear and if you are then you're able to come in you know fuck all that seriously I think I you know man the amount of people I've seen argue in favor of this executive you know these are these executive orders is pretty scary yeah I've been scared about that we've been talking about that quite a bit lately where I'm saying you you can't have massive overreaching government surveillance as a response to a disease you can't because they're not gonna shut it off once the disease has a vaccine they're gonna keep that stuff in place and you are giving up a massive part of what it means to be an American well take me free take a look at the the social media what's going on with you know Twitter Facebook they you the CEO of YouTube we'll start there set on on CNN basically anyone who says anything out of line with the World Health Organization is a bit expandable it's against our Community Guidelines the World Health Organization is flip-flop back and forth you know like several times on well they're clearly spouting out Chinese propaganda to protect particularly in January when they were saying that according to China there's no evidence that you could be transmitted from person to person and did you know the AP reported at that time China knew and withheld the information for six days so the day that the World Health Organization tweeted out no evidence according to China of human human transmission we now know according to the AP that China did no and purposefully withheld that you what you've got going on with China right now I question whether or not we're getting close to an act of war and I know that might be a little exaggerated but they've got you know this is the story was published in BuzzFeed news trolls working either for China or than China trying to slow down the response in other regions like Spain Italy Taiwan I think I think that the buzz be most specifically about Taiwan sowing disinformation so it would slow their response things like that why well I think China wants Taiwan right well that they don't that was they're a rogue provinces that they consider it yeah well that's why they instructed the World Health Organization not even mention the name Taiwan you saw that video videos crazy weather the head of the World Health Organization is being interviewed and in the interview the woman asks him about Taiwan's response and he says I think China has done a great job right and then first he ignores yes and then he hangs up yeah he hung up but he did say China and she said Taiwan and specific and yeah I think that's when he hung up on and then he came back said well and she goes what's get back to question well I think we've already covered it China's done a great job like he's clearly avoiding but why does he think he can do that like what what what does China have on them money is it fun is it kind of funding them I mean you saw what happen with the NBA and like desert you know people don't want to give that cold hard cash they're making a bold bet you know and I mean you know through Citadis trap is know so this is I was reading about this the Atlantic wrote about this in 2015 are we headed for a war with China and the city's trap says that whenever a growing power seeks to upset the dominant power it results in war and out of 12 out of 16 times of the past 500 years it has happened so people have been predicting a us-china war for a really long time because of this historical precedent it's not absolute but it looks like I'm not gonna put on the historical expert or anything like that but it looks extremely probable to me I've had a lot of people get mad at me saying that I was fear-mongering by bringing this up but the u.s. just sent two warships into the South China Sea which China considers their own territory when you look at what China has been doing in terms of misinformation clearly lying about the numbers that you know there I can't rubber who did this I think may have been Germany removing China's numbers from the charts saying they're not real so China has been misleading the rest of the world withholding information on how by the infection is they sent a strike group an aircraft carrier through the South China Sea near Taiwan putting Japan on alert the us's aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt was disabled because of the corona virus they evacuate 8% of the personnel the US doesn't what they call an elephant walk in Guam where they have all these bombers then the u.s. pulls him out because apparently China's got some kind of weapon that can just blanket Guam and wipe out our forces next thing I know we sent a kind of weapon they know they can do that it's I'm not entirely sure I'm you know I'm getting my information from just rating peripheral stories I'm not a military ro no got any thought that but it really does you know so the u.s. just sent two warships into the South China Sea and I think they're doing this because one of the things I read from a military website was that the strike force is testing us resolve the last time that China has done this where they sent a strike force around Taiwan actually tried to you know take it in some fashion the u.s. sent a couple super carriers and everything calmed down now our super carriers in the region were disabled by kovat well didn't China didn't they go into a group exercise with Iran after we killed that guy oh I don't know yeah there was a group exercise with China and Iran in the sea that they did something like some sort of show of unity right after Trump had that guy's ass intended do you see what happened with those Iranian gunboats they were swarming us the US naval vessels and then Trump ordered them if they do it again sink him blow him up Wow do you know that Venezuela tried commandeering a civilian yacht a couple weeks ago what Venezuelan naval ship crashed into a German owned private cruise liner they were trying to count as my understanding of the story because I know a lot of people are they're not gonna want to ride that analysis out they were trying to steal it so they claimed healin yeah they so I think the official word from Venezuela was they thought this was a fake cruise ship with assassins for Maduro or something so they ordered it to come into their their waters because they weren't Venezuela Venezuelan naval ships are ramming it sank itself yeah I heard about that yeah yeah and so then sometime after Donald Trump deploys two US naval vessels to near venez what near Venezuelan waters which he says are for drug related operations I'm not gonna like I know I'm a lot of people gonna get heated saying you know you're talking about yeah yeah all I know is that's what was reported who knows what that means or what leads to but needless to say with it you know look Russia's withholding wheat exports several European countries have have closed their borders within the Schengen area their withhold their people are trying to hoard food and we just had a full-page ad in in the New York Times Sunday edition I think was from Tyson saying the food supply chain is breaking and we're getting ready for a major shortage of food you know they had a killed two million chickens Wow because they didn't have anybody to butcher them here's what here's here's my concern when you have these nation-states shoring up their borders even within the European Union that was crazy to me when you see Germany and France and Austria closing their borders to each other then you get these warships making these movements you get people desperate for food you see Venezuela ramming into a cruise ship I say this it could be that we're hyper focused on it because we're bored we don't only pay attention to the stuff we normally pay attention to celebrity gossip in politics now that we're not doing anything we're really focused I was happening in international territory or perhaps it's that we're getting desk and were scared as the economy tanks well if it wasn't for mutually assured destruction I would say yeah we're probably moving into a place of war but you have two nuclear superpowers like China and the US it's like what you know what do they do what are you gonna do you're gonna one guy gotta launch a missile the other guys gonna launch them and so like what are they gonna do yeah are they gonna go into a full-scale warm wipe out everyone on the planet cuz that's what would happen I think so I do the thing is who would be more willing to wipe out a giant chunk of the population would it be China or would it be the United States I don't think it'd be the United States I think it'd be China and I think it really depends on how strange they are for resources and whether or not they're really going to lose the the the the difficult look in China when this broke out what we saw videos of them barricading people in their homes welding their doors shut yeah the doctor whistleblower there's one story of Iran a journalist was calling out all of these things disappears for a month comes back a month later all happy like governments great we love them really yeah we know we know what they do we've seen we've seen videos now this could be propaganda you know cuz I'm in America so of course I'm getting this information maybe the u.s. is trying to you know build us up but I think you take a look at that kind of behavior the willingness to do anything by any means necessary and at what point do you get one person is in charge saying I will not be the captain of a ship that sinks you know I look - well I don't want to get super political in American history but I view it as you've got a leader of a country and as people are looking at him he says this will be the year my country ceases to exist if that presses a button I will not be the lead you know I will not be the person with its stain it's hard to know though because it could be a leader saying I will not be the person who destroys the world I would rather go down in history as the you know failure of my country I I think you back somebody into a corner and you get fighter flight I don't trust chumps Trump's decision-making in that regard either no I don't you know I just I don't trust anybody's decision-making but anybody who won't admit that he said one thing when we saw this infection maybe I know the fact that he said he was being sarcastic that was so dumb and if you're that same person and we want you to be in charge of this decision whether or not we go to war I mean obviously you have to have the support Congress but this but you know this this is you know the the the disinfectant story is the one of the weirdest and most difficult things to actually grasp I think you just got caught rambling that's it yep setup so a South Park where Cartman pretends like he has Tourette's so so Cartman finds out that people with Tourette's just say all these things so he's like if I pretend to have this I can say whatever I want and then eventually he loses his filter and starts saying a bunch of ridiculous things like he starts admitting to like you know touching his cousin or something camp and he's like why am I saying this oh no I've lost my filter Donald Trump that's what he here's how I see it he heard something from these experts he didn't understand it he has no filter and so he just asked this thing here's here's my challenge with it is there such thing as a stupid question yes there is can you eat glass right that's a stupid question well I don't some like performers eat glass they don't really know really well so he chew up candy glass yeah here's here's this here's the struggle here's a struggle what is it disinfectant how do you interpret what he said and here's what Trump supporters immediately fired back with there is h2o to nebulization therapy and they they pulled up an article from it was posted msn.com April tenth one of the treatments they're looking at for kovat is to take hydrogen peroxide through a nebulizer into your lungs that's a disinfectant into your body for a cleaning I don't think Trump was going for that I think the guy mentioned we have bleach and alcohol in Trump was like I wonder if you could you know possibly get in their body through the addiction as a clean and yeah I'm right look well what's really interesting that came out of this was Twitter banned an account that is a publicly traded biotech account that has a legitimate therapy you know when someone has been incubated when they've been when they're on a respirator they can send UV light through that tube and actually kill some of the bad bacteria in the lungs now the the video that shows how they do it shows like the tube and this likes an animated thing which shows the lungs they banned them right they banned a publicly traded biotech company just just I don't know if they banned them because they think that in some way this supports what Trump was saying or if someone just pulled the trigger too quickly I mean who's doing this over here I think you have a bunch of fucking kids that are making decisions whether or not something gets banned or not something gets reported like someone report I'm just guessing some reports that says look these fucking idiots are saying that Donald Trump's right you can get light in there ban it make it count okay we set here yes with Jack and Vidya Vidya and I don't think we got a definitive answer necessarily we got a you know thank you for your feedback I think we got an answer in terms of what Jack wants in terms of he I think Jack is a legitimately honest guy who is trying to manage things at scale and I think that's almost impossible I don't think she or numbers that are coming in and he's trying to do wild-west Twitter now this is his concept of having a Twitter that's just wide open we could do anything and then having like a regular sort of moderated Twitter there's a there's a name I can say right now a name if I say a name right now Candyman this this video will be pulled from YouTube do you know that really I can say one guy's name Alex Jones no I'm not don't don't say it if you know it is don't say it I'm not gonna start with I don't think I should even do that really I've had my video taken down and I've been told to write it down he wrote its own form you sure yeah right yeah just write it down if you say this name your video will be taken out they take it on c-span they've taken down Fox News really I'm Hitler no I'm warning enough say this name the company's been unsuspended if you will unsuspended for that so yeah so somebody probably fucked up there's probably a kid that my handwriting is awful that's okay do not say that name I'm not kidding with you man do not say that name I don't even know who that is he is the he's a I can I can scram to you he's a CIA he worked he worked for the CIA I guess he is accused of being the whistleblower the Ukraine whistleblower oh and if you say his name you will get taken down wow this is that so that seems like how come how come news will get you taken down yeah makes you wonder right how come a biotech company with a legitimate product gets taken down now you got yourselves a restored yeah I think that biotech company somebody fucked up I think I think you have too much I think from what Adam curry was explaining to me is that there's a bunch of kids that work for Twitter and they work for a lot of these other companies and they're there were the ones responsible for whether or not something gets banned if something gets taken down you know the zubi story the okay dude story right right which is just bonkers let's look for people so this can be standalone zubi who is a British guy we've talked about this on the podcast where he's been a guest in the podcast he's a rapper very very intelligent interesting guy doesn't even swear he's very polite he's a really nice guy so he gets in some sort of an interaction with someone on Twitter and this person says I bet I sleep with more women than you he says okay dude that's it he got a new hand banded for a long period of time like weeks or whatever the fuck it is I don't know how long you get suspended for something like that but then he asked for it to be reviewed and they upheld it yeah they said yes you can't say oh okay dude no I don't know if he was talking to a trans woman didn't either yeah he didn't either yeah I know it he didn't know is that what it is is that what the case was I that's my understanding of the story yeah well he didn't even know right he just saw someone and said okay dude you know what the problem is this idea of approved truth what YouTube calls authoritative sources so I know I'm pretty hard on YouTube but this doesn't involve Facebook as well that name I sent you this book will delete your post without notice if you type it Wow so here's what I did tried it I typed I just I I said something like I heard of a man from Dubuque an orthodontist named who has five kids and he's in his mid-50s I did that because that in no way describes who that person is right not not only do Facebook delete it they deleted it without telling me it was just erased from the site gone so it's some sort of filter that's in place no no somebody manually did it it was there for a while and then somebody came in or somehow so so do you know what happened with CNN Chris Cuomo getting--getting kovat you know they faked that whole thing right what do you mean they faked it so Chris Cuomo was spotted 30 minutes from his house on a property with a new cut with a new construction being built yes a steel frame a guy on a bike saw him Chris Cuomo they got into it como goes on his radio show and says I don't want this jackass on a fat tire bike coming up to me I should tell him what I want the guy in the bike says he called the cops and said he threatened me so this basically confirms the encounter Chris Cuomo then then shot a segment for CNN of him emerging from his basement like this is what I've been dreaming of finally getting out of my basement see my kids but he was witnessed seeing his kids somewhere else with his kids yeah so you even had that you even had Ben Smith the New York Times call this out saying he Ben Smith used to be the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed news now he's a media columnist for an airtime said something The effect of it's it's like shocking how CNN is aligning this whole controversy there they're kinda like it didn't happen everybody knows Cuomo faked it yeah he wasn't in quarantine he was out presumably he was at two women and three kids so we can we can assume it was his wife and his kids whatever I bring that up because you got a couple other moments right you've got brian Stelter on you on his show saying that we got to channel the anger for the people yeah that he was saying that journalists need to do that yep which is which is you know I basically said so you're admitting your rage bait you know yes I saw you did that I was glad that you said that like finally they're admitting it right right right I mean look it's no secret I'm gonna rag on on the media I worked for these companies and I've seen them slowly getting worse and worse with everything I want to see Brian scream you want to see Brian scream yeah I think like him enraged would be a dog like I don't I wonder how much anger he can muster I can't I can't so what so here's a point I was getting to CNN's called an authoritative source yeah they're lying in our faces I mean you just had the Joe Biden thing for I don't know if you've talked about this yet but if you go to google play and look up Larry King's show from 1993 you will see there so actually I checked many of the different months what people noticed was that one episode was missing August 11th 1993 the episode where Joe Biden's accuser called in saying my daughter had a problem with a prominent senator knows Joe Biden's what accusers mom because yeah what did I say I said accuser all right yeah his accuser is his mom write that up so it's gone yes so I went through google play and there's certainly were other episodes that were presumably missing typically mondays where I was soon I would assume that you know Larry King had a day off or something the 11th was a Wednesday why was this missing why did CNN why were they scooped on their own story they had this evidence apparently this was this was news so when you look at what CNN's been doing admitting that they're doing rage journalism you get people like Jim Acosta but isn't that like what Brian said what's brian Stelter Stelter Stelter isn't he just that is that this his own opinion you know i mean it's not that they're admitting that they're doing rage journalism it's he's saying that they should do that right isn't that what it was how'd he set it on twitter right yeah yeah it was somewhat from his show was it I'm a thank you I think was reliable sources tweeting it out yeah and you know look I may be hyperbolic or whatever cuz I got my opinions on CNN and all that but take a look at someone like Jim Acosta he stands up he argues with the president that's not what journalist was supposed to do you know if you want to ask the president question he gives you an answer if he if you have the opportunity for a follow-up you do and then you write your story and you fact check them you write your story and say Donald Trump here's what he told us here's the truth that's what journalists used to do now you've got this idea of channeling the rage for the people what that means is it's something I've seen in activist circles where I was explained to me that what people are looking for is someone to strike down a symbol of what they view as their enemy or the cause of their problems so the reasons why someone like Jim Acosta would do so well he would get so many followers constantly doing this it's not that he's asking any real questions or actually challenging the president it's that the people who don't like Trump see him as striking a symbol down it doesn't matter if he's telling you the truth or not now you get performative journalism where Chris Cuomo pretends to come out of his basement where you know you get people standing up with the White House Correspondents or at the press conference is just arguing instead of actually asking questions and then YouTube Facebook and Twitter say this is the truth we deem it so YouTube now puts them among other outlets on the front page of the website guaranteeing hundreds of millions of views meanwhile independent commentators like myself we actually get hurt in the algorithm if you go to my channel they only show you fox news if you want to watch me then you are guaranteed in the sidebar the next we'll be foxnews they prop up all of these channels David Pakman for instance you get MSNBC Jimmy Dore Fox News I don't understand why they're gonna send Jimmy's you know lefty followers to Fox News but they're doing seemingly everything their power to make sure individuals like myself and other commentators are struck down while channels like CNN Fox and MSNBC are propped up even though we know that they put out fake news but isn't that but because of the algorithm though and do you think that algorithm is engineered it wasn't towards those mainstream so absolutely we can see we can see when it happened it was May of last year you looked at my analytics around the time these smear pieces came out arguing that there was a rabbit hole where if you watch one kind of contents all you get mm-hmm it's a very very misleading way of framing what was really going on and I'm surprised that YouTube just bent over for this you basically have YouTube's competition these media outlets using their media wait to hurt YouTube in ad sales so YouTube says you got it we'll give you front page access we'll guarantee you you know people watch your content right but they're doing that because that content is very popular and that generates ad revenue well are why would out I would say no actually I would argue against that well okay but listen like Tucker Carlson for example you ought to know he's hugely popular absolutely if you have a tucker carlson video that's gonna generate millions of views absolutely so youtube within their best interests I'm talking about Allison Cammarata is anybody really google searching you on YouTube Allison camarones opinion on all day I don't think so I think I don't know who that is right exactly and so you wouldn't be searching for it Tucker of course we know all right so you're saying it's the the channel in general not just someone who's popular like Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson they as very famous personalities very obviously do get you know more get more naturally yeah so people are searching for Tucker all day and night Hannity and Rachel Maddow things like that right but if you if you look at house what YouTube has even said to CNN they prop up authoritative sources yes if you search for a new story guess who you're gonna get if you google search you know taro Reed Joe Biden you're gonna get CNN do you doing that though because they're trying to get rid of conspiracy theories yes yeah that's right reason yeah they're trying to get like I understand what they're saying in terms of so like the CEO of YouTube when she said that they're gonna go with the World Health Organization I don't think it's a good idea to go with the World Health Organization cuz it seems like it's a very corrupt organization but I do understand this desire to go towards respected and establish medical professionals respected and established medical professionals have a protocol for dealing with coronavirus we should listen to them right yeah absolutely and there's a lot of wacky fucks online that are trying to say that it's not a real virus and that it's 5g and there's like all that kind of stuff is dangerous you know what they told me don't you think absolutely absolutely but they told me they publish that etheral guidelines very early on I did a video about this January 23rd when they first started locking down I did a segment talking about what's going on and I actually didn't think it was a big deal this was before anybody was really covering it I mean this is young Pietschmann was happening and YouTube fully monetized it can so I'm I have a thing on YouTube called self-certification where when I upload a video they ask me does your video contain any of the following my videos are always clean family friendly I don't swear and I was approved video monetized a week later they implemented a new change without tongue anyone anything anyone talking about coronavirus was instantly d monetized D ranked possibly had your video is harder to find things like that and it wasn't until about a couple weeks ago they overturned these D rankings on my channel they told me before they published the guidelines you cannot say these things one of which was that it may have emerged from a bio lab now we have on April I think I think was a 16th a former Clinton administration NSC staffer saying that Occam's razor suggests the most likely place that this came from was breaking out of an bio lab it was a story by Bret Baier over Fox News where he said according to sources he has who have overseen the documents they believe that China was trying to essentially prove their their their worth with American bio research by racing to do this development and there was a breach and this resulted in in the covert outbreak that's that's Fox News and CNN CNN's run run multiple segments saying this when I talk about it I get D ranked do you monetize confirmed they say you can't talk about the stem CNN Ken they're authoritative you can't even if I use them as a source even if I say like so if I what I try to do is you know way the sources how good are they bret baier that's a good source I mean Bret Baier is one of the last true news people I don't I'm not somebody who follows him too much but he's a straight news guy he put his name on this and that that says a lot to me you don't gotta like the guy you like Fox News but CNN also ran the story saying US intelligence now believes or I'm sorry they're investigating whether this claim is it has merit we also had a story from the Washington Post that asked the same question even got a professor from Rutgers University to say it's very possible the story actually emerged because at south china universe was I think South China University in Beijing released a paper saying that somebody was doing experiments on bat bats with coronavirus and one of the bats spilled blood on him and peed on him and he had a self quarantine for 14 days being that the Wuhan CDC I think it's a CDC is about you know 300 meters away from though from the food market it seems like that was a likely scenario they eventually retract that retracted that paper it's a fuckton movie scene totally so look all right it's not it's not me saying it I understand what you're saying but you know what I get I get knocked down for this I understand about it I understand but I think in their defense some of this has to be that they're managing at scale some of this has to be the fact that millions of videos are uploaded every day and they have to keep this dense disinformation from spreading out of control when you have all these fucking nut jobs they're saying this is 5g is uneven a virus it's radiation sickness someone sent me a guy that I really like sent me this video of this doctor that seems like he's got schizophrenia or something he's talking about this is a plasma disease caused by radiation and I'm like oh fuck in Christ he imagined I've gotten so many people hitting me up Jim you got to talk about 5g oh god you know how many people hit me up when 4G came out listen 5g is a thing right it's a it's a new bandwidth for cell phones it's going to be really fast let's go going to be in your phone so the question is like okay all this stuff's flying through the air there's all these signals to the air what effect do they have on the human body that's a good question that's a good question but to say that that's responsible for this coronavirus thing it's fucking crazy totally if you're saying they don't have any effect and here's why I go okay this is why you don't need to be worried about UHF or V or whatever different waves that are flying around through the air Wi-Fi and people are worried about all that kind of shit they're really concerned that this does have some sort of effect on human beings they think that in fact cell phone signals have an effect on bees right that was one of the primary theories about the drop in bee populations yeah colony collapse now these cell phone signals are interfering with these bees ability to communicate but to say that it's the fucking corona virus like Jesus Christ and then someone had a meme little Lil Duval had a meme that he put up on his Instagram and I retweeted it five g's only in five countries you fucks right this guy shit has spread across the whole world he you really think it's five G it's they I believe YouTube has to step in and they have to do something when shit like that is so egregious is so preposterous so the question is where do they draw that line if it would be nice if they could watch all your videos and say oh well today was a really reasonable guy they do okay but yeah they do they really know that yeah they do they really they literally guy who's doing that yes who is a hundred percent dedicated to watching everything you do you put out a lot of fucking kind I do how much content you put out every day so if you had to guess rat an average right now as of the past few months up to about three three hours and forty minutes per day so you got a guy it's dedicated at YouTube his job is what do you do I'm the Tim pool guy I'm just so first probably not like that specific but I do have a partner manager I do have every single video I put out on my foot my mate mama my main channel is reviewed 100% of them on they just recently introduced my other two channels so I have I have a total of three channels under my name where I put out around ten to twelve separate videos per day for a total about three hours and forty minutes they what they do so if I upload a video it gets reviewed through something so I first self-certify I say this video has no swearing it has no you know extreme imagery or anything like that if someone watches it and D monetizes it I then contact Google and they reverse it for me so I actually have someone who fixes this if there's an issue they watch them they watch every episode they watch every episode every episode that bonkers so you got a guy who that's there don't think I don't think it's necessarily one person but a team of freaks my understanding is it is California based and so so here's where I look I'm I think you did a very very awesome thing I wouldn't have a show I'd be working I was working for a Disney company and I did not like it and I was able to leave and start my own business and I'm rather successful with it and it's because of YouTube and it's because they view me as trustworthy they you know I've known them for a long time they've worked with me it's not perfect the challenge is fundamental human rights and in the end the collapse of the media industry when we have news outlets that so it was I give you an example you post this on Instagram that people were calls for poisoning you know disinfectant ingestion had gone up after Trump's comments right that's not true it's fake news I fell for two I tweeted out I tweeted the George George Carlin quote the one that's uh think about how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that sure enough it turns out they faked the story the real story is that since the start of the pandemic people have been buying more cleaner than normal so statistically with more people having cleaner they're more likely now to accidentally ingest it and since March the calls have been going up the New York Daily News one of the main purveyors of the story tacked on after Donald Trump's comments unrelated unrelated unrelated so here's the problem if the Daily News if CNN if if Fox if MSNBC if these outlets are going to do these things in a desperate bid to stay alive as their as their methodology fails and YouTube is going to give them a preferential access which is what they've done then we're in serious trouble but they don't give the Daily News preference no no like a channel the main networks I don't think I Regus right here's here's one that really grossed me out was CNN I believe they tweeted one of the reporters at CNN tweeted that Elon Musk has not supplied all the ventilators that he promised and then Elon said are you aware that Twitter has a search feature and then he starts retweeting all of these different hospitals showing the ventilators people thanking him it has a Tesla logo on it and and and it was the hospitals are requested them specifically and they were specific parameters so you don't CNN did argued semantics the article that was written to to prove they were right was that those aren't ventilators real ventilators are invasive ventilators that go in your body and cpad a CPAP is a ventilator is a ventilator as is a BiPAP what they're called non-invasive or not intrusive that's such a fucking gross way to just decide what you tweeted and so journalists are supposed to help you understand what's going on in them yes not confuse it there the goal of making money right that's what that's what it is right it's about clickbait absolutely you can clickbait that the smartest man in the world fucked up and didn't give the ventilators you want what the scariest thing is CNN anybody's network anyone any of these networks can make a fake story get a million views a day later apologize retract and they keep all the money they made they don't got to give it back so they're actually actively incentivized I'm not saying they're sitting there you know trolling a mustache man like let's write a fake story but they know that if they do they get paid and they less so what they were you know what the fake news gets a million hits the retraction gets 30k we get paid for both so this is an editorial review fail or editors are not reviewing these articles that are being written by journalists I think they're all swimming in a toilet circling you know down to the drain because what happens is somebody so I saw story written I think it was an op-ed for the Washington Post or something about Trump's alligator moat as fake news that was never real alligator moat right right so this story from 2017 that Trump talked about putting alligators in a moat around the southern border or something was like it's ridiculous but here's what happens you write a fake story they wrote that yeah so that was his idea too do that it's been a while my understanding of the story was that a source familiar with you know Trump's thinking said that Trump had discussed an alligator moat and I'm like even if Trump did isn't it obvious it was a joke they take they run their money good luck alligators would it take to guard the southern border thousand miles or whatever but now now we see this pop up again and so I'll tell you what man the scariest thing is how these social the social networks remove like we talked about last year they remove a certain point of view like this biotech company they default on what is authoritative and the authoritative falls in one direction almost every single time Falls left right yes so you know I can't tell you how many how many stories I've gone through where it's like you know that Peter Navarro story where Trump said to the journalist you're a nasty nasty reporter and everything yes what you don't see was the full context where the guy kept goading Trump for like 10-15 minutes and then finally Trump snaps at him and they take that one soundbite and say look at Trump just being a dick it's like well yes Trump's got no filter and he gets mad but they cut out the entire exchange where this dude was poking and prodding and like really just insulting the guy so this guy Peter Navarro he's saying things like why are you trying to give people hope don't you think that offering up false hope is is wrong and Trump's like no I don't think so I think was in cleric win yeah so you get a you get a guy that keeps you know goading him and arguing with them and that's what the point is being earlier it's these people is for CNN and whatever Network have realized hey we're going to get ratings but let me tell you they say first of all that way of communicating is fucking terrible it's second only to the terribleness that in those late-night news shows where they have three different people like with three to the screen separated into three chunks and this person on the right is arguing with this person left and the moderator is trying to keep everybody in order and everyone's talking over everybody and everyone's looking for a soundbite and everyone's looking to get their shots in before the buzzer because there's like a bell coming right the commercial runs it is the dumbest way to really explore a complicated idea right and second only to that is these fucking things where this the president stands the podium and people yell things out someone called it to come flu someone called it to come flu do you do not denounce that this racist word come flu and Trump said who said it yeah I don't know I heard I don't know you know I loved when one of the journalists asked Trump of the price of oil he goes where's it at and the guy says oh I don't know but I know know where's the price of oil the reporter says I don't know then why are you asking next question yeah these people are don't they don't know what their look I've sat in these rooms at press conferences I have I have stood in front of public officials as they prepared an announcement and I know exactly I've talked to these producers I've talked to the journalists they're like ask question what should I ask just just ask anything so they they've I've been thrown in front of people like ask him something I'm like what am I supposed to ask him ask him anything make something up because they want you to get that screen time so they can say it's theirs well it's also someone like Jim Acosta for example don't you think there's an inclination when someone gets a certain amount of attention to lean towards that attention this is your base now these are the people that are supporting you and you find it with like online commentators and where what's really weird is one like a person used to be left and then you see they get them getting a little bit of love from the right and they start like entering over there and their comments and they get more and more attention and then they just jump ship and the inverse like people who were leaning towards more right wing talking points got attacked for it and then immediately came out in support of certain politicians yes yeah yes you see people leaning towards what gets them the most amount of love right and for Jim Acosta like that it seems like he gets a lot of love for attacking this guy because he's talking for them for the people at home I wish I could ask the president what the fuck are you doing there's kind of get him Jim and this is the it's it's and it's it's scary when I go on reddit for instance and they've basically purged 90% of any pro-trump point of view really it's gone man I I pull up I pull up reddit and what do I get it's it's it's all lefty commentary if you go to like our slash politics which has I think you know 5 to 6 million subs they use left-wing activist websites as new sources so it's not a place for real political discussion it's a place to get your biases confirmed the same the same is true for the Donald Trump subreddit which has been basically purged you know they like they used to have a real subreddit called the Donald and then oh yeah they killed it they killed it because they thought that it was filled with trolls right they killed it because they claimed the Trump supporters were threatening cops I'm not joking that's that's the story does that sound a little strange to you that Trump supporters would be anti cop to me in any sense zowie that doesn't make any sense that you would use that as an example for an s to see a necessary move to ban the entire subreddit it seems like so it's not banned what is it it was quarantined quarantine so you can no longer you can no longer search for it the only way to access it is to be subscribed until I give your email they've since abandoned that and created a new website that Donald dot win you go there you're gonna hear only good things about the president and while there are certainly things you'll just like any rational person would disagree with I think a healthy discourse tries you know you want to you want to see the counter points you want to see the positive points you want to better understand you know is there a real reason why Donald Trump did something or is he just an idiot and if you're only getting one side of it your your view of the world is just totally and it used to be like the Wild West right it was pretty wild until like 2016 is very little moderating reddit is so incredibly easy to manipulate and control at ridiculously easy that you know I remember and what year was may be 2015 political operatives were seeking ways to prop up politicians manipulating reddit's algorithms because users have direct control of it I'll just tell you it's ridiculously easy to do like insanely easy they've since made it more difficult but one person with a hamp with it with ten cell phones and you could own the front page of Reddit very very easily that's crazy since then we've seen accusations of and I think it's fair to say you know in my experience I know that this you know tends to exist the sock puppetry when someone runs multiple accounts prying to be different people to create the perception of consensus yes and that's what they do that's really really common super now I know a guy who is a at reddit and told me this one account had nine different people mm-hmm or nine what one person had nine different accounts yeah they were using to attack this guy and you can can so the way right it works for those I don't know is you upvote and downvote something if it has more up votes it moves up if it has more down votes it does it's elite it appears so if you create a bunch of different accounts using proxy servers or you know other IP manipulation you can make sure your post is always in front now was there a concern that the Donalds that the donald reddit site was being manipulated that so that they were basically just using it early on yeah yeah there was a so the donald post would frequently hit the front page of all so if you go to Reddit and you want to see every subreddit the Donald was always on top sometimes it was so active that depends on who you ask right or because people were manipulating it one of the other I it's that there's a good argument for both I don't have the evidence to give you a definitive answer I think it's fair to say that Trump supporters will smash the upload button make sure those posts always fly to the top because they're very enthusiastic very enthusiast it's also possible that somebody had a bot you know botnet that was you know yeah yeah but one of the things that the Donald got in trouble for I think was they would they would do what's called a sticky post so that means if you went there one post was always on top of their page so the supporters knew top-voted guaranteeing it would get a lot of traction but we actually saw this is the craziest thing the CEO of Reddit manipulated in the database someone's comment who was a trump supporter it's actually this is like could you imagine the CEO did this the editor he went into the database the hard database for someone's comment and changed what they said what yeah he apologized for it saying I got new I got angry someone called him a pedo so he was like oh yeah and he went in oh that's right I remembered this he actually edited the words to make that personal piece of shit like anti-trump or something yeah so I'll tell you what man look there's there's a there's a lot of arguments you can make about policy and the right way to solve these problems but I go on the front I go I open reddit I'm browsing through it and I see these comments from pee that clearly do not understand what's going out with these protests that people want the economy to reopen and I try and talk to my friends about it and it seems like they're trapped because I think you know it's like you were mentioning how people drift towards what gets them the most love mm-hmm but now it's not just famous people it's not just people on social media it's everybody who does that and they don't want that worldview broken well they also don't want to lose the respect of their friends who are also subscribing to that same ideology yeah yeah that's it's it's part of politics well over here in California if you're if you're not left-wing if you don't you know just instantaneously when when there's an issue instantaneously side with the left you get chastised and you get called a racist or you could call the Nazi or you called a a Trump supporter or yeah you can't even have a rational perspective on things you can't say something like in hindsight it was a good idea that Donald Trump closed off travel from China because it was coming from there and a lot of people are calling him racist it turned out to be a good move and then they've shut it down from a lot of different places as well you can't say that so so yeah right so the first thing Trump does is the the task force two days later the travel ban Joe Biden says the last thing we need is Trump's is in a phobia then on March I think 12th Trump suspends travel from Europe Joe Biden says a travel ban won't stop this April third Biden says actually Trump was right about that now Joe Biden's launching ads saying Trump didn't go far enough now Nancy Pelosi is saying Trump should have banned Americans from coming back in did you ever see that video when Nancy Pelosi is talking about telling people to go to Chinatown oh yeah it worse that video is fucking insane and when they confront her on it on Fox News I think was Chris Wallace on Fox News was talking to her about it she's saying well the record will show that I was saying don't be rude to Chinese people now you were down there encouraging it yes and the record will show she's such an ineffective speaker it's so bizarre that she got to a position of power because she's right she's so disingenuous and so fake in the way she communicates maybe especially on those shows maybe she's just old maybe she was better before I don't know maybe right that's the Addyson question this is oh man he had the Biden question that dudes not even he's not even here anymore he so weird it's so weird they're pretending that it's okay that this is gonna be fine but the way they're defending him over these allegations is this the creepy thing under whirring the allegation you see Alyssa Milano when she yes what what is this yeah she said deserves due process yeah other times what about all the other people this is it's it's you know I can't predict what's gonna happen there's a lot of things that are changing you know right now that's gonna affect whether or not Trump wins the Republicans win or lose but what about is this weird thing that he wants to do where he wants to insist on a woman of color as a vice presidential nominee wants to I think he said I'm not sure he said woman of color I think he said he's guaranteeing it to me a woman and he's looking at a woman of color I'm not entirely sure to me that's that but that's absurd I mean if you're if you've if you've got a good candidate I think you know it I don't care what they look like what their skin color is their race gender I know a lot of people on the Left view that is like short-sighted because and and I think there's there's decent reasons to talk about how identity plays you know into how you view the world and the policies you want to implement I just think it's dangerous to create that kind of yeah we're not talking about prom queen we're talking about someone who actually has a real important job I shouldn't pick them based on what part of the world their ancestors are from or what gender they are that's really I would actually say on a scale of one to a hundred that's not near like the top 50 but I think it is fair to say that there's a real reason why that would play a factor play a role like you you've got a lot of people who have never experienced certain things and that includes the left and one of the big problems even politics is what we see coming from the left is really based on urban living and from conservatives on more likely to be rural living so when you see people on the left argue for like rent strikes and things like that well yeah you're in a you're in cities where you're predominantly renters so that's your big issue it doesn't resonate the same with people who live in areas where they primarily own their homes or if you're talking about the Second Amendment like obviously people in cities they tend to be liberal they want gun control yeah because you've got a very very dense population gun accidents probably are an issue and you've got cops within a minutes notice you live in a rural area the cops are for you it's a way you need to protect yourself so this this divide creates a difficulty in creating policy for the entirety of the country I could pawn I personally would never play someone's like racial identity or gender in the top priorities but I do think it's it is fair to point out that you know a black woman is gonna understand things about life in the black community that a white man is not going to that doesn't mean you give him a job because of it you can point out the perspectives will be different I agree with both those things right that's a good point too in terms of the overall country is so enormous and it's so different and varied like to find some common ground amongst everyone is so incredibly difficult so it's a contest of who's got the bigger bigger bucket yeah big our electoral bucket yeah that's a good way of putting it - yeah yeah it seems like but either way there's so many people that are just gonna vote left to get Trump out of office they don't care you're gonna elect a guy with dementia you gotta pull up this article stay alive Joe Biden by the Atlantic no I'm not kidding when did they put this ha man was a couple weeks ago maybe it's called stay alive Joe Biden all something and then she says something like all we need is your corporeal form and it's it's not not only arguing that we just need Joe Biden's body but it actually kind of argues he's a bad candidate and it's like it doesn't matter though it doesn't because we just don't like Trump well they're right about that he's a bad candidate Biden oh yeah they could have done so much better with Budaj edge with khlo Bashar with did they're terrified so Gabbard they're terrified of Bernie Sanders and Andrew yang I think probably freaks him out a little bit too I was uh I'm a big fan of Tulsi and followed by yang and a lot of people didn't like that because you know I rag on Democrats all the time it's like more I'll fully admit you can criticize me all day and night I'm you know much see Pelosi and shift Nadler and like you know the problems we have with them and I'm not a fan of their policies I think they go you know they either do nothing but you know within that I saw Andrew yang and his website the list of things he's gone through what he's thought about was was insane I mean the dude had a policy for everything when I was a brilliant guy absolutely and also not a politician so his approach is going to be from a guy who's an entrepreneur right a guy who looks at it in terms of problems to fix you could you can argue there's a similar thing there with Trump being a businessman but yang's listo his he's a comprehensive list of policy positions was it was to me I was like I like it I do totally not that guy the thing about Trump is a giant personality right whereas yang is a really reasonable person yeah for me you know Tull sees anti-war stance was paramount I think the US has wasted too much money we've got people arguing for you know fix the pipes in Flint and I'm like right on let's stop building weapons and doing deployments and trying to control these foreign countries and start working within America and I think that but there's a reason why a lot of moderates and conservatives like Tulsi and it's that it's it's kind of America first right you know and why are we applying so much of our resources and time and energy to these foreign countries we shouldn't be doing that well also she's earned that perspective with two tours of duty overseas she served and you know the Armed Forces she's been a congresswoman for six years she just stands a lot about how this works I disagree I disagree with her on to some of her domestic policy issues nuclear energy and well you what is her stance on nuclear she opposes it well I don't want to speak for her cuz I'm trying to be very careful but negative view on nuclear energy and nuclear energy is different than Three Mile Island right now or Fukushima we need to understand that when you're looking at some of these issues that they have with Fukushima in particular which is a kind of an antiquated system that they had set up that they can't really shut off which I had a whole bit about how crazy that is yeah but when you're talking about the nuclear power that they could implement today it would be a very different system right there I'd be fairly clean extremely high return on energy investment yes and zero emissions yes but there's a fear because of the past just put it somewhere that sucks yeah he's point out where that sucks put a big one someone that sucks and juice up the whole country with it you know when it when it when it came to yang I felt like here we had a guy who I'm not a big fan of you bi and that's a weird one right they I think the way he put it spoke more to me than the way anyone else ever framed it and I actually felt like he shouldn't have called it universal basic income hmm when he didn't he call it the freedom dividend right yeah but it became ubi to so many people that's the one with it yeah when you see you know Amazon Google these big companies becoming just insane behemoths they can't you know they can't be broken up they just absorb an absorb and absorb there's an argument for some kind of dividend to the American people for potentially what they do outside of the United States it's it's very complicated up not economics I guess I'm not smart enough to you know pretend like I know anything about but you look at he brought the example of Alaska they have the oil drilling the people who live in Alaska I get a portion of that revenue and those profits that makes sense you bi the way it's framed in general makes very little sense and eventually I think we're actually seeing now with the government stimulus one of the biggest pitfalls to it do you hear there's a there was a story they ran an NBC a woman her employees were like in revolt because she acquired a loan from the paycheck protection program that insured their jobs meaning they would receive less money because under the cares Act they would have received a bonus of $600 per week on top of the salary they'd normally get they actually preferred to have lost their jobs so you have people who are complaining that they're keeping their jobs now so there's that's one instance though there's a couple stories like that but the challenge with just giving people cash cash is the assumption that the cash has inherent value when the value of it is based upon what you can get for it so one of the lessons I think we learned now with the economy being shut down is doctors and nurses got to work you know that we need them on the front line they're also getting paid what do they use that money for pay their rent buy food things like that where I think we're facing food shortages if you can't buy anything with the money what's the point to taking the money I mean like if you were given a choice you're gonna work you're gonna go work your job at a grocery store you're an essential worker we're gonna pay for in a bucks your buddy who is let me stop you right there because the universal basic income was not designed to deal with the pandemic it was designed to deal with automation which might have not stopped the supply chain which has not stopped which wouldn't have created food shortages this is a sort of a unique situation so you're comparing apples oranges you're applying Universal basic income to our current situation which has nothing to do with the reason why he wanted to implement it in the first place he's worried that automation is gonna take away jobs he's right it will it probably not now consider this problem though there will always be some kind of essential work right yes what you tell the essential worker when other people are getting money and don't work that you have no choice because you're essential even in an automation system so let's say every job but great job but hold on a second they're only getting a small amount of money to stay alive you would rather have a good job were you getting paid well and have benefits and all that other stuff I think that's an assumption I see it is an assumption but the basic income the real problem there's a psychologist your issue the real problem is the way human beings work we need incentives we don't yeah people don't just want to survive and get a little check from the government will be people be despondent you know you you don't want to create any united states of welfare like an all-encompassing thing where some you know these programs that are in place that automate all of the goods and services they take some of that money and give it back to the people because no one can work like that's a that's a depressing dystopian future I mean that's a terrible place to live you ever watch Battlestar Galactica yes loved ERC snowpiercer what's that then you talk about the new Battlestar Galactica one what was snowpiercer which was out that's where Chris Evans is on a train that travels around the world because the world is frozen and only that train has like it's a kind of a weird premise but there's an episode of but no no no no it's a movie I'm just bringing up two different bits of fiction to you know make a point oh yeah it's a futuristic movie it's real weird who else is in it Chris captain Tilda Swinton right isn't it yeah I think I did see that it's real weird yeah it's kind of cool so they take kids from the back from the poor cart and have them work internally in the engine because they have to move things around because parts are missing if they don't everyone all human life dies so they literally go in the back and they take children away from their families who scream and reject this in Battlestar they had children who were also taken for a similar reason to work you had people who had no choice but to work on the fuel processing ship otherwise all of you many we wiped out one of often thought about you know I'm a huge fan of starch at the next generation how do we get to a post capitalism world where we still have incentives but we're post Reno post-scarcity the problem is in it as we're in transition there will be jobs that are essential which means one of the one of the glimpses we get I understand a pandemic is different but we still see a glimpse of people who have to work you know kind of low-skilled boring tedious jobs like a grocery store while other people who have higher skilled jobs are getting their their needs met by the government at least in terms of the cash so we're we're here telling you know these people talking about right now right right so I understand it's a pandemic it's very specific but we're getting a glimpse of what happens when some people are told your job is not essential so we're gonna guarantee your food and resources for the time being you are clearly doing that though it's not just as effective I'm just I'm just saying that as we move towards automation there will still be jobs that are essential what do we do how do we you know incentivize and compensate make that worth the people who have no choice but to keep working while the rest of us don't I don't know if it's a keep working while the rest of us don't issue I think it's a problem of jobs being phased out I think the real problem is automation is gonna phase out jobs it's not gonna be about what's essential what's not essential I think you're sort of applying pandemic vernacular to let's let's let's remove the pandemic from it and let's say you know right now one of the things I looked at and we talked about this little bit before I met a homeless guy in Chicago and he worked at a job that became obsolete I back build it yes I asked a homeless guy how he became homeless when I was when I was like 19 and he told me that he had a job he worked there for 20 30 years as he got older his family you know moved away lost contact is there different times some of friends and family had died when his company became obsolete technology didn't matter anymore he was cast out you know he had nowhere to nowhere to work anymore and his expertise was very specific so he got a severance package that ran out he got unemployment that ran out he got kicked out now he's homeless I look at that and I say how do we make sure that doesn't happen this guy should not be punished simply because times have changed but if you scale that up you know and say it keeps happening in every different sector eventually you'll end up with 90% of the population saying my needs will be taken and 10% saying I still have to work whatever the industry may be like what that's a transitional period is gonna be very difficult we automate most jobs that's up for some some people will still have to work does anybody really think you're gonna automate most jobs though I mean there's so many jobs that can't be motive automated yeah I don't think that gotta be the I mean we're you're talking about some weird sort of futuristic version yeah I don't think that's what we need to be concerned with I think I think the idea of universal basic income is wonderful the idea that your your needs are taken care of in terms of food and housing and then everything else you got to do on your own if if we're looking at when we look at struggle right we look at struggle like across the board can't feed yourself can't put a roof over your head can't do would have the this is what was attractive about universal basic income to me what if we all agreed that some semblance of dignity is a part of being an American and then we will provide you with food we would provide you with housing everything else you have to fucking earn and that's interesting that's interesting I like that I like it but I don't know people don't work well when they don't have to exactly when people don't have an incentive and the competition is important and when you look at people that are anti-capitalist they're they're really into socialism one of the things you find is a lot of rich kids it's weird right it's fucking real weird it's because they don't understand real struggle because they've grown up without it and they have these ideals like they feel guilty because they've grown up without struggle and they want to help the world and they think capitalism is evil and I never saw my dad so we need to we need to get all these rich people they need to give that money to all these poor people when you know balance out income you know what else they notice the people around them we're all white people that are into socialism the the people that are in socialism tend to be upper class upper middle class obviously white generalising in a big way right but there there's there some studies some research that came out and it finds the overwhelming majority of socialists in the United States yeah you know they came from upper-middle class to upper class families that tended to be white yeah and so that focused so hard and these social justice warrior issues you you take a person who's been surrounded by rich white people yes it probably got a reason to not like them but then they assume all white people are the same and you end up seeing this you know racialization of politics also they find themselves in a position of affluence that they didn't earn they want to burn it all the ground yep you know it's and they assume you know I think there's some truth in that you know that there's people who have money they didn't earn and there are leeches on the system they make money from money they've never done anything in their lives or their arrogant sure there's a lot of people like that right but you know when you doesn't take that generalization and apply it to anyone who has money or everyone and you take it to a dark place exactly when I when I first started you know entering the public space in terms of news and politics I was at Occupy Wall Street and before I had any notoriety I was being m''d they called me a good example of what's wrong with the system here's Tim Poole a high school dropout mixed race guy and here he is just sleeping in the dirt park using his phone to tell the real stories of the world after I got featured in Time magazine what did they say Tim Poole is white and he was born with a silver spoon which is not true is absolutely not true but the the the socialist types the activists couldn't accept that I had you know jumped the the class system I guess their view of the world is rigid that the rich people keep the poor down there's no chance for upward mobility and that's not the case you know you absolutely can become successful from you know humble me one of my favorite AOC quotes was her talking about it's literally impossible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when she used to be a waitress I know now she's a congresswoman like she can't look it's not impossible but it's not even that's what we need to address it's not even the reality is some people have a far easier path absolutely some people have a far more difficult path it's just these are this is just but you have to deal with the hand you're given if life is a game and while I'm not saying it's a game it is life but it's similar to a game in that you're dealt a set of cards you're dealt a set of circumstances and yes some people just get four aces from birth your dad's a multi billionaire and your whole family's always been rich and you never have to worry about a goddamn thing for the rest of your life well guess what those people turn out to be fucking miserable and crazy there's some benefit in being born with a shitty hand of cards absolutely there really is a motivational benefit for sure gumption yeah there's a TED talk there's one one trait one personality trait that guarantees success of all it's not intelligence it's not class not race not gender you know what perseverance that's it there's a TED talk on it it's it's it's interesting and it's true now I think there's there's always gonna be certain limits based on your ability like I'm never gonna play in the NBA right it's all enough right nowhere near as fast I can jump high enough actually that's not true I can jump reai skateboard but you take people who don't have top-tier intelligence not the strongest but if they work hard enough they can find their their apex they can find that point where they are successful and they can make it right it's not true for everybody some people are below that that threshold no matter how hard they try they're gonna need help well I think the problem is with any sort of generalization you know perseverance is the most important thing yes sure but you also have to be intelligent you can't be doing the same thing over and over again no I'm not gonna quit no you have to be able to figure out what you're doing wrong as well as have perseverance perseverance is a necessary part of the equation but there's many pieces to that qualities but define success in that regard right if success is well it depends on the field that you're choosing right if you're not smart enough to be an astrophysicist you shouldn't be an astrophysicist right you're not tall enough to play in the NBA you probably can't play min do you think it's totally true though Mugsy Bose that dude was amazing he was amazing yeah it's 5 7 was he 16550 Webb that's right Wow shorter than I thought yeah yeah you can do it yeah that's amazing it's very rare when we talk about two guys right - exactly exactly like that yeah I think the average person has the potential and capabilities of being successful wealthy if they want famous I think one of the challenges we have in our culture is how we're raising kids and what we're in what the values were giving them well it's also what are you trying to do like what do you just look there thing hey there's a bunch of different things that you could just you just don't have like some people can't sing they're not any fucking talent I just don't have it their voice sounds like shit but guess who else's voice sound like shit Bob Dylan terrible voice yeah how does it feel man people love it because there's like authenticity and passion and there's something to it right but he found out a way to make it work you wouldn't win American Idol fuck no imagine this music one of the greatest musicians are feeling imagine him going like someone saying what do you want to do man I want to be a singer songwriter okay just without any music what only interesting me a song probably probably well you know there's there there are a lot of people especially in the internet day and age that you would not expect to have made it who made it yes no that's you know there's a lot yeah I mean that's and then there's rules today that I don't think really hold true you know people say oh you know you have to be good-looking you have to be thin well Adele's not thin she is now she's thin now people are mad at her for being thin yeah she just was talented she said a powerful voice or that woman Susan what it was her name that was on America's Got Talent I don't know no but it wasn't America's Got Talent an x-factor x-factor right isn't boil that fucking wizard over here Susan Boyle she looked like someone's Grammy right and but she belted out this song that made Simon Cowell almost cry Wow because she's just fucking talented just really good you can find a thing but you know if you're Susan Boyle and you want to be a comedian maybe her jokes are fucking terrible maybe she would show up at open mic night it's a Sunday night at the Comedy Store over and over again and keep bombing and then you know she never would have made it yeah I can't learn some people it I think I think if you can if you can learn right if you can you know what one of the problems those people refuse to accept when they're wrong they rise see self-critical yeah they're not they don't have an analytical perspective in terms of their own issues they can't analyze themselves and see the flaws and be objective and introspective some people just don't have that because they've been protecting themselves they they have these sort of personality traits that protect themselves from self deprecation from understanding where their flawed when I was a teenager I remember reading that Michael Jordan would watch tapes of himself playing I figure I would get wrong I know that's true but to me that was like if you want to be the best like Em's you need to actively look for what you're screwing up yeah call out immediately well that's imperative for sparring yeah when you're sparring like we used to film a lot of back when I was competing we'd film sparring sessions and fights particular fights but sparring sessions it was critical because you could see how you were telegraphing something and then you got countered you could see how and sometimes you don't ya think you're doing it then you realize that oh my god I'm dropping my hand every time I do this and then you get caught Razia yeah it's like that's with everything they're like poker yeah yeah giving your nails away mm-hmm it's not but I think most things you'd be better off seeing like with comedy its massive it's gigantic being able to visually see yourself is like primary that's number one a little bit little bit less good is listening to yourself and at a certain point in time in your career you can get away with just listening in terms of like but there's a big difference between people who monitor their stuff and go over it and analyze it versus people who don't it's just it's it's accelerated learning it's like taking advantage of all the tools that you're given and you can apply that to anything that you're trying to do good in life if you have the time and the energy if you're doing a job and during this job you know you just show up at work and you try to do your best then you go home you fuck off and you do your stuff you'll get better at whatever you do exactly but if you go and do your job and then afterwards analyze what you did pay attention to it write things down make a diary perhaps or review your work and really you'll get better faster it's a matter of how much time as long as you don't burn out I don't take days off ever yeah that's weird I took a day off yesterday had some bad sushi I here's a lesson everybody if if I don't want to be mean to the sushi people they're really nice to me but you know maybe maybe lay off sushi if they've been close for a month and well you're driving from the other side of the country text men I'll tell you the place there's only I go to like four places out here for sushi and everywhere else I'm like you know well so here's what I wanted to say right I don't take a day off and a lot of people say I'm crazy and I've actually in my Monday through Friday is now double shifts every day then Saturday and Sunday are single shifts in terms of production so I do Monday through Friday 3 hours and 40 minutes about Saturday and Sundays about an hour and 40 minutes and and what would I do if I wasn't working I'll be playing video games but listen to the numbers you just said yeah three hours and forty Monday through Friday yeah and then an hour and a half per weekend day yeah that's still not a full day's work so an hour and a half of recording is like ten hours of research oh okay well so it's like eight out so I'm doing constant research in between fact-checking and then I work like once I get everything in line and I think I'm confident on what I'm what you know what I have and of course I'm right I'm not perfect then I record for about 20 minutes then I get back to researching reading and I you know so it's it's there's another benefit though you work for yourself absolutely you don't have some dickhead over your shoulder telling you what to do I chose this though right so so there's a couple things when you brought up you'll get good at whatever use whatever as you do I tell my friends every second you spend doing something as an investment to be into being better than better at that so if you want to come home from work and play video games all day you'll be really good at video games man um maybe you start a stream be a twitch channel maybe maybe you can make you know some money being a good personality but you got to earn it or maybe there's something you want to do that instead of playing video games you do that instead for me when I'm not working I'm just sitting around like why am I not working what like what am i doing you know I'm it's I ended up taking yesterday off I didn't work today because we're doing the show and so I'm sitting you know sitting around watching TV shows like this is awful I can't stand I gotta read the news man I got it I gotta be in I got to be into it well you're driven but also you're enjoying it that's the difference between someone who's working and fucking coal mine or someone who's working in a field all day picking strawberries yeah but I hate the job yeah I hear you but you know you know many people have hit me up you probably something similar like how do I do what you do you know when I was working for vice and I was travel around the world ten 20 emails every week from young people saying I really want to do what you do and you know what you know with what they would say to me when I would tell them how to do it they would say I would never do that I I would tell them here's what you do do you have any money saved up no okay where do you work you don't work get a job Starbucks McDonald's whatever you can get maybe you can do better than that save your money once you've saved enough find a store you want fly there cover it you know they would say no I had one there's one person who that said to me I want to travel around the world and do what you do how do I do it I say do you have money saved up yes excellent there's a story right now going on in Turkey all right you got to be secure you got to be safe but it symbols fairly okay fly there right now film it and you know I'll see if I can make any connections on what you find and yet they said well the money I saved it from my apartment in Brooklyn and I'm like right what's more important to you having your nice Williamsburg apartment or being a journalist traveling around the world well I like my apartment I'm like okay listen when I worked for Vice I was sleeping on a couch every time they paid me I put in the bank I didn't touch it I got a job working for a Disney and ABC News joint venture company after that they paid me a bunch of money I put 70% the bank I didn't touch it when I left I went to a bunch of these New York digital companies you know I'll spare them their names for any embarrassment many of them who have become rather worthless this will exist in their bag and I decided after seeing what they had to offer the bias the deception the the clickbait driven nature of it I'm doing myself and because I saved my money every step of the way I was able to do so so then I had an apartment then I could pay for my plane ticket you know to Sweden to France to Germany to do these stories and started building up a base within about seven or eight months I had gone from red to black so now all of a sudden I was no longer losing money I was making money and I'm like there it is couple of years on ridiculous it's ridiculous is ridiculously successful for myself I guess I could you know it's relative but I've got some several employees launching new companies well one of the companies shattered a fundraising record of a million bucks in a single day so that's that that's look the path through me isn't the path of everybody but sacrifice you know well you're basically saying exactly what they're saying in TED talk perseverance but and you you embrace the grind but it's also what do you really prioritize yeah for me what are you trying to do I don't care about having an apartment I want to I want to I want to see what was going on the ground in Istanbul so you know what it's also like who who is the type of person that would chase down the stories the type of person that's really gonna chase down the stories the person's is driven to chase down stories what you're getting is questions from idiots you're getting questions from people too like how do I do it and then when you offer the answer I'm not gonna do that right those are the people that are never gonna make it but the conversation I have with Ari Shaffir where he and Robert Kelly apparently they thought about sponsoring a comic who's up-and-coming taking care of their financial needs and you know for like a year and a lot trying to see how far they could get in their career if they didn't have to deal with money and I said that's the problem is the type of person who's going to make it is going to make it not just in spite of the fact that they don't have any money but because of the fact they don't have any money heroes day jobs those sucky jobs that you need to have when you're struggling those they fucking motivate you they're important if somebody just comes along gives you all the money you need for food you're gonna have asset and some hungry guy in the other side of town is gonna take all the gigs that you would get they're gonna write better jokes they're gonna be more motivated to go to open mics they're gonna pound the pavement harder well I got a story for you I'll try get details right so my buddy's company so forgive me if I'm if I'm getting details wrong but he had a social media management company he started himself he knew everything about social media Instagram and all that and he started building up a client base where I'm gonna run your social media for you worked like a charm so I'm making ton of money getting new contracts these companies and what they were doing he got to a point where to hire people he ended up hiring a couple college grads and he put up the ad saying you know college degree required they couldn't figure anything out they kept calling them having problems couldn't manage anything so he fires him rehires again more college grads same problem eventually has to fire him then he hires because he's running out of money he hires to high school I think they're high school dropouts and he was like they wanted substantially less money and at this point I just couldn't find good people they worked swimmingly it was amazing no phone calls no problems these were people who had worked hard saved up money in their small bumpkin hometown moved to Los Angeles to make it big they knew what they wanted they knew what they had to do and they said I will find a way to do it he said the other people are hiring were just like drones they just wanted a job they didn't know or care what they were doing they didn't bother so they don't wanna learn but these people who were driven viewed this as just another problem to be solved on my path to success yeah that's that's the mindset and that's the difference the mindset of success is the mindset of I will figure it out so I think the problem is how we're raising people in this country we're raising them too in certain areas to expect things to be given to you you get a participation trophy no matter what you do your congratulations this is the problem with socialism and this is the problem with universal basic income what we're talking about yeah yeah expecting something from the government particularly without any financial feasibility there's no there's no real logic to where that money comes from like show me where work is right right what is money you know so so one of the arguments I keep seeing from a lot of people who have more I don't want to calm socialist I think they're just regular urban dwelling like liberal left type people mmm there's one viral post on on ret on Reddit that said you've got these conservatives or you've got these people out protesting so they can enrich their landlords and these billionaires when they should be demanding that rent be waived that mortgages you know in evictions be cancelled and that the government take care of their needs and provide them with stimulus or something like that and and and I look at that like you're very clearly living in a city but what they don't understand is they say things like you know landlord isn't a job like I argue that there's a lot of very successful landlords who make a ton of money and do very little but it's a fuckin job right it's not just that it's the money you pay in rent can't just be wiped out because there's groundskeepers there's maintenance there's administrative assistance there's taxes that be filed rent doesn't just go into their pocket so they can buy a boat but they view it this way and they think that money is is what you want that when they say these people who want the government to be reopened you know are simply trying to enrich the wealthy it's like I think maybe they make things and they want to keep making things they want they want their economy not the government the economy yeah mixing that up but there's there they're there a lot of people that don't seem to understand I think it's because when you live in a city everything's already there for you when I lived in New York the Williamsburg Bridge boom there it is I didn't see it built I didn't pay a dime for it and I can just use it I can cross over it's just there and I've never had to you know you never had to fight for it so you just say why can't I just have it you see you walk in any store and there's food hey there's food easy what they don't see is the supply chain where the food is made the work that goes into it so they assume that money guarantees access to it which it doesn't if the economy is shut down the money can't buy you things the value of that money starts going down if the farms can't sell any of this to anybody and start dumping and I think it's called fallowing fields no longer farming then there's nothing to buy so if products aren't being made and services aren't being rendered because the economy is closed what is your money gonna get you at a certain point when the economy has shut down for too long and we're seeing all of these businesses closed family businesses I heard a story terrible tragedy somebody killed himself because there's their family business of seven years was shut down that net product is gone so eventually there's no food to buy and only then will people realize that the government stimulus money has no inherent value it's it's the work we do for each other that's the argument being left out when you when you get a biased view on social media or when these people don't quite understand you know that's the problem there's a lot of noise people that don't quite understand people that aren't a part of the supply chain that really don't know what it's like to like the people that raise food they're freaking out right now yeah people that raise cattle and the people that grow food and the fact that they have to deal with being shut down and trying to figure out how to restart things and when is it gonna be okay to restart things well and what if it happens again with there's another flare-up two months from now I mean they're hurting right now and they might might take years to recover from these past couple months well there was I think some health official in California saying they might not not not be able to fully reopen until as a vaccine which could take 18 months fully reopened what like to go back to normal right so I think there was an MIT Technology Review article talking about how we may have to do intermittent lockdowns you know like two months lock down one month off until the vaccine is available then there was another another study came out saying something similar about herd immunity I mean Sweden they think they're there on target for the end of May that herd immunity which is like 60 percent I think yeah I the information keeps changing you know we're learning more so maybe these statements are at this point I don't know obsolete yeah Sweden's a weird place to because it's a it consists mostly of little villages why Sweden yes big cities well you have Stockholm but the primarily the population is sort of its it's separated by these smaller towns it's not you're right over there I see you've already been tested for the co vid I'm really worried about you right now people are weird about coughs now no I inhaled water yeah coughs are nerve-racking for folks oh that's brutal all right yeah you gave me this bottle of water and I hailed it don't think you just messed me up are you okay yeah think so give me it yeah relax no it's okay I got Joe gave me the test three no no kovat nineteen yeah your your voice sounds terrible right now I just inhaled water how did you inhale it I don't know I was trying to drink it and I nailed it bad happens now I sound weird right yeah you saw a different person the luminosity critism you with somebody else yeah you're too controversial well that shit you were saying to people up all right think I'm better i won't i won't inhale the water that's it feels weird um Kyle Cohen school me something today I wanted you to see Jamie it's some thing there's some shit going down with UFO sightings oh yeah yeah before well yeah but they were new here I'll send it I'll send it to you I've been following this stuff yeah it's um hold on a second Jamie all right I just texted it to you Pentagon officially releases UFO this is the tweet it says new Pentagon formally released three mysterious UFO videos captured by Navy pilots the already leaked video showed what DoD insist on calling unidentified aerial phenomena moving at incredible speeds and performing near impossible maneuvers this is a weird subject because it's one of those subjects where people automatically dismiss it because it's been it's been so touted by kook's there's so many wacky fucks that have talked about UFOs that anybody talking about UFOs has to be out of their fucking mind but then when you see these videos and you see them performing these impossible tasks like these things are moving in a way that we've never seen anything move before flipping upside down and sideways moving and insane rates of speed like they don't know what these are yeah you know phenomena what's interesting though is I was reading one of these stories and they passively mentioned that the sighting was near a technology and a u.s. naval like technology station of some sort mmm like a top-secret development and I'm like that could be one of two things either right it's developed by the people that are at that base or they're monitoring the people that are at that base these aircraft we call them aircraft are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the u.s. inventory nor any foreign inventory that we are aware of maybe they see this shit that's going down with China and all the ships being moved and like listen you fuckheads the aliens yeah listen you fucking moron territorial Apes I'd like to think that but you don't think so Manhattan Project man I mean the US has probably got some crazy motherfucker weapons it could be but the Manhattan Project was also coincidentally right after they started detonating bombs and the aliens start showing up that's what they think right yeah well that was when the the bulk of US sightings started jumping and worldwide I believe too you know maybe we've slowly been getting more and more information about this I've been actually reading a lot of these stories of the past several months more admissions from government more release of documents and more sightings so there's been a big I don't want to call it well a lot of people murmuring that April was gonna be the month when we finally learned the truth April's almost up it's almost almost that we gotta wait a few days man twenty-seventh you know what I use more days is left do you know 13:30 you know about happened the you know about the O'Hare Airport sighting which ones that so this was I think in like oh six at Chicago's International O'Hare a UFO came down and hovered above I think I camera which eternal terminal it was hovered for a few minutes I think and then shot straight punched a hole in the clouds everybody saw it happen now I had just quit working at O'Hare around this time when the sighting happened so I had friends who were still there I had a friend tell me that when this UFO came down people on Mannheim Road where which is the road on the side of O'Hare got out of their cars like just stopped the light got up and we're looking and staring at it and that the people who are working where we worked we worked for American Eagle Airlines walked out of the rooms and we're just staring at it float and then shoot up and punch a hole in the clouds you know they said weather phenomenon so there's a photo of it a pilot took a photo of it this is back when like very early phone cameras that's a very grainy awful picture there that's that's not it no no that's super fake all right I think no these are all people trying to fake it's really hard to find that one is not that one might be it but I don't think so it it barely looks like cargo O'Hare UFO sighting 2006 said it right there I do not believe those are it no so this will click on that article see what it says Jamie that one might be on the left but so many people try exploiting this stuff for for clicks and fervor views and they make these fake photos and it was links not working it was a very very faint photo from the from the cockpit it might be that one right there in the middle no no so on the left side for well it might be that one no no it's not it that's not it well there was a really crappy photo of it and that might be that might be it was a really it was out of the cockpit of a window a pilot took a photo and you know I wonder where of all the sightings gone since phones became ubiquitous I mean this is a simple you know I guess excuse the aliens they're sentient they know we have phones they're like okay stop you know decloaking or whatever but I want or I wonder if you know why is it there were so many UFOs and then around the time cellphone cameras come out they're gone well I think most people are full of shit yeah yeah I think most people like to pretend they see things that don't really see things but you know I don't think that excludes the possibility it's not like it's it's not like it's these things are mutually exclusive like people are full of shit therefore aliens don't exist I think aliens could be real and people are full of shit and I think that it could be it's very rare that they visit us but if they did like well how often do scientists go to the Congo to study chimps I mean how many people do they send let me let me the bottom of the ocean to look for new life-forms how rare is it let me trip you out okay on that idea we put decoys up for animals animals can't tell the difference what if you've actually met a decoy person you couldn't tell the difference maybe it's you bro maybe it's me that's right unless we're able to work so much oh yeah robot I don't get tired no so you're interested in news and disseminating factual evidence because we're actually doing is collecting a database for the for the aliens no but I thought about this because I saw a photo on Reddit of puffins I think it's called the bird and they put up a fake puffins and it's because I think they're called puffins it's because the birds don't like you know nesting in places where they're alone and so I putting the decoy there the other birds would start coming and like one bird showed up and was hanging out with the decoy and I'm like could you imagine like you see like you we put duck decoys in the water we do duck calls and the Ducks like oh wait fly honey I'm gonna come over and check this out and it's like a wood block could you imagine like seeing like a beautiful woman or someone you're attracted to and being like look at that it's really like an alien decoy just to like probe you and like better understand you or something well the decoy just the term decoys weird because decoys are used for hunting like turkeys turkey season right now yeah and the way that hunt most guys hunt for turkeys they take a rubber turkey you put that fucker out in the middle of the field and then you hide behind a bush with a shotgun and then that turkeys like hear it and they come over and they try to get some pussy and then they get shot so what if you know you see some dude and or it's like you see it for you you know beautiful woman you won't get that pussy you know and then she's going like hey hey come over here and you're like oh hey me and then I get eaten no no they just you know take up in the ship Probie on a MicroBot need to this is the thing about putting things up your butt most doctors don't even do that like they have MRIs now tenant aliens need to probe you in your ass I think it's just what everyone's afraid of they're afraid of things go in their ass so that's what they they think is gonna happen if the aliens get them a little fries me somebody somebody told the dumb story back in the day and it was the most sensational version everybody had to have it so they were like that's what they went with you know maybe or maybe they do that to keep you to keep your mouth shut they fuck you in the ass just so you keep your mouth shut or some dude actually got abducted right yeah and he comes back and he's like they think they won against me they think they beat me they puts up with my butt they're weirdos do you hear the story of Betty and Barney Hill now it's the very first UFO abduction story it's an ancient story and what's crazy is Angela Hill who's a UFC fighter I had her on the podcast and after the show she told me her grandpa was Barney Hill whoa and I was like holy fuck like we forgot to we didn't talk about it during the show but she wanted to bring it up because she knows I'm kind of obsessed with UFOs but the account that they have like they get hypnotized and he's recalling the abduction and they have like the same story it's very terrifying they hear him crying and screaming and you know that he was taken aboard this craft and examined and brought back and they have missing time but here's the thing if they only did that occasionally they only came down once every few years and just scoop some person up in the middle of some rural place like if you're flying over you know I think their instance was in I believe it was in Maine if you're flying over somewhere like Maine which is a very low population state and you see a lone car and it's just traveling along the highway and there's places in Maine where you go from like Portland to Bangor when you're traveling on that road it's like 60 miles with nothing not a gas station nothing if you were an alien you saw a car by itself like no other car will move in we got one isn't it just easier to think it's the US government no why not because we don't have the capability of doing something like that think I don't think the capability of the scientists working for the government is any different than the capability of the science scientists that are working for you know Project X or you know fill in the blanks in terms of like what Raytheon publicly traded companies how long look yet quadcopters don't seem all that complicated to me quadcopters yeah like a helicopter like you drums you know we've seen a little toys you buy they got four propellers take take that concept use thinner you know jets and surround it in a disc so that it's you know universally like it can move in any direction because it's gotten you know source where's the gas tank well lithium-ion battery or come on you're talking space shit like this hasn't even been invented yet think about how little mileage you can get out of a Tesla you know they had advances Tesla's you know still when it's going full out it can only go for I mean you get three hundred seven miles if you drive like a grandma but if you drive like a maniac you don't even you'd have that you know that they could be wrong with this but I'm pretty sure that they had this flying platform in the 70s that uses gas power and they've also had jetpacks for a long time know they've had sort of they've had jet packs that are capable of going for like thirty seconds they don't exactly know no I'm pretty sure the jet packs back in the day went for a long no no they definitely didn't we can lay it out yeah let's look it up because I didn't the whole thing was the fact they were burning gas and to propel you in the air they only had a certain amount I thought it was like 20 minutes 20-30 minutes maybe now my understanding of why we abandoned jetpack technology was that it was inefficient and heavy and you couldn't carry it without it being turned on so they opted for larger like you know like what are they called Chinook's helicopters that can carry multiple people multiple people at once when you're wearing a jet pack it has to be on idle negating its own weight which means it's burning as you're walking around which means you get a good 20-minute jump and you gotta abandon the tech and then you don't want your enemies to get it have you ever seen a guy flyer jet pack yeah as a video on youtube no I mean in real life oh I've seen that one guy the Iron Man dude what real life in there and really my friend Willie be from in Denver on the radio yeah had a radio show in the morning h2s radio show he still has a radio show shout out to Willie and he had this guy who was a jet pack pilot who came in and in the parking lot of the radio studio and you know fans of the radio show came and did it too and watched it rather and this guy flew in the air for about 15-20 seconds and then landed this guy was so banged up he both of his legs were blown apart he had he had big braces on both of his knees I'm like what happened your knees he's like just crash landing both knees are blown to shit hit no ACLs and either one of his knees but what I'm saying like this is back then right good for about 30 seconds 10 seconds of flying well so the point I'm trying to get to is if you take something like a quadcopter you could absolutely feel it with with you know gasps loud as fuck it but it would it would depending on how you measure engine to be an engine yeah it'd be loud as fuck and you'd hear from the from the quadrotor yeah but these what these people are describing is nothing like that these people are describing things that are silent that go from zero to a thousand miles an hour in a split second the things that defy physics as we understand them this is not something that I think that the u.s. government has I don't I just if you look at like okay like Elon Musk company project X or SpaceX SpaceX is right now one of the premier civilian companies private companies that's making rocket ships they fuck up all the time total there in the middle of innovating all the time he's one of the smartest people on earth he's one of the in terms of Technology he's one he knows as much about propulsion as anyone and they still can't get it right they're still trying to figure it out they're trying to come up with something that could be viable in terms of commercial space flight and they're working on it daily and these these people are the brightest minds we know of right now they're in this jet propulsion space travel business there's you know virgins working on something as a couple other companies that are working on things as well and then you have NASA which worked they're the best they could come up with was the Space Shuttle right do you think that there was something way better than Space Shuttle they just met we used that they had and they they kept it on the back burner didn't want to let anybody know but the way they would use it is they would pick people up and erase their memory and exhort their asshole that's crazy well that's less likely than the hundreds of billions of galaxies just in our own in our own known universe right each one with hundreds of billions of stars each star with who knows how many fucking planets that's somewhere out there there's something more advanced than us maybe a thousand years maybe a million years but that it's figured out how to come here I got same question then why hasn't why isn't anyone discovered them why is SETI failed search search for extraterrestrial intelligence why haven't the chimps invented guns they've started using more tools but right why haven't they invented guns though I don't know so why hasn't said he found UFOs the same fucking answer they're not advanced enough yet really it's a it's a real simple answer the Industrial Age is a pretty fucking recent right I mean you think about when people invented cars you're talking about 1800 that's really recent and we call these lights 1800s like high power radio transmission is only in the past 100 years or so right well you saw it you've seen the movie contact maybe that's the old one right it's Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey it's a based on Carl Sagan's book about contact with space and with with aliens I think I did see it recently I can interesting interesting take on it but oh yeah way is that they've received the signal that we sent out way way back you know in the day actually when the the first broadcast signal was Hitler announcing the Olympic Games to start of the Berlin games and this was the first signal they got there's a really controversial moment in the movie or controversy it you know in the plot with that once they were trying to decipher the image that was being sent they realize it was Hitler yeah the first thing they see is a swastika what the fuck is this send it back to us and then they had to realize oh no no this is the first image that we sent out to space they wouldn't be able to understand the political or historical context of this and well so so I got a few there's a few issues I see in terms of aliens and earth contact right we are substantially more connected you know in an evolutionary chain - ants than we are to any alien so we we can't communicate with them for the most part we kind of can we understand how they communicate but when an ant sees a superhighway there's something like this is someone else's quote they don't think twice so it's possible there are aliens that have super highways right above us we can't tell what it is same as a dog doesn't understand other than state government but one of the one of the issues I think is often neglected in the conversation about aliens is the we assume aliens would be on a very similar planet to us we assume that they would have some kind of gaseous atmosphere perhaps it's a liquid atmosphere and one of the things that I would ask of a researchers I'm not the expert is the fact that we have the proper balance of oxygen the atmosphere to manipulate fire which allows us to you know separate elements and then create computers and components and fuels wouldn't exist on a planet without the same you know atmosphere we existed to stop I can answer that really easy yeah there's no known propulsion system for any of these crafts these things are not using fire they don't have a heat signal there they don't know what they are they don't know how that works I don't mean propulsion I mean the separation of elements the manipulation of elements right so we we melt things and separate them and break them down they don't believe that that's how it works no but I mean like how do you even start from I'm sure there's an answer you know let's say you have you have a species that lives on a planet with no oxygen it has no access to fire what energy like what dense energy source do they have that will allow them to manipulate matter do you know the Rob Lazar the bob lazar story I do yeah well one of the things that he talked about when he first stopped working for area s4 and the government was tapping his phones and you know there's there's a lot that can be documented about him there's a lot that can't be but one of the things that he talked about was a thing called element 115 right that element 115 this is insanely dense element that they use to bend gravity and that the way he described the way the propulsion system works it's like putting a bowling ball in the center of a very soft mattress and that all of the other mattress all the rest of the mess the mattress bends around the intense mass of the bowling ball and that this is how these incredibly advanced aliens from this other planet use this is their propulsion system that was used from Star Trek though the the concept of warp was all around for a really long I think the concept is based on Einstein's theory of gravity I mean this is the whole idea if you could find something that could do that but here's the thing when Bob Lazar talked about this in the late 80s early 90s this element didn't exist right now it does it wasn't it wasn't proven until they did it in a particle collider I believe it was 2013 so he was talking about this element far before it was it was and he's apparently this is the big rumor he apparently had taken some of that from a lab yeah and through George Noory and it was a George Noory yes they did some experiments on the on television and showed that this stuff had made light and fog bend in a way that they couldn't describe he also didn't he also claimed to see a small alien creature on his way out he said he saw something that was sitting down but he doesn't know if it was a model that they were using like if they had created something that was supposed to be the size of a thing that could fit in these crafts because these crafts he said we're designed for things that were far smaller than human beings I'm pretty sure in the initial interview he gave when he went public was that he saw an alien and then later on changed it saying I don't know if it was maybe a model or a puppet yeah he said he thought he saw something sitting down and two people standing over it looking at it he said he thought he saw an alien you know but he's probably I mean I don't know I mean look he said it was literally for like a half a second look it's walking by a window and he sees something inside of it imagine being a guy who's in your 20s and you're a propulsions expert and it's been proved and he worked at Los Alamos labs has been proven that he did put a fucking jet engine yeah it's been proven that he did put a jet engine on a Honda I mean he's a genius he's a and then you talk to him he's an incredibly smart guy now imagine you get sent off to area s4 and they show you this thing that you know doesn't even exist and they tell you about this propulsion method that they don't understand and they say that they found this a long time ago in an archeological dig and they want you to back engineer it because you're a propulsion expert and they're running out of options they've been studying this for decades no one knows what the fuck it is or how you can make it work and then they do test flights with this thing and then he tells his friends about these test flights after he gets fucked you know I got fired do you know a story about him getting fired he leaked it or something no no his wife is fucking her flight instructor oh and so when his wife was fucking her flight instructor they told him he couldn't work anymore and he's like why not well they were tapping his phone because when you have top-secret clearance to work on UFOs I guess they don't want your fight your your wife fucking her flight instructor then you're gonna go crazy and you have a lot of imbalance at home right so he doesn't know why they don't tell him why so he takes his friends and he tells them listen this is this is real they're running these experiments I know you think I'm crazy this is what I've been working on so he takes them to this area where you used to be able to have access to but once he did this they closed off access and pushed it far back to where the public has access to and he showed them these things doing these impossible maneuvers in the desert in the night sky as I remember and so then he gets arrested and so when he gets arrested he was a fear he was in fear of his own life he goes public and tells this whole story and then they erase his past they erased his social security number they erase his education background even though people that knew him and knew he worked at Los Alamos labs he takes George Noory of a tour of Los Alamos labs knows the people that worked there they all say hi to him he takes them a tour around the laboratory yeah shows them around shows them the the devices they use for biometric security and I think the one thing you can't ignore is that he'd he'd there was there was documentation that he did work in one of these places yes and they later claimed he didn't yes and like I think I was watching the thing on maybe was Netflix I think like he promoted that right it was undone yeah that's what's they show the paper like we found yes like he clearly was there he was in the employee right yeah no but but you know for me you know man I'd love to believe it all he's been insanely consistent about that story yeah for 40 years I I want to believe you know 30 years whatever yeah I want to believe - that's the problem man paper didn't I want to believe but that's nonsense pics or it didn't happen is cents well I'm not how do you how do you you know how do you what about Neanderthals none what about dinosaurs there's not mix I'm more so joking right what I mean it's tell me the evidence right I get it let's you know the challenge with any theory I like I don't like saying conspiracy theory because they're not always conspiracies is that people want something to be true and so they end up looking for things to justify what they think it already is of course instead of starting with what you've got trying to figure out where it goes from there but when you start with what you've got you've got a guy who was living in Vegas was taking these flights out to area s4 knows the place knows it inside out can describe it very accurately also worked at Los Alamos labs that very accurately yeah it proves he worked there yeah but I cruise easily he's also a legitimate scientist but what I mean when you talk to the guy he's a brilliant guy but he's not a nut right what are you saying aliens that doesn't mean aliens no I'm just asking like so it doesn't mean aliens but that's what he was told right what he was told is this is something that has come from somewhere else and they're trying to figure out how to work it how do you what if we're in a simulation and this was something that was leftover code or it you know wasn't supposed to be placed in this curtain iteration would if there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to and that these things do you know my favorite I want to call it conspiracy theory but might one of my favorite stories is humanity emerged on Venus and that we destroyed the planet with a greenhouse effect so we created the ark project and took the DNA of two of every animal and loaded up on us on the last vessel the ark and went to terraform earth and that's the dumbest idea ever it's hilarious DNA of two of each animal and then how many copies of those things do you make before they eat each other they got they got they got graphtec they they they just started seeding the planet and what people do I'm again I'm not saying it's I think it's a fun story they argue that the Bible was like the stories being told and retranslated over hundreds of years to a lost civilization that had only one ship escaped the destruction of their planet and I'm not saying it's true I'm saying it's a fun story I love that story yeah it's fun it would be a fun sci-fi movie and then you end up with lost tech being discovered well yeah here's like Elon let's say we have to get off you know there's so many people that say we have to escape earth we have to we have to sort of colonize the solar system or colonize the galaxy I agree and I think if we don't discover a better propulsion than hard chemical energy we're not going to do it so yeah well that's why this is so compelling this idea that they're using some element that apparently is impossible to find here you can only create it with a particle collider but maybe in whatever solar system they are coming from you have a very different environment and maybe this element was the primary source for fuel they might have figured that out a long time ago I wonder if I'd love to talk to an actual physicist about this is there something with negative density what's that mean so like you know things with density create an attraction through gravity because they the the pressure that like their their influence on space-time I'm not an astrophysicist so I can't explain it to you perfectly but you know the larger that more dense the object the more pull it has you know so I could very dense black hole for instance sucks you in then you know Mars has silenced gravity than us cuts less dense I wonder if there's something again this probably you know I'm sure there's some scientists laughing right now what a moron but negative density something that would actually have a real effect in terms of gravity in which case you could have some kind of object with where you can control expand and contract density so that you're pushing and pulling I don't know but Bob lazarre's perspective is if we showed a nuclear reactor to a civilization from the 1400s they would think we're doing witchcraft the Ark of the Covenant yeah they would think it is absolutely the craziest thing that anyone has ever seen or heard they would try to tamper with it they'd all get radiation poisoning and die they'd never be able to figure it out in the million years if you just left it with them if you left some sort of a nuclear reactor with them and he said this is really how far advanced he believes these these aliens or whatever you want to call them are that they're their science their technology is indistinguishable from magic because they're so far ahead of us do you think they'd want to be involved with us beyond us why wouldn't you we study butterflies we study mice we study we study bugs and the other side of the planet we send people unscientific journeys to go and look at frogs even sure are real anymore are we giving guns to chimps are we are we building forts for them and teaching them to use stone and I mean we've seen now there's more videos coming out showing like ember watch primate species but using more tools yeah will this be your undead stuff they believe that primates chimps have entered the Stone Age yeah they're using them on a regular basis are we gonna go and teach them their culture I mean do we do we teach chimps things all the time what in each imposed yeah.but environments because that's the only way you can study them yeah we teach I mean if we they had a civilization you can go to you knew they lived in an apartment and you can study them that way but you don't think that they would study if they found a planet like it looks the magic if we found a planet okay we found a planet and it's all just filled with octopus and these octopus are changing colors and just Jack and fish and eaten lobsters we would be so it'd be fascinating absolutely well all innovation happens because people are trying to improve on initial designs now why do they try to prove and improve on initial designs they try to make things that are better make things that are more efficient make things that can do tasks that they can't do without these tools and then they their curiosity and their creativity causes them to expand upon these ideas well of course if something's going to be so far advanced they didn't accept their current place in the universe they don't even accept the fact they want to stay on this planet they want to travel to other places do you know fucking insanely curious you'd have to be to lock you and three of your other three-foot buddies and a giant fucking flying saucer and propel yourself through space oh yeah we would have to be incredibly curious and incredibly not just curious but innovative they would have to be thinking about things they would have to be exploring things and of course you would want to come to a planet that is filled with people who have hundreds of different languages they're all full of shit they lie to each other constantly send videos through the air they have weapons that they could blow each other up with yeah I mean of course you would be fascinated by that is the least compelling argument that anybody ever says why would they mess with us why would they care about us of course they would care about us we are fucking interesting well I'll put this way I think if we saw like a group of chimps standing near like a water water bed and then one chimp fashioned some kind of bag and pulls it over its head jumps in the water and tries to go as low as he can for as long as I can but before coming back out we would look at that like that is the stupidest attempt at scuba diving I've ever seen but oh my god a chimp just tried to scuba dive so if there are aliens and they're in these amazing technologically advanced ships that can jump Lightspeed manipulate gravity they just watched us strap ourselves to an explosive and fire us off of our atmosphere where we're likely to die and they're like this is the in stupidest attempt that actually go into space he's guys trying to go to space no I wouldn't think about that way at all I would think about look there's a fucking Space Station it's up there and people live on it they shoot themselves is that they have a very crude form of propulsion right but they have figured it out because they don't have element 115 in their environment naturally so these dummies have to light things on fire and usually push off the back of it to shove themselves through normal air and you know why they're not gonna give us that Tech right now why would they give us that why why do I say give us tax why they wouldn't I'm saying why would they give us tech why would any that's the weirdest argument ever that they're giving us things I don't think they're giving a shit no I don't think so either I think they're specifically not doing it and they wouldn't do it even if we wanted them to I think I think it's the inverse you you people a lot of people talk about how they're like sharing technology with us or something right you see that stuff in the conspirators conspiracies the reason they won't is because we're we're trust we're territorial we we fight each other I'm sure so look if they came down and went to Russia and said here's anti-graft propulsion we think Russia is gonna do all right our planet now they're gonna immediately expand rapidly their population is gonna grow exponentially and it's gonna cause massive turmoil between nuclear powers which could destroy themselves so you can use it as a weapon the smartest thing is to not share at all until we're a one-world you know Society well also like look at what they look like when aliens look like if you look at the iconic shape of an alien they have giant heads and genderless bodies like maybe that's the key to to stopping war with the north no incentive whatsoever for people to be sexual or attractive everybody looks exactly the same we get over this idea of biological mating they reproduce through genetic engineering why not just be robots well maybe they are like yeah that's me that is like a robot artificial bodies where you you know have you seen altered carbon I haven't but I keep hearing good things about it I just finished season 2 season 1 was awesome but basically they have a thing called a stack you said you finished season 2 season 1 is awesome that means season 2 sucks season 2 is a C+ Oh season 1 second a plus plus yeah like it's fun but they have a thing called a stack in the base of their in their in their spinal column right below their their head that stores their consciousness and they call their bodies sleeves and they kind of don't care when they die because they just get you know it's if you're poor you get really crappy sleeves right but if you're if you're rich you get premium access military upgrade like high tech very strong but their body has just become separate and you can also transport your consciousness interstellar like to other planets and then you wake up in a body in a different plant that's how you go places now your consciousness travels so yeah I mean maybe aliens do that maybe there's there's not you know I'm I find the the idea of the various alien life but the body's curious one of the one of the things I've read about is that it could be humans from the future yeah I've heard that - that makes sense you think about what we look like as opposed to like what a champ looks like yeah and then you keep going further with that like oh the head will get bigger the bodies get weaker yeah and then look there's a sort of a trend in this society today to be less masculine less feminine more gender-neutral and these well so they them pronouns maybe that's all just part of the programming this this falls into another one of these conspiracy theories that the goal of the globalists is that in order to get access to alien tech we have to be a unified planet aliens aren't going to give aliens really you've heard that one oh yeah it's all over the Internet the that's why they're doing this so that they're going with a one-world order in order to get alien tech do you think the Galactic Federation is gonna gonna let a planet in which has got numerous governing bodies and nuclear weapons there's a Galactic Federation think I'm just right about the point I'm making is they're people and I believe this they believe that if there is some kind of Galactic Federation or at least some kind of recognizable you know different cultures that have some kind of set rule base right who do they negotiate with us Russia or China and so the argument the one of the theories is that interest on the United States who have access to the aliens know that they have to do everything their power to unify the entire planet under one Authority so that we can be entered into whatever alien you know access would exist but so long as we are nuclear-powered competing territorial factions they can't do it well that makes sense if that was the case but you add in what you what you were saying about masculinity and gender and one of the things that I find interesting is that when it comes to this argument about removing masculinity there's this kind of overlap with this idea of domestication you think about proto twelves proto dogs and dogs dogs are effectively wolf cubs perpetually so wolves are aggressive territorial independent yeah I mean independent the sense that like you you're not gonna tame them they're like you know teach wolves yeah yeah willing to listen to you there I mean I you you can but it's like it's it's Sarah they agree with you or they don't you're following you know so an adult masculine tough human is gonna be like I'm independent I'm in charge they've got to remove that and domesticate us so you get a bunch of weak effeminate genderless humans who are gonna be passive docile and agreeable yeah like dogs right yeah do I have a whole bit about what wolves are and what dogs are yeah and what men used to be right and what men are now yeah I I was thinking of this really cool idea for a sci-fi film where aliens come to earth and most humanity accepts domestication and then 300 400 years from now you've got regular looking 21st century kind of men and women but then you have these five-foot tall super armored jet pack with plasma rifles that love and serve the aliens and we view them as freakish genetic defects so have you seen like oblivion with Tom Cruise yes the aliens basically genetically engineered a whole bunch of Tom Cruise's I was thinking of that kind of idea but also with domestic Asia that's an underrated movie by the way that's cool I love it yeah very good if if aliens came to earth and most humans agreed and then over time the humans that got access to life-saving technology special armor were the ones that were agreeable and less likely to be aggressive yeah they would bitch out just like the Wolves bitched out and became a pole and then you'd have wolves so I thought of a cool idea for a story you basically if humans like raiding a chicken coop and the aliens are like ah and they call their attack humans who jump out with like armor and crazy feature tech from the aliens but they're like these small dong the like versions of humans you know like desperately in love with the aliens you know right justice crying in logs yeah yeah wolves aren't like that but I wonder if the people would eat those doglike people the way wolves eat dogs well for the sake of a fiction no we wouldn't have them do that but what would kind of always be coyote be like this sneaky smaller but our carios aren't the product of domestication I mean they're just a separate Kain canine breed I guess or species right but I'm saying like they they really never got domesticated yeah that's what's interesting it's like they're I mean you zero coyote version of humans yeah the North Sentinel island right you know yeah yeah the people who've never had contact with humans well they had several bad people well that's why they killed that guy they killed that I shouldn't hear he killed the missionary because they were invaded in the 1800s by a guy named Maurice of Adal Portman who was a pervert / Explorer who you know would measure dicks and yeah take detailed descriptions of people's anatomy and genitals I mean was it for legitimate research purposes no fucking wacko just yeah fine people and run tests on them yeah but that would be what we'd worried about with aliens too right that's why that's why people were worried about them touching their asshole well somebody's only the pervert aliens somebody posted this tweet they said something about like you need to realize the aliens who would come to earth aren't the cool nerds who want to like talk science it's they're the rich assholes who you know rat fuck their planet and they're dipping out the myth that's a silly way to look at it well I mean it's one possibility I understand but that's us we always want to look at things through like a human centric filter exactly but if they're genderless things from from the future like what benefit would it be to get richer you know these they have their giant heads and they could travel the speed of light like this is this is why I really don't like I think it's Hawking's argument that we shouldn't we shouldn't be excited about aliens because whenever a more powerful civilization approaches a weaker one they dominate it's like I don't buy no buy that for two seconds in terms of aliens coming earth that makes no sense what what so the argument I buy what Hawking's argument oh you don't that if aliens came to earth they would enslave us to steal our resources well I don't necessarily think they would enslave us to steal our resources but if we were aware of them they would become space daddy well what he's what he's saying is like you know when when the Europeans came to North America and spread disease and then stole land start wiping everybody out like when a more advanced civilization meets oh you know you know I don't think aliens would do that at all it's like why not the way I the way I would view the most devastating approach would be more like a gigantic vessel coming down and just slicing a skyscraper in half and stripping out all the copper and elements while ignoring the people and when we go to a habitat for animals we're not going to like haha we'll kill all the squirrels we're like we're taking the lumber squirrels be damned so we go into habitats where other creatures live take what we want and we don't care about the animals we don't we farm we kill all the mice and our little critters in there we don't care so I don't like the I don't think the argument makes sense that a more advanced civilization would come to earth and be like haha humans now you will serve us and it's our land now they would have completely ignore us and just start taking stuff and crushing us and ignoring us it wouldn't be but I don't I don't think that's the the most likely scenario either I think any any race sufficiently advanced enough to travel the massive size of the universe would have little need for the primitive elements on our planet and it actually be substantially easier for them to go to any other empty Rock no it's not true we have no idea no we have no idea what they need like what this might be an incredibly rare place incredibly rare as far as everything we've been able to observe they might come here because they found this Goldilocks planet that has liquid water and incredible biodiversity and more like than any other place on earth already a little place in the solar system you know the or in the known galaxy you know the eros planet theory right was that that's a leap there's an elliptical orbit for a planet that every 300 years comes in comes in close orbit to earth gets elliptical around our Sun yeah that's planet Nibiru Nibiru yeah yeah that they they used human slave labor for mining gold yes that's all zecharia sitchin yes it is I've heard the name and stuff he wrote a book called the 12th planet that's a fascinating take on the ancient Sumerian texts and he's widely been criticized by other scholars who understand ancient Sumerian yeah and there's actually a website called Sitchin is wrong see if you can go to it Sitchin is wrong calm because all the whack jobs like me who love the idea of you know all that's why we're so into gold man right because the aliens use these suspended gold particles and their atmosphere atmosphere to protect their atmosphere from deterioration by their you know in industrial use of chemicals and toxins has destroyed their environment so Sitchin is wrong calm is an interesting website and I don't know who's right or who's wrong and I think if you want to go over the Anunnaki and the ancient but what's really interesting and not just about Sitchin but about Sumer in general is one thing is they had these tablets these clay tablets that had a depiction of the galaxy or the depiction of the solar system now you're talking about 6000 BC they have this depiction of the solar system that shows the Sun in the center and it shows all of the planets in our known galaxy are known solar system with a proper perspective in terms of the size of the planet and the proper distance like they're in the right places it's not like there's a big one really close to the Sun then there's a little one three planets out like see if you can find that it's a weird image see that's the image yeah right yeah yeah they're the take that zecharia sitchin had was that they were trying to tell us that they have come from this other planet and they were trying to explain to us what our solar system is but just the they have this Sun in the center and then they have all the planets that we know of circling this Sun and this has been criticized like oh no they didn't do it riding it didn't do it first of all they did it in clay okay so relax there so it's so goddamn close that you would have to say man that might be what that is and if that is what that is what are they trying to say with this thing because there's also an image from a clay tablet of a very large being that has a very small human-like being with a monkey tail on its lap and this is what Sitchin points to as some sort of a depiction of the genetic engineering that took place to turn primitive primates into human beings this is the reason why we are so different from every other animal on this planet and the real thing that when when people talk about aliens and alien Kali what would aliens be doing here why would they do what if human beings are the product of accelerated evolution like what if they came down here they found this incredibly rich planet that's filled with biodiversity and all these different life forms and then they found these primates and like oh we know where these fuckers are going like this is us ten billion years ago or whatever the fuck it is let's accelerate this little party let's inject some of our super advanced DNA into these primates and let's see let's see where it takes itself so what do you think you think yeah that's a fun story right that's the story that they told Bob Lazar but Bob Lazar said I don't know if they told me that to throw us off the trail if it's disinformation or if it's just some wacky thing that they came up with to just like have a crazy story that the scientists couldn't tell anybody so if you do tell people like what are you working on I'm working on a reverse engineering a propulsion system from an aircraft that came from another planet and by the way right we are a product product of accelerated evolution they came to us and they injected our DNA and you know we'll think about that star in the context of ancient religions and a lot of the commonalities notably like Abrahamic this idea that we were created that we were told we shouldn't do certain things so I think these are all fun stories but yeah you could look at the idea of someone being the Son of God you know a hybrid right yeah you could look at the stories of regular ol Genesis taking the rib of Adam to creative well yeah the genetic matter sure and then manipulating it so you know I get I get a lot of heat from my more religious friends for pointing that out that I believe the Bible is more likely at an odds base to be about aliens and about the actual creator of the universe and I'm talking astronomical odds like ridiculously astronomical but I think we actually know some things exist genetic manipulation cargo cults we know how primitive life-form reacts to more advanced technologies they don't understand and that would would would make more sense to me than you know believing in a hard religion about the Creator and you know carpenter's son things like that yeah well it's also we're dealing with translations Yeah right that have gone on for thousands and thousands of years that are a story that was told as an oral tradition for a thousand years before that like boy the saying hard-and-fast exactly what they meant in the Bible and what this means and what must have happened for them to write that down to me is just bonkers I mean yeah who who knows but what we do know is that the older the stories get the weirder they get like that's one of the weird things about the ancient Sumerian texts is that you're dealing now you're in like the 6,000 years ago range yeah which is really weird like that's a long fucking time like oh I saw that conversation had that dude about the Sphinx I think he's I was like 9,000 BC or something well this is a Graham Hancock and or Robert Schoch Robert Schoch who's a geologist at Boston University is actually taken the time to examine the erosion around the outside of the Sphinx see the Sphinx itself has been worked on a lot there's been a lot of rehabilitation of the pause they've sort of rebuilt it which is kind of a shame but it's it's made out of a sort of a soft stone you know it's eroding and falling apart and when they found the Sphinx like when and found the Sphinx it was buried it was buried under sand so this is the thing that had been buried and reexpose many times they think throughout history and what Robert Schoch had found in discovering this the temple where the Sphinx was carved and the the area that surrounds us Fink's was this deep fissures in the walls that were indicative of thousands of years of rainfall the problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was 9,000 BC right right right so they're dealing with like in and you have to go back thousands of or 9,000 years ago might be 7000 BC but you have to deal with thousands of years of rainfall prior to that to create this so that means that this was something that was clearly carved by a man has thousands of years of rainfall that eroded it and you're dealing with a time period where the last time they had this rainfall in this area was thousands of years before they think people were even capable of building things like this maybe it was a lizard people you know that theory about the super intelligent dinosaurs that flood underground no there's so many wacky theories it's funny right what I'll roll my eyes at isn't it even slightly even tiny tiny bit more likely that humans came from a different planet and after they destroyed it and then receded and we lost our way of life yeah it's possible look if we're gonna go to Mars like what is the fucking origin tale gonna look like a hundred thousand years from now once we go to Mars let's take the the the climate change you know global warming stuff to its logical conclusion of rising tides and a greenhouse runaway greenhouse effect right so we we built one ship Elon Musk builds one ship with a very small crew of you know how many people are gonna be on that you know on his gotta have some chicks though yeah I think I already populate the earth right so it's got to be men and women and the people are gonna have to be boys heterosexuality is gonna be favored yeah because you really can't have gay people that aren't going to breed on a you know you have two lesbians like oh we need to have it only populated by lesbians well there's no more yes do you guys have buckets a sperm and a turkey baster cuz how else you gonna make people when you're over there I was reading that they're gonna go with people who are already coupled and they're gonna you know with like ten couples or whatever I don't know about you and most specifically but that was a lot of swapping normal space they did talk about there too I was reading like the the most optimal theory for colonizing Mars would be like amorous people something like ten people already coupled now that they're polyamorous but they expect there's gonna be commingling eventually expect commingling oh so it's Burning Man in space but but but check it out let's say let's say we sent a Mars expedition you know ten families we've got you know two of each start having kids they send cargo there they start building and then earth wipe itself up runaway greenhouse we can't get it control things nuclear war whatever right the planet becomes a desolate wasteland there's no more communication to those who are on Mars so the last remaining you know hundred or so people who are now on Mars the adults who remember earth write down a book here's everything happened here we shouldn't shouldn't do here's how he lived and they give to their kids now their kids never experienced earth and know nothing about it in fact those kids only have a fleeting image of the technology that they once had now go two more generations down the old tack where we used to colonize Mars is now decaying and falling apart they have no idea to fix it the original colonists are dead go down three more generations and I've got a few thousand humans start moving off looking for resources and no one has any idea earth even was a real thing other than stories they heard about the military leader in the in the in the orbital orbital Space Station who long since died so now they have this book they don't fully understand their language is now changing as they separate from each other and find different heirs of the planet now English or whatever language they were speaking becomes ten different languages now they're translating the book now it's a thousand years later they're not even on earth existed and they have this weird book about the way things used to be and now the billions of you know now we're ten thousand twenty thousand years in the future and they find you know these old ancient relics and they're like I wonder what if you don't even smoke pot dude no man I don't smoke imagine if you did oh my gosh you know did you'd have so many more of these theories one that's a good theory but I that's to me that's the logical conclusion that's why I like the story of like humans came from Venus not saying it's true there's a there's a oh there's a group of people from Africa that actually the the Dogon did Oh John people's that what is Dogon people and they they talked about the very specific area of Mars where human beings came from and they have a really weird understanding of cosmology like they they know some things that like hmm where'd you what and their their origin story is that people were living on Mars and that they destroyed Mars and how to escape Mars and come to earth and so it's sort of a very similar version of it and now when you add that to what they know about Mars that Mars used to be like a hospitable place to tell any water yeah nothing about this way to let's say that we had an orbital space station over the new planet we're terraforming mmm what kind of government would exist let's say earth is wiped out right the only survivors on an orbital space station over Mars with a small colony in the base it's gonna be a military dictatorship not intentionally not from this evil perspective but from a your the general your second-in-command we've always operated this way it's a military mission you know the person who's in charge is in charge and then eventually you build up the colony to a certain point where second and second in command or one of the favorite lieutenant says it's time to enact democracy and the general says fuck no and then a civil war breaks out in the heavens people on the ground watching the ships shoot at each other and blow each other up and then all the technology gets wiped out you should really start smoking pot no no you know what you know but there's a lot of ways to interpret like various ancient spiritual religious texts in science fictiony kind of way so I actually you know talk to my friends about this we like kind of what if what if the Bible and and you know the Old Testament were viewed from a science fiction perspective not to be disrespect I'm not trying to disrespect anyone's religion anything like that but like what if we tried to apply a lens of from a futuristic perspective of our understanding of Technology to how they may have viewed what was going on back then so you know what the cargo cults are yes for those that don't it's you know these natives on these islands saw planes didn't know if they were so they built effigies of the planes like I guess hoping they'd come back or whatever right so I saw that I wondered you know a lot of people ask that question what if we did the same thing with aliens and the other question is what would we do if we destroyed our own planet like people say we are and how would that how would that you know result in a government how that resulting stories it would be so fun if we destroy this planet we go to Mars and repopulate Mars and fix it up and then destroy that place and come up at Earth after we're done cuz I look at what's going on right now during this pandemic the skies are clear than ever before the Venice canals in Italy of dolphins in them now you can see the ground jellyfish you realize how disgusting we are and yeah we're gross like what we've done the Los Angeles is amazing and in just a month and a half the air is pristine crystal-clear you can see forever it's a different world now imagine if that's what happens if we go to Mars we fucked that place up come back to earth look it's fixed we're back you know I guess if we can sustain our technology yeah did you find one Dogon tribe find that it actually says talking about see Siri right but didn't they have something about Mars as well I typed literally that and Mars and that just took me to serious stuff instead of Mars serious yeah the star Sirius but they understand they have a story or if you can it's a it's a weird thing in terms of like the cosmology like what they understand and this is you know relatively primitive tribe that has this origin story well it's like the end of they find earth the fucking new Battlestar Galactica is so good isn't it yeah it's one of the reason trade yeah then the more recent one one of the most underrated science fiction series ever it was so good well not not to act like my ideas are original the series ends with them discovering the habitable planet yes with what did it spoiler alert spoiler alert with a species that's compatible with them yeah they find primitive humans yes and so if that story you know it's an interesting story yes we would lose all knowledge of the previous planets and technology and well imagine if we flew to another planet for the first time we landed there and it's like 1940s America like whoa or maybe do if we could fuck them you know they'd be so impressed with you well what if what if we find a spaceship underground with ancient Tech and we don't know what it is in turn that's ours the Dogon tribe the Nomo and they're fascinating cosmic knowledge deep in northwest Africa more precisely in Mali we find one of the oldest most fascinating ancient cultures to develop on earth so the ancient Dogon tribe is known for the religious traditions ritual dances their massive ritual masks their wooden sculptures in their architecture however they're also known for their incredible astronomical knowledge and their fascinating mythological accounts the Dogon have a compelling ancient tradition they mentioned myths and legends that go thousands of years into the past predating possibly even their own history some authors like Robert Schoch who's also the guy from Boston University he's the geologist that talked about the Sphinx argue that the Dogon were people who originated in Africa but who had been forced to leave ancient Egypt due to their religious persecutions it is in his opinion that the Dogon may preserve ancient Egyptian traditions and myths that may even have been carried into the present age claiming that the Dogon have a powerful cosmic connection I can go on for this will take too long to read yeah cuz I'm just gonna just whelmed so what is that coincidence ancient knowledge well it's just they understand the the cosmos and you could you'd have to go and hear the story but it's a it's a weird story it's a weird like oh how do they know this like what what a weird origin story but you've seen zeitgeist yeah yes where where you know the first time he talks about the three kings of Orion's belt pointing to the star in the east where the Sun rises in the third day yeah yeah maybe maybe their stories are just just that you know we look what could we do but stare at the sky and that's a good point yeah when you stop and look if you were traveling across the country as you were did you get a chance to stop and look in the middle of nowhere at this at the sky of course fucking amazing yeah there's Nick Ulis there's a grouse that were robbed of that yeah and it wasn't it there's a story that I think in Los Angeles the power went out there's blackout in the 90s and the police got tons of calls from people who didn't know what they were seeing in the sky it was the Milky Way galaxy those are the same people that are injecting lice all right now they aren't though you know well somebody might it's probably a few yeah well you know if you're gonna what about how chloroquine thing you know when the one form of chloroquine that was but the the form that was a pond cleaner oh yes husband but here's the thing the lady wasn't she like a democratic contributor and donor she treated that Donald Trump was a psycho like that and and her and her husband took the stuff well there's new reporting that says the husband was an engineer his friends are shocked that he would do something so stupid so the wife poison him that's the theory that's going around now now the the FairPoint brought up I think it was a free beacon is that he trusted his wife and he loved her Wow poor she's really dumb but I'm fuck out of apparently a couple decades ago she had struck him there's a report about it Oh decades ago yeah twenty years I think but there's also reports and you gotta factor this stuff for sure because it's not like something I've been diving too much too deep into but she was trying divorce the guy so the story popping up is that donor Carol Baskin of chloroquine that's what people have been saying yeah like the rumors going around but whether or not any that's true it's like you know I always say give me the proof but I can't tell you this the media loves to run everything the president says through a filter of like it must be taken literally or to its worst most the opposite have benefited out the the most negative conclusion possible if he says it we're gonna run the most negative interpretation it's bad it's awful you know so when he says something like you know that Peter Navarro instance where he said you know you're nasty reporter he said about hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine it might work it might not but I'm optimistic what are the press run with Trump recommends untested dangerous drug meanwhile you get a scrupulous Proust no no press room with that right right of course but but look when Andrew Cuomo came out and said we're gonna start trialing you know chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and is it her Meissen where was the negative press didn't they say that that has actually been proven to kill more people than not using it though the one six yeah one of the initial stories to come out said that it actually more likely to kill so the CDC had listed that this was actual treatment used by many countries and we have there's a lawmaker in Michigan she's a Democrat she was given the treatment she had saved her life and she personally praised the president for it for that she's being censured and being stripped of any I've heard of that it sounds crazy it is it is there's a reason why they were using it these shouts it showed some promise with some people I guess the idea was that the the extreme immune system reaction in your lungs was killing people mm-hmm the swelling and the fluid buildup so by suppressing the immune system you would stop that from happening these symptoms would abide and you'd eventually recover you know what man if the media that there's a graph showing the amount of press Obama got versus Trump what Trump got and I think to a certain degree Trump thoughts on himself because he chased after this press and he baits them and he goes after them right but it's like three or four times as much news but it's also a different world now if you go back to 2000 Oh 8 2008 rather when Obama was elected the influence of like online media and the ability to pull eyes away from traditional media sources was nothing was nothing people newspapers were still real people are buying newspapers yeah I mean the mainstream media was the only way you got your news now there's people like you you know there's there's there's people like kolinsky or jimmy dore there's there's people like the hill they have these online platforms where this is they're not only they more viable than the traditional media outlets they're more accurate they're they're less biased they're they're younger or more intelligent and they're not connected to some gigantic media machine that has a very consistent bias I think we're seeing substantially more bias than ever before and seeing from online things wrote from from from into everything from everything but it starts with it people like me so look I'm an individual I have an opinion there are things that I think are more important to other things I look at this establishment press this behemoth constantly lying to people not every single journalist I know many journalists they're fantastic their jobs they risk their lives they do good stories even political reporters you know my respect to Ben Smith formerly of BuzzFeed news now time's calling out the New York Times well sort of for their defense of Joe Biden calling out CNN great reporters but you have a lot of people in media who's their goal is just survive make money and so what happens with YouTube one of the reasons I think they started censoring a lot of channels is what works shock content sensational rage bait mm-hmm so YouTube's hard suppresses that it's not entirely fair but there's no real good answer to how you deal with this and it's unfair to a lot of independent creators because like you mentioned YouTube doesn't know better they're like who's credible but CNN starts adopting the same tactic so now you know CNN realize and they can't win no matter what they do they're competing with with free videos on Facebook you know you know mom-and-pop who post that video from the rally on Facebook cost them nothing they don't care and CNN's got to pay someone 30 to 50 thousand dollars a year at a low level to make this kind of content they're losing so they switched it up now we're being told that there are counter built you know are a credible you're credible news outlets authoritative sources they're the same thing as what the youtubers were look I mean when you get Don Lemon going on on the show asking if a black hole swallowed an airplane how's that any different from the crackpots on it was Don Lemon asked a guest if a black hole swallowed the missing Malaysian airplane wait a minute he was serious he said I know it's preposterous but is it preposterous and the woman responded never to see the totally yeah Don Lemon Don Lemon asked about black hole swung airplane I get a kick out of him okay I like when he gets mad but it's performative it's not real news so you know I think it's great that I think we're seeing a certain kind of creator emerge that are good I think Jimmy and Kyle are awesome I think I do a good job don't think I'm perfect but I think we're all biased and so that's why I always tell people you can't just watch me like you definitely got to watch Kyle Pakman or jimmy dore and i get a lot of heat cuz people like you always recommend these left-wing channels oh my god right steven crowder you know for instance sticks accent hammer these are good good youtube channels but we're biased I think we all try to be as honest as we can these big corporate channels are trying to survive they don't care about honesty so brian Stelter on CNN actually said he shows a bunch of videos from fox news and says don't watch the spin watch us we're gonna give you the facts don't look man if someone you not to seek information outside I wouldn't trust that I don't want to tell you what to listen to but I will tell you if you only watch my stuff you're missing out you got to watch other perspectives I want to see Don Lemon and brian Stelter unmake Adana frayed out in the woods you get trapped by saying the black hole thing he did it this is from 2014 oh yeah was that when it was from I think so yeah a while ago I'm hear him say that something fully that we don't really understand a lot of people have been asking about that about black holes and on and on and on and all of these conspiracy theories let's look at this Noah says what else can you think about black hole Bermuda Triangle and then desi says huh just like the movie lost and of course it's also they're also referencing the twilight zone which is a very similar plot that's what people are saying I know it's preposterous but is it preposterous you think Mary well it is a black holes about you know a small black hole would suck in our entire universe so we know it's not that muted triangle is often weather and lost is TV show so I think okay he's just being provocative to get someone to answer a silly questions be sure and heed about on the Internet he's not saying it like he believes it no no what I mean is that he's presenting the conversation that's what's become it's become well I think he's doing entertainment because first of all back then I mean this was 2014 September 20 feet I think people were just starting to understand like the impact of comments and and they were addressing them and they were probably trying to silence a lot of the nonsense but then you get a woman stupid chilly a small black hole with small small of the whole universe yeah well I don't think she's a real expert if she said that right so why is Don Lemon asking nonstic equestions to pay to guests who can't answer them properly at all well he's just trying to be provocative I get it I get it and so what I mean to say is that you're watching must've look at where they were in 2014 look where they are now with faking the Chris Cuomo thing they've that's his idea the the Chris Cuomo know pretty gross did you hear what he said on his radio show know what he said he said I don't find value in what I do I think it's ridiculous he said I don't like what I do for a living I don't like an I think you know and then he said something defective I'll never beat them in reference to like Hannity and Maddow or some like that I think in my person in ratings yeah and rating so he's their biggest show he is I'm pretty sure Cuomo is their biggest show yeah this is the only one that seems to be a man and he doesn't crack a million in the ratings really yeah it's like eight and I think it's like 800 to 900 I think he periodically might the ratings might be going up I could be wrong so check the latest ATS but I hear something Kevin I think that the CEO producers went to him and said look man you you got this thing like we should we should we should run with it let's like go to your house we'll film it we'll make it this big deal I think so and I think it wasn't that bad I think he had mild symptoms look the dude went out the guy left his home he was you know when he was talking about the the issues he was having he was he seemed normal right like here's what I don't expect from someone who is as sick as he seemed to be I don't feel that good but hey I'm one of the lucky ones now he's normal yeah that's what I would expect he's saying he's shivering so hard he's chipping his teeth seems ridiculous yeah doesn't seem I don't know I mean maybe when it's night time and you're tired because one of the things I remember last time I was sick was quite a while ago at the end of the night I'd be like really a key because I was tired and I was as I was tired my immune system would be depleted and then I would feel the effects of the cold more and then you wake up in the morning you feel a lot better maybe pop some ibuprofen I know he was taking tylenol so it's supposed to take ibuprofen for this for some reason well he said I think he was taking time for Michael yo said that he was told to take ibuprofen and when he did it made it way worse no yeah well so so here's what can I say I'm not gonna accuse the guy a lot of people are for any and everything got sick I don't think that's the case he probably got sick he tested positive but right I think he it seemed fairly mild in comparison to other people like Michael yo when I talked to him what first of all when he was doing a video talking about recovering from it was coughing yeah and in the video he was coughing when he was talking about our Instagram I'm thanking everybody but he had a bad case of it where he got pneumonia and it was rough and you know Michael's a healthy guy so that was disturbing to me but the Chris Cuomo version of virus didn't seem that scary the dude wasn't quarantined okay he went out to some property 30 minutes from his home presumably with his family he was witnessed by somebody else not supposed to do that right no you're not I mean it's not just that but on CNN they said he was locked down right they did this whole reveal where he comes out of the basements I've been waiting for this do a tick-tock dance with his daughters I don't know I think he did but I think the reason he went on his show complaining was because the movies coming the producers told him to do this fake thing and he didn't want to do it he want you look man I worked when I make sense he can't call them out cuz he wants to keep the job when I worked for you know one of these companies they told me to side with the audience we talked about it last time I was here mm-hmm they wanted me to create a narrative that the audience agreed with because we were there to serve them what was the narrative young progressives whatever they say so social justice so whatever young progressives say I'm gonna side with that and I told him I asked are you saying that if there is a factual news story that would be upsetting to audience we won't cover it he said I think that's fair yeah what was it that Oh a OC said recently that people shouldn't go back to work the didn't revolt like they should yeah they should protest like not go back to work that to me was one of the craziest things I've ever heard a politician saying like if anything we need to get the goddamn economy back on track I wonder if she's gonna lose in her primary she's gone up against a woman named Michelle Caruso Cabrera who is a moderate who actually sounds very reasonable and it and it kind of breaks my heart a bit because I remember how Democrats used to be I'm like you can look at the thing she talks about and she's a very reasonable like she's got like a book she was an anchor for some I think for like CNBC or something and she comes off like I don't know kind of like maybe you were me just how what used to be left before they went became radical activists and for social justice why do you think they went that way why do you think every social I mean you think so yeah so you know there's a couple different theories I have on it conservatives are less likely to be on line in a lot of areas of the country they have weaker internet all right but they're so active online they dominate for sure and that's one of the reasons they're like you know they get wiped out a lot but you look at room you'll be talking about conservatives yeah yeah conservatives getting banned a whole lot because they're very active they do a lot of memes but I think so how are you saying that they're less likely to have good internet rural rural towns have really bad internet but are you good enough to be able to post on Twitter like what do you mean no yes it has phones but with if you've got dial-up in the middle of the country you're not posting a video or a photo on your phone you are watching dial-up yeah that's true ones doing it through their phones that's a good point all right what I think is that you've got a lot of older people that are conservative a lot of younger people that are liberal and there's there's issues there with how people interact online mm-hmm so my assumptions my opinions things I've read older people more likely to just follow and read younger people more likely to engage most people not likely to engage at all it's something I think like 2% of a country action is actually acting around Twitter yeah but you end up with internal biases the social media companies who is authoritative and who isn't echo chambers so a really good example is like BuzzFeed news wrote a story that the wuhan bio lab leak theory is a right wing you know popular right wing theory Trump supporters are pushing it and here's why it's wrong but CNN ran multiple segments about this and so when when you have digital media framing things as always like you ever wonder why they never say left-wing you know like in the media they'll say conservatives did X they never say liberals did X because they view themselves as those people right so you end up with social media companies that view that kind of content as authoritative left-leaning you end up with left-wing activists and acceptable marketability there was a study done where they tracked essentially like it's a visualization of location for various aspects of than the Internet conservatives are in this bubble liberals in this bubble marketing digital marketing companies overlapped with resistance Twitter anti-trump so what ends up happening is big marketing firms based in New York City based in Los Angeles very urban areas much more likely to be blue have a blue perspective they run commercials based on a left-wing perspective politicians see it with the television is saying they see what the websites are saying and they say this is what America wants it's not it's what the hyperactive 2% of Twitter wants so they fall into that trap where they believe all this stuff the reason Ocasio cortez became got elected she won I think she got 17,000 votes district of 750,000 like that's not winning a real election but I was an exploit it was exploiting the system so you end up with someone who has views that don't represent the overwhelming majority this country in a very high-profile position influencing Nancy Pelosi and what you know one of the reasons they think they even went for with impeachment was because Ocasio Cortes gave a statement where she said it was a bigger scandal that the Democrats would not impeach Trump next thing we know Nancy Pelosi hops on board with the idea and that blew up in their face Trump ends up seeing his approval rating go up he raises a ton of money it would be really interesting if what did him in was the Lysol shit oh that was bad for him though yeah but I don't think yeah I don't think it'll be it what do you think is gonna happen in November as of right now there's the panic factor could be good for Trump the fact that we're in a crisis may mean people are desperate for security and they don't want to take a chance they don't take any chances and Trump is a bully like I don't mean it necessarily as like you know to the Trump supporters get mad what I mean is like he's he pushes people around and a lot of people like that about him that he yells the press what a lot of people on the Left don't get is when he yelled at that CNN guy you're a nasty reporter his base was clapping standing up saying thank you for finally calling these people out right it was a good thing you take that attitude next to Biden do you think Biden's gonna make anybody feel safe nah man I don't think so so the argument I've put forward is look man I'm a moderate person my politics have always been left-leaning pro-choice progressive tax government programs all this good stuff grew up in a city but I'm not super far left I need an argument from you Donald Trump has come forward with the economy was booming lost unemployment in 50 years best numbers of our lives up until the pandemic he instituted a travel ban that they dumped the Democrats are even agreeing with at this point if you want to convince me to vote for you and many people like me I think you got to give me an argument as to why Biden is better but they're not they're saying stay alive Joe Biden we just don't like Trump but they really they really are they're really doing it it's a good point and I think if the economy does manage to show some signs of resurgence around November in in you know towards October in September if he has some sort of a real rock-solid plan and he can show you where it's going this is what we're planning on doing this we're going have this by that and that by this by the way Joe Biden is not gonna get better his cognitive decline is going to increase and it kidding it could drop right off of a fuckin cliff you might come around to where November is where the gaffes are constant and they pull him off of the public eye and they never show him if the Democrats want to win they'll run Michelle Obama we might have a fucking CGI Joe Biden with I'm not kidding where he does it from some sort of a remote location and they CGI the shit out of his his face well I'll tell you one thing that there's there's some net positive Trump could look at in terms of the pandemic worried you know people trust him his approval rating was going up when they were televising his his press briefings as soon as they stopped doing that as proof writing start going back down so when people hear what he was saying they liked it but the other big factor is if this persists beyond the election Joe Biden will never debate him and we see this in the press right now everyone keeps saying it the more the longer Joe Biden is hidden the batter his campaign is doing because people can't see him struggling the speaker just going against Trump mail and voting I agree with you about Michelle Obama but I don't think she really wants to run well I didn't I'm not sure she would either but I'm saying that's there I think they would win if they ran her they probably would mail and voting I think will be the downfall Republicans if if Mahlon voting does get pushed through Nancy Pelosi I believe she said she wants to have mail-in voting confirmed the next stimulus package if the lockdown persists beyond November November and mail-in voting is the go-to way the the challenge you see a bunch of Republicans saying that mail-in voting could lead to fraud and it can write if somebody's mom is like you know old and just like not paying attention and you fill out for her but the bigger issue I see for Republicans is that uninitiated and uninterested people will be voted for and that means in big urban areas you'll have a mom and a dad telling their kids who normally don't care to vote just fill it out just fill it out just vote for the guy and that could potentially hurt I thumped the real concern is in the counting that's the concern but in terms of fraud right fraud is so the Republicans main concern is fraud then someone's gonna take their kids packin just flat-out for them right but I don't think not just that also in how it's counted right tracking them the algorithm mailbox in the post office so a mess I agree with all that no I think I think you don't need to go so far as to assume some is going to snatch up all the ballots it's possible and replace them I think that's a bit too much for me I just think right now we know the youth vote swings left and they don't care about voting you put the ballot in their house they don't they didn't turn out for Bernie they did not turn out they turned out in some areas but they didn't turn out so you get this very active base online ranting about what they want they don't actually go out for it put the bat in their pocket send it to their mailbox and their mom says there it is fill it out they're gonna do it and so that's gonna make sure the people who normally aren't bothered to go vote will go vote Tim Poole we just did three hours know it or not it's always fun thanks for taking the trip thanks for driving over here in your bug out van it's good fun how long you stay this part of the country probably leave right away okay yeah good luck come to Shannon and maybe people wave to you along the way yeah you have photos of the van the outside where people could see it on Instagram I have one she probably heard that one do we got one ever man someone's gonna come in my van and kick it in I don't know that's not what I'm saying there's gonna tattoo your face on their ass or something something weird people are weird man I had a weird story I didn't get to it good denials I had a I had a crazy guy show up in my house ooh pedophile 4:00 in the morning wanted me to tell a story I had to call the cops wanted you to tell him a story wanted me to tell the world his story about being a pedophile I saw him like that about about how he was innocent it wasn't true so she shows up miles at 4:00 a.m. tried breaking in so I wake up at 4:00 a.m. - son of a gun either I don't have a gun and so I call the police this is crazy police showed up they catch the guy they first Kim they tell him to go home cops come back tell me to buy a gun basically oh jeez it's not easy thing to do but get this that morning I wake up it's like 9 a.m. and I got woken up at like 4:00 a.m. by this I think was like 3 something and so normally I do a segment first thing in the morning airs at 10:00 a.m. and so after dealing with all that I was like I am not prepared I'm just gonna tell people what happened and say don't come to my house in the middle of recording my segment that comes back so I checked my security camera and I see him there and I'm filming while it's happening so I call the police and I'm like he's back and I recorded all of it and then the cops came and he took off I guess yeah I was gonna bring it up cuz we were talking about you know the end of the world the apocalypse guns so it's not easy to go to New Jersey the cops were like if we're me I'd open the door with a shotgun and I was like yeah if I could get one in Jersey but you can you just have to wait 10 days right no you got to write an essay I got to write an essay on why I need it yeah and then you have to be accepted and then they have to approve the essay and they said they said typically takes 30 days but sometimes it can take up to a year it's not supposed to take up to a year that's kind of illegal that's what I was told at the department but they're like a move to Arizona or you could just buy a gun in a grocery stores for jigna so are you gonna go oh I don't know man I'm gonna leave I'm I'm gonna move out of Jersey nah yeah for sure so I'm in the Philly area because of this partly yeah but also because I want to expand my business you know I look I do opinion commentary on news stories and now it's time to start hiring more people for four straight news in fact checking so there's been I have a fact-checking build-out that I've been working on how we're gonna write other agencies we're gonna do a hundred randomly sampled articles and we're gonna run them through the spj and Reuters ethics codes we're going to look for violations of the ethics codes we're gonna apply them so if BuzzFeed news runs a hundred stories and we find that 63 are have some kind of violation of a code of ethics we give them the score of you know 37 out of a hundred mm-hmm and then people can see how we rate these agencies and you can look at all the stories you can look at exactly why we disagreed and we'll highlight where the violation occurred that's a great idea so I need a building so I can hire people to do it beautiful well let me know when that gets up and running we'll let everybody know and appreciate you man I really appreciate your perspective I appreciate you a the way you look at things and it was great to talk to you as a man for sure thank you but
