let's do it for one boom hello Travis what's going on thanks man thanks for doing this we shit stuff to be here it's cool to have you hey so I wanted to talk about what we're talking about right before we start I've always watched you play drums and I'm like how the fuck does that guy's arms not fall off I mean you you have so much repetitive motion I've never understood how you could do that just barely know I pull this thing like right up like a fist from your face there we go I always do battle ropes oh okay that happened that most constantly like I'll do thirty minutes you know not high-intensity the whole time but just keep my shoulders and arms moving as I prepare for a tour but yeah I think my wrist my wrist probably have gone through the most hell over the years like I just feel like just normal people's wrist strength that probably don't have because there's been so much grinding like they popping oh Jesus do all sorts of weird things but yeah but I'm still you know I feel like because I do battle ropes and because I boxing the kind of workout fast twitch muscles I really don't get tired that's it's amazing like because so many people have repetitive stress injuries yeah I mean even secretaries they get carpal tunnel you know people get who write a lot get carpal tunnel okay so getting injuries on their thumbs from you know fucking run with their phone too much yeah I felt like when I smoked cigarettes a lot I was feeling kind of the first symptoms of that stuff I wasn't drinking a lot I was kind of a dumpster on tour you know not really taking care of my body and I could really feel it and then you are you still vegan yeah and you run that restaurant right um with crossroads or it's one of your one of the owners running it is saying a lot I couldn't be that shouldn't said running no towel towel Ronin is the man he's like the illest vegan chef ever he's like an old punk rock hardcore guy like new john joseph yeah john joseph keeps trying to get me to go there and i almost went last time he was in town with them next time i'm gonna make it down there I think probably 80 to 90% of the people that eat their arm vegan cuz it's that good yeah that's what I hear Dana White's all that yeah uh uh yeah Dana we have dinner there when he's in town so I think for Dana to be able to sit through it and enjoy it and Matt Sarah I think he brought everyone for like I don't know if it was like fight companion it was like no it was yeah it was Dana White's looking for a fight yeah tube show yeah I was on tour but they FaceTime me from there but yeah towels like a G he's the best vegan chef in the world by far that's cool how did you get involved with that is it well you were you already you're cleaning your diet up because of your your injuries or because you were trying to keep your body tuned for drumming or you just wanted to clean it up period now I was vegetarian since I was 13 really yeah and then after my accident I was in the hospital actually long story that that I'll just sum up Indo this is real plain accent yeah yeah and I had to eat meat in the hospital because they didn't have any other kind of vegan options of protein Saudi bags of beef jerky whatever they would give me whatever I could stomach and not like kind of like think about what I was eating because I wasn't eating at all and I was just ditching my food giving it to my friends because I didn't want to eat any of it and I got caught so long story short I did a little bit of meeting in the hospital and when I got out I just felt like the next evolution of my eating would would try and be vegan and it was so easy in LA because we have so many great vegan restaurants so yeah that was that was pretty much it I was already vegan I was actually at a bad brain show one of the the best hardcore bands in the world to ever ever do it and towel approached me there saying hey I had this idea for a restaurant I'd really like to be you know you to be involved and I said say no more just tell me what you need because I do think about it all before because it's a weird thing to approach someone with it hey man thinking about opening up a restaurant yeah I need this drummer yeah right no I think he was just reaching out to friends and family cuz he was he was Oprah chef and he was Ellen DeGeneres chef and he was all these like you know really high-profile people's vegan chef when they would you know do a vegan diet for however long some some forever so I'm just like a two-week thing but I think he just got to the point where he wants to do something for himself and then crossroads was born and I knew how good he was so I just told him say no more tell me what you need from me and I'm there and then it just you know think it's been five years now well it's got a fantastic reputation yeah I know a bunch of people that have eaten there and they loved it well it's not because of me it's because of town and its food for sure yeah at Allen Scott the chefs they're just you know the best now how hands-on were you in the we just one of the people promoting it like how hands-on were you with the construction of it or nothing with like the decor or anything he would run stuff by us like hey check this out to us what you guys think of this as you know there's basically menus change every season so it's not the same menu all year long so as we prepare for the next season's menu he's like testing it on us the you know the season prior mm-hmm so he'll be bringing out dishes and and letting us try it but yeah he curates the whole thing that's interesting so when he gets his food when he's preparing his food like is he getting his stuff directly from farmers like how how is he getting his food yeah directly from Allen's yeah so he has to curate these relationships with these farmers and just go visit them and find out how they're growing their food yeah and and you know you'll be all set with a menu if it's fall but then those same vegetables aren't in season so he has to rethink everything for the next season and not kind of repeat himself so it's really he's really got it down to a science and how long has he been vegan for I don't know how long talisman vegan I've never really asked because it's got to be incredibly difficult to be a vegan chef I would imagine being a regular chef is difficult but when you put all those restrictions you know and you just you have to make things taste interesting and and different and yeah I think that's where chef Scott comes in because he's actually comes from a meat background so he was working at Italian restaurants and Italian Mediterranean restaurants that cooked everything so it was infusing this vegan obviously like lifestyle of eating with you know chef Scott's tastes as well so I think he had to think that out to where it would appeal and and meat-eaters would eat there too and not really notice a difference I agree you know sometimes I'll be on tour when you go to a vegan spot and I'll take my bus driver in or my whoever's traveling me and they're like oh man this is rough you know they can't stand it crossroads is not one of those spots where you're thinking about like man I might not enjoy this meal there's some good spots in the LA has some great spots you ever go to follow your heart in the valley all the time great spot yeah that's the spot close to home that I love like follow your heart shout out to Erewhon everyone has like good vegan options chef Vito who has a spot in downtown called Alec who took a vow of silence 22 years ago yeah well uh the special man yet 22 years ago took a vow of silence and he's done no more talking no more talking what in the fuck is that about yeah so he just communicates if he he has a lot to say he'll write it down you just read the lips and I know what he's saying but he shows up oh that's so crazy yeah he takes a lot of photos so he'll show up to like punk or raps whatever whatever show I'm playing he's in the pit with his camera this silent guy who doesn't say a word yeah and his cooking is phenomenal so but yeah LA were spoiled with great great being in restaurant that's a fucking trip yeah 22 years of no talking yeah he also does like this juicing where this year he juiced for a hundred and eighty-nine days with no food Wow wouldn't he get down to I think he was yeah he lost about 20-something pounds fuck yeah he does it every year Wow yeah he's trying to vanish right do not talk I don't think I could read yeah intermittent fasting is like as much as I can do yeah I do that every night but that's the vow science is freaking me that silence is freaking me out yeah he and I I've never really pried and kind of like asked a bunch of questions why doesn't even have to write a lot yeah that too but no I've been around when people ask him he just said he wanted a timeout for 22 years yeah that's a serious fucking timeout how old is homeboy he's got to be probably in his 50s so almost half his life yeah what the fuck man yes but he spends Christmas with me spends things with my family and I oh that's cool everybody smiles on him yeah everyone just smiles and waves basically he'd be a good guy to sit next to someone who's on coke told her they would just talk his fucking ear off he just be sitting there all silent yeah yeah fuck man that is I've never even heard of anything like that does he make any noises as you whistle no I've heard him snore at one time when he was laughing hella hard but that was about as close as it gets so he doesn't laugh out loud like hahaha Wow nothing terrible comedy club audience me yeah yeah it would be rough he has a March - it's called March of silence that happens once a year where you have a bunch of them that basically you know that are and they're basically marching for the March of silence for like the cruelty of animals and whatever else so yeah I'd like to have them on the podcast to see how long I could talk to him for yeah just to see what it would be like that's so strange it sounds cool I mean yeah I love that there's people like that out there though I do I love hearing those stories like the world needs him you know like when you said that I got excited yeah the guy's been silent whoa you know there's something about that it makes you go wow I was talking hello loud when I first met him because I was trying to wrap my head around you know no one did an introduction going hey this guy's silent tell you know I had no idea so I'm talking really loud he like he like just whispers to me like mouse to me I can hear you and I was like okay and then I just figured out over time Wow silent by choice whoo yeah that's heavy what is he involved like heavy meditation or Buddhism or anything very strange like that yeah he meditates I think he I was like a lot of kind of Buddhist kind of qualities like kind of I think he had a lean in some kind of religion or practice it would be that Wow yeah that's intense yeah that's a serious commitment man yeah I could even imagine going 22 days without talking a day I think any anything I think we'd catch ourselves it being very hard well I was gonna get my tonsils and adenoids removed because I have sleep apnea because I have a fat neck but I found a mouthpiece that I can sleep with that keeps my tongue from falling over because I have a when when your neck is thick your wind hole is smaller believe it or not because the more muscle you put in the small your your hole gets and then if you have a big tongue when you lay back you can actually block your airway Wow yeah and so friends that I know have had their adenoids and their tonsils removed and they actually take some of the soft tissue out of your your passageway so you can breathe easier but the problem is you can't talk for like seven days yeah that would probably be rough for you the main yeah yeah and I wonder if wide neck you know like that the the internet phenomenon is the same problem I get that guy must sleep terrible yeah yeah his neck starts up here it's crazy his neck starts at the top of his ears yes its way to his shoulders tonsils out is a it's a bum out I did that did you yeah did you have tonsillitis now you know what I had is I had I was smoking tons of weed right like but I would smoke backwards like I love the woods so yeah everything yeah so I'd smoke about 20 20 backwards a day he's like yeah and I was recording an album with the transplants and I turned to skinhead Robin I was like I think I think I have something like someone's lodged in my throat like I could barely breathe right now and kept smoking didn't even you know I didn't I didn't really know what was going on and then I went to the hospital that night and they rushed me to another hospital to get my tonsils removed because they were like twice the size that they should be and then I had a throat infection and then it comes to find out I had what's called like Barrett's esophagus which is like pre-cancer wrote lining my esophagus from smoking and I don't know I guess just abuse over the years so that was that's what led to my tonsils being pulled out these are serious think about this like you probably shouldn't smoke too many of these because now it's just plain tobacco love I love him--no I got to a point where I couldn't smoke joints I couldn't smoke out of a bong yeah a pipe it had to be a backward that's where I am yeah that's bottle of it I like him did you ever smoke cigarettes no see I did I smoked a lot of cigarettes and then I quit smoking cigarettes just smoked weed and then I discovered backwoods and I was kind of getting a little bit of both still getting the tobacco that I missed but yeah yeah my friend Ari said that he started smoking spliffs in England you know and when he was over in the UK they next the weed with the tobacco and he got totally hooked on tobacco again because he had quit cigarettes for years and then he started smoking the weed mixed with the tobacco and before he knew it he was smoking cigarettes again yeah so he smoked while he was over there and then he quit as soon as he was done and then came back to you u.s. yeah I feel like they just started smoking just pure weed over there Geoffrey yeah for years it was both yeah I don't understand that like had that how'd that work out over there yeah it's still so illegal over there - it's like jesus fucking christ it's 2019 fellas let's get at times when I used to fly over there we'd have to tape tons of weed to our nuts just just to be able to end our road cases just so we could smoke over there because they had dirt weed yeah it was horrible weed but yeah it was a pain in the ass it's fucking dangerous bringing that stuff overseas though yeah if you get arrested that's that's serious yeah I brought it so I'd bring it everywhere like that and we went to talk about heap like gaff tape Jesus man I feel like you've heard of the first layer of your nuts off when you go to grab your weed but yeah we would do that and then it's a commitment though yeah I actually brought it I made the big mistake of not bringing a bunch but I got to Iraq we went to Iraq for like right when the war broke out what was it like 2003 or 2004 and we were over there and and scandalous Estevan Oriol the photographer he's over there with us documenting the whole thing and I pull it out because we're at this this Airport in Bahrain but I feel like it's a field and no one's gonna mess with us and he's like hey bro look look at look at the back you fucking passport look what it says and it says right there like you're basically like they'll kill you if the if find you know you brought any drugs into Iraq or you know where we were ball rain so I did away with everything and I just kind of took up drinking I know not really much of a drinker but do you still smoke weed I don't know I have a friend who's like a dear friend is like cool like young doctor named dr. B in San Diego and I called them he actually removed my my tonsils and then like a week later I found out I had what was called pre-cancer Barrett's esophagus I said what does this mean doctor be shy just like kind of like kind of like toned down like how much I'm smoking he's like no this means like this is your warning shot like pay attention stop smoking esophageal cancer is a rough one too that's what killed Christopher Hitchins really yeah yeah it's uh that's a rough one that kills a lot of fucking people once you get it you get it and you're gone yeah it's cute I think kills like I think hitch said like 95% of the people get it now yeah so I felt like he's always pretty honest with me you know I just stopped like I love CBD yeah that's pretty much what I messed with now but that's all do you find that you see a lot of people use CBD and they find that it alleviates anxiety and lets some sleep better do you find that yeah as long as I take like triple or quadruple the amount that it says to take on the bottle right because I feel like what I take if I take what the proper dosage is it doesn't do much but I'm one of those people whose minds racing constantly I'll get home from the studio at 1 or 2 and I'm just like kind of like figuring out how long I gotta sleep before I get to wake up my kids and go to school and I just sit there with my wheel spinning unless I use CBD and then that kind of helps and then I had I have what's called trigeminal neuralgia have you ever heard of that no it's the fucking worst it's called the suicide disease because basically all of your nerves and your face are firing all at the same time so it almost feels like what you feel when you think you need a root canal or you have like a tooth that's messed up but I got trigeminal neuralgia and I've only had 4 episodes but when I do get it I use CBD and it it's been amazing but if you get up a lot of people will go actually go to a dentist get a bunch of root canals done that they don't need or they don't know how to treat it and usually people kill themselves whoa yeah it's gnarly I didn't really know about I just was homeland and I was like what the fuck like my face is burning hmm it's miserable onic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve which carries a sensation for your face to your brain if you have trigeminal neurology even mild stimulation of your face such as from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup make trigger a jolt of excruciating pain holy shit man yeah what is the cause what causes that all different things they thought like mine I maybe got mine from impact like from my accident mm-hmm and then maybe a little sparring that I've done has has triggered it mmm also dental when I get dental work done it triggers it so but the CBD stops it yeah CBD and then if it's really bad there's um this medication called gabapentin and i feel like that's been a real great way to kind of like mask the pain and one once the gabapentin calms the nerve it kind of Dead's the nerve 24 or 48 hours it's gone if it's a really bad episode if it's a not so bad CBD just keeps it away Wow the they say that a lot of nerve diseases are inflammation caused so sometimes like if you change your diet you can you can smooth some of those out like lower the sugar intake and some of the other things that might be causing inflammation did they give you any advice like that no but around the same time I figured out I was allergic to gluten which I really thought was horseshit whatever I was like yeah right okay yeah we need to be gluten free and then I tried it and and the doctor I had seen said well you really gotta try it though you got to commit a hundred percent you got to give it at least like two to three weeks and see how you feel and I did it and it was a game-changer mmm like I felt normal whereas I'd have a lot of ups and downs depending on what I was eating and I'm still eating clean at the time I'm still eating vegan and I'm eating you know whatever but uh you know a lot of a lot of us can't you know digest or kind of our bodies can't absorb the gluten yeah well it's have you ever had pasta in Europe yeah it's very different oh yeah yeah so much shit in ours you know so much well it's the Maynard explainer Keenan from tool he explained it to ex you know he runs in Austria in Arizona I didn't know that yeah he's he's a fucking wizard man he's got his own winery runs in Austria but he said that when and we subsequently looked it up after he told me this in the early turn of the century when they were growing wheat they experimented and changed the wheat to make it more dense so that you could get more yield out of an acre and so by doing that they changed what you how your body processes it and there's more complex glutens in like a stalk of wheat like an old old timey wheat like you would get like in Italy or France or something like that it's a different wheat it looks different it's it's a much more scrawny looking plant and so if they had an acre that you don't get nearly as much wheat yeah and so in America we said where's butter and we made it bigger and better and thicker and your body is a much harder time processing it and that's why people get so much inflammation and leaky gut and all these different ailments that people get from bread and pasta in this country it's because of this much more complex wheat but I buy pasta overseas I buy this goddammit I found out about it in Italy that they sell it in America just for that reason yeah Wow because I can eat it and if I want pasta it's not that disgusting yeah I love pasta I do too but it's just it's something that I found if I eat a lot of it just fucks me so I have to make sure that I don't let me find it real quick and I'll pull up the name of it and I felt like leaky gut was like a hoax I was like what are you talking about I've never even heard about this but I feel like it's legit and and they're spot on about that it's called Morelli Morelli spaghetti and it's from Italy and the type of wheat that they use it's a very different type of wheat I get to it taste different it doesn't bloat you up as much it's uh I think somebody explained it to me like what kind of wheat looking for but what I found is it I've tried the gluten-free pasta and it's like you know what I like better than gluten-free pasta spaghetti squash spaghetti squash with marinara sauce it's fucking delicious and I actually sometimes like it better than pasta but they said that I ever won all the - yeah in the hot part it's spaghetti squash is outstanding yeah yeah and it's guilt free you know you can eat it you you you're not thinking you're you know bloating yourself up yeah but we've ruined pasta we ruined pot but you know it gives you that feeling you know that feeling you get after eat a lot of it like oh that's what that is your body's like what the fuck am I doing with this yeah you're immediately tired yeah loaded yeah but if you eaten in Italy you don't get that feeling and you look at those people over there they're not fat yeah it's weird it's true yeah they walking around all over the place and they're eating pasta yeah yeah Europe everyone's walking or riding bikes yeah Americans that's the thing about France to France when they're eating those baguettes there they're eating it with like this very rich butter that's like grass-fed butter so I got dark yellow butter so it's very high fat content it's got a lot of essential fatty acids in it and just you're just getting it and it's a different kind of bread - and meanwhile they're not fat yeah and they're drinking one and they're not fat like it doesn't make any sense yeah agreed standard American diet it's just fucked up but I've always wanted to ask you that about like the drumming because I mean everything that I do like everything repetitive whether it's boxing or even archery a lot of people get injuries in archery just from repetitive stress from just pulling the bow back over and over again I'm like god damn Travis this your whole fucking thing is repetitive that KBB I see you every time I see you like my shoulders hurt yeah my elbows hurt no I mean my first week hurts my first week sucks like on tour really like getting acclimated because even practice rehearsals are not a show it's just a different intensity but but yeah as long as I train for it I'm cool I kind of like boxing has helped so much and I don't box because I think I'm a tough guy I think I can you know beat people's asses or whatever it's really just for functionality like so I can play the drums the way I want to so you know started doing it for that reason well no I started when I knew my son was being born like when my girlfriend at the time was pregnant I woke up that morning I ran to the freeway and back like twice and then I wouldn't found a boxing gym I walked into ten goose I want actually walked into jump raise who used to be Tyson's sparring partner and it was like 2005 yeah - no 2003 and then I started boxing I just walked into ten goofs and I started jump roping and hitting pads and I don't know I just had this urge to wanna like box and be better that's so interesting like just from knowing that you were gonna be a dad I just wanted to be better I wanted like immediately I just thought to myself I wanted a lifestyle change I needed we evolve and I needed to know how to protect this little human I was bringing into the world and I knew I needed to change my lifestyle because I was I was kind of out of control Wow it's a amazing thing that happens to you when you become a father it's a weird switch that goes off in your brain that you can't really describe to people that don't have kids yeah and it's even weirder when the switch doesn't go off so like you know you see people who are horrible fathers no more my parents and I just don't get like how didn't how didn't that switch turn on for you right you know how yeah like the ones who don't want to be around their kids freak me out the most yeah they just don't want to be they just want to be away all the time I just I don't get it yeah I don't know why yeah I couldn't imagine but yeah and now I love boxing like it's one of my favorite things to do I'm I've been doing Muay Thai a little bit more because I can kind of save my hands yeah cuz it's not good on my hands in any way shape or form how so just the impact over and over do you feel professionally wrapped you get them rounded correctly yeah but it still bothers my knuckles hurt really yeah are using big heavy gloves yeah what a one ounce gloves are using I think there are 14 outs mm maybe should switch to like 18 or 20 yeah get a thicker padding in the front it'll protect your knuckles better and it even gives you a better workout really because you're pushing more weight a little heavier yeah yeah pushing more weight and you'll have more more impact but another thing I would say is get a bag that's a water bag water bags are fantastic you ever seen those yeah I've seen them at the gym tell you the awesome fucking dig into those things and it's it's minimal impact but you still pushing the same amount of weight you know through throwing the punches you can still explode with the same amount of force but you know you're sinking into that bag and so a lot of people with tendonitis find that that's a way better option there's another I have two bags out there one of them is a fairtex bag and fair text makes a it's a muay thai bag but it's softer and the other one's a monster bag the monster bags are really hard stiff right hands yeah dances fuck so I like the combination of the two but the fairtex one is good if I'm injured if like my shoulders bother me or something like that I can dig into that bag and it's not gonna have the same jolt yeah hitting something solid and hard so if you're having problems with your hands that's what I would say another thing you can do is they make wraps there are gel wraps you slide them on your hand almost like a glove yeah that's what he just told me about what you guys are trained with yeah those are great yeah and then that on top of the heavier glove I bet it'll stop all the hand stuff yeah I'm gonna try that yeah you just told me about that that'll protect my knuckles a little bit more because I find if I lift weights I never get big like I never look big but I feel kind of stiff and just slow it's the worst feeling ever and I did it one time right before torrid I was living in Chevy Hills for a little while and I was working out at a gym over there and it was all body builder guys and I would train with one just to like be pushed and I got behind my kit and it was the worst feeling ever the worst I felt like I was in slow motion so I figured out like I need to train how I want to move when I'm actually playing the drums weightlifting is fine but you have to do it lightly the thing about weightlifting is people want to do it to failure all the time you know do ten sets of this and five sets of that and go to failure every time come on push push push but yeah don't do that you shouldn't do that yeah I subscribe to the Pavel at Cellini method he's a famous Russian kettlebell instructor and his philosophy is that you should do more sets but less repetition so like say if you could do a weight and you could lift it 10 times don't lift it ten times lived it five right he lifted ten let's talk about esophageal cancer my voice is rebelling but if you say if you could lift something 10 times lift it five times and just do more sets and give yourself a lot of time in between sets because if you're trained for strength you can do certain things like kettlebells and specific where it's strength but it's also endurance but really if you just want to do strength the best way to do it is to do a short set of a few repetitions and then do multiple versions of that like take a long time off like 5-10 minutes and then do another 5 reps 5-10 minutes do another 5 reps and then do it again in a couple of days and then do it again stead of like once a week where you just blow your body out you're like ahhh that feeling we could barely move that's terrible yes it's not a smart way because you don't recover as well yeah and you end up getting hurt or you had to take a day off you know what I started doing was with this one trainer named Don we figured out kind of like a metronome workout so you're actually like a tempo workout where you're training into a tempo oh so you have to do high reps like you know you'll stay to a minute and maybe the tempo is like you know what I mean so whatever even if it's quick and you're not doing everything like exactly technique wise really slow and you know it's it's kind of like making sure you stay up with the tempo which I feel like really helped me with with staying quick and fast with drums and more endurance you know yeah that makes sense like is is drumming a young man's game I mean is it like athletics where as you get older drummer slow down I don't know I haven't I played just as wild as I did back in the day and how old you know 43 you look great oh I think you don't look 43 yeah Max Weinberg told me one time he was he watched me play and he I got a show or a blink played and he's like I don't know how much longer you can play like that dude he's like you're gonna need back surgery you play like you have rabies smashing the fucking drums so knock on wood nothing has changed and I've just I play exactly how I always have you know I don't even want to think about a day where I have to play any different right sure it will come but do you get massages yes that helps a lot right massages epson salt baths that's where the tank comes in play man that thing's amazing the tank is all epsom salts lucky you dude you don't fucking crazy when you watch that i watch you play and I would just go how the fuck in this guy maintain this pace because everybody drums differently you know I mean it's really interesting to watch people's different especially my friend bill burr really got into drumming and you know he's really into it and I like watching him play and it's it's interesting to see someone take something up and get better and take lessons and learn it but the thing that really strikes me is how many repetitions are involved like as you're doing this like the amount of times you're hitting these drums is fucking insanity you got to pace yourself if it's a two-hour set I know like oh this is a verse of this song I can kind of this is not a big big part you know you can kind of chill but it's like a round you know if we're going around look up in the clock and you realize oh wow I still have two minutes left yeah well pace yourself and you know what I mean yeah that's kind of how I approach shows but but the goal is to train so much before you even get on tour that you're not even having to think about that you're just playing the show exactly how you want to play it's almost I imagine it's like that with fighting where you envision what you want to do in your head and you're in the shape and you know the technique to execute mmm you don't have to think about our goal you know I can't do that I'm not I didn't practice that enough I'd like to be able to just do whatever I'm feeling and not you know be like oh shit I don't know how to do that or I'm gonna get tired if I do that I don't want that to happen right now so that's the goal it's just being able to execute what you have the idea in your head well musicians have to have discipline because you have to practice it sit yes that's one of the things that makes you guys so unique in the entertainment world it's like I mean I guess maybe actors have to practice standup comedians we only practice in front of an audience but you guys have to fucking practice less you don't go through your show no before you go out no I write I write and I listen to recordings of old sets but I don't like to sit in front of a mirror go hey folks yeah I don't do that I don't know anybody because it would feel so weird when you go up to do it it feel we're Hurst right yeah that's the last thing you want you got to be in the moment same thing happens with if you practice too much as a band and then you go try to play those songs and act like you're having fun that's what happens so I try to practice a lot on my own and I'm not even practicing those songs just kind of just drill you know yeah like Sam Kinison used to have a joke about the Beach Boys about their going out there likes playing I wish they could all be california girls again and like jesus fucking right we're okay like it becomes a job that you don't want that you you want it to be fresh and exciting and you want it to be something that you're really in the moment really thinking about so I make up new shit on the spot - that's the best is I just make up new fails or just try to reinvent the songs to the point where even like Marc will look back at me and be like you know whatever like that's the best you know just kind of freaking it on the fry and and even to the crowd it's like oh that's that's cool you haven't heard like that before yeah that's like after two or three months of being on tour you do stuff like that yeah when you get off tour do you consciously give yourself a rest no I'm busier at home than I am on tour on tour so lavish man like you have you have someone saying I mean you do have people kind of waiting on you hand and foot somewhat you know like a catering you know ready if you want to eat or hey you got to go do an interview 30 minutes before you go onstage cars outside waiting for you after the show taking you to the hotel so that doesn't happen at home right you know and at home I do so many other things besides playing in the band like I you know produce a bunch of rap artists I have crossroads I have clothing companies have three kids it's way busier at home Torres Torres a vacation that's interesting yeah for me Wow because I don't know how to say no either mind you I have a lot of things I love that I love doing so I can't complain and be like oh I hate going to the steer I hate doing this I love it all I just kind of love it all so much that I have trouble saying no sometimes so when you you're you said you're managing or you're producing rap artists yeah how many I come in - I'm in the studio right now with this group called suicide boys who are awesome they're from New Orleans and we have a EP coming out that's called a live fast die whenever and we just finished over the weekend so or yesterday so it's you know you go in there at noon and you leave there at 4:00 in the morning every day until you're finished because they're only in town for a little while so yeah it takes a little bit and then like I worked on xyx extant ations album before he passed away I work with like smoke / big men's a bunch of different artists do you like that because it's a different genre helps you mix it up a little bit you're just a big rap fan as well obviously you're wearing an IceCube shirt yeah I grew up actually listen to rap music before I listen to any kind of music at all like Beastie Boys and Run DMC and Public Enemy and the farside and caris one that's what I grew up on and then I discovered you know I loved metal - I love Slayer and King Diamond and then and then I discovered a band called Minor Threat and the descendents and Black Flag and Bad Brains and I just liked at all and then my dad listened to jazz music and country rebel music so I was born in raised on like Johnny Cash and bottoms and everything so and I kind of learned to love it all and I had people around me when I was young when I was first learning how to read music that just kept embedding in my head like you gotta listen to everything can't you can't just learn one thing so I was actually taught how to play that traditional jazz when I was really young and then I taught myself how to play everything else that's cool yeah but that's always sucked everything that's nice you have an appreciation for all those different genres - yeah it'd be like if all you did was the UFC commentating you'd be like I'm gonna go crazy right this must be so much fun for you and all of your other endeavors like same thing like if I was only making you know punk rock records or pop punk records or whatever it was I think I would go insane and it's been like that for three years you know yeah I think different people I think some people if they're just doing like baseball commentary or something like that they're fucking happy shit they love it yeah I just want to do that but there's some people like you or maybe like me that I need different things yeah I will go crazy I love like studio life is awesome like I did a handsomer thing the other week and then the next day I'm in with like a band called nothing no we're doing something completely different this week I'm doing a little peep and xxx remix it's it has to be like that for me or I get really bored and I I just don't feel creative right kind of like I don't know that's cool done like that how does that work like you get a phone call or someone texts you hey Travis we need you to come in here and light this motherfucker on fire and you get in there and yeah it's been like that you know or like you know some projects manifested too like there's this band called the fever 333 that I produce and and write with and they just got nominated for a Grammy like throughout for a Grammy for Best Rock performance and that was something I just envisioned with the singer that band Jason and we started literally a year ago and and they're nominated for a Grammy Wow so like stuff like that like kind of being an architecture without building buildings you know being architecture and music or whatever it is whatever it is you're passionate about that excites me you just building sounds yeah like there's nothing better and working with different genres to's got to be exciting too because you can mix it up and yeah Wow now when you're like what when how do you how like schedule your time in terms of like how much time you're gonna spend on your own studio work how much time you're gonna spend on other people's stuff to just play it by ear it seems like with a guy like you you must get so many requests and you said you have a hard time saying no I would imagine it's fucking overwhelming yeah well my kids come first before everything anything you know and then I get a lot of opportunities like my son Landon it was a big rat fan like he loves right he was raised on rap music like he grew up touring with me and little Wayne when I talked with Lil Wayne and he loves being in the studio so he'll come with me to the studio so I can kind of like double-dip work at the same time as he's in be making music well my studio B which is really really awesome and then same with Alabama she's me I'm lucky they're both musicians cuz Alabama and Landon both love music so they like going on tour with me they like that's amazing me yeah or I probably wouldn't be working so much that's really cool yeah what the fuck is it like going on tour with little Wayne it was so awesome I came out with a rap a rap project where I produced I've made all the beats and I just got all my favorite rappers everyone from like RZA from the wu-tang clan to Lil Wayne game Swizz Beatz it was it was crazy I think I had 30 guests on there and Wayne asked me to go out on tour with him so me and Mix Master Mike from the Beasties were like the opening act on that tour and Drake was out there Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross Wow fun so I loaded up the bus with everyone I brought yellow wolf out I brought j-roc I bought Paul wall I brought the cool kids and we just gotten a bus and we went on tour Jesus is the best yeah how long are those shows all those people how long is that show that psycho well with all the acts and there's four hours yes long fuckin show's over like good Lord that audience must be beaten into a coma oh yeah but then the headliners on who they're really there to see right but that that was a big accomplishment just being able to play in that genre of music cuz I listened to it as a kid and there's never really been a home for a live drummer in a rap scenario right so from the beginning I think I don't even know what year was when puff called me when I just joined blinking he's like y'all want you to be in this video I was like what like cuz I pretty much was I was just like well I'm I'm in the biggest you know bands in the world I'm so stoked I couldn't ask for anything more and I always wanted to go I always wanted to uh yeah i'ma get some that tour was so fun but yeah once puffs asked me to be in a video it was kind of like a it just snowballed from there you just got in that world yeah and I had no idea why he wanted me you know but I was just like wow this is so cool because I grew up on Biggie like I loved all that genre of music but I was okay with just staying in my lane as well but when I got accepted with like open arms and I was invited to do like BT Awards with Ti or Tyga or Wayne it was just insane you know playing the Grammys I the funny thing is I've never played the Grammys with blink but I played the Grammys with like pitbull Drake Eminem like it's so weird it's so weird to me I just feel it's a trip the opportunities I've had outside of rock music have been such blessings do you when you say all those things and you know that you did all these things it almost seemed like you're living in a dream yeah I feel like smacking myself like it doesn't feel real when people go like oh who would you like to collaborate with I feel like I'm so spoiled and I've I've been so blessed to play with all these musicians I love then I just say nobody you know whatever comes I'm happy with Wow yeah well that's cool though that's great man that's means you're fulfilled you know you're you're you're doing what you want to do like you're ready told whoever let's do it yeah if you wanted to make a record job be there you know that's what I'm saying well lucky for you I'm totally talentless in the music department so it's not gonna happen but now you're such a talent man I love like when you and Dominic Cruz are commentating together doesn't get any better yeah I love Dom he's awesome man he beat the shit out of me a couple times why did you let him well because he you know we used to sponsor him a little bit like we're famous like you know he used to walk out and famous stuff like when UFC wasn't they didn't have rebut gear and he would come down and train because I would train with this one guy Josh over here in Woodland Hills and he said travel I'm gonna be in town I'm gonna come train with you okay cool little did I know it'd be Dom tossing me around and Mike oh my gosh man it was so difficult but does he make you roll with them well now I'd be he'd be like try to sleep me I try to knock me out today so I'm giving my all and just using his defense and you know when you when you actually swing in the air and you're not landing it actually more tiresome than when you're hitting somebody so I'm swinging in the air he's like on the side of me all of a sudden like you know he's so quick like with footwork and then I'm wrestled to the ground and it's just a wrap every time and he's so so talented so yes but where I love preposterous yeah he just has the most ridiculous footwork his footwork is so unique to him to everything he does he's got like this weird herky-jerky little yeah he does he's probably one of the most unique MMA fighters ever I feel like a lot of people have kind of borrowed from his style for sure you know yeah for sure not to say they didn't make it their own but I feel like Dom was the first one you saw you know kind of move like unquestionably yeah and that's because of his intelligence yes he doesn't like getting hit he's like okay I got to figure out a way to not get hit so much like what's the best way to not get hit he just just came up with this very unorthodox way of moving he's a real encyclopedia of information when you start talking him about fighting like he's I really enjoy doing commentary with him because he's so insightful he's so good at pointing out little areas where he thinks people are making mistakes or how to capitalize on certain things that people are doing yeah I've watched fights with him before and he's and he gives a different insight than what I'm seeing yeah yeah yeah no he's great especially when it comes to wrestling clinch work and you know and even like weird striking techniques I mean he's just he's so good at befuddling people that he fights with with movement and information like he's giving them looks and they're they're trying to set up and understand and they're trying to set up and they don't know what the fuck he's doing then they have to reset and they're trying again and then he's giving him a different look and yeah standing over here and then he's in front he with his hands down then he's not and yeah yeah that's a trap he's great just fucked up his shoulder again man I know man I think he trained so much I feel like he just you know he's obsessive yeah yeah he's a savage I mean he he got back from knee surgery and he went so hard that he gave himself plantar fasciitis so he fucked up the bottom of his feet from running and sprinting and doing all kinds of crazy shit to get in shape and you know he got over that and I mean he's had so many different surgeries Nisar Israel have you had that no I've never had planner oh man I had it on a tour where I would I'd get these I get these weird kind of things where I have to do a certain thing before I go onstage so one of the things I did on a tour that was I don't know is about a formal tour is run four to five miles before the show hmm and by that by the middle of that tour I'd actually give him myself a stress fracture in my foot well it was terrible did you run on concrete not a treadmill really yeah Wow well sometimes sometimes when when there was no treadmill I just run out in the street but I kind of get like that where I just like I don't know I get obsessive about stuff and I want it I want to do it I I get to kind of I throw myself all the way in well I like what kind of running shoes do you run with do you run with I was running like honestly on that tour sometimes I'd run in vans which is probably half of my problem but you know it'd be so quick like Oh an hour here to do this but yeah that it wasn't fun though it was painful yeah when you have overuse injuries those are some of the hardest especially your feet there's some of the hardest to recover from because you have to walk it's not like if you hurt your elbow you can just not use it for a while yeah and it'll eventually heal up but you need to use your feet yeah yeah planners a rough one man I know a lot of people that have got that I've been very lucky I came from martial arts background a lot of kicking and stuff like that so my feet are pretty strong from moving but I found that running with minimalist shoes on hills that made him even stronger Yoga stronger like what those weird kind of what are they called Vibram FiveFingers shoes I wear those and where there's another company called vivo barefoot or where those I like those a little bit better for running on the hills because I'm running on a lot of rocks and shed in the Vibrams they would be great if everything was soft dirt but I'm running on weird jagged rocks and shit and it's just it hurts your feet you got to be real careful where you place your feet yeah but it just forces your feet to work as they're supposed to as opposed to like a big sheeni running shoe you know I think cushiony running shoe feels good it feels good to run on it because you get all this cushion it's not so jarring but your body really you really should run I think personally unless you're a runner you should probably run less with a minimalist shoe then you should run like because it's more comfortable to run with a big fat cushion I think you ultimately give yourself probably more injuries that way yeah but you can get injuries from those minimalist shoes too if you don't pay close attention you try too hard too quick yeah your foots not conditioned for it my feet are terrible - man I had what was called a Liz Frank fracture when ever heard of that it's basically your foot breaks in half like all your all your tenants your ligaments and your bones how the fuck did you do that so I was high as a kite and it was in Australia and I was running to the bus and I had like two huge bags that were like probably like I probably 40 pounds on my back and I was just trying to get to the bus to get to the next show or whatever and it was the the stupidest thing ever but it was a little like you know the little cracks in the sidewalk was up higher and I didn't see and I fell with all that weight on me and I'm in the bus and I'm starting to think wow this is really bad in my tour manager is like a man just get the blood flow and try walking on it and I'm trying to just suck it up and I'm walking in the airport and I'm like almost like tearing like I'm fucking hurting so bad I was like man I think I need to get an x-ray or like an MRI this isn't good so I play like the next two shows with my other foot I get an x-ray they say I've broken my foot in half I need surgery so I I think I ended up doing a couple weeks of the tour which I shouldn't have I should have gone and done that surgery but I played it with my other foot and then I got home I did the surgery and I was like six months on crutches and wow just recovering it was terrible six months on he watches and then I feel like I wasn't healing that great cuz I was taking so many painkillers and everything it was slowing down the process hmmm which I don't know if you've heard of but that it really like my bones became super brittle from pink from painkillers what what painkillers Norco yeah yeah huh yeah but I would imagine the pain must have been fucking excruciating snapping your foot in half oh it was so painful yeah when it first happened it's something else for pain medication after you got off of that stuff just smoked weed yeah yeah said enough yeah I'm pretty good with pain doesn't really bug me what about edibles I haven't really done it you don't fuck with edibles really I haven't had anything for 10 years nothing nothing zero no alcohol no weed no nothing damn yeah ten year which was a big well after my accident as well I was fed you know four months in a hospital being fed morphine every day for four months and then being on all these bipolar meds and everything else I honestly didn't want to put anything in my body when I got out I didn't even take painkillers when I got home now what kind of bipolar meds they put you on I don't even remember I was on like four or five just bipolar and I mean I had like I had so many I probably like twelve medications I got sent home with and I did it for about a week or two and then I wouldn't see my doctor I'd actually overheard one of my friends talking who was like a brother to me and I had heard him talking to someone else he was like you know like Travis seems a little different you know he seems a little bit slow or something and it and I had overheard him he didn't know I overheard him but I was these meds I had been telling my dog feels like I just don't feel like me I feel I don't know I feel weird and I just don't feel like myself so I just flushed him down the toilet one day next week I came back to see him he's like how you doing I said good I'm off all those meds you told me I'd be on for the rest of my life they're like oh dude from what you've been through like you you it's okay to be on something like that and I was like yeah I'm doing fine though like I don't need those you know he said I wanted to put you on because of the plane crash yeah they're like don't shame yourself you know by giving yourself a hard time that you have to take these pills and I said well you know I honestly don't feel like they're doing what they're supposed to for me and they actually having like a negative effect on me so I don't I really don't want to take them you know they also told me I'd never run again I'd never do this I never do that so I think I just got to the point where I was like let me see how many things I can prove otherwise that they've told me you know once I stopped taking the pills Jesus so they put you on bipolar medication because of a traumatic crash yeah that seems odd to me I mean I'm not a doctor obviously but well I was kind of crazy you know I was like suicidal when I was in the hospital I was on so many drugs I couldn't even I didn't even know my friends had passed away I didn't even know the two pilots had passed away I didn't remember anything I kept thinking like everyone was in the hospital including the two pilots including my two best friends and a.m. I thought everyone was just in different rooms till about two weeks before I left and then I went crazy then it was like they had a you know 5150 case on their hands you know I wasn't I wasn't in a good place so yeah then I did I did a lot of like post-traumatic like therapy when I was in the hospital - kind of like calm things down once I got through all my surgeries and then yeah I mean over time it was it was cool but or it was never cool but I started to feel better you know but yeah I think it was cuz I was so crazy at the time but that's it's interesting that that I would think that bipolar medication would be something that you would give someone who has like a condition that just is sort of preed they're predisposed to it yeah I don't know anything about bipolar but I would think that that's something you just have you know it's like I have a mental condition I wouldn't think that it would be something that they would give you to overcome a traumatic incident yeah I think they were afraid I was gonna be I had like a mental condition after everything happened you know I think they think like maybe because you're an artist that you're probably a little crazy anyway possibly yeah I mean yeah I think but I was a mess too like you know like I had done I'd smoke so much weed you know every day and I'd taken so many pills and and I would self-medicate quite a bit that I woke up probably out of 11 of my 30 surgeries I had in the Burn Center I woke up swinging on doctors so because I would wake up and I would just I'd be opened up and I would just go crazy Jesus Christ so trying to get off the table yeah I would just try to get off the table I don't even think I really knew what was going on I just wasn't they couldn't give me enough medication to knock me out because I had been self-medicating for so long and abusing meds for so long Wow so you would get up from anesthesia you just wake up in the middle of anesthesia yeah so yeah that was crying that was a problem how did you clean up I think after there was I think the last time I swung on a doctor they were kind of like you you're not gonna you can't be here no more and then I was like wow well I need X amount of more surgeries and I I really was just in it fighting demons you know I just figured out like my two best friends had passed away and the pilots had passed away and I was just like in an ugly place and you know my my kids couldn't come visit me because 65% of my body was burnt so I couldn't be around people so I was just in it man and then and then I just I don't know I turned a corner and then I was like a team player and I don't think I was on as many meds most of my surgeries were over and just learning how to walk again being able to take a shower by myself again all that stuff man I think that was just those are the good points that helped me turn the corner and I don't know I just had more strength you know you know so wow so you just just turned a corner in your mind and just sort of accepted it and yeah same with drugs like I didn't never do rehab or anything I think it was mainly my kids and just second life the second chance at life was enough for me I was like I don't I never want to do any of that stuff again you know that's cool so once you get a certain amount of distance between you and those days does it seem like like it wasn't even real it wasn't you doing those things yeah you look back and you're just like yeah like I still talked to those doctors to this day like dr. Grossman he's he's he's so awesome and he basically saved my life you know but I still talk to him he lives out here in the valley yes Grossman Burn Center and I go without Christmas and and see burn you know burn victims that are over there in the in the burn center and help out any way I can but yeah that's great man yeah really cool yeah many of my friends that I know that I had real bad drug problems and then now are off drugs they'd look back and they go what I know what the fuck was I doing like how did I do how was that me yeah it's interesting how that happens in your life or you have these new chapters in your life and and then sometimes it could just be something that happened like two weeks ago and you're like who the fuck was that guy two weeks ago I'm not even him anymore yeah you know like you you could sometimes people make these abrupt turns in their life and then they go yeah I'm never going back and you go well we'll see and then you look 10 years later like wow you were right you never went back yeah yeah and I think like I still have have you ever heard of what's called like user dreams no we're like I think I've fucked up and I'm smoking weed again like oh my god how am I gonna stop cuz I'm not I love smoking so much you know or whatever your vice was you know if it was like whatever was yeah you're just like you wake up and you think you're doing it again and then you realize nom I'm all good I just have dreams like that where how to go back to high school really I just have dreams for years man why'd you hate high school fucking hey Monty I don't think anyone likes it yes you're like you know soon to be a professor fucking doctor or something but well I just had no idea what I wanted to do for a living and I was just like being trapped in a classroom constantly was excruciating yeah I must have had I mean I probably do have like some crazy form of a DD I don't know I never been diagnosed into a shrink but if I did I mean I'm sure they'd probably try to put me on something right if I tried to tell him what's going on in my head all the time they'd be like Jesus sit down hold on take these take these whatever you do it is bad but when I was in high school I fucking hated it and I barely got by and then when I got out of high school I would have these dreams where I would wake up in the middle of the night and I didn't have enough credits to graduate and have to go back and then I was sitting there in my bed but before I woke up trying to decide whether or not I was just gonna fucking drop out and not graduate from high school not have a high school diploma or go back and do another fucking year of hell and then with my guts would turn then I'd wake up and oh my god I graduated I graduated yeah yeah it was the worst I was the same way man I just like just barely got by high school did you go to school here yeah well I grew up in like Fontana okay Riverside Ronny yet fontucky about the double dose more Thai out there yeah yeah so people like to fight in Fontana people like to fight everywhere yeah now you do fighter play football hit Fontana yeah yeah yep yeah I was the same way just just skated by high school and then I remember I didn't even want to walk I fucking hated it so much I actually rode my skateboard with my friends that were like much older than me yeah I go skateboarding with every day and we were skateboarding by the high school as everyone walked and got their diploma I was just did you get your diploma that yeah they sent it to me but me too I didn't want to fucking be there no I didn't know I didn't go to my graduation I'm like I'm gone yeah like this is I once I got through I'm like you don't have me anymore I can be free it took me a while to figure out what the fuck to do next yeah I would sit there and they would be like so what do you want to do like the counselors and I was like I just want to play drums in a band really and they'd be like well that's not an option like require college are you going to talk to me like I was like just insane isn't that crazy that there's so many bands and there's so many drummers why is that not an option yeah why is it not an option it'd be better if they just said well you know like I don't know if they motivated you to actually do what you're passionate about instead of just being well that's not gonna happen so what do you want to do so many fucking people that probably wanted to be drummers and just never got a push and never never you know yeah I never made it through but then there's the other argument that if you really want you'll find a way yeah you got to do it I mean my dad used to tell me the same thing he'd be like you got to have a plan B not and I'd be like well if I have a plan B I'm not gonna try that hard yeah I started thinking in my head and then that's when I just said nah fuck that like I'm it's only this no matter if I'm rich or poor whatever whatever the circumstances this is what I'm doing like I don't give a fuck what the outcome is I think that's the right mindset yeah I don't think people get by that well like when I was uh just starting to do stand-up there was a lot of guys who had full-time jobs and they got degrees and you know they would work there full-time job and then they would just do stand-up like a couple nights a week they never made it yeah is the obsessed guys and women the people that were just like I this is my fucking life this is what I do I'm gonna do this yeah those are the ones that do it the no safety net people are the ones that made it yeah I mean it's gonna fucking happen you just have to you have to stick with it yeah I feel like the people who really stick with it and give it like 110 percent your time will come it's however big or small it is something will happen you know yeah yeah if you figure it out and keep improving and keep learning and learn from your mistakes and learn from your setbacks and and keep trying to push and get better and improve if you do all those things is as hopeless and helpless as it seems if you continue to improve you've got to get to a better place you got to get better and one day you'll be undeniable and if you don't and if you just fall back on that safety net you're always gonna wonder yeah you know yours gonna look at Travis barkingham or the drums I'm going shit that could have been me dude I almost did it I actually at one point my pops and my pops is awesome but um he's like Vietnam vet and you know wrote him Harley his whole life and he just basically said to me he's like yo you got a you either got to start paying rent at the house cuz you you know you're not in high school no more or and get like a 60 hour a week job like a real job or you need to go you know go fuck and play drums but you're not gonna do it here in my garage so I was like okay and it was probably the best thing that was ever said to me you know as harsh as it was or whatever and then I had actually caved in and I just told my my friend no I was like you know what I think I'm just gonna I'm gonna get this fucking job because I just somehow got a job but made you know in a warehouse it was like Target warehouse making pretty good money compared to what I was at the time and and he hit me the next day and he's like I think you're making a big mistake I think you're very fucking talented and I think you'll regret this and you can get this bullshit job any any time down the line come live with me on you know stay at my house you could sleep on the floor or the couch and let's play in this fucking band and do it and I did it you know I was like a trash man in Laguna Beach lived in like this studio apartment with a couple other guys and I just fucking took off like I had a like I mean it was like humility too you know there was like playing bar after bar and you know you know but but I was eating I was eating I was you know I was skateboarding every day and I was living at the beach playing in a band with my friends so for me it I had already made it those are the best stories yeah they're the best stories and I think back even to this day I go to Laguna sometimes I'm like wow that was kind of one of the best moments of my life besides my children being born like poor no money but like happiest fuck I can't even think of another time I was that happy you know yeah cool people the the only pressure is the pressure of trying to succeed is not the pressure of already succeeding and the overwhelming pressure that you must experience now yeah those are great stories men the stories of like where you didn't know if it was gonna work yeah you clue those stories right now some kids are listening to those stories right now listening you say this like fuck man I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go for it like who knows how many rock stars you're making right now just saying this yeah because a lot of them are teeter-tottering yeah not gonna do it am I not gonna do it even I mean I was at the time no and you just have to you know don't worry about being cool or being fucking rich or having money just be passionate about what you're passionate about and fucking dedicate a hundred percent you know yeah there's those moments man when you're first starting out anything where it's not sure yeah it's not a it's not it's not a definite thing you were in this weird limbo space like man am I gonna be a loser my whole life like what's gonna happen to me and those moments man when you look back and you realize you could have quit but you kept going you figured it out you sucked it up yeah you worked your way through it you improved you kept moving yep yeah that's that's life man yeah that's what defines you man yeah it really does I just love those fucking stories I can never get enough of them man yeah the dirty grimy and then finally make it story yeah dude you're running out of space to tattoo I'm gonna tell you right now I'm actually getting tattoos on top of tattoos that's outrageous yeah I just got this lj4 xxx I'm gonna get a I'm working on some new ones I've decided to go back in you kind of like remix in him at this point you know like getting tattoos on tattoos have you ever gotten lasered yeah once I had like a new wife and I divorced my ex-wife and she wasn't really stoked on the ex-wife's name on me yeah sounds like a problem yes so I lasered it cuz it was right on my neck and she always had to see it but that's the only time I've ever done it there's nothing on me I really want to get rid of her I'm like all that it's all a story to me it all tells the story it's like a moment in time and I got it for a reason but I was trying to be cool and you know I mean trying to be respectful and made her happy at the time that makes sense yeah I mean it was amazing she hung in there all the way to being married with another chick's name on your neck yeah that's a great woman true in that regard yeah yeah but yeah I love tattoos man they're addicting yeah I love him too once I figured out they didn't hurt at the age of 15 it was on I didn't yeah it's like what people tell you like oh it's so painful yeah and then you get when you're like wait a minute it's not so bad this is like it's kind of like a a slight burn yeah it's like kind of therapeutic too I fell asleep I was getting tattooed same same when I did my back piece I fell asleep and I had two artists working on me at the same time oh wow just because I fucking hate wasting time here so they yeah they did my back together they did my head together to hear that heads impressive let me see the head let me see what that looks like when did you get that done I did in my head like I don't know six years ago Wow yeah yeah I started I a piece on the side of my right that mr. cartoon did back back in the day I love that guy's work yeah cartoonist said he's amazing he's got great shit he is a legend yeah he's a legend even outside of tattooing like lowrider culture yeah he's he's one of the illest but um yeah he did that and then that kind of set it off I always had like praying hands on the side of my head and then I shaved my head and I've never grown my hair out since cuz I'm like fuck it I it's permanent haircut you know what is up there it's hard to see my little shine I have like oh wow I think I have like a rose you think what's on my head I have like a transplants gas mask on the back of my head I have one life one chance yeah and then like some writing Wow now when you got burned did it affect your tattoos did you have to tattoo over it yeah so I lost I lost all of my tattoos on my legs Wow yes I lost I lost my first tattoo ever which was a d'agnasti tattoo this hardcore band punk man that I loved forever and a bones tattoo which was my nickname growing up but I lost everything on my legs so then they do like they do what's called that grafting so they owe and I lost some tattoos with my back so they take it's like a cheese grater and they grade all of your skin off your back and my thighs and then they staple it to you with pig cadaver whoa and they wait for for you to start healing so yeah so I lost a lot of tattoos and then I I did I like on my thighs you can't really see I did I did memorials for for little Christian djm who who all passed away in the accident so I put them on my legs over the graph so you can't really see it but yeah I mean I I got out pretty well man let me you can kind of see it on my hand my hand you can see it's discolored and stuff but for having almost 70 percent of my body burnt like you can't really tell that's amazing yeah you can't really tell at all because you're so tattooed up that uh the pain of healing burns is supposed to be it's the fucking worst thing ever well for me too I mean I don't think you guys ever think about being burnt I know I didn't right I'll just be like I don't know I just never think about fire until you're on fire and then you're like oh shit and then and then the you know the treatments afterwards to like do everything you know like like they would put me in this big pan that was literally about as big as this table with different people all around you and they would scrape all my buns with a metal brush to get rid of all the infection cuz I had I basically when I when I jumped through the emergency exit when I opened the emergency exit before the plane blew up I was in such a hurry to get out of the plane and exit the plane I jumped right into the jet which is full of fuel so my whole body lit up you know so I had jet fuel just in my whole body like I burped jet fuel for almost like three months so they had like that was the main thing to get rid of the infection is they scrub you with a metal brush to get rid of all of it and all of the dead skin and then and then I did about 30 surgeries to to repair everything like skin graft surgeries they saved my foot because at one point they were gonna amputate my right foot oh yeah it was wild I have pictures fat burnt that they're gonna have to amputate it my right foot almost didn't make it was it because the way it was was it was necrosis or like what was going on that they were gonna amputate it I think cuz that was the thing that was most soaked was was my shoes and socks I jumped into the Jets you know and I had done like I had exited the plane I started running I'd started like ripping off my clothes just that's what my instinct told me just get rid of everything but little did I know I would still be on fire cuz the jet fuel was you know soaked in it so I'm actually running towards a highway highways right on the side of me and I just hear some guy yell like stop drop and roll and it just like I heard it out of all this chaos of every sirens and everything and I stop drop and rolled and the only thing that was still on fire was my feet and came and patted him out so I think they were on fire the longest - so still like my I think my right foot is probably like over 50% of its a graft Wow yeah it's wild but um yeah that was like I never like I said I never even thought about it's not something you think about until it happens to you but being burnt is like it's it's horrific you know were you affected by the recent fires out here it came about a couple hundred yards from one of my houses oh wow but I was in Vegas I was actually playing a show we left that morning and then we got phone call saying you had to evacuate but we love you thank God you had the kids my dogs with me my housekeeper was at the house she was able to get the rest of our dogs out and yeah we were as long as I had them there with me you know I was like everything else is replaceable it's yeah whatever but yeah that was sketchy I mean you saw obviously you live very valuated yeah we got evacuated well we evacuate ourselves before they had a mandatory at 2:00 in the morning I came back from the comedy store my wife and I were looking out the window and the flames are coming over the hill and I said no one's gonna save us here I go you know we have to figure out what the fuck we're gonna do and she's like I think we should go and that's that all right I think you're right and we just got a hotel room and we just bailed yeah and I just grabbed I literally grabbed my laptop and I think that's it and some some clothes and then the kids are a little freaked out but I said look just look we're here yeah all right like we could buy more shit yeah like the dogs fine we're fine that's how I was - I was like let it burn yeah you know I mean I don't want it to burn obviously but rather than you being hurt like fuck man this is this is it's an inconvenience when you're when you lose your house yes it's a horrific tragedy when you lose your life you know we're not we're gonna get the fuck out of here yeah and so they were freaked out but within a day or two I mean we stayed in the hotel for a week but within a day or two they were they were cool were laughing about it same we did the same thing that came came home but not really home you know just a hotel for a week but yeah I felt kind of helped us like you couldn't do much you know it's not like I could sit there and and put out the fire myself you know they wouldn't even let us in our community yeah same here crazy for people that weren't around here they don't know how crazy it was but the sky was filled with smoke everywhere you looked was smoke I mean all of LA was filled with smoke it was I've never we we stayed in Beverly Hills at the Waldorf and you look out the balcony window and it's just fucking gray just smoke everywhere yeah I've never seen fires like that before never in my life neither and I always see we're on high alert yeah you not see it like my kids are at school over in Malibu were really close to there and I always see high alert but nothing's ever really happened you know there's been like small fires but that was horrific that was just it looked like Hiroshima yeah in our neighborhood like you know airplanes flying really low dropping like fire retardant and yeah it was it was crazy bill burr flies helicopters he's got his helicopter license and we took a flight around Malibu around Point Dume and you go over there and you see these massive estates just burnt to the ground these gorgeous houses with the perfect view on the bluff overlooking the ocean gone huge Lots you know 20 million dollar house is gone just burnt to the ground and there's so many of them and then like one house standing there yeah one house out of just random it's how it wasn't our neighborhood my house caught fire but nothing near it caught fire it's weird yeah some shit will fly through the air land on someone's house and if you have like pine needles or something on your roof or a flammable roof yeah you know just catches catches on fire was it a campfire it started it's called campfire I don't think it was a campfire that was the name of the fire I don't think I don't I don't know what the fuck the cause of that fire was Jamie see if you can find that out do you know what it is no I think they've been trying to blame or blame has been put on like different utility companies or whatnot and they're not they're not taking the blame or they can prove that it wasn't them and didn't be pastor I don't know that anybody knows yet what I've been looking at you know it's fucking crazy though man when I was in Boulder there was a giant fire that broke out that was a fireman accident started a fire yeah he had a fire pit in his backyard and some fucking embers blew out of his fire pit and started a giant fire and just burnt the massive amounts of wild forest it's just gone damn yeah a fireman imagine how painful yeah he must have felt like shit it mean anybody I mean just couldn't fucking imagine if it was your fault that one of these things get started oh yeah the guilt I would I wouldn't be sleeping for weeks the craziest rate is Northern California Northern California got it wayward we got it bad down here worse than I've ever seen but they got it way worse in Northern California yeah Northern California they lost like a shitload of people died on the highway is it burnt to death in their cars you see those photos yes yeah fuck man yeah you know ends that a lot of this is because of you mean there's a lot of issues right there's the the dry you know the fact that dry climate the fact that you know there's a climate change it's happening but also the fact that there's no small fires like although those dead trees are supposed to get knocked down by small fires like controlled fires yeah and those that doesn't really happen anymore we don't want small fires that can possibly get out of hand and so you you have these forests that are oftentimes filled with dead trees right next to live trees and a lot of dead trees all over the place well so they're supposed to do it that's like maintenance burning like the small yeah before there's me I mean some people advocate doing it for maintenance but in nature that's like a natural thing like the lightning would hit light something shit on fire and the the live trees would probably survive and a lot of the dead ones would burn to the ground and would actually regenerate the forest yeah yeah I mean the crazy thing is like you look how fucking lush and green it looks out here now yeah you would never imagine that just a few months ago this was a raging inferno it actually is good for the ground yeah you know and all that still smells like fire to right now Rises yeah every time it rains it's starting to get a little bit better but does it freak you out when you see fire now because of your accident yeah it took a little while for us to pyro again remember it was like we just got back together and like this really really like killer like photographer had this idea to do this photo shoot and they wanted us holding like the watchman called the thing like the flares yeah that's it he got me to hold it for a second I was like ah bro I can't do this like wrong photo shoot like I yeah I'm sorry you know I know you have this vision but I that's an insensitive vision yeah and and I yeah oh yeah right I've been a little bit more fitting but and then and now we do pyro stuff on on stage and production it doesn't really bug me but I'm very cautious around the house like you know my daughter she has like a straight iron plugged in or for my son whatever lights a candle like I'm so crazy I'm not I mean yeah come on yeah a little weird so I have to ask you does Tom talk about UFOs all the time well you know he's not in the band yeah I know but you know always do that he always did we used to get loaded and just look out the bus window yeah and I used to do it with him as like I don't know it's kind of a bonding experience it's like uh if you wanted to show me bow and arrows whatever we're on tour together if I were in like you know check it out so with Tom that was his thing like fucking let's get high and look for UFOs so he would you know we just sit there and like stare out the bus window look at UFOs were like he would even go as far as when we're on tour like let's go and fucking look for Bigfoot whatever was you know and he would assemble a crew and they would go do it oh my god I never got me on one of those trips cuz that was just to fairytale for me but yeah but I would you know I'd do that and he was always it's really not something he just got into from the day I fucking met him I was obsessed with UFOs and aliens and was always very passionate about it to the point where like I didn't know enough to to have any kind of I guess like opinion on it I was just very open and and you know just took it all in yeah but nothing has changed he's still the other day I talked to him he's like I'm on the way to the fucking White House bro and I don't ask any questions I drag as you should be let's fucking go what a great response yeah good luck with that yep wow that's crazy yeah he was a trip man having a conversation with him was very strange because I'm what part of me was like Skyy putting me on like what is happening dead-ass seemed like it and we would look at these videos that were so clearly horseshit and he would be like amazing right and I'm like what like you think that that's an actual UFO like that is the fakest fucking video I've ever seen in my life yeah but he didn't see that at all yeah in his mind he was seeing a real alien spaceship even on tour I'd be like he'd walk in my room and be like what are you doing I'm like I'll check this thing out I just made up whatever playing drums he's like dude fucking whatever George Bush just did you know he was just coming at me with some like politics he's been watching CNN or or yeah like he's just he's always been obsessed with it so he's obsessed with all sorts of like hidden things like not just UFOs but Bigfoot too and conspiracy theories politics yeah everything very very passionate about all those things conspiracy theories and politics it's interesting how those things go together because people are always wondering like who the fuck is running things what's really going on yeah what's happening behind the scenes who's pulling the strings what does it all really mean yeah you know yeah but the UFO thing is like boy boy you gotta I mean I absolutely believe there could be intelligent life out there but I've seen a fucking single thing that makes me think that anybody's got a picture same video yeah I feel like it could it could be real I believe but I war I'm not I can't fucking I'm not dedicating my life to search for it you know yeah and I I give it to a man to like honestly to walk away from your fucking very successful band to go do that shit like I have nothing but respect for his passion yeah but it's like I couldn't do that that's insane yeah it's like that just it really shows like he's you know he's very very passionate about it I hope he saved up some money yeah me too you know Survivorman Les Stroud naw he's you ever see that show huh fuckin great show he would Survivorman would go out into the woods with a limited amount of things he would say like okay I've got this bucket I've got a fucking pocket knife and I got a ball a ball of yarn and I'm gonna survive out here for seven days and he films the whole thing and he'd be filming himself like eating frogs and catching a squirrel and finding edible plants and just living out in the forest and oftentimes going days and days without food yeah and then he would have like a point where he'd get rescued seven days in there would be a spot where they would meet him he had an experience when he was in Alaska a long time ago where he was camping and he said he heard footsteps like big heavy footsteps and he heard some sound that sounded like a gorilla like whoa like something like that yeah and and then it ran off and to this day he's convinced that that was a Bigfoot and so now he has Survivorman Bigfoot and he goes out into the woods and just looks for evidence of Sasquatch well he needs to eat easily ate up Tom Tom will pull up he'll go with and he would love that I'm sure he would fuck yeah he's tried to get me to go with them I'm like good luck I did I did it one time I went hunting for Bigfoot for a television show I did for sci-fi called Joe Rogan questions everything we went yeah looking for Bigfoot and the more I talked to these Bigfoot folks the more I was convinced none of these motherfuckers have ever seen Bigfoot there was one lady that I talked to one lady who just did not seem like a liar and she was telling me that she saw something in the woods and it was standing up and it was tall like seven eight feet tall and she's like why is there a gorilla in the woods and then she's like oh my god that's Bigfoot and she said and it was the Pacific Northwest like outside of Washington State or in Washington State outside of Seattle and the woods are so dense up there that if anything goes 10 20 feet it's gone the problem with that is that there's black bears up there in black bears sometimes stand up on two feet they do it all the time and if you saw a black foot especially a black bear rather especially from a distance you would think it was a big gorilla if you're standing up on two feet which they do do especially when they're trying to see something they'll stand up and they'll even walk there's a lot of videos of them walking on two feet am just on the red legs never seen it nah that's crazy I could see how a big four hundred percent yeah so I think I don't think that lady's a liar I just don't she might I mean look it might be real there might be a few of them left there definitely was a thing called Gigantopithecus that lived in Asia and the thought is that it came across the Bering Land Bridge the same time that Native Americans came across from Asia and that they came across and you know because they lived in Asia and this this Gigantopithecus I think lived as recently I think as a hundred thousand years ago I think the the most recent fossils they have of it which is you know human beings were alive back then yeah and this thing was sixth or an 8 to 10 foot tall bipedal hominid so it was a huge huge ape-like creature yeah check this out this is a look at this bear so the crazy shit ever bears walking on two legs look at them like if you saw that old early yeah oh my god it's a fucking pig foot especially if you believe the hype and yeah you're searching for a Bigfoot out there yes yeah or if you're on shrooms Yeah right I mean if you're walking or if you're high on mushrooms like oh my god Bigfoots real look at that thing's like hey how you doing oh he's got a hurt right foot that's what that is you see his right foot there's something wrong with his right foot sometime yeah it looks like he's missing his front paw it says sometimes you know bears will fight with each other and one bear bite the other bears foot off or he could have gotten shot or it could have broke it off on something yeah that's crazy yeah he's missing a foot so he's he's walking around out there like a gorilla but everybody else I was like when I'm talking to them let they're like living in make-believe world here's another one walking around look at him that is weird man those are big-ass bears yeah big-ass bear still in on two feet I mean look they look like fucking people man I think that is a big reason why and they're there feeding them that is so crazy where is that that doesn't seem like America is it South Korea yeah Wow oh so that's it one of those wildlife parks where the animals are all and you're in a car yeah that's like fake wildlife I mean wildlife but not really wild yeah you ever see that video where the lady was in China and they were in one of those parks and she got in a fight with her boyfriend just she got out of the car and she got killed by a tiger no she actually she didn't get killed her mom got killed she's more fucked up cuz her mom came out to rescue her she got snatched by the tiger and then her mom what watch this shit this is crazy on another day of it she's like fuck you I'm fucking walking and they're like hey listen bitch get back in the fucking car there's Tigers out here just like none of now fuck you and fuck him and fuck you and the tiger just grabs her snatches around so the guy runs out and then the mom runs out but apparently the mom got killed - here comes the mom that lady wound up dying yeah and there's a park ranger like shit yeah when you get snatched up by a 600-pound cat you hear about that fucking dude in Colorado today he killed a mountain lion with his bare hands he smothered it to death yeah it get jacked him while he was jogging he was running on the trails the mountain lion grabbed him from behind he got a struggle this 80 pound cat and wound up suffocating it I guess yeah fucking bad-ass jogger just yeah I want to know what the fuck a bar is net fuck oh fuck yeah Erik Lewis or someone you know like I can't picture anyone else being able to do that maybe he's a jujitsu guy yeah we see him I've seen him when my kids were really young in Calabasas where I live I saw one like just pacing back and forth in my back fence Jesus yeah they're out here man yeah they're out here when we see coyotes in Deer all the time but mountain lions that's that's next-level scary yeah a friend might just send me a message this morning when I was when I posted that thing on Instagram about that guy that killed it and he said he was running on this fire road and he realized he like felt weird and looked over and 20 feet away from him was a big cat right above him on this Ridge 20 feet so that's basically us to that wall yeah big cat just looking and he said he waved his arms to look bigger and a thing just walked away uh I carry a nice when I run I carry a fucking half face blades it's got a like a loop you could stick your thumb into it so it stays in your hand and and people like why are you running with a knife what the fuck you doing like you don't need it until you do yeah and when you do you want to have it didn't someone get attacked by a coyote in Hidden Hills like running did they how is your story about that but I mean I ran in my neighborhood before and a two coyotes ran right past me I mean the group's yeah they usually don't mess with like humans you know well we had a problem with them killing chickens because I have chickens in my yard yeah I've lost a bunch of chickens too coyote so they were they were on top of the chicken coop pulling tiles off of it they're creepy little fuckers man but they're little you know these are like 35 45 pounds they're not very big but they're creepy there's something about their little wolves and they're looking at you and they're trying to figure out a way like what can they eat what can't they they're out there scraping scraping and grinding there's sneaky like gangster like I saw one of my friends a dear friend of mine he lost both of his dogs to coyotes and he had I think he had like surveillance of it and one is in the yard and he's playing dead and then his a dogs approach what they think is dead and then basically like his home he comes out of nowhere and attacks and they both and the one that's playing dead attacks and both of his dogs were a wrap how big were his dogs small I mean there were smaller dogs but you know now he has like big German Shepherds and he's you know he's kind of like got bigger dogs now but it was really sad ma'am it is very danceable like very very crazy yeah they figure out some way to work and cooperate together without communicating it's very interesting yeah like if it wasn't so sad that they're killing someone's pet it's it's really kind of fast that they're so smart that they would play dead there was a guy that used to work at this pet store that I go to and he also worked in a veterinary center medical place and a pitbull came in big one of those big Jack pitbulls just covered in cuts it cuts all over its body and the owner was you know they asked you only like what the fuck happened was I don't know he goes I came home he's covered in cuts I really have no idea what happened to him so he stitch the dog out but hundreds of stitches all over the dog's body then he takes a walk outside of his house and he follows his dogs blood and he goes up into the hills near his house and he finds nine dead coyotes that pitbull was yeah apparently he just tear and he said it looked like Vietnam it looked like a fucking like Saving Private Ryan just ripped apart coyotes nine of them this motherfucker just went mauling yeah they must have been so bummed out they're like this dog yeah there's nine of us we're good what good we got this guy yeah and then you see this fucking fire hydrant head yeah that doesn't feel pain they've engineered those things like there's some pit bulls this is pit bull if you go on Instagram I think it's I am The Hulk that's that's the name of the pit it's a 200-pound pit bull like they've gotten them to 200 pounds now it's the most preposterous thing you've ever seen in your life it looks like like like Brock Lesnar if it was a pit bull it's like it doesn't even make any sense you lookin like that a pit bull used to be like a 35 pound dog these to be small yeah look at that thing yeah they're white in the ferry imagine if a coyote saw that fuck yeah those aren't anything bull Mastiffs is fucking scary too oh yeah I had a master if he passed away recently I was 13 years old and we had to put him down and it was really sad he was he was a great dog Mastiffs are so sweet look look at the size of that fucking dog man just yolk to just it's a crazy 200-pound pitbull it's just so crazy that they make him that big now like a hundred pound pitbull used to be a bit I had a 90 pound one it was a big dog it's like wow that's a big pit bull and like has a big pit bull this dogs a hundred and ten pounds bigger if he doesn't even make any sense it's a fucking tank yeah but that's one of my favorite coyote dead death stories this guy going up into the hills and find all these dead coyotes just laying in a pile they try to ambush him what they would do they try to get one to come out and try to get chased and then the one would run and then the other ones would jump it they're like a game straight up that's crazy that they're they think like that though they're facts that they have actually have strategies they're savages yeah well that's like the downside of living in the suburbs the upside is you get a nice yard and get a little view and yeah I love getting away from the city here like you know it's like studio or just chaos whatever just going home and being home yeah meats nice Derick eat do you keep a place up in Big Bear anywhere I don't I don't I go up there I don't really like traveling really numb after my accident I fucking hate traveling Wow like I'll go on tour but I won't even look in an itinerary before I go on tour I just kind of like just tell me where to go I'll be up I'll be where I need to be but yeah like I don't want to and I don't fly you know I haven't flown since my accident oh wow so all your touring you do is by bus yeah by bus and then I'll take the Queen Mary to do Europe but no way yeah do you need a boat to Europe yeah measure of your boat sunk you know on a fucking float rafting mother fucker yeah trust me well you know what I'd rather be on the fucking raft then fucking plummeting into the ocean at yeah 100 miles per hour or whatever yeah I feel yeah but yes I like tuna for like like quick getaways like you know just chill out with the family so if you guys have a gig in New York City you have to start your journey five days early yeah Wow it's cool the kids and I get to see a lot of stuff we don't normally see yeah but I gotta really think about it like like that fucking fire festival yeah if they had booked us on and I was like I'm so glad cuz I would have had a drive five or six days you know to Florida to Fort Lauderdale then get in a boat and then you know get over to the Bahamas so thank God man because I was I was literally on my way there Wow so when you do that do you actually drive yourself do you have someone Drive you know I'd be white knuckling driving the tour bus have you driven a tour what it's scary man why are you driving like this right I've done it like what like when I was 19 or like 20 when I was on a tour the driver let me drive and it was the scariest fucking thing I was like take the fucking wheel man this is so scary like a white knuckling like just being in control being responsible over that big of a bus and all of my homies or you know all your friends are sleeping in it oh so it's like oh gosh man I give it bus drivers are that's a hard fucking job it's our money drive for you know I think you know we usually do eight to ten hour days a day yeah bus it's a long time it is a long time so it's quite a drive in and you know they have to stay awake and maintain their focus and yeah I don't know about you but when I see those white lines that there's something about that it's not good for me I start non yeah it's like hypnotizing yeah right it is hypnotized yeah I could do like two or three hours and I'm cool exactly you know San Diego is about as far as I want to drive yeah they're built different yeah and I know fuck you know they say it's way more dangerous to be on the road in a bus or in a car than being a plane but I don't know one day I always say like my kids want to fly one day maybe I'll be down but the thought of me leaving to go play some show or do something cool and something happening while they're at home like fucks me up right I don't really do I know what you mean I can only imagine I mean I don't think anybody's ever gonna be able to understand what you've gone through with that kind of an ordeal a plane crash where your friends died and the pilots are dead and and you managed to get out alive but almost lost your foot and burned half your body plus yeah you know fuck man it's crippling but I try not to let it be too much of a handicap you know by traveling but seemed like you seem like you got to work around ya and figured it out yeah but Australia can go fuck itself huh I wish I could go I thought I loved Australia I love Japan fuck I love Japan yeah you guys go there for UFC fights yeah have been yeah I can love it did you have seen in Tokyo once it was great I honestly wanted to move there really yeah I loved it so much David Lee Roth moved there for a while yeah he moved there to take sword-fighting classes fuck yeah moved into this dog got an apartment he is that you ever talked to him now he is one of the trickiest fucking guys I just got a message really recently that he wanted to talk to me and so they gave me a phone number for him I sent him a text message he's never heard back it's like I might have to call him like I don't I don't want to miss it out so if David you listening I tried twice yes but he said he wanted to get a hold of me for something and they gave him a number they gave me a number to get a hold of him but he's one of the more interesting people I've ever talked to in my life he worked as an EMT for a while when he just gotten out of Van Halen really yes like an actual EMT like helping people like in New York and people like what are you fucking David Lee Roth and yeah can you forget we're getting in the ambulance like he would keep together they like strapping people to a gurney when they're had accidents and shit and fucking date you imagine you get in a car accident and fucking David Lee Roth is gonna help you you like what what am I I must be dead yeah this isn't real life Wow fucking David Lee Roth that's fine that's legendary I love ya I love he's a trip yeah that'd be a great interview move to Japan with his dog just just hung out there I go what are you doing he's like taking kendo lessons it's taking sword fighting lessons from a Japanese master whoa so every day be ticklish taking fucking kendo sick he's that he's a real deal man yeah he's a real deal like a real eccentric but a really friendly really interesting guy yeah what it's awesome yeah I love when someone is like that yeah you know like your friend that hasn't talked for 22 years I love shit like yeah you don't hear about that or someone that'll stop being in Van Halen to go fuck with swords yeah yeah it goes fucks without you to think they're really bringing him to the Pentagon and shit like that I don't know cuz I said hey like I have no clue and I had watched a little bit of your podcast where you were like I use let me a text message why didn't you you know but I feel like he's made himself readily available you do that shit you know like right I don't know it's a it's I sit and scratch my head and go I don't know I don't know either I just fucking yeah he's such a talented talented dude - man he's like such a good songwriter yeah he well he certainly is certainly a very talented guides it's just so interesting that that's his main point of focus yeah I would think that if aliens were real Trump would have told us I really do believe that yeah that guy's he's such a fucking loose cannon he became the president like maybe they can hit it from him or his fucking chaotic as shit is right now it was something I don't know something with slip you know i yeah I would think that if they told him if they brought him those are just two things I would want to know who killed JFK those are two things I'd want to know if I became the president and our aliens real what do you got motherfucker yeah what do you got I go to the top generals I bet look I'm gonna defer to you guys I'm not a military expert okay I mean I don't want war but I want you guys to have support I got full respect tell me about that was it Trump borders establishment of space force he did that that's right the space force man but that's because there's that's actually a military strategy because they're concerned that as technology improves Russians are going to be in space and we're gonna be in space or or fight off two aliens Yeah right like Will Smith type shit yeah look at him yeah Mike Pence is behind I'm going Jesus oh yeah yeah I don't know man but if I became president I never will but if I did those are the two things that I'd want to know who killed JFK and where the fuckin aliens do you think they know do you think they know anything more than regular people because you got to feel like they come in every four years someone would open their mouth somebody knows somebody knows come on what did he give on must say he's an alien yeah bro he's not gonna rat on his friends right if he drive that car I'll give you the Cape just take it for a tour just take it for a spin out of here I will that fucking test will make you believe in aliens it doesn't even make sense it does not make sense I feel like I'm driving a computer when I'm in a Tesla it's no saint yeah it's like every car other than that seems stupid so this is love first when you've had yes Wow and you're just completely in love with it sold Wow sold I drove one there was a rental car company that was sponsoring the podcast and it was like like uber for rental cars they would drop off a rental car and they would remember the name of that company I don't know if they're around him yeah anyway um I said yeah I won't try a Tesla and I drove it I was I was kind of interesting but this was years ago it may be five years ago was that four years ago five years ago it wasn't as impressive but now I got the Model S P 100 D this is what he told me to get so I said alright I'll get it I drove that thing the moment I drove it the very first the first couple of feet like what is happening here like why is this going so fast it doesn't make sense it's effortless like effortless like every other car on that road has to accelerate it's like man this guy's just its instantaneously going 60 miles an hour I mean it just feels like it's it's happening in like blink blink 60 yeah and fucking smooth and just you can't hear anything yeah you don't hear anything it handles great it's quiet as shit it's comfortable yeah I'm fucked cuz I'm no dude I'm a gearhead like you I know you saw that blazer yeah do that Stoke yeah I tried building like my icon version of a blazer you know who built that for you his name was del mo he was over here in the valley so he did the LS swap and then I had another buddy of mine paint it and then I've just kind of like did ground up like suspension but I feel like I should have replaced the chassis and done everything like that I've known wanted it to be like a true icon but it bad fucking truck don't look in truck there it is that is so sick it's so few no icons done some Blazers yeah someone they did afterwards yeah oh so you have it it's a full convertible no hardtop god damn that looks good dude yeah I put a soft top on it like a bikini top mm-hmm but summertime I just take it all off but I rolled a rollcage too sick I love it I love the lowered ones too like the slammed ones they're so nice yeah thanks though that's so nasty man is that the color you have like a matte yeah it's a cool matte like charcoal Mercedes gray yeah that looks good yeah it almost pops wheelies it's so fucking strong he's so much horsepower which engine they put in there an ls3 okay what is it how many horsepower uh I think I'm at like 700 that's so ridiculous besides that you know I had like I like 16 old schools I've actually do you really I actually fell out of love with them it's kind of weird or I think I've spent like my time with them and I'm ready to like separate from them and move on and maybe like get other stuff or like I don't know I feel like it was a moment in time though I was like kind of like hood rich in a sense where I'm putting all my money into cars right like before I ever bought a house I had like four caddies you know and I was living in like a two-story a two-bedroom house you know with a bunch of friends but did that old red one behind you was dope what is that I still have that 53 Chevy truck oh that looks cool icon does some of those - you ever see the Thrissur he's got one for sale right now I saw it yeah somebody had one built and then just never drove it and yeah and he's selling it is nasty did I go over there and window-shop all have you got him yes super cool he's very CRO he drove me there that one's available right now look at that fucking thing he drove me in one of those and was like hitting corners at 70 like I fucking almost lost my breath that was like this motherfucker is crazy but they really do perform there oh yeah fucking cars even my Bronco even though it's so high yeah so high off the ground you would think that thing handles like shit it handles really good for for something like that is it like stock how it comes from icon like that same height or did you do anything yeah yeah he just does them all that way yeah and I was originally gonna get an F J made from him and I went there I saw the Bronco in person with that matte silver and I was like holy shit you did I go scrap the fucking F J we need to get this going so Jude did you do the whole build-out like you how long did it take well it's honorable you're on a waiting list for a long time and then I think the bill took close to a year it's like close to a year my agent yeah me too but the key is like have it in the then just forget about it yeah and then time goes by do you drive it a lot all the time I Drive to the comic store like two or three nights a week but since I got the Tesla I'm telling you man really ruined me it's ruined me I'm a gearhead yeah I like old-school cars I have a 65 Corvette with an ls1 supercharged drive that all the time side pipe you know that yeah silver shape I love it but it seems so dumb it seems so dumb wants to drive a Tesla Wow it's effortless dude it just goes yeah it's like you're on fast-forward I need to check it out everybody else is living in the past yeah like maybe last year I used to have a the wraith like the roll oh that's a sick car a bad car yes you have the ceiling with all the lights yeah ha ha ha space he was so sick but my buddy my buddy John said hey let's let's swap cars wherever we were driving so I did and I was tricked I was really impressed it was it fucking it was really really fast which one did he have did he have the 100 d I imagine it's the one before the one you're talking about because it was a couple years ago those were fast yeah but it was still impressive you know yeah those were fast they're still fast but this one is fucking stupid yeah it doesn't make sense it's like you it's like you're defying what you think a thing can do and it has that big fuckin screen yeah everything information yeah yeah they're dope he's a he's definitely a legend man you know Musk he's got his blowtorch to like he's fucking yeah he lit that fucking thing up in the hallway out here no yeah thought I was gonna burn the building I haven't even lit mine I'm so afraid my son's like of course an animal I don't want him to know how to turn it on yeah yeah he gave it to me and put the fucking fuel in it and everything I was like all right thanks crazy like he comes bearing gifts yeah how many people give you a glow gun blowtorch hell you just call it torch gun blowing which called it's not a blowtorch right no what does he call it's not a it's not a bullet or yeah not a blowtorch that believe so yeah yeah whatever it is this is a crazy picture online that we put up of him shooting that fucking thing out in the hallway and you're like you can't tell him no you know like no one tells him no he's got security around him and all these fucking all these mercenaries with guns no one saying it he rolls hard dude he's Elon Musk yeah it's worth billions everywhere he goes I mean he's gotta have security everywhere guys come before him and chase everything out yeah look at him what an iconic photo what the freak party signed above his head it's almost like we planned it and Steven Tyler that's Steven Tyler's mugshot in the background crazy man he said takes from your guys interview to where he's just like fuckin stoned be honest not so good I don't think he got stoned I don't think he really inhaled he took like a tiny puff I think he puffed it like a cigar I don't think I really smokes we didn't inhale he drinks we drank that's what was interesting about that the the blowback or the backlash is that we drank for two hours before we even busted out the weed what the weed was like what are they doing the guy takes one hit of weed what are they doing yeah and then it went crazy and stock plummeted 6% and but it went back up to 9% you smoked before you drink right I don't know I think you get really fucked up if you don't smoke a lot and you smoke after you've been drinking really it's a wrap yeah oh yeah I don't know he never seen I don't think it affected him he's like well he's so his brain is wired so different you know what his brain is like it's like you ever see like okay no disrespect to Pete Holmes but you know Pete Holmes the comedian like look at his body and then look at Usain Bolt's that's how I feel like like the way if they had a race that's I feel like with my brain in the room with Ellen's brain it was like oh these are barely the same thing you keep up man like you you've had some crazy guests that are talking about atoms and fucking the universe and whatever else and you're always like you you keep up with everybody it's an illusion I don't know just memorize things yeah I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about Deena they understand the actual concepts yeah you know I might be able to repeat things that I've learned in red but I don't know what the fuck I'm really talking about they know what the fuck they're like you know I'm saying it's like if someone never did jujitsu before and they want to talk about choking someone out in a triangle and I hear them say it I'm like okay yeah that's how you do it that's how you do it but they don't really know how to do it you know I'm saying yeah but then if you talk to hoist Gracie and he tells you how to choke someone that was trying to like this motherfucker did it he knows how to do it he does it all the time it's a different conversation you know so that's the difference like me I'm like a spectator talking to these geniuses but I just trying to pull information out of them I'm just trying to get them to talk you know yeah I just try to know a little bit about what they're talking about the guys that were on I don't know what was it last week the guys that were talking about like longevity like living yeah yeah David Sinclair yeah he was that was pretty crazy fascinating whereas fascinating yeah this I'm glad there's people like that out there I think within the next 15 to 20 years people are gonna start going back in aging like legitimately yeah they're gonna be able to not just slow down aging but we're gonna see like 60-year old ladies or hot as fuck yeah we're gonna see 60-year old ladies a little 532 I really believe that yeah I do too coming around the corner especially like I was talking about that diabetic medicine that he takes like metformin yeah yeah but apparently that stuff has negative impacts on athletic performance it's one of the things that I was curious about when when he discussed it and dr. Rhonda Patrick sent me something on it and Ben Greenfield actually brought it up on the podcast we did a couple days afterwards yeah it's I don't think it's it's probably good for longevity but not good for athletic performance which is uh I'm not willing to make that sacrifice yeah and he's probably not really concerned with it performance no no he barely worked out and he wasn't into working out hard either he's like his his deals like just maintain a little bit of exercise just to kind of keep the blood moving but a lot of those guys that are these super genius sort of longevity experts they're just interested in how you can slow the clock down as much as possible and then there's other people like Ben Greenfield or like Rhonda Patrick they're more interested in performance like what is what's the best thing for you in terms of for your mental performance physical performance I'm more in line with that but I'm but I'm also I want to know what these guys are working on yeah like the David's and Claire's of the world because he's at the top of the you know the tip of the spear when it comes to longevity and and gene-editing and you know yeah that what they're talking about is being able to inject certain what it was like certain genes or bacteria that carried genes it's gonna fix eyesight yeah crazy like people that are blind are gonna be able to see again like yeah they're gonna be able to do some mad mad shit as long as human beings don't we don't figure out I mean we don't nuke ourselves or fuck the world to a point where you know scientific research halts if these guys can keep going if we can make it to the next 50 years people are probably gonna live to be 300 years old yeah nuts mascone I love it how fucking smart people gonna be if they're 300 I mean think about how smart you are compared to when you were 20 yeah I was a dummy I'm so dumb I'm amazed I'm still here yeah like I stop and think about how I used to drive oh oh oh now you you have old schools do you have hot rods you have any hot rods nah pretty much like slow and though like old schools those are safer he had a couple impalas I just got rid of two of my impalas and I have like a 53 caddy I still have I have a 64 60 53 truck and a 41 caddy mmm 41 cash yeah it's nice man fucking nice but it's like a 3-speed you know what I mean like it's like it's you know no holds no more steering it's like it's like yeah you gotta know how to drive so yeah I still have a couple that I'm holding on to but I don't know or steering the steering must be Giants gigantic it's so sketchy to drive but yeah I'm gonna bring like I'm gonna bring a couple out I have a I have a festival that happens in March called music that's like tattoos music and cars oh well I bring a couple of them out there where's that a Orange County Fairgrounds oh all right yeah nice nice yeah so but yeah but I'm slowly I really just I don't know I want a simpler life man I want to be able to get in a car and not worry about if it fucking breaks down and I can get to point A to point B yeah without busy I am I don't know do I stay the fuck away from that Tesla yeah yeah it'll ruin you oh yeah there she is that's yours wow that's beautiful yeah what a car what I mean what out like a not just a car but a window into time yeah that's history I mean back in 1941 that's what people drove man that was the shit back then people tooling around Manhattan in one of those yeah I love seeing those you know the movies that take place during those time areas and they find all those classics so cool you know it was great the more recent version of The Great Gatsby with Leonardo DiCaprio when they drove those cars but it was a weird movie because they made those cars almost like modern oh very strange that's how Romeo and Juliet was to the one with um the one with Leonardo and you know I'm talking about did you notice that all the guns in there were super ill yeah yeah yeah cars yeah yeah it's like sake the futuristic yeah some weird interpretation yeah but still I'm period-correct right yeah so that's time period correct but when he drove that car it drove like no fucking car yeah like see if you find a scene where he actually drove the car because it sounded like it was supercharged and it's flying and it's handling well but it's all like cartoonish almost like everything the scenes were like when these they're driving these cars they're nothing like those cars were back then oh yeah because they don't move like that no less human Road unless you do like a LS swapping you have everything like when they're on the road like these fucking cars didn't drive like that man yeah they didn't they have skinny ass bullshit tires yeah they barely could break you hit the brakes it took forever to slow down that's a great movie though yeah yeah see they're all going sideways around corners and shit nobody did that back then it was weird it's weird how they do that with movies where they they have this like they're having a race yeah reason I mean with that electric car outside will blow by these motherfuckers the problem with those those Tesla's is that once you get in one other cars just seem kind of dumb they seem kind of old oh I bet feel like it's you're stepping into the future we have those anything else wouldn't seem even up to date you know but there's something about cars like you're 41 Cadillac that have a fame - um yeah that you're never gonna get from a new car yeah you know what's cool about those is like when you're in those you're not concerned with whatever's on the radio or talking on the phone or I don't know you're into just like your content we're just hearing the car yeah driving you know driving is fun yeah whereas like if you're just in a 2019 Chevy truck you're not gonna feel like that you know but it would take it that far back just a smell of them everything it's a it's a it's a vibe and it's just I don't know it's you can't compare it to anything yeah when I bought my 65 Corvette the first thing I do is pull the radio out I'll say get that out of here I don't want to have that radio unnecessarily yeah yeah only have those side pipes and the wind yeah but it's it's gonna be a thing of the past man I've really firmly believed that now after driving this car I think you know 50 years from now those things are gonna be it's gonna be like seeing some guy drive by on a Model T yeah engines are gonna be a thing of the past it's probably better for the environment anyway overall anyway I think that's it let's wrap this up nope dude thank you so much I was really glad we got together man it was very cool talking to you likewise um social media you're Instagram is just Travis Barker Barker and use Twitter as well or just yes Barker beautiful thank you brother [Music]
