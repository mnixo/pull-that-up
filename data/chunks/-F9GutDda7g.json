the Joe Rogan experience I went to I was a when I was a seal recruiter I got invited to MIT smart ass motherfuckers there man I'm not that I'm missing garanimal dumb a knuckle dragger and there was this guy that I forget his name and he was like the top head head guy old white guy you know all all genius doubt and we were on this panel and they were asking us all these questions about the mind mental toughness and shit he was answering them and I wasn't answering many questions I'll never forget he was just answering off of theory mmm he never put his fucking ass and shit you read a bunch of fucking books and you think that you know how the fucking mind works and shit I've gone through hell just a kid and then all the way up until now right so I know so that theory is bullshit yeah there's a lot of good stuff out there you can read from people but I had lived hell and when you put yourself in hell that's the only time you can figure out how to fuck to get through that motherfucker you can't you can't read somebody else's book about some theory on how to do shit some guy who set up in there a nice warm office and rat and wrote some book with a nice cup of coffee in the fucking hand no I want to see that guy who put immersed himself in fucking hell and he thought about quitting and leaving him and his wife and his kids and why am I here is it is it worth it all this crazy shit it still said and found out a way to get through it so basically that's that's the bottom line of it all we all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere that's why the six-minute abs and all sort of shit so powerful did you make it some results from it they're not permanent the permanent result comes from you fucking I say it all time you have to suffer you have to make that a tattoo on your fucking brain so when that hard time comes again you don't forget it you may forget it for a second but you can go back in the cookie jar call it it's a it's something that we've all indoors I call it the cookie jar and we often forget how hard we are but you got reflect back take a couple sides reflect in through this I've been through that and then remind yourself I'm a bad motherfucker and then you can get do that shit but if you don't believe it you ever endured shit you just blowing smoke man I think there is a lesson because I think that what we did actually was fairly simple which was we played it by ear and the stuff that didn't work we chucked it and the stuff that did work we augmented it and sorry there were no hard and fast rules yeah you're also special people you're both very unusually smart and open-minded well thank each other we found each other and I think I think open-minded is more important than smart in this case all right like being able to look at each other with compassion you know this is true for any interaction right let's look at you and see you as a human being with real emotions and feelings and reality to your experiences as well even if I feel like we disagree completely so even you know even when we're at our angriest with each other if we can see each other's humanity through it and you get through you know that that is a lesson for every human being in all walks of life in any situation when you disagree with someone not just your lover not just a friend but people that you don't even know it's it's very easy to dehumanize someone who disagrees with you and I think to bring this all back around this is a part of the problem with male-female interaction today is this dehumanization on both sides that the men are demons that the women are this and the men of that and it saw this you know it's these rash generalizations in this extreme tribalism well there is kind of a secret weapon and I it's not let us check it out the secret is Heather and I have a whole second channel on which to navigate which is that we both know the same evolutionary story yeah so there's a way you know there here's an idea that's important you can very often understand more about a given human interaction especially a contentious one if you turn down on the sound right so you can't hear what's being said and that sounds wrong right sounds like well the most important piece of information you could have is what these people are saying to each other as they're arguing but no that's not how human beings work sometimes the important information is on that vocal channel and sometimes the vocal channel is actually almost purely noise right and so if both literally and metaphorically yeah but if Heather and I both know that then there's a part of us that's sort of always outside I mean we don't fight that much it's really pretty rare but when we do there's also a part of us that's watching the interaction and knows that a certain pattern may have to unfold in order for us to get to the other part of it you know sometimes they're knowing that we're engaging in theater at some level even though neither of us wants to be that's a great way to put it engaging in couples theatre it's the perfect example of this thing like you know you're talking about Peterson and going to work and wearing makeup and you think am i sending sexual signals will it be gosh we're all involved in weird stuff sure right yeah the idea that you and your mate could both be aware that your argument is in some in some way theater and that even you know you might think well if it's theater we can just skip it no you can't know there are things that have to happen in order for you to get to the next act there are so many of those guys I mean how many guys did we start out with that were alcoholics or former alcoholics yeah fucking everybody all of them yeah and they're all and that was the thing about when you were an opener in Boston it was like the criteria were are you funny enough to cover 15 minutes to open number to do a functioning automobile that you can take these DUI headliners to the gig with because none of them had licenses and so I can remember like picking up Gavin picking up sweetie picking up Mike McDonald's yeah and having to drive these guys out to wherever and then you couldn't leave early cuz you were driving them home they'd give you a few bucks for gas and you were happy to do it you're like holy shit I'm gonna be in a car with Tanya and so one time Nix Nix gummy stuff called me up and they're like you're working in Framingham you got to drive the feature and the headliner out and I go downtown to pick them up in front of Nicks and I've got a I've dated 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit 4-cylinder rusted out floorboards and I get down there and it's Mike Sullivan Irwin who weighed about 300 pounds and John Pinette always about 275 and they saw my car and they both started giggling like schoolgirls like we're gonna fuckin go to a gig in this guy so we packed them in and ins I couldn't get on I couldn't get the car going above like 40 so instead of taking the Mass Pike out west of Framingham I had to take Route 9 no the whole way so I wouldn't get it past 40 that's hilarious like you carrying lumber on the roof eight hundred pounds of humans in my car that's crazy yeah interesting was it stupid a do you have to watch the Olympics there but I'm this Olympics is I think I'm gonna say this I think the Olympics are gross this is why I think the Olympics are gross I think it's a great opportunity for all those athletes I think it's great for people to watch it but I think it is a fucking disgusting money grab and all those amateur air quotes athletes don't get paid shit and these companies are making billions and billions of dollars off of them and I really wish they would all quit I really wish they would say fuck you pay me I really wish they would just go straight Ray Liotta they give a fuck you payment they give up their youth for that not only that the fucking companies they're so restrictive the IOC and all the people that are behind it are so restrictive and they are making ungodly sums of money ungodly contracts they're just giant contracts to air the the Olympics giant amounts of money to build these stadiums and set up these or these events and everything is about nationalism and national pride whether it's in Korea or Russia or whatever the fuck they do them but meanwhile the athletes don't get dick they don't get dick if you're lucky and you're Michael Phelps you become famous out of it and you get a bunch of commercials and endorsements and you make a shitload of money that but how many Michael Phelps's are there there's a three or I mean how many but how many in all the Olympics and out all the Olympics Jamie Europe sports fan had all the Olympics say like the Olympics this year well let's go the last one who the fuck came out of it were there a household name Yeah right now you've got Shaun White and maybe okay I heard of that guy the girl that won Kim as their last names last night or two nights before the real famous there's Lindsey Vonn that's just very famous it's very famous she used to date Tiger Woods that made her famous too plus she's hot that makes her famous interesting names so like yeah her she's a gold medal winner I believe how many other ones are there it's like a handful they can build a story around someone than the whole story but but when you get to the point where it's worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life and it actually pays off what that what are the odds it's so fucking small but meanwhile people are tuning in to all of it they're making massive amounts of revenue from all of it and they're not sharing it with the athletes at all I think it's fucking gross they pretend it's amateur tennis and amateur it's a goddamn motherfucking business that's what the Olympics are well you can't basketball and football really n-c-double-a says student athletes shouldn't be paid because the Thirteenth Amendment allows unpaid prison labor what the fuck oh that's Shawn King I cannot this is me another article well it made one going around but there's a that's crazy you don't really say that did you really say that the Thirteenth Amendment which allows unpaid prison labor they cited in a lawsuit response to a Moses and that's what they use it's so disgusting they're so disgusting they're the same to me n-c-double-a the college football and basketball same thing to me hundred thousand people yeah fuck you pay those guys pay them pay those girls pay all those athletes you're making money you're making money and you're not sharing it with the athletes they might as well be slaves they might as well be fucking prisoners the Olympics NCAA all that shit it's just these no way there's no way you could do that fresh today if you started from scratch today or and said we're gonna make billions of dollars and we're gonna give you all got it all got so cool there's no way [Applause] you
