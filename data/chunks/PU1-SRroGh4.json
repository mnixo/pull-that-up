the Joe Rogan experience there's too many bongs out there right people still rock the bong those got to respect that you know it's like driving a manual car I never was a bong guy it's too heavy man I got shit to do man I can't oh that just peeled down or the dab thing that I got friends in Colorado California now the first time I ever did wet shit this is pretty embarrassing story but my my buddy you know they were all at California Colorado guys they roll pretty hard I'm not really a heavy smoker man to be honest on the road it keeps me occupied from time to time but from writing maybe but at home you know there's no need so it the first time I did that shit I didn't know what it was you know I just pulled it like it was a big old bong rip and they're like I'm very special oh you know I need you instantly no you just did something you shouldn't have oh no and lay off fuck man so I sat down and after a couple minutes I just started getting really cold and clammy I was like yep I'm gonna puke so when I was like I fucked this guy so I puked right in his sink I was like dude I got to go home I feel like dog shit now and I'm pretty sure I'm dying so this apartment I was like went out the door and turned the corner to go down the hallway to mine and it was full-on vertigo like the hall every time I took a step the hall we got twice as long this is fucked up my wife was out of the country I work at the time I was like I remember I was sitting down in the hallway just like trying to get my shit together man because I thought I was having a fucking heart attack it was just like Pat like sweating and I remember this voice saying get up you stupid junkie fuck before somebody comes out here and sees you you know sitting in the hallway like a dumbass and I managed to like pop out of it and as soon as I got back to my place and sat down on the couch everything was fine but it was just so initial and the rush I was like I don't nobody needs to be that stone you know that fast I'm sorry yeah we were talking about Joey getting in trouble though he just just texted me about it how's Joey Diaz get in trouble with what the MMA community MMA outlets nothing to do well here's the thing though I see where they're coming from they're they're journalists if someone says something that fucking outrageous about what McKenzie Durin's derriere must he said I think your ass smells great right yes the comic uncle Joey said this yes the Commodore girl Joey but I get it I get where they would and then Vinny Magalhaes back them up I get it packed up Joey yeah backed up Joey says alike and tasty too yikes yeah yikes I get it I don't get it that's Joey Diaz the great comic who's commenting on a hot girl in the UFC he is not a writer he's not a journalist these riders have nothing to do so they're like how can we get hits let's talk about Joey Diaz right because no one's reading any of our shit I agree with you in some what but he definitely did do it like it ain't a bat here's my thing they could say whatever they want about what he said but if he was your friend and he texted you that you would do what I did I'll show you he fucking texted me that before tweeted I love the Joey text now Joey never would text message oh I hope he doesn't keep the ideas as a full on text easy he still calls though last week most of the time he calls but he texted me yeah it's Joey yes man sorry folks you can go to Google what he said I'll try to be respectful it it's Joey Diaz this he can say whatever he wants he doesn't work for the UFC he's not he's not an attorney right I'm glad he does I glad he does think like that okay you don't send me texts like that but if I was a news website and I was gonna report up first of all you want me place read yeah let cliff for sure that's what they want but also anybody who reads that I really you're either gonna be like me or you like you're gonna start laughing what so you're gonna get really upset really upset and you're not a joy Diaz fan you know if you read that in 95% of that is dudes reading are like that's hilarious yeah the other 5% of like what the hell what are we doing how could you report this yeah I think that's a good number 95 95 percent of dude that's hilarious I was wondering the same thing some women will get upset though and rightly so if I have just to imagine if you were a dude and there was some big ol giant Alexander Karelin looking dude who wanted to fuck you and he was always making jokes but well your butthole must smell like just stop just stop and think of what that would feel like that wouldn't be a good time after McKenzie if you're anybody that someone is saying those things about right I just mean just trying to be open-minded social justice I'm fucking cows I come out it's not possible I just I feel another thing but what I'm saying is if you look at it from the position of my right as a person the person whose butthole is in question that would be an uncomfortable position to be in right a bunch of people talking about what your butthole smelled like we're just trying to make a living on TV just trying to make a living just try to choke a girl you know what that it's it's also Joey Diaz being complimentary you know it'd be one thing if she was not an attractive female or something like that she's obviously very attractive which is what makes us funny I agree 100% there's definitely people that are bored with Hollywood though like enough well they do Hollywood's overreach I think Hollywood tends to be what bothers me about Hollywood is their virtuous virtue signaling like they're gonna set an example you fucking guys like you want to be liked okay and you're as fickle as it gets they were the same people that were standing up and clapping for Roman Polanski yeah I'm sorry man well some of them were some of them were really saying some ridiculous shit like guys it's a long time ago and he's drugged and sodomized a 13 year old I think I was like more than one too yeah yeah so so guess what you know I can't have that guy you're not kidding they wanted to sign a petition to bring him back in the country I can't forgive that stay in France well they want to bring it back to the country to arrest them and they're really trying hard to do that and there's people that resist that I think he's an amazing artist and you know artists are just they're just be consistent though you know en system that's where I draw the line you can't drug kids fuck with me I mean Asia Argento was one of the one of the people that came out against Harvey Weinstein she had been raped by him apparently and then she had a sexual relation for ten years afterwards which by the way feel like I live I actually forgive that because people go back to the trauma right they want to relive it on their own terms but she signed the petition to for Roman Polanski to you know to be freed when he was put under arrest and I believe it was Switzerland now that's not consistent I'm sorry man I'm sorry but if that guy's just as bad as yeah you can see the petition on them what was her perspective she was somebody who thought Roman Polanski should not be prosecuted for something that happened a long time ago she signed that petition I would never sign that petition so there's a lot of disconnect so I have a big problem with that sort of disconnect that's a problem I don't know this woman I don't know her III believe her I believe what she says about Harvey Weinstein and again you know people like well she went back to the scene of the crime that's very common but don't sign the petition and then now be this leading voice in this whole you know anti harassment so III think it's very inconsistent I think you have to pay you have to at least answer to that did she comment on what she saw I think she there was a Mia culpa there but it's very inconsistent in it and and there's a lot of that out there so a bunch of my US team members are gonna shoot me in the face for tough talking about this big guys in the face yeah literally in the face because one thing that was an ongoing thing for when I was on the US team we there was a thing that went on about how long we could go at a tournament before we talked about this particular person so during my time on the teams we actually had a person that was she claimed to have medical disorder or she didn't actually claim to have it but supposedly it happens but she claimed to have a disorder where she had attachment to items this girl that was on my team actually ended up marrying
