boom and we're live what happened you took your hat off you're going crazy I'm trying to feel you know I want to feel at home it's at West Coast marijuana dude it's hard and fast it's no joke yeah it's no use chemists or whatever they are botanists he's fucking science dorks they've done wonder did a job yeah Jesus Christ it's not even the same thing anymore no it's a it's it's a it's a it's it's GMO all the way yeah it's like hey you guys tested this on people you know it's crazy I'm like I know you took the seeds out of watermelon but what yeah they do that I don't know how did that even happen I don't know I just read that at Barbra Streisand cloned her dogs did you really heard about that Jamie told me it's like the weirdest thing just two dogs from one that's where she made two clones of her favorite dog that is like the polar opposite of adopt don't chop yeah it's like you can't get any further yeah cause like $100,000 oh my god yes it does yeah she can't have a different shape it's impossible can't be a different dog it's impossible yeah it's a it's a weird it's a weird move to fuck man if you really believe that personality comes from that if it's the same thing like if it just looks the same or you don't want it to just look the same do you know it's supposed to be an identical clone of your original dollar so it's really kind of wood and really stupid but what is your favorite work all the way there we go the way it looks like like 94% your dog and then you know it's missing an asshole it's 30% as smart as your last dog which is pretty good because your last dog was a genius also there's another dog attached to it that's walking in the different direction so eventually got to pull each other apart you got six eight weeks with these weird to heavy stuff for a hundred grand yeah you could just go to the pound yeah the friend there's I have a story that I do my act about a pound dog that I had I had a pound dog that killed one of my dogs Wow pound dogs are tricky man yeah you know you get a dog that's been in like a shelter for a long time yeah sometimes they're in there for months they come out highly aggressive and like myself um my son's a shelter dog but I got her I mean she's 13 now but when I got her she was a puppy you know and they found she was a stray puppy she's a little black lab like just wandering in the Bronx yeah and I got her probably like three days after they found her what age do you think a dog would have to be like you got to imagine like a certain amount of abuse that a dog suffers early in its life before it gets to the pound has got to really fuck with its head yeah I think there's dogs you get at the pound you're essentially like taking on an abused organism its nightly it's not just that it doesn't have a home it's that it might have been in dog fights like I'm pretty sure that mine either its family was in dog fights or it was in a dog fight and there's you know people around you that are probably kicking you and beating you oh yeah or you're tied up for hours at a time you like you you know you have no I mean who knows but I do think dogs can be rehabilitated but I do think it takes you have to have a look to even have a dog be a good dog right I like to have like I have a I have when I have my puppy like I worked with my dog so much and she's a great dog like I could walk in New York City without a leash just follows me she's not really yes she's amazing that's amazing but I worked so hard and then if you add to that you have to first like Dee right you know like uh brainwash them or let them over the anxieties that like there's certain dogs that just hate men cuz obviously in their former home it was an abusive man in the house and you know they react differently to men than women you know it's sure yeah yeah you mean you never know a dog can't tell you what it's seen you know nope I had one dog that I adopted she was two and she had mange all over her body like all over her body and she looked terrible man and they caught her eating out of garbage cans in front of this family's house that rescues pitbulls and I took her in and like within a month she had hair on her body she looked great she was healthy sweetest dogs yes sweetest dog with people but if another dog got too close she would fuck that dog up yeah it was like she was like protecting what she had it was it was real hard to have an aggressive like pound dog yeah and depending on their size but it is like the thing I would always tell people to try to do first because I am a big like adopt own shop guy like if you go to a dog pound you could find someone right where I got my dog if you go which is like Animal Care and Control in New York City like they euthanize like a hundred dogs a day like it's literally just like their dogs are coming in all the time dogs with stab wounds dogs they find in the park half day and then they like they have five days in that pound and then they're out so it's like if I was when I was there this is again like thirteen years ago but when I was getting my dog and I was waiting to pick her up but this woman came in with two Rottweilers beautiful Rottweilers on leashes and she goes I don't want these anymore um and the lady behind the cameras like what do you mean like that you know and she was like I just can't handle them and then they like took the leash and she walked out and then they were just he's too done no I don't know if they were trained to kill or not I was gonna be like I had two Rottweilers two might ask who knows I have no I knew nothing about them but I'm like well in five days those dogs are dead because they're like four year old Rottweilers I had a Doberman that we adopted as kid when I was a kid and it had distemper and it it's a disease that makes him really aggressive and it's crazy way the dog turned on us that's scary oh dude it was so scary I was like I couldn't have been more than 12 I was like maybe 12 somewhere around then and this big-ass Doberman is like showing its teeth and barking and snapping and out of nowhere yeah it was the sweetest dog before and then all of a sudden it's on the couch like looking down on us and we were like whoa what is happening here and so they they came and took the dog I think or did we take the dog to the pound I don't remember what happened or to the vet rather and then they ran an examination the dog and they're like this targets distemper so we just we've got it with this your disease then that's like you can't have that in a house with kids I don't know what the fuck they do I was a kid at the time when my parents weren't having it but I don't remember I don't remember too much about it they send him to the couch I just remember that dog on the couch showing its teeth yeah snapping at us scary and I was like oh shit we brought home a dog a full-grown dog yep that has a disease Maya my mom's cousin so my like second cousin was married with dude for number of years who have this Rottweiler that was like a psychotic dog and like at one point it jumped through there Bay glass windows in their house to try to get the mailman and got caught oh my god Queen the two windows and was I it was fine I mean it's you know had stitches and they had to pull some glass out of it but it like didn't impact the dog that's how and it dove through a window it just didn't make it like to a man it would have like killed the male it was just because if somebody was walking up their porch you know and the dog just and not in that same book it almost the one time like my grandparents had a house upstate and they were there like my brother open the door and came out him you know it was just like but some people just like having like a scary no I'm like that's not the kind of dog you just want around a kid you don't just know people get killed yeah yeah it certainly can happen especially if it's like really aggressive with people like that like Jesus that's so dangerous yeah monster yeah and they're huge right why there's like a hundred those big males there's big fucking frying pan heads yeah they're giant flat heads it's funny too cuz we're talking about like genetic modifications or cloning but really dogs if you look at them historically that they've been that the whole time like men have man has manipulated what they wanted have certain animals and like they've bred the the the meanest toughest ones to be guard dogs and they've bred the cutest take a piss on a paper Matt wants to be left to us you know those are all choices that were made by humans yeah by humans in overtime they look like by continued breeding of ones that were the same and same see me end up with like you know breeds and things like man really like played a huge role in the kind of man did the whole thing yeah cuz when they did they did genome but it's just a wealth of DNA it's a wolf yeah every dog is a wolf yeah no matter how big the talk is isn't that crazy yeah think about how powerful and terrifying and majestical wolf is right it's one of the most amazing creatures in the far and agree more and we found just the one that was just slightly bitch-ass just slightly bitch-ass away come on in the campfire bro yeah dude we got free food like your ears poking up like this dude just relax relax for your ears I think you two alert yeah you looking a kid and then they found a male that was like that dude they figured out a way to get the bitch-ass family they stayed close to them to fuck each other just like they were like let's take the two smallest ones and make them do and then you know and then they probably and then you've got dog houses and I bet dog houses change the game have to lose extra hair gets cut not having a hunt every day so this is great I want white curly hair I'm a poodle now motherfucker excuse me I'd like a perm yeah funny amazingly food food dog but it's still a dog that dog will fuck you up yep somehow those poodles are ruthless those things will come out yeah poodles probably have an attitude too like no one takes them seriously yeah yeah yeah I got a bunch of guard dogs what do you got then 90 pound poodles yeah shut the fuck up oh yeah still a dog yeah hittin it would be so funny if that thing that looked like a Barbie toy right and looks like a Barbie toy doesn't even be really a real dog that's all I'll fuck you up it'll bite your dick off but I have to say I feel bad when I see dogs have that haircut it's like they have no part in it you know what I mean like they're just happy yeah Jamie's showing us a picture of dogs with braids unreal okay now seriously wearing slippers is that cultural appropriation look how does that work a little bit I feel like it might be there a white dog they're stealing from Santa Claus look at the colors yeah they got Santa's gang colors and people just you know like Dom what in the fuck is that not okay what in the fuck did they do this dog we're looking at a dog Esteban is a pink snail and I'm not joking it looks like a pink snail like a swirly with with hot pink accents how do I say it yeah stripes and its back leg as a flower yeah it's fucking preposterous spray painted they spray paint spray painted the dog the dog is dying that's chemicals it has green hair - it's like it says the poodles transformed into pandas horses and don't do that you fart and even snail you've seen the ones with a stuff they take certain dogs they make them look like a lion what dog do they do that what the fuck did they do this dog they turn into this is so mean this is abuse come on it says Cindy the poodle right so city the poodle just is a new look every year Donna 90s oh oh sorry looks now oh my god Cindy Blackie parents oh my god that's a different dog they turn this dog into a pan now show me your stuff it's hair white and black and imagine coming over someone's house she's dead like Sonic wildlife scuse me you have a camel and a pant in your front yard hey dude um I can't pat your bear I can't pet your bear oh I have family dude they turned into a horse this is the folks who are just listening what does he go in this Jamie because we have to tell people about this it's a poodles transformed in the pandas bison did they put a mask on it with a glue a master at ed I don't these are monsters yeah these are horrible would they do the dog the game of mazel yes the monthly they put a muzzle on it so it looks like a football helmet pleat that they could he could be a football player from the 30s you know he had to have one in the face put a wig on how they do the Buffalo the Buffalo doesn't even make sense scroll back up again the Brewster scroll back up to the Buffalo where's its head nose where's its actual head oh so they put something over its head look at that it looks like they put a outfit on them horses that seems mean this is mean like extra ears you think they put a mask on them it looks like this is so fucked up so crazy now you are a werewolf no I'm just a dog man oh okay you got hot dog oh the last one they turned into a peacock he literally glued feathers to its ass that is just I'm told that it's just it looks like it might be actually just standing there and they have the feathers propped up against the wall possibly am I seeing that correctly but the other stuff has done to it I think that yeah it's unfortunate you know go get a fucking mr. Potato Head how about decorate your house no sangria god damn dog yeah it's just Christ people they're gross make so many bad decisions but it's interesting like that did you know one of the things that was coming out of South Korea during the Olympics was people were talking about in Asian countries the consumption of dogs it became a big hot point issue with a lot of people yeah it's it is weird that we like choose certain animals that it's okay to kill any I could agree more man I think that our our food hang-ups are so specific to our country like put a bacon egg and cheese sandwich right is fried pig's ass unfertilized embryo and mold well that's not not true and old but yeah and it's sometimes you ever crack an egg and there's a little chicken in there no no I've had little extra things in there no I've had like a little grow most really yeah not like a full chicken but like oh that's gonna be a chicken you know I was like in my 40s before I knew that an egg couldn't become a chicken as I never thought about the rooster and now I didn't know they were they just laugh all the time yeah I didn't know that until I was in my 40s yeah I don't think I you got to be a forum setting to know that could you imagine if you were a farmer what a fucking asshole you would think somebody is that didn't like what you offer on your chickens didn't know you didn't know yeah that couldn't just become a chicken like no I just it's like this one things where it's people that are vegetarians I urge you to eat eggs eat eggs it's a free ride yeah they just coming out anyway they're coming out coming out anyway if you get it for you can get it from a place like just like you can get organic grass-fed beef you can get pasture raised chickens they do have that then pasture raised chicken eggs though the yolks come out dark you just kind of figure out where to get them they're not as a more expensive but they're not as expensive as meat right I mean they're really good for eggs last a surprisingly long time it's a free ride the chicken is gonna eat all that stuff on the ground the bugs and all the worms if you don't want to kill anything just eat those eggs yeah it's good for you very good for you they're fucking amazing for you goddamn egg propaganda I'm a big lover of eggs yeah I can eat eggs every morning I do yeah I'm almost every day yeah yeah I just think that it's a one of the most Karma free things yeah like you got an exchange with these animals like I have an exchange I give the animals food they eat the food they lay the eggs I'm nice to them I come into their little caged area they don't run from me they come around give them little treats and shit they look pets yeah they have this really cool life they get to wander around occasionally to get jacked by coyotes really I've had a three but how I'm act by they they're not next to at least to one of them I'm suspicious you don't have him in a coop man it's a fucked up story I've told it before I'll briefly tell it again my Mastiff got honeydicked by a female coyote oh my god and he thought the coyote was his buddy and he got two now this is I should say that my gender you know gender identifying with this coyote I did not have a chance to like really closely examine it I'm just being it's for the good of the story this is what I think this is my theory mm-hmm I think it's a little earlier coyote and I really think was a female is hanging around my house for a while and it talked my dog and then knocking down a fence and he's huge okay and when he got through the fence he got to the chicken coop and one of the chickens was doing a thing called brooding and when they brood they they're convinced that if they sit on their egg that that egg is going to turn into a chicken fuckin convinced they get just to get like a little depressed to get nutty yeah and what you have to do when they're brooding is you have to take them off of the nest and put them in a cage by themselves with just a perch so they just sit on the perch for like a day or two and then it leaves their system but if you let them lay on it it'll take like 30 days take so long then they plug but how how do you plug their uh their their feathers off but so how often are you monitoring your chickens that you're like we got a brooder yeah oh it's pretty it's pretty evidence for yeah yeah you look at him every day if there if one of them is in the the hen box like where they lay their eggs and she's like getting weird when you get in the air like a little weird with you Anila package a little bit like that yeah not they don't try to hurt you but they're protecting what they think is yes I think I think there's a baby yeah it is it is but what's the alternative you got a bunch of cocks in your yard yeah watching chicken rape on my backyard 24/7 but maybe like once in a while bring a cock in to you know give them a weekend and so what we need is bird birth control I don't want these chickens shit now kids and when I can bring in a couple of roosters I'm willing to make a few adjustments this is what I want I want sever the Roosters vocal cords I don't hear that shit at five o'clock in the morning yeah we know the sun's coming up shit yes Siri told me serious and that would be one and then make it so his dick doesn't work like like his sperm you like what do you call that yeah give them all fix it job yeah just let them bang it out for pleasure you let one fertile male inch going let's take their cows I think a rooster without a voice is not gonna be I bet you're gonna have a brooding rooster on your hands you know that's gonna take what the rooster you know it's half of its yeah what a piece of shit I am no I'm saying like you know the nines I've seen people who have to clip their dog's vocal cords because their dogs bark steam I have heard of that that's fucking scar raisi man that is it is annoying when they bark at you though sure but I would say try chickens have the weirdest birth control method ever oh no what is it but it's got to be a chemical chickens have long known to a time eject sperm after doing the deed Wow that wasn't well established what wasn't was well-established was the underlying reason for what's technically known as seminal evacuation I like how they give us a technical term because now I understand it better I'd prefer it's technically turned just call it shooting jizz yeah shit the jizya but in a recently published paper a team led by Oxford researcher Rebecca Dean explains that this behavior is in fact far from random and that the tendency for females to jettison sperm is actually finely tuned mechanism of post copulatory sexual selection wow wow wow that's weird dude well that'd be a weird thing to see right walk into a chicken just a chicken kind of Gemini your sperm splits she's a little like what would be the like evolutionary advantage not that you're a biologist nor my we should probably stop there what would be the evolutionary advantage of being able to shoot sperm outside you get a vibe he's an asshole why was it I wasn't consent I didn't say yes to that Tyra's bullshit yeah really why did he take me last you know I mean why don't I have to wait for for other you know chickens a wonderful Easter crows are like like those that's what's called right a crow when they stagger yeah I think so I wonder if there's like national anthems and that some people nail it and some people just overdo it like some hens just like Jesus Christ we get you're awake you're awake yeah we got it the first time Oh [Music] when that unity like nah it's not supposed to be that long it's a shorter song than you're doing you're doing a totally different song if you're doing that you're doing that thing with your voice that oh yeah you do Whitney Houston tell you not to do yeah they love that 100 another time I wish I could do that thing yeah when I helped in that East Village in New York City back in like year 2000 1999 it was uh it was it had it really been like a you know a neighborhood that was gentrified whatever you want to call it at the time and there was a lot of roosters in the neighborhood like these parking lots they have these like empty Lots where there were no buildings and people just had chickens and roosters outside so I would I was like I'm not 21 years old sleeping in my apartment in the West Village and every more from the East Village rather and in every morning I wake up to rooster crowing like every morning and then after a while the community started hanging these signs like are you sick of that roosters like and then they also gothic turning on the dudes who own the roosters dude yeah which is not cool because it was like those guys to live there a long time and have roosters you know so there was that petitions yeah all these rooster petitions and then over like maybe a year and a half two years it was no more roosters yeah one of those like like end of an era things in New York City where people still had like just wandering chickens and an empty lot it had like could help caps in it and chickens people don't understand how cool that is I don't know I don't know it's like this it's this weird thing that happens in cities where people come in and take all the culture out of it and then complain yeah let go what happened all the cultures that could you removed it look you you actively came in and removed it well isn't it making as much of a suburban environment so you could have kids in a minivan and all the stuff you would have had in the burbs anyway well now you say that though isn't it a problem that it's not like one individual that's doing it it's like a whole movement of economics right it's a movement of economics but there is a lot in my opinion of sort of community like activism towards making the community the way they envisioned it to be we end up with a lot of signs there's like we're working on a tomato coop and you're like well man you know now it's so now you know there's a man come up they're working right now to get in on that you know and then like so there's a lot of like but I'm not saying that things are doing or bad but they're definitely you know there's just been a removal of a lotta that's up and look there's this argument about New York City that people used to be better you know it's like now like it was really dangerous better yeah but they're so there's an up and down to it's a matter unless you were the guy that got shot exactly and like and then there's the other part which is you can I look at cities like this it's like you're always building something on top of something else that was already there yeah so what to us is like I can't believe that hardware store went out of business it's like yeah well maybe my grandfather's I can't believe they're putting a hardware store and we're like the horseshoe guys like oh really the telegraph guys going out with this is bullshit you know like like it's probably something people felt you know anytime you're somewhere first you always feel like someone's ruining it yeah I think we're in a very interesting time and in in a lot of amazing ways and I think we're learning more about people and behavior I think than ever before I think we need to give ourselves a little bit of a break in this because I think everybody has this feeling like why haven't we got our shit together why haven't we fully evolved and my take on this is that this is a really recent thing like being aware of what the fuck is going on just in Ghent in the general scheme of being in the universe is a very recent thing yep and what we know about life and what we know about you know just our own finite life form how far it's gonna be able to be pushed how long we can stay alive you know what how easy it is to transfer information from Australia to China to fucking England and back and forth and back and forth we're in the craziest time ever and it's all really fucking recent really new 20 plus years if that because if you go back 20 years ago the internet existed but it you couldn't like watch a video on it and then self like to me the smartphone thing is every day I'm like I can't believe I have this vague in my pocket this is like it's like if if you don't remember what it was like to like you know if there's this whole like vibe like Millennials don't get it you know like I don't know I have the same attention span as a millennial because I'm on my phone like this is we know that adults that adults are better you know and I'm like I don't know like I did a USO tour in Afghanistan a couple years ago and I met all those dude like the soldiers man and women over there and I was like really blown away I was like really impressed this idea that like our best days are behind us all that stuff and I'm going I know this is a really impressive impressive group of young people who are like fighting for the country volunteering to fight for the country and like coming back here sometimes wounded sometimes you know all the things that they risk going there but then like you meet them and you're like these are like they're not like jarheads you know they're like sophisticated thinkers and they're like trying to like be a part of something it's I found it very like inspiring to be around that not like aw baby boy bunch of bunch of losers if Millennials loser sounds like did seem awesome yeah I mean there's we have a soft life now so there's gonna be a lot of people that are ridiculous and you know are there's always been those people that are weak-willed and they want the world to be nerfed up and of course had their feelings you're you're gonna have that there's also more people that have an understanding of like that's not a happy healthy way to live your life it's not and I also think that like reality at some point will always supersede nerf padding yeah there's always gonna be pushback on that we go look like I don't want to offend anybody but like you know and I do agree that like there's a movement by the left that really does push you know I did a thing Reese I'm doing this charity event for like an urban program for kids mainly inner-city black kids and I'm hosting it with my my buddy Mike yard he's a really funny comic black dude and we went to meet with the guys for this charity and they were telling us that uh you know we're they have an auction like I did any charity event right an auctioneer comes out and they all try to auction off and raise a lot of money from Richmond to help the program that's a very basically 99.9% of every charity event I've ever been involved this has an auction segment and in the dinner right they were like we're gonna have that but we can't use word auction I said what what do you mean you can't use the word auction don't like it's a sensitive word for you know the community I was like and then yard goes are you talking about slave like it was a god wait no and I was like wait we can't say the word auction I'm like but aren't you hiring a guy from Sotheby's yeah his cards gonna say auctioneer honest oh my we're just gonna pretend that's not what he's called and they were just like we just don't feel comfortable with that word in the room and I was just going I can't I said guys I gotta tell you like you're making me want to vote for Trump that's that's a that's how dumb I think this is I'm like all agree to it because I want to help these kids but this is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard Wow I couldn't believe I was like can I say cotton am I allowed to say come on like what other words can I say that's a dumbest thing I ever heard you're gonna get triggers in yeah auctions we're gonna make a joke like we're not gonna joke around about like auction off a black person although yard and I probably would have but first of all like when you say auction you automatically think of that boys I got a voice I'm gonna want my head when I do you think they did that with when they were doing that with slaves I do not think they talked like that I don't know what their technique was but I do know when I think of the word auction yeah I'm not like oh don't say that it's a don't say that a word don't say the a word it's like it's a it's a it's a new league it's absolutely accepted it's a different thing now yeah that's like the word gay mm-hmm it used to be Flintstones gay have a gay time having a gay time was like we're out having a gay old time yeah and then it became gay and then you had to stop saying it that way but yeah just go back to gay happy like Flint no you can't but again for me growing up was the thing we just said about everything almost everything didn't matter like the only thing you couldn't you you wait no it was terrible what done did gay go bad I don't know that's a good question it went bad after the f-word went bad did it yeah f-14 was it connecting the two of them fucking gay and like wow no no not fucking I meant the other word for gay people that they have in your by the same factor no I'm not afraid to but I'm just kind of being sarcastic like the other white meat yeah exactly but like it that was the and not that long was it was this idea of like if something was stupid it was gay like it well it didn't mean homosexual it meant like knob dude don't be so gay but but then you start thinking about oh I guess it does I guess it's offensive because you're saying like that stupid shirt you're wearing is gay of course it's that way but isn't it weird that gay took a turn for the worst I don't yeah wouldn't you've loved to been at the intersection when gay went bad yeah like fro will have a KO time that's gay yeah woah yeah what are you saying like an intersection a new one over ran it yeah the mean one beat the happy gay it did gate took that they took the word gay and turned it into either a negative like though that's gay or homosexuality how is it not connected to homosexuality before I don't know I don't know if the connection came from the fact that like they're like oh those guys are gay like they were like being like because they were being like really you know like really happy they were like slight boiling well that guy's gay he's really gay look how gay is with that shiny shirt on you know hey that Liberace sure is gay and then maybe someone was like I'll show you gay people hey we gotta stop you know we should stop come up with a new word gays a different thing yeah because I asked the guy to get gay with me and it got really really uncomfortable there had to be like a time in between where it was real confusing right where they didn't hadn't fully establish what it meant yet more people were like hey man are you gay yes I am gay I'm having a gay old time guys like good and guy tackles him in the bushes yeah like like the word hookup changed yeah like right around like when I was in high school but like my dad like yeah you're gonna hook up with your friends tonight you know meet up with your friends I'm like that's not what it means you know and then like all my buddies would be in the room like yeah you guys gonna hook up tonight with that and like those dudes it never was a dude your dad's gay don't be so good yeah that's hilarious so funny yeah a lot of language shifts occur but I just feel like right now if there's more policing of it and there's more people act I don't know there's a sec there's a lot like the word pussy yeah was is one of those where I you can't say pussy anymore no people get offended by it look because the wrong people well getting offended by the words but unless you're overusing it no no I'm saying again what I say or don't say is what I say or dogs say it I take my licks if I have to but people get offended by it you know like that's a word now that like if you're you know if you're in like a hardcore leftist community yeah they wouldn't say pussy but you'll still say dick thanks guys being a dick it's like well that's offensive those communities need a hug yeah yes dude I feel like they don't need a hug actually I feel like they need like I have too many hugs you know I think there's just too much I think it really it goes back to our lives are easy now so we have a lot of free time to come up with bullshit yeah we do it's like if we had to actually we didn't have electricity or we'd have like all this ease we wouldn't be you know harping on this stuff it's just like you have a lot of downtime a lot of downtime so you like I'll start a blog I think I'll start blogging about words you shouldn't say we have so much surplus that one of our biggest problems is that we eat too much food and we get too big yep that's like one of the number one health problems that humans have like this is how much surplus we have yeah even though I know people have it hard and there's people that are starving all over the world I'm aware but just in an in general especially in America well what is like one of our number one problems is people just eat too much and when we've the wrong shit about people starving in America and you think about how much food is wasted and thrown out like it's more Danes doing a documentary on it there's no there's no yes it's such a strange concept that there's like no internal desire you know it's like why I get annoyed at the Christian Right you know the low is like abortions are you're killing babies what we need to do is have those babies and support young mothers who support young single moms I'm like when's the last time you fucking volunteer to support a young single mom who had a baby Christian dude posted on Twitter was the last time you give a a Saturday of your day to take that kid to the zoo bullshit you say it but they don't fucking do anything about it you know it's a nice little box to put yourself in for some people they think they're a good person because they're a Christian but how much how much do you really ask but you're taking your day to stand outside Planned Parenthood was a sign why not take the day to go help that kid who didn't get aborted and his mom can't feed them I don't go why not stop by there instead of holding a sign about the devil yeah if I could clinic for women it's it's weird it is weird yes it's it's a weird thing that you can do it do right I mean that's one of the weird things about people is that we know that if we don't do anything and we take care of ourselves a baby's coming and like if you get the first countdown like countdown like it's almost like we agree that there's like levels to the countdown like in the first couple of days no one gives a shit pull the plug pulled apart yeah and then everyone's looking in everybody like you feel okay everything what happened what happened yeah it's not that big of a deal it's like would we how many cells was it it was only four cells at the time okay four cells is not a lot of cells and you start thinking I don't think it really ever can be four cells what you get my play a tiny little thing mm-hmm and then when does it become Wendy's side to side that's a person I get I get by the way it looks like one I don't listen I get the argument and you know I I do think that I have my own personal philosophy on how I would handle a situation but I don't if you were a woman no no I'm saying if I was in a relationship with a woman and she got pregnant you want to have the kid or did want to have a kid and I did you know at the end of the day we'd have a conversation together and if she was dead set on doing it then we're gonna do it you know because that but my point being I do believe that like it's a weird thing to just tell other people what they're supposed to do or not I do I feel that way about gay marriage I feel that way about everything it's like it's it's a strange thing to be able to dictate to someone else how they're supposed to live agree because there's too many people doing that man like we got no right doing it through the Christian Right and we got the left doing it through you know all their all their movements and it's like I think the reason most people are so annoyed in the country isn't like even political it's like they're just sick of people telling them how to live you know it's like I get it I can't say that oh you want me to not have a gun you hate does it yeah it's like it's like everyone just fucking just stop for it's like we do you like a just like a national timeout for five minutes think we're just learning how to use this thing man we're learning how to integrate society into this kind of communication that we share right now is just why you're still figuring it out I did I talked about that with somebody the other day I was actually just doing a set on stage and I was riffing a little bit about how you know we talked about the Second Amendment a lot and the founding fathers didn't know we were gonna have assault rifles they didn't have the foresight to see that so then we have to rethink what that means and it's like well they didn't know we were gonna have Twitter right so like maybe we have to rethink with the First Amendment it's didn't know every fucking moron was gonna have the ability to say stuff out like just at a national level the internet I mean imagine how easy it was to govern people before the internet came around yeah what's been so much easy it just lie to them yeah light of them to have almost no access to the truth yeah we get what Walter Cronkite tells you bitch yes all you get what you get it's like it's like it's like the entertainment industry it used to be like you want to hear a song Merv Griffin and Dick Clark will let you know what songs you can hear you know you were on the side of the people that are anti-abortion there's one side of you that has to logically interpret that if these people really did feel like babies were being murdered like it was their perspective that babies were being murdered if you completely ignore that perspective and just try to say it's a woman's health issue yeah like I get I almost get where their mind is at I don't think that they should be interfering in anybody's life especially when something is legal and yeah and they fundamentally believe that's what's happening and you could see how don't you thought babies were being killed up the street right we can't allow this to happen what I'm saying it'll tell you that they are babies yeah and the problem with that argument is it's it holds some water sure like you really have to mean is if you're gonna be a rational person and I'm 100% pro-choice but as a rational person you have to look at what it actually is if you don't then we're playing game the game is you want your side to be correct but the reality is this is a very complicated weird thing yeah there's like a life in your body and for sure guys shouldn't be able to tell a girl what you can do totally agree with that can't you can't tell a woman she has to keep it people have already aborted babies there's a precedent for you can't tell them what they can do all you can do is support their decision can weigh in I think if we were their dad you can weigh in and what you want but at the end of the day she's gonna decide what she wants to do and you just got to agree with it yeah and that's the move I think you know it's just it's a very complicated thing like a life form that will eventually become a person is inside your body what do you do like you imagine we had to make that decision yeah we're lucky that chicks do it because we don't think correctly for that for that proposition no ability to weigh those assets but I do think that the that you know the when I think about that I agree with you and I and I think most issues in the country are like that and that's the whole problem there's no rationality on either side right there's no it's like no rational center-right like for example people will you know look there's a lot going on with Trump and Russia and all that stuff wait what have you heard and then then people will post some thing yeah well about Obama scandals and then someone on the left to Billy he had no scandals and then someone to list like five skandhas ago yeah those were scandals like you can't just pretend that like that Fast and the Furious thing was good if you really like muscle cars no but you know that book Obama thing where he like oh that yeah where you gave all the guns oh that's right he lost all those guns and there were some of them were used to kill people yeah it was like I don't know like you missed that what was the logic behind that they were gonna trace them it's like a iran-contra hunt did you see that movie damn or was it a thing where they were trying to give them guns that they could trace they could trace and then they instantly couldn't trace it I think that was the I think that was the gist of it kyouma and that was just really a gun I mean this is some people do think it was like just an illegal arms sale that happened right under our nose yeah that's really what it is I mean did you watch that I just watched it the other night that Tom Cruise movie American made no I did not but I know what it's about it's it's I know this first good Tom Cruise movie he's had out I think in a couple years like you know yeah because he's that kind of a dark characters not like a hero he said I know bear the berry season story it's what this right so it's it's he's you know I'd say he's a like a pilot who basically like you know the CIA was like hey you're a really good pilot and we need a guy to like bring some guns to the it's all the precursor the iran-contra you thing which as a kid I remember hearing all about but then understanding it in a better level which was us trying to arm rebels which we've didn't do and for we are bin Laden against the Russians we've been arming rebels for a long time yeah that's our move right yeah big time and that gang yeah and then so he became the dude the CIA asked to do that and he was like you got to pay me more money and the guy was like you'll figure it out and then all of a sudden it became he was land to bring the guns the Jews were like hey we want you to bring a Escobar and his crew were like Pablo Escobar were like hey as long as you're bringing us guns we also want you on your flight home to bring a 1500 pounds of cocaine that he was like I'm not going to do that no thanks that they're like mm you know 2,000 bucks a kilo and he was like an 20 kilo is it 1,500 passed it became like oh and he became like this insane to wait smuggler smuggling guns in and drugs out guns and drugs it's a really interesting story what do you think happens today do you think that stuff like that is still going on today or do you think that this when it happened like they figured out that it was a bunch of cowboys like CIA operatives that were just trying to make some money on the side or do you think it's like a systemic I think that it's like I think that it's human error I think that like people that's why I'm not like a big conspiracy theorist because it's like I don't think the government's organized enough right it's always weird to me when people who think the government sucks who want small government they want the government we don't the government mishandles everything they don't know how to do this they don't know how to do this they can't magic magic you know manage traffic lights whatever they think the government can't do they can't do health care there it's private sector and then they're like but there's a giant government conspiracy where all the government knows this thing and I'm like if they can't fucking manage traffic lights how are they pulling off like a fake moon landing or whatever it's like well when you that kind of stuff to me it's like you're you're perpetuating two very different views of an extremely competent clandestine group of people who can achieve these like dark shadowy things without anyone knowing or bumbling morons but they're the same people they're government workers so I don't know I think some CIA like like the story behind going into Iraq is interesting like a CIA operative had a theory about what we're have been I mean no Simon fuck another dude Saddam Saddam Hussein had had weapons of mass destruction he had a theory and he was a analyst at the CIA and he wrote up this whole document and they read it they were like yeah this is bullshit like we have no proof of any of this thank you and he was so mad they did that that he published it on the Internet just leaked it to the Internet and then that story got on the internet and then a dude in Australia who was a spy no what were like a guy from Australia and and another guy from Afghanistan or Iraq read it on the internet came to America and said I have all the secrets of what he's doing and he just used that guy's document that he read online and told the CIA and then the guy came in and goes he has weapons here weapons here weapons here and then that analyst goes holy shit I was right meanwhile he's quoting him his own report so then he goes back to Cheney and he goes we've got this dude talking to the Germans saying all the things I fear eyes and then that's the guy curveball we listen oh dude named curveball so like that's how the whole fucking thing went down and basically some dude tricked us he actually didn't know anything but it was too late we like went off the information that a dude read off the internet from a guy who is mad they want to take his info which was wrong which is why there were no what fit semester so crazy it's just a crazy so yeah I think that shit happens all the time but I don't think it's I just think they're sloppy government employees well I think you're dealing with a bunch of different things some of them are sloppy government employees some of them are not some of them are brilliant I mean there's that too like Robert Muller there's it yeah there's a ton of them there's a ton of them that are brilliant but you're also gonna have cowboys and this is what I think when you find out about these like the CIA drug deals gone bad where did you see that one where the plane crashed in Mexico they wouldn't let him refuel they wouldn't let him land refuel because they kind of knew maybe that they were smuggling drugs and they made him crash and the plane wound up crashing and it had how many tons of cocaine did it have in it and people like this is proof the CIA sells cocaine like no it's proof those guys flying that plane had cocaine right the real question is did they just get to loosey-goosey traveling back and forth to South America a little too tight with some people that had a little bit too much money and they realized we could can do this so we could do this and no one would suspect it well that's the thing though so what the CIA 5.5 tons of cocaine Christ 5.5 tonnes wow isn't that 11 pound how many how many thousand pounds eleven thousand yeah two thousand times five and a half so what it is yeah and eleven thousand pounds a fucking cocaine dude that's insane but show the pictures of the crash because it's crazy this just wasn't some coke man I want to see like two thousand five six six but so but that Barry seals story was he's just a pilot yeah a CIA operative who's trying to make connections with then do his mission which is given to him which is arm these rebels so five guys in the CIA I have to try to figure out how to arm rebels so he approaches his pilot that he yours is a good pilot who flies for TWA yeah and he goes hey man you're now in the CIA but he's not really in the CIA he's not part of this he's just a pilot that this guy subcontracts right and then he doesn't tell the bosses how he's getting the guns in so it's he just made up a little thing he has his his own budget to do his own little thing and he finds his dude so it's not like Barry seal was like the CIA guy flying cocaine he was just a pilot that the CIA told and only one guy from the CIA told it to him and then it's crazy story you know and then he's doing it and then he starts making his little side business and this guy looks the other way because he just wants Barry delivering the guns and then after a while like as it starts to fall apart this he a is looks like burn everything with Barry seals name on it like we've never had we've never had connection to Barry's you learn our entire life and that's that's all the coke that they got off that plane looks like what size was luggage for an army like an army troop and like boys this is your gear and it's all rolled up in these giant bags isn't it so funny though that like that is crazy people still think a walls gonna work it's like like everybody director coming in on an airplane well just the fact that the airplane was a CIA airplane do they have in the movie did they have the reason why they the whole scheme got busted in the first place do you know the story yeah I mean I don't know if that's like a spoiler for listeners but I'll tell you well the real story about the kids that were murdered the kids that were murdered where that wasn't in the movie I don't think so well the one of the ways this whole thing came apart was two kids were apparently in the woods when they made a drop and these kids saw a drop yeah and they were murdered and they were stabbed and then they lead left their bodies on the train tracks and their bodies were run over by train tracks and then the parents got an autopsy and the autopsy showed that at least one of the kids had been stabbed Wow and so this is a sad thing yeah they realized something had happened was in New Orleans where the kids got killed no it was Mena Arkansas okay well that's the mean apart yeah yeah that's where the drop was the drop was apparently in mean Arkansas so they killed these kids and then this whole thing happened and the whole thing fell apart and then people started looking we'll do it and Barry seals was murdered actually as he was heading to court to testify well yeah he is amazing thriller like a Tom Clancy no that's it's a really good hit and it's done well the movies done well and but they don't mention the murdered kids they skip like me no Arkansas is the place where the CIA moves him and then I hope I'm not remembering this wrong but I think that was the reason why they got busted I could be I'm saying in the movie that's not mentioned so that's like you know that's the creative license of making a movie they're like oh man I hate when they do that yeah I hate when they do that when it's a real-life situation like there's a did you ever see that wrestling movie with Steve Carell the fuck was that called the wrestler no no with Steve Carell and Steve Carell what he's that DuPont guy John du Pont oh fuck what's the name of that movie - got your classic never would have gotten this yeah that they did that in that movie where they cut out key details yeah well they changed a big part of the ending where Mark Schultz like this it's a UFC fight a famous UFC fight where Mark Schultz who was just top of the food chain wrestler fought this guy Big Daddy Goodrich who's a really well-known MMA guy just totally dominated him mm-hmm and in the movie he's fighting some white guy did you see some made-up guy they just changed it it's just changed they maybe not get the rights to the name it doesn't matter then don't have that that you take it I what the fuck the history of this was now if you lied to me about something so insignificant as who the guy was that he fought in the UFC what else are you lying about agreed a bit it's just so stupid to do it's a real story did you ever see that movie with Marky Mark in the rock I'm being serious I should I call a Makemake I think it's Marky Mark Wahlberg in the rock and it's like it's a true based on a true story now it came out like two three years ago it's really good and in the middle of the movies one of the coolest things I've ever seen done in that true story movie they're like doing this absurd thing or like jumping off a rooftop together and it just pauses and then text comes up and says this all happened this is still a true story like it like reminds you in the middle of the movie pain and gain as those cut pain and gain yet husband say like a fun move on and dump or something and it was something like that is this the part the trailer the trailer do this a fun movie it's a great it's a great movie yeah my favorite movies that he did yeah it's a fun ass movie yep the rocks good man I like the rock I love the rock yes so like in the middle in the middle of the movie they say pause it and they go this is still a true story like this happened which is gold is it like because it gets almost inconceivable after a while I think the rock is gonna be our president I think the rock should be our president I think you can pull it off and I'm not joking I'm not joking either man I would feel like we're in a serious political discussion I'm good hands we're rock my patience for real politics has waned look we're we're on our way there you've seen idiocracy alright we're on our way dude I still haven't fucking seen that oh wow you will love that movie I know I would I guy I got salty because when I had a bit that was the same premise of that it's about dumb people out fucking all the smart people really one day we wake up and all the powers off and you know no one knows how to turn it back on that would that would annoy me too if you let your bitch obey because it's not my bit they stole yeah it's an obvious concept if you think the people are out if you think that people are getting dumber and the dumb people are having more kids it's just it's inevitable yeah and they are yeah that's very true and I traced it back to the pyramid like the whole the whole thing was like that the smart people just died and then the one they dumb people showed up at the pyramid and then they just moved in like fat dudes look good yeah the idiot workers they all stumbled in there we built this generation to go with the best that's so funny that's still to me if I had one time in like if you could go back in a time machine and go to one place in history and see something I think it would have to be Egypt while they were building the pyramids hmm I would just love to see what that culture was like it's so hard to tell I mean you look at all the stone and everything right even if you were standing there other man I've never been to Egypt but I've been to Chichen Itza it's kind of the same feeling you get where you like what was it like like when when this place was popping yeah like what did this feel like what was this these people have built these crazy structures like what was a normal day for them you know it's funny I had that I didn't realize it I've watched the documentary about the pyramids and not the not the one what's the aliens in which one Nazis an ant with that one on like with the guy with the crazy hair yeah yeah it's like ancient astronaut theorists surmise that's not really a he's fairly reasonable when you talk to him giorgio is just a lover of all possibilities UFO that's an hour's worth of a show they've done like season 11 you know it's not the first one with like the Nazca lines it's pretty interesting but now they're like Eastern in ancient astronaut theorists some eyes that palm trees were brought here but and you're like artists stop like listen man you finished it if ghosts shows are still on the air let them be on the air cuz at least they're showing cool old buildings and shitting stone structures everything it be possible they haven't found one ago yeah that one ghost man at least we have some cool rocks to look at where you look at like you know what are those giant stones in is it Peru Stonehenge no no no I'm still in England England yeah there's some there's some crazy structures somewhere South America that Giorgio was talking to us about and it was one of the reasons why some people speculate that it's possible that some of the things that are constructed that we really don't have any idea how ancient primitive man did were actually constructed by someone from another another plan yeah which I don't think is any less reasonable than people thinking God sent like pointed his finger who was a giraffe you're right about that you're right about that like like half the world believes that you're right about that but it's more reasonable to think that it was done by people because we know people are a real thing and we know people have built a lot of shit yeah so the yeah this is it this is the exact structure these fucking stones they're they're not just cut and placed perfectly but they're in fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and somehow or another they carved and move these enormous stones and if you stand right next to them like there's some photos of people standing next to them stand right next to apparently they're just tower over people so these were all done you know who knows how many thousands of years ago but it isn't there like a reasonable thing to think that like maybe they had technology that is lost a time yeah that's a reasonable thing to think right or other words like if our civilization crumbles and in two thousand years people dig it up yeah and they find the Empire State Building but like how'd they do it they're not gonna find like a backhoe look at this picture look at these fucking stones amazing go back to the other one with the person in the front of it so you can see the perspective look how big shit so I did not think it was that big they're so big dude it looked like a staircase and this was one of the Georgio's things he was saying like we don't have the technology to do this right now mm-hmm like if you wanted to get someone to go out there and move those giant stones and cut them and place them I mean we kind of have the technology but holy shit would it take a lot of money would it take giant fucking cranes it would take forever look at what they did they did this whole structure and all these things you got to get the guys to show up think about how organs they like at your kitchen done you know because I I need two more weeks you know my stone guy's out of town how long would it take to build something that fucking crazy I don't know and so the idea was that aliens came here built some things fucked with our DNA and got ghost see ya fuck - fuck Summerlee man yeah early man a couple of poked hopes exactly and then decide coyote no I didn't finish that story no so the brooding chicken that was in that cage mom she honeydicked my Mastiff into smashing open the cage because the Mastiff just smashed the cage like she was trying to get out the cage like she's like like where the chicken was the coyote was for the coyote list and my Mastiffs like I got this and just smashed the fucking thing tore it open and then and then she was running out the backyard with the chicken in her mouth and hopped the fence and I saw her hopped the fence with the chicken in her mouth I'm like I'm living in the goddamn Disney movie you are look at this yeah I just watched a coyote snatch a chicken from the from your yard yeah that's badass who's wild yeah but the crazy thing is my fucking dog standing over there I was like asshole the fuck did you do chickens I meant animals or animals you know you can't really expect much more from a dog he's like I don't know if they'd wanted a chicken so he's trying to help these built these stones what part of the world is it Jamie so people who look at it it's in Peru Peru and what's the name of the structures it's like something tie you hmm god I wish I remember in that Kuzco district Cusco and it's got some cool stuff is that that's not what we were just looking at earlier though is it that's the hole over structure that's what it looks like from the top yeah that's what I googled another hole that's a fortress - holy shit that does look like aliens built it well or super sophisticated man that was wiped out in a disaster that's more likely yeah but the crazy thing is how quickly then if that's the case how quickly then we came from some sort of ape-man to what we are now you know it hasn't been that long the amount how long ago is they think this was built this shit was built like at least a thousand years ago I think right so I don't think they know though see the problem is if you don't you have to get stuff from like something that someone ate or it has to be like a carbon-based thing you can't test the stone you can test some of the material in the stone or you know like scratches on the stone like in crevices and shit like that you can get stuff but when they run around you know that would have been several thousand years of man advancing at that point a thousand years ago right wonder I mean I don't know when it's hard to say cuz I don't know when it was actually built when do they think it was built so these all these theories and then there's these really fringe theories that push everything way way way back and that stuff gets resisted a lot because the carbon dating though right in some in some case occupied since 900 900 occupied since 900 that means nine hundred somebody moved in yeah and then just had to until the about the 13th century that's a long run so who built it though do they know when do they guess I think because I think it doesn't say like what year was built or you said occupied from 900 yes does that mean that that's when they first moved in indicate the earliest occupation on that hilltop dates to about 900 CE okay so wow they built it over 400 years or so it sounds like so more than a thousand years hmm yeah but like you know the jewels in years is hard to wrap your head of the Jewish calendar goes back to like fifty seven hundred years ago no no so nuts right so banned his but man had a lot of time to get some sweet tech but 900 yeah it's so arbitrary that we start at zero then start up again you go backwards and you go into negative number so it was so stupid it's so dumb yeah it's we Christians it's weird how we do that yeah yeah I mean even with like temperature yeah it's not being on the metric system so stupid like you go to places Neal Celsius what's it's always 2030 Celsius outside here what the fuck is 23:00 Celsius but if you learned anything though I agree I'm like so we should we're all gonna die so we're all gonna die we winter Hatter shorts I have no idea but they a lot of them no are stupid shit because this is interesting there's more sort of a we're like that's like a real American move like they tried to switch over in the 70s to the metrics and people like fuck you ain't learning French man did I remember it I remember it being taught in school I was in school they tried they tried soccer - yeah just picking up now just maybe a little heat now yeah a little bit a little bit a little bit but yeah it's funny to me that stuff like that's kind of what I love about America it's like that just like that but yeah we're not gonna do the non interest the rest of the world yeah we don't give a shit it sounds French it sounds gay sounds like a gay symmetry is the matricis a music gay math okay we're Americans it's better though I mean it's intense why are we doing 12 so it's better and and but it is it confusing when somebody tells you a metric you know they say like oh it's a leader like liters of gas I'm always or if you drive in Europe right and you're looking at the you know speedometer it has the conversion on there for you but whenever we you'd say like 12 inches is a foot like why 12 fuck is that what is that why did you why did you arbitrarily you know that's and it's only us in a few other countries that still accept that right what that 12 inches yeah how many people do that do they accept it in Canada Canada's metric right and then three feets a yard like thanks Canada's metric yeah it is I think yeah but most places are metric yeah I have a friend from Australia my friend Adam Greentree and he talks in meters there's about hunting 20 meters what that means now is that that'd be like how many football fields yeah there's only two distances I understand school bus length and football field why things have been taught to me how many meters are in a real unit of measurement like a real one like an American one how many feet we're in that fucking meter fucking goofy-ass meter yeah it's a yard I want to know what a yacht a yacht 30 yards away mm-hmm yeah that's it you know when you're in school the only way they teach you about the distance of things as stack school buses or football field you like the moon is 147 million football fields do you like that now I understand whatever the distance is but it's always it's always converted to football fields at school buses always right yeah as a student that's all I remember ever in science that would be like taking school buses and going from here to Australia you know and you're like it's like 97 million school buses you that's true of school buses like that's a constant unit of measurement in football fields it's all we got yeah yeah it's true it's like how far did she live like two football fields and three school buses we could get we can walk we could walk it's pretty cool no it's cold so how cold is it 24 Celsius Oh so 23 tells these supreme yulux is that like 70 degrees I have no idea I literally have no idea I know a little bit about kilos they're very little I know I'm embarrassing 75 23 is 75 okay yeah 2475 all right I'll remember that yeah and that remember that in that way if it gets to like 30 I'll go hey it must be hottest because zero Celsius is 32 mm right because their zero is freezing zero is our that's freezing yes but our 40 below is the same as their 40 below doing another math trick it's tough okay 9/5 Celsius plus 32 9/5 Celsius plus 32 and fuck you it's almost a half just it's a little bit under ass fuck somebody one of you fuck one of you somebody we need to figure out who's who's got a simpler thing than who's get a simpler think 9/5 get the fuck out of here with your with your ferret mentally we need which over two Celsius but zero Celsius is freezing and 32 fahrenheit is amazing yeah but it's not just offset by 32 something something happens around 40 below zero they become the same I don't know if it maintains for very long or if degrees get colder and I don't know yeah I don't know it's just zero makes more sense as the yeah it's weird like how the fuck is if our 32 is the Celsius zero how the fuck is is the same thing at 40 below it doesn't even make sense make sense how are you not just adding he said my friend gave me this tip double the centigrade temperature subtract the first digit of the result and the result and then add 32 to that okay sure all right you really yeah so 23 okay so 46 and then what we do with the first digit of the result there it is right there so 23 Celsius equals 74 Fahrenheit 23 C plus C times 2 is 46 minus the first digit so minus the 4 46 minus 4 is 42 42 plus 32 is 74 hey fuck you that's the easy one well what's amazing to me is like when you meet someone that lets you know like what you just talked to them about math and they can do like math problems in their head and you realize or oh I am a baby math baby oh yeah I'm a math baby all right totally there's people that were like looking at that going yeah that's what you do that's it it's obvious I'll try clearly there's my head 74 degrees I'll have moments were like I had this recently I was just laying in bed you know in an insomniac state like I offered him in and I was going how do you do long division and I was like I haven't done long division and I and I I tried doing that problem and I got it wrong and then I had to read I was like oh yeah you know like it was like yeah it it was it was confusing and I haven't done it in where's the last time you put out a pen and paper to do a long division dude I barely do the add the tip part thing right yeah just not down you just double it and move the desk of my adding sucks I put that on my Instagram recently it was a question to get on into MIT in 1869 whoa so it's really just the order of operations if you can figure this out let e equals 8 in the following equation and there's a bunch of stuff what is the numerical value of the equation hint as a mentioned as mentioned earlier knowledge of the order of operations would be pretty important here scroll down to read the answer huh a lot of people did not get it right but most people kind of got it right what is it the answer is 15 to this are you well versed in these kind of equations I remembered how to do it pretty quickly that's like I showed it to me like I don't remember how to do any of that interesting check mark I'm square root Oh fairly positive I never learned that fairly positive but that's a good example yeah like I'm completely illiterate when it comes to that and yet cube root no one know what that was either a cube root Oh second exponent Jesus Christ yeah I could I literally I there's just nothing I could do with that well that's what's so fast society and that's why you know if anybody tells and it's not all good but that's one of the things that's fascinating by society is that there's so many different people with so many different abilities and there are people that gravitate towards that and our wizards at mathematics and there's other people like you and I they're good at talk and shit yeah yeah that guy thank God we live in a world where that can happen oh god no I often think about how useless I'll be like if the apocalypse goes down you're gonna be like the dude you want to hang out with but the apocalypse goes down I'm done dude if the apocalypse goes down whatever happens you want it to happen in your neighborhood so it's over okay look of meteor hits you wanted to hit your house but you're insane quake I post upon the glass society say we both survived it and we're living in a like a shanty town we're gonna you have skills you can hunt you can do shit I like to do something yes I can teach you the things that I know how pretty quick I would bring no value did you first you figure it out after a couple of weeks I can fix things I know how to fix things but I'm having punt it's nice with a bone area you would figure it out do you never you've ever use not anymore rifle but I would it's a it's a better way to get me it's more accurate you can do it from further away he's you know if it doesn't require nearly as much discipline still requires a lot of discipline but not nearly as much as a bone marrow donor is just cooler it's harder it's way more difficult but then there's other people that use a traditional bow and they think that guys like me are pussies cuz I use a compound bow you mean like legolas bow like just one like Robin Hood just like that so just a lot of them use recurves but some don't even use recruit I'm go to old school stick bow really yeah these people that like want to make things tougher on themselves they want a bigger and bigger challenge and you know it gets into the stories like what like some people said like you should only hunt with a rifle because it's probably the most deadly thing that you could use in that situation like so you shouldn't use a bow and arrow because you're not you're not using a bow and arrow because it's more effective you're just using it so it's more of a challenge to use it's like oats of a bastardization of the original idea of what hunting is right now some people feel like that but then other people are like no no it's just a different kind of hunting if you do it correctly this you have pretty much you have less likelihood of success but if you do it correctly you've just as much of a likelihood of killing the animal so it's not like it's an unethical thing if it's done correctly just requires way more work yeah and and and like you said more skill yeah but if you were in an apocalyptic scenario where we had to go out and get food and you and I went out I could teach you what you need to know pretty quick yeah that's stupid no you know the hard part would be learning how to be accurate with a bow that would be the hardest I want to learn that I was actually gonna text C one day and go what's a good starter bow I got to learn how to shoot a real good means a bunch of good companies I use a Hoyt but there's a bunch of great ones like Matthews makes great bows there's a bunch of companies that make a recurve bows those which are fun to practice like Duncan has a recurve he does yeah he shoots it in his backyard he loves it that's cool it's just a fun thing to do man even if you never want to ever shoot an animal and you don't want to eat eggs they're just straight-up vegan like archery is a fun thing to do it's it's so like a weird kind of a meditation you know like something happens when you're at full draw and you're like holding on an arrow and then you release that arrow and it just sails right into the target it gives you this weird charge it's like you're you're doing like almost like a form of yoga with your mind and your body together because like everything is has to be perfectly still and then on the release if it goes in the right spot you get this big burst of satisfaction it's really interesting yeah there's something and you can't think about anything else other than the shot that you attempting to make yeah you have to keep your eyes on where you're trying to hit it's really there's a mind thing going on with archery that's fascinating I do think though shooting a gun is like that not probably not as intense or meditative but there's something like you know what people are like I don't know why anyone wants a gun I'm like I've ever shot one really I mean I don't own a gun I mean I live in New York City it's not really even an option for me but it's you know like I said you know yeah I've been on in it was when I was in Afghanistan with some of those dudes and they were like take us to the shooting range we were shooting all their different wet and again it was a war zone so I'm not getting into my ethical you know I'm not a huge fan of ar-15s for 18 year old but I get why people want guns I get why people want to own guns you know I think that's like the argument that countries like I wish people would just like take a beat and go i under it like you just said about the abortion thing I understand you feel how it's like it's like that's okay so you feel that way and then it's that way it becomes less of a conversation but we've got to get rid of guns more of a conversation about like all right we just have to tidy maybe just tidy up a couple components of it you know that kind F initely have to figure out how to stop people from buying them legally when they're crazy well there's something wrong with them right you know I mean here's a question how many of these mass shootings were actually done by someone who was in the NRA well according to the people on the right none is that true that's what I don't know I mean that's like that's that's out there I know on Twitter yes well that's why I wanted to ask you if you knew that could be a Russian bot for probably right should spread that fake news baby yeah hashtag fake news um but yeah that's uh see if that's real does that make sense to you yeah I mean it's an interesting question well if that is and then it gets weird like why is everybody attacking the NRA well I know the very good wine once you're making it easier to access these guys they're the ones right a cock blocking any legislation getting done because they have paying so much money to these congressmen and Senators you know I mean did you saw that Lieutenant Governor Delta said they don't want to first of all I got to be honest with you man like I had no idea you got like your flights are cheaper because you want a gun I was like what the fuck dude like I'm just getting ripped off on Delta cuz I don't know what a gun it was just counts you know it was just such a weird thing to find out and now that Delta pulled that I did I was like wait but I like my passive mentality it cost more money you know is so the thought is that the NRA has made it more easy for crazy people to access these guns and so we that's what it is it's like hot away from them yeah the idea that like we can't raise the age to 21 well if you can go to war at 18 why can't you I don't maybe reasons I don't know I mean it's it seems like when you go to war you're getting trained by the military right versus when you've just 18 and you walk into a gun store and walk out with an ar-15 nobody taught you how to use it literally just bought a gun it's a strange like I just thought on it has always been like why not like if you have a driver's license for a car but then I like if gift up to drive a bus or like a truck you have to get a different class of driver's license if they get like a Class D or a Class C whatever the next level is there's different classes of driver's license like you can't just go buy a big rig and start driving around the country you got to get a license for driving a big rig which means you have to go to school learn how to drive one learn how to park one all the things that it fuck it takes and you have to prove it to an expert yeah you have to talk about this yesterday so why not just have it be that simple which is you want know one handgun now just get you get the class a handgun license and you take your road test which is like know how to load it know how to clean it whatever the rules become and then it takes what four hours to pass the test is like 10 Brittain questions and and then that's it then you get the license you get the gun and it's yours and then next next class yeah I'd like to own a shotgun all right get a Class B shotgun license take the class they'd think fine and then you get to like the ar-15 level and they let go and now you have an instructor looking at the guy like this guy doesn't seem low you know it's got a little bit like of a dead eye here you know like if you we don't got that maybe like maybe we double check this guy or whatever you know like you can you can get a sense of people in in that environment or if it's a five question questioning thing you have to answer you know and it's like what like what are your hobbies and it's like eating rabbits alive you know you like that man that guy you think they hide those answers though I don't know a real crazy person a real psychologist can spot a fucking crazy person based on how they hide their answers do you think rut from the written word I think that you could devise I think you could devise a written test where some will be like this is an alarming answer to this right because it references his mother and it has nothing to do with this father or whatever ever fucking weird you know right so I looked at that sounds really unappealing to people and I get that they were met but that wouldn't be banning any guns that would be you can have anyone you want you just have to like do a very basic you know rudimentary seven question test and go to a firing range with a pro for two hours and has to make sure you know what you're doing the nra perspective is they don't want to give an inch yes if they give an inch they feel like the ultimate is they're just gonna lose ground they're gonna lose more ground yes more ground what's a slippery slope are yeah yeah it's it's it's interesting like that whenever anything happens like now more than ever I think people are demanding some sort of a change like there has to be some sort of a change all says seventy-five percent of the country wants some kind of change even Trump well you know to raise the age but it won't happen because the legislation won't pass it's one of those things where I did I seriously doubt and I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing but I seriously doubt if we didn't have guns and all of a sudden guns became a thing and we all had to vote as to whether or not everyone should be able to have guns I I don't think it would have passed I don't think it would pass no way but it's interesting though because it exists now and now you know most politicians are in favor of it because some are in favor of limiting it slightly they got a lot of money yeah a lot of money from the NRA but it's also like who and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to have guns but who wants us to have guns like you're just gonna be completely democratic like what percentage that people actually want everybody to have guns and what don't just out of pure curiosity with no judgment percentage want everyone to have guns I don't want people to be able to have guns and so what percentage thinks that no one should have guns like if you add like yeah Australia or something I think that all the guns I think it's a much smaller group of people that don't want anyone to have a gun like I don't think there's a damn it I think there's probably like fourteen percent of the country the things but no one should have a guy yeah I think the vast majority think we need some new sort of regulations and restrictions absolutely it's reasonable reasonable restriction I really don't think anyone is saying I mean I think that people is it's a right that's embedded in the DNA the country and whether you like it or not it's part of the DNA the country and like something that's very important state just stays that way forever well we I think that to me their arguments can be made about this which is you know I don't think people really understand how everyone how everyone lives I think there's so many different lifestyles in this country that like you know I think you have a perception of Aleksei like a suburban just outside of metropolis kind of a mom that doesn't realize that for some people in the country when they dial nine-one-one it's like a 50-minute response time you know like it's not like there's like a local firehouse and they could you know like people feel like I have to be able to protect my family because I can't necessarily rely on the police to come I mean I I think that's true it does happen yeah and I also think that like there's a component to people's fears of like you know society unfolding and whatever that's perpetuated by I actually believe that people from the dawn of time have always believed they're gonna be the last ones on earth you know I believe that that they're gonna live through the apocalypse because I really think it's all about FOMO you know fear of missing out and it's this feeling of like once I die everyone else should die so like cool shit doesn't keep happening once I'm dead you know protects you I think I really do I think that people have this instinct of like I'm gonna die with everyone else it's like no you're gonna die and then we're gonna forget about you and then cool shits gonna keep Abaddon still there and it's like I remember when I left the Daily Show I felt that way I'm like yeah good luck assholes and then like the show kept going I was like oh they're fine my life has no purpose you know and it's it's that and it's that feeling of like you want you know you want the sea it's like what a football player whatever any athlete leaves a team they're like yeah I like good luck win it without me and then they win the Superbowl in the next year I'm like yeah you were the problem Jeremy Shockey you know I think that applies to the apocalypse though I think the apocalypse is people understanding and knowing in their head that they're fragile and that their very environment is fragile that we're lucky that it stays the way it is right now but the more we learn about super volcanos asteroid Olympics earthquakes tsunamis all the crazy shit that can happen to people the more we realize how fucking incredibly fragile we are so we're always worried about the big thing that happens because there could be a big thing that can happen if some super volcano blows and there's ash that covers the Sun or blocks out the Sun and we lose all our crops yeah it's like a new shortages yeah it's a hundred percent possible totally earthquakes fucking asteroid impacts all that shit's a hundred asteroid hitting the earth we're not here the earth it's just up to fucking what's floating around and if people have been alive if human beings have been what we are now for how many thousands of years what is like 10,000 maybe no more I think more than that I think I'm just thinking about mock human modern modern humans modern you wanna say like two hundred thousand years does that make sense it for modern humans yeah I think that's probably wrong though I think it's more I guess it depends on what we're calling modern like is that yeah that's a good question yeah what do we call modern like a society that has like in a Connecticut economy and right a trade system you know systems wray trade rose holes shelter right when it was it what do we got stone tools was two and a half million stone tools that's like yeah but that's I saw an orangutan at the zoo using a stick to try to get bugs then the next thing says modern man is two hundred thousand years ago yeah okay 200 thousand years ago they essentially look just like us like pretty close to us yeah I'd be I bet if you saw a woman for two hundred thousand years ago you can be like yeah she's hot you know you'd be like what the fuck you think so yeah I do I do yeah that's a long time ago yeah that's a long time ago are you swiping right what are you doing I was just looking up I was just piece of information yeah that's a crazy notion when you really think of 200,000 years 200,000 years ago we weren't even people we were some some other thing that became people like what are we gonna become yeah I just like like I like when you go back 200,000 years it feels like you're you know that's like pretty close to like caveman era caveman era I think like it which really could not like ape man but it's like mmm you know it's super primitive super primitive but that's modern Hume I guess I think that was that was revised recently that modern human was like when you have trade and rush you know Oh civilization yeah like that more you know versus the versus the actual like body being you know I think they used to think it was where Iraq is I think they thought that was the oldest aim you know at that area sumaré they think that that was the one of the first real civilizations they think that was the first that will at least the first evidence of written language and there's a lot of it there Sumerian Mesopotamia is in fact the first known complex civilization developing the first city-states in the 4th millennium BCE it was around these cities at the earliest known form of writing cuneiform script appeared around 3,000 BCE yeah I like how they go BCE now for the non-christians before current era like what is wait why is it current what's this what is that BCE you sneaky bitch yes so that's God it was even earlier than that I didn't think like 550 700 years ago where they like started keeping track of shit I had like you know so that's what they've language and that's writing about all those structures like the the pyramids and all those different things they think that there was advanced civilizations that died off and that that's why all those things were there well you know about like that the library in Alexandria yeah that's one of those things that probably loss of thousands of years yeah they've burned all the shit the Egyptians knew mm-hmm like thousands of years like we might not ever figure it out but I'm saying like just God know right what they has recovered yeah and how we could have stacked our science on top of that and right now be hmm who knows we could be living to like 250 years old for all we know like we don't know what they knew or how they built that shit like it's just like what a that's like a total religious move too much knowledge in here we're never gonna be able to convince these people of an invisible cloud man if they could read these books so burn this fucking picked out yeah people had been apparently going back and forth to Egypt forever yeah knowledge they would go there to learn shit yeah and it was it was like lush place yeah no that was a Patra it was closer clear its Cleopatra is closer to the birth of the iPhone than she is to the construction of the pyramids Wow so if you go from Cleopatra to today is a shorter time period then Cleopatra to the construction of the pyramids yeah that's crazy wrap your fucking head around that job that's crazy and if you listen to Graham Hancock and John Anthony West this guy was in Egyptology so just past they think that it goes back way further than that they think that the Pyramids of Giza might be from 2500 years ago but they think there's a lot of shit in Egypt giant things including the Sphinx there are thousands and thousands years older than that well did you see that they just invented this new air sonar yes that isn't what's covered that Guatemalan society in the fucking jungle that's my mind exploded crazy did you see that lost city of Z that movie I didn't I it's a movie I want to watch but then I like watch the trailer it was like Moshe kasher sent me the book and I almost read it but then I found there was a movie I'm like fuck you oh my god let's knock this out an hour and a half huh I'm sure it's not as good though because corsa was raving about the book oh by the way congratulations to motion and Latasha from making making people oh they detonate a person first but that city of Z movie was really interesting because these people were just the rawest of raw adventurers somebody get horrible mosquito bites and go into the jungle these crazy Englishmen and like that to me was what was interesting about that book to try to see I don't know I it was really well done so I assumed that their version of like what these English scholarly gentlemen were like when they were planning out these epic mega trips but when you're watching it take place like the way they did in the movie you really felt like that could have been how it went down mm-hm and this crazy fucking guy went just deep deep deep into the jungle looking for a lost civilization journals and things which most of those dudes did yeah you know it you have to take it I guess what they're writing with a grain of salt is you're like I want to make myself sound as badass as possible for sure but they definitely found some stuff for sure back they went they found pottery and they found a bunch of different things well the boughs that the guy Colonel Percy Fawcett is that his head Wow they think it might be his head oh dude go to that page please well we need to know about this shit strange stories dunt dunt uh yeah they probably killed that dude and cut his head off I mean that's what they were doing to people down there they probably got tired of this white dude stumbling around through the forest yeah head thing yeah shrink heads they cut your skull out this is the thing I used to think they shrunk the whole skull and everything I'm so stupid I already told you how dumb I am when it comes to eggs with shrunken heads I thought ha they got some fucking solution it makes the head shrink up no now they take the skull out and then they take the skin stitch it all up together and then they do something with it to make it like shrivel up like I put it I put a coconut or something in there I don't remember I don't remember how they make it I would never in a million years if you asked how a shrunken head would made and they stuff it I would have no I would even guess I think they stuff it too that said that's homeboys head yeah they they they chopped that dude up and did something to his head that is so crazy but what a what a dark way of approaching other human beings they have his eyeballs stitched up they have a rope coming out of his mouth that's like a just a carrying look strap yeah you know you can put it on your belts might be right they stitched his mouth up though right look at his mouth is stitched up yeah that looks like a limb yeah it's like they made a keychain you know that's what it looks like they got that little loop yeah they carried that dude around their dick yeah and just walk through the forest this was it was all for a novelty store in fact that was their version yeah forever 21 a little like Hudson news in town with a little knick knacks what a fucked up practice kind of people's heads off taking the skin off stitching it all up and shrinking it but yeah but again it's like we were talking about food it's like we had a lot of fucked up shit we did here too oh yeah you know smallpox on blankets that wasn't that's not really fucked up no no no way didn't even bet they didn't even know but what bacteria was back then oh no I'm like see you're out how to get no apparently it's an urban myth apparently that on non-urban yes it's a rule world it's a Wild West yeah apparently what happened was just the first European settlers just alone by their presence killed somewhere around 90 percent of the Native American outside diseased all kinds of crazy shit that people had no immune systems for and that this idea that they did it all with blankets wouldn't look that this is not to say that people didn't do horrible things to the Native Americans they absolutely did and it's not to not to in any way diminish the genocide that took place on the Native Americans but I don't think that the blanket thing was true because they didn't know how to isolate syphilis I mean unless they just went to peak patients that had syphilis or smallpox or smallpox whatever it was you're right now yeah that's what I thought his guilt Al Capone I thought they just knew yeah I got my stories mixed up just a good way to go out yes I think you're blind but yeah I just think um the the just exposure to Europeans killed the great many of them and there's a guy named Dan Flores that I had on my podcast that's an expert in the history of animals in North America I think I heard that pocket fucking to me yeah guys a genius he's a brilliant but he was talking about Buffalo and that when the Native Americans died off when like literally 90% of them were killed by European diseases it's a just crazy and a lot of them that were killed off by Europeans the Buffalo weren't hunted anymore so they grew to these mammoth proportions so it's his contention that those giant fields of Buffalo the people experience where there was like thousands and thousands and thousands of Buffalo stampeding across the field if that would have never taken place if the same amount of Native Americans had been there previously because they were in control they were the primary predator because all they did was follow these I mean that's why they have these teepees a lot of them would follow the herds of Buffalo and they'd peck on it from the outside it just nomadic yeah oh yeah and they just stayed with the Buffalo but they also kept their numbers down because you know if there's several hundred Native Americans or how many in their camp right there they're killing a couple Buffalo a day every day and everybody's eating it and then there's no refrigerator so they remove it again yeah keep following it so they're basically just eating Buffalo and shooting arrows at them and taking the populations down all the time that's so interesting it's crazy yeah I'd never heard it before he was on my friend Steve Rinella spot cast he explained it on there and then when L explained it to me also independently and then I had him on the podcast and I read his book too he's got two books to see if we could find the titles of Dan Flores his books yeah I mean it makes sense la needham actually is a paper populations expand exponentially right so it's like the baby Erica right is that it coyote America his new book is coyote America is about the history of the coyote in North America dude it's fascinating shit guys genius yeah he looks like he knows a lot about like he knows a lot of shit worth Western handles any look you look at the Morse code you get street cred with naturalist if you live in New Mexico you know that's a place for it where there's a lot of dudes that have gray ponytails yeah a lot of great da little new agey a little a little scary a little new in Santa Fe that's rotates from tape Fletcher's from there co-owner of caveman coffee simply delicious and really pumps you up well played thank you I've never had one man nitro how susceptible are you to caffeine 270 milligrams and that mother fall that's what versus how much in a cup of coffee a large Starbucks I think is like that much like a venti Starbucks yeah did we how many times we've gone over this and I can never remember the numbers I want to say that a venti Starbucks is like 250 or 240 and that's a 270 it's a touch mo touch more really need it see we're scared I'm drinking I thought you were kind of giving me the vibe of like look I don't have too many you know no no I'm done of them I just got a new shipment no that's not what I was giving the vibe I just always tell people cuz I I've given it to people and then like an hour into the show they're like dude I'm on crack I'll call you later be like I ran home I ran back to West Hollywood okay so a venti why was I wrong 415 milligrams so this is at all this is at all Wow did they jack up the caffeine is it always high come on was it really always this high I feel like you're looking up maybe the numbers have changed dude I thought the old number for like a cup of coffee for a diner was 40 is it an amazing like 40 milligrams I always think about like caffeine just a drug yeah so this is just these guys just deal a drug Oh delicious being feted but it's also addictive you know like once you're in you're in you can't not drink last person who would like to deny all of his addictions I can't follow with you on this I think it's a lovely couple you don't think that you could could you wake up and not have one why would I do that [Laughter] just show everybody like I can I was like what people always like pots not addictive I'm like have you tried not smoking it for a week I could any time the average caffeine content of a 8 ounce brewed cup of coffees 95 milligrams so yeah so Starbucks is way more yeah so an average not a lot more I would have guessed that was way high I thought I for some reason thought in my head like a cup of coffee from a diner you know when those reasonable small cups of coffee yeah I remember that being 40 but that makes sense because like a real cup of coffee it's probably double that size anyway like 90 but 464 so it's not as bad as a venting it's more like a tall 460 I feel like they jacked that caffeine up well people some people get super conditioned to it like Tate my friend Tate the owner of the company he could drink five of those fucking things just sit here and throw him back yeah he's also a gorilla he's a big giant dude that's a big factor that's a fat how much body weight yeah he's moving around a lot of tissue yeah probably to 40 I mean I have friends can drink like that but they're just big giant suits giant dude yeah well Justin I have a friend who's a legit giant he's like seven feet tall you do huge yeah and he can put down some makers and coke that will fuck you up yeah I can't try to keep you can't try to keep up yeah I have a couple friends like that they're like let's grab another one like dude I'm gonna die you go to the Darklands yeah I'll keep drinking but like let me you have a glass of water here you know dudes you just fucking booze yeah I grew up with a lot of guys like that Long Island where I grew up it's like a lot of like Irish dudes who just we would be in high school they would bring their own 12-pack to the party and drink 12 beers at a party like no big deal they look like a wine barrel yeah those guys those guys can put away booze they've built like a barrel from and they love beer they love beer it's not it's not you know like if you want to have a whiskey with them they're like yeah let's have a beer love beer just let them beer gives you both carbs and booze at the same time yeah it's like a double way love it the double whammy of satisfaction it's like heaven it's like having whiskey and pasta you know yeah it was like what it's like but if you have like beer and crab like crack and open some crab claws when ice cold the layer delicious a nice Sam Adams I like beer the can I'm not gonna lie more than I like it out of the bottle yeah I ran a beer Pabst Blue Ribbon and out of a can I feel like I'm getting back to my roots that I don't really have yeah yeah I just like the like or like Tecate is good out of a can like I like having like a because the can gets really cold yeah it's good it's good yeah Modelo they have them in cans yeah they might do they say Madeo or Modelo was there one L or two else growing up it was I think it's two else isn't so wouldn't that be modelo on oh it's one well there you go I just thought it medea would be too right there's a midday yeah oh yeah Oh sneaky bitches just capitalizing the other name is that what's happening dum dum dum Modelo oh they got cans yeah speciality cans there's a video or a YouTube commercial that I've watched the other day of this dude who's an astronaut and it's a Modelo commercial and it's he's a mexican-american and his dad in him are out there looking at the sky and they crack beers together and drink a beer together like that's really interesting I got I don't think I've ever seen a beer commercial with an astronaut before yeah and it's like I kind of feel like it's hard to pull that off unless it's a Mexican astronaut drinking a Mexican beer with his Mexican dad then you got to shut the fuck up because people get really mad it talks to shit about that commercial yeah here it is look at this dude this dude was an astronaut powerful look at that fucking backdrop holy shit that's amazing and so I love this tune that they throw in here yeah inspirational music this is what that J's The Blueprint easy them blueprint Jose am Hernandez retired US astronaut and so they click beers by the starlight and his pops you couldn't do that with Budweiser could you do that with Jack Daniels could you have like Jack Daniels what if Kid Rock's kid becomes an astronaut Kid Rock clinking Jack Daniels bottles in a fuckin cornfield the son who's an astronaut I don't why you couldn't why not I mean why do you think you can't do it with an American it feels like a very American thing to look at the moon and drink it would protest remember we put our flag up there let's have a bud well soon we're gonna have war in space Rory I don't know if you've been paying attention to the news some Goods of Elon Air Force guy was saying that we have to prepare for the possibility of war in space but this is an inevitable inevitable possibility probably with drones well let me ask you this what was your what was your take on that UFO thing what is this change space this was a UK ad for a beer it's all these astronauts in space in space drinking beer the garment good but there's British astronaut I had no idea belong beer wow that's cool British astronauts what would member that UFO thing that happened like two months ago and they released the government was like we have no idea what this object is and you heard the pilot in the air like what the fuck is that came across the remember like they're like the UFOs it happened right after Tom DeLonge was on here watch it didn't we watch them the government literally confirmed that they don't know what it is and it's a UFO and it's doing things and then whatever would just stop talking about wait maybe I don't believe these things enough I barely pay attention they come my way and this was on like real news sites right but what is the video can we see the video again there as you see it again Oh see stop hold on this is but now remember this says has been debunked and now you know yeah you know who debunked it what's-his-face Mick West Mick west from Medibank comm what they did was they changed the perspective from 1 X 2 to X so when see when you're looking at something zoomed in things move faster your sight picture is much quicker when you're at normal your sight picture slower so like as you zoom in everything looks faster so when the thing moved out of frame so fast it was because it had been zoomed in all not because it took off at some insane in other words the pilot was just fucking with the government no they didn't know any better when whoever released the video didn't look at it these meta bunk guys looked at the video and you can see all the numbers on the screen when you look at the video you see like what his perspective is x1 x2 and he points out a look here it goes to x2 and then it just moves out of frame it's not even that you're snapping in on it you're looking at it from a totally different perspective now you're looking at it from a zoomed in perspective that's interesting yeah see if you could find it written it sure my dream was that was gonna be aliens and their goal was they needed plastic he's got a bunch of photos in it see if you find the photos he points him out that's what I was hoping and they were gonna go like our planet needs plastic do you have anything like we have so much yes in the ocean you need to take it all you know and then they just cleaned it all up and things got better hmm like they went to the Pacific Garbage Patch and just like and then they left mmm the Pacific Garbage Patch you see there's a kid who's got a solution to that what his young man and figured out a solution goddamnit I'm supposed to be in contact with that fellow now that I'd be curious you know what that solution is some sort of a machine that like skims the the ocean for plastic and it collects all the plastic huh yeah and I don't know what what what it's powered by I think I want to say it's powered it's a solar powered thing well that was the concept behind got like a Roomba Dutch students giant ocean cleanup machine is going into production inventor says the technology will solve the marine plastic crisis but some scientists are skeptical as they should be there are scientists Boyan slavich's that's right I was connected to him how much it's growing by let me write it down 8 million tons a year that's that's insane hi spells last name SL 18 plastic is yeah well million we never thought about we thought once we throw it away oh it's thrown away its they've got it no shit falls off there's there's fucking dumps they leave it sitting there fly to the dump they pick it up they fly away with it but I don't know what the craziest thing is how like the ocean currents all lead to one place you know it's so weird it's weird that you could see it all swirling and it's like the size of Texas I think they said and they say it breaks down all that particles or all the the rather plastic these weird little particles and the fit and that that's why they're pulling fish out with mmm stomachs full of plastic you fish out with it and more birds birds are dying and they're feeding it to their kids and there they find babies in the nest that have these plastic caps yeah filled in their stomach it's really a horrible horrible have you seen that to the Stars party balloon oh yeah is that really what they saw what this says stops hmm well it might be that you say they were tracking a party balloon in an f-16 is that what it's supposed to be saying yeah on the other website said that exactly what you were describing as I was reading it like the camera angles were off and you can follow the angle with the clouds moving with the yeah balloon well once you zoom in on something that's what happens I mean if you if you've ever looked through a binocular if you're trying to hold a binocular the more powerful the binoculars are the more like the picture at the end seemed shaky it's a known you're known if we take a picture I think it's it's a cop it's not an optical zoom it's a digital exactly yeah so that was the explanation for the bizarre behavior that object apparently is so funny to me it was a party balloon what's that Jamie there's another one too that was like this was the day before he posted which a second video similarly I don't know if this was the one that they were one dude nobody wants you opposed to be more real than me that's why I was asking you about it nobody but I'm also I don't I don't buy a lot of the thinking that goes behind these things because people just want to think that it's real they want to think it's real so bad that they they're not looking at it completely objectively if it is real we got to know for sure and there's no way you know for sure this way this just doesn't seem like we know for sure this seems more like what he's saying is correct if they if you see the perspective shift you see the the way the thing moves shift but this is what we're talking about earlier about like the government and conspiracy like that's a perfect example the government's like we have no idea what this is that we're confirming it was a UFO and then guys who aren't at the government like yeah it's a fucking balloon douche Jamie scroll back down what was it saying there this little animation it says the flare around the much closer engines rotate independently of the rotation of the plane what does that mean I'm not I'm not sure I get this I think we're we're halfway in the middle of this page that's probably the problem they're explaining something along and out yeah see there's a lot of these things that have been proven to be horseshit and people see the video footage and they think oh my god it's UFL oh no it turns out it's a oil thing that's on fire in the distance like there's a lot of weird things you see in these like real blurry infrared scans of shit or whatever that is night-vision scans yeah I want to see some real shit where you look at it and you go okay yeah deposit if that's in the fucking UFO like what is that but it's not real and if someone says that there's no way they could have faked that then then I'm curious but right now I just think too many people want it to be real but for the Pentagon the Pentagon sat on that for 10 years and then released it and no one in the Pentagon figured it out until like it got out into the private sector online and something's like yeah it's a balloon and you zoomed in on it you fucking idiots look at this 2x that's my point about government conspiracies I'm like yeah it just seems like incompetence to me it could be like nobody looked at that closer but you were known for 10 years that's just the people that were responsible for that that were incompetent do you think that you would give the fucking UFO searching job to anyone you wanted to do real shit the UFO searching job is a job as gift to your friend's cousin that's fair you get him a job you are going to be involved in a top-secret operation what Kowski get in we are gonna be searching for you and you know we're gonna rely on you you've been carefully selected remember fly this number spies like a stupid dude to interview people in their farms hi I'm shining crystal meth I'm sorry I saw it it was lit up like a goddamn candle remember that movie spies like Gus with Dan and Chevy Chase yeah like the purpose of that movies are total fucking moron so they use them as decoys happen must have a give him a fake mission like yeah just go here and in a Russia and they you know and then like the Russians are looking at them not the actual isn't that what was the movie with springtime for Hitler yeah Mel Brooks are either still young Mel Brooks made a movie with AC set similar well not really but they both wrote for rusty Caesar yes um he the it's about them making a play that they thought was gonna be a total failure and turns out to be a smash yeah they were trying to lose money they wrote the biggest bomb they could make because they figured out how to game the system that has bond they get all this reimbursement money it was and and everyone's well everyone's walking out and then all of a sudden like a moment occurs where it's they really they think they think it's a comedy and they start laughing at it and then like everyone's a get back in here you know the act too it's really funny that movie is amazing Zero Mostel yeah yeah is it Gene Hackman to reality stock and blue guys gene hi I'm gene Wilder him yes Gene Wilder I think is the Bialystok in bloom is their name dude I used to love Gene Wilder when he was paired up with Richard Pryor god I'm such a gene Wilder fan dude I love that producers yeah yeah but when he paired up with Richard Pryor those days were magical man um stir crazy and uh hear no evil see know who they did a bunch of him they do a crazy it was funny and then when they were in prison together I just re-watched with my nephews uh Willie Wonka with Gene Wilder yeah it's fucking unreal yeah how good that guy is it was amazing everything he did was oh and Blazing Saddles one way it's yeah yeah man it's a he's almost like a forgotten genius yeah to just stop just died last year you don't hear I'm talked about enough as much as he should as much as he should be he's amazing he's caught the camaraderie that he had with Richard Pryor - it was just so interesting real it felt real you remember when they walked into the prison like that's right that's right we bad we bad follow my lead they'll get us kicked off YouTube right won't it probably somebody owns it oh these motherfuckers yeah even if you play Clinton the up yeah yeah you pulled yeah I had that my my nightly show that's right that's right we bad we bad dude he's Richard prize one of the few great comedians that I loved as much in movies yeah I loved as much as movies as I did seeing him doing stand-up did you like a veggie well there is that it okay it's hilarious yeah this is so ridiculous look how he's walking I didn't know even you know like movies back then we're just so innocent they're also like scenes took so long like look how long this walk is yeah that's right [Laughter] this is not playing over YouTube right no okay okay let's it's probably frustrating for people Fantan what is it the name of the that's right you're crazy that's right we bad we don't take no shit that's this that's the name of the clip if you want to watch it on youtube remember also like Richard Pryor with that movie with Jackie Gleason the toy oh yeah if he's funny yeah yeah he had a bunch of great that was a like if so much of my childhood yeah Brewster's Millions was fun yeah uh-huh who's John Candy I think he's a persistent uh funny fucking dude man concept of Persis million is this great concept for a movie he gets he gets thirty million dollars and he has to spend it all in a week and he can't have any assets and if he does it he gets 300 million dollars yes I was like he's gotta like just get rid of all this money as fast as he can I completely forgot about that movie if you hadn't brought it up like here's a here's a freak out every year every year they make new movies movies don't go away you know but every year they make new movies yep like movies just get lost in the shuffle big time there's too many movies you know what the amount of movies yeah so you could just watch like is there ever been a time where people had more access to shit to entertain them just constant all day all that's in there glued it's just coming at you while you're completely immobile it's insane I mean like when you're flying on a plane now right yeah hundreds of movies right there yeah pick a movie in it just placing your yeah I don't talk to people about this all the time just like you know like people used to just sit like like I was at dinner with my girlfriend the other day I left my phone at the table I went to the bathroom and for some reason there was a line for the bathroom they're like two coed bathrooms and it was like people waiting so I didn't at my phone I just stood there and it was like much longer than I thought it would be and I'm just standing there with nothing to read nothing to do and it's like oh it's bullshit I'm like this is just I'm like this is just how we used to live like I couldn't even wrap my brain around it well that's how some people still live like Ari Ari Shaffir with his flip phone really it's how he's living yeah yeah I don't know he just keeps that stupid fucking thing and it's Bobby L has a flip phone yeah all those on Instagram though yeah he's got a iPad yeah it's kind of a workaround though you know that's what people like I don't have TV and like the of the internet like yes Mike fuck you you have TV just cuz you don't have a cable box at your house doesn't mean you don't know do you have high-speed internet yes all right fuck you HBO GO only exactly that's I know it's not TV it's HBO but it's still TV it is weird right that everybody wants to be the guy that tells you that they have abandoned television I just read a lot of books but really yeah a little bit spirit that's like that was like the whole hipster movement I'll say it organic and just read well I just make my own pickles but yeah I guess by name it's like fuck off dude I make my own shoes yeah I'm a cobbler and a Pickler and I make a ten I do like I do think that there's a periods of time where like things are at their peak you know like LPS music in your home but again the reality of like sure it's fun to have a record playing some records but like the end of the day if I'm gonna like listen to music I just don't know what Spotify it it's just place forever you know yeah it's like you know it's fun the novelty of like put on a record and listening and then taking off and flipping it but if the activity you're doing is listening to music and you're lying to listen to an album all the way through but if I wanted to like play a tune for you I can find it find the like the line on the record that's that song like counting lines it's just you know there's just I don't know I liked it I liked that people have it you know a tendency to try to keep stuff in its pure form but at the same time we're like whatever man you don't have a Victrola in your house you know Patrol's not good doesn't sound good yeah like Henry Rollins would give you a different perspective on it cuz he's a for the best music well Neil Young - Neil Young had a whole website he created for music to sound the cut the download music and it's like raw yeah full LP form well it's actually had a device it was like a zoo or something yeah it was one of those things and I don't know how successful it was but for the audiophile was like one of the best sort of devices in digit I thought was just a website but yeah really impressed music yeah Rollins has a crazy set up in his house though and he loves records and he's got these fucking speakers what did we find out how much those speakers are like quarter million dollars or something I was gonna say like 15 grand dude or something bananas and there's a scene he's got some crazy setup and so he'll like sit around and just like play music some days just sit down and just play some music and sit and listen to music like that look at his speakers it's crazy you know I mean that is a that's an intense experience yeah like that's that's something very mean I don't even think that has to be allowed I think what you're getting out of that is just like this pure sound it's not that Henry Rollins is destroying his neighbor's life every day with music he's getting every level of the music yeah every track every I bet if we went to Henry Rollins house and he played music for us we could understand what the fuck he's talking about sure but again like I love music but to me I don't know if maybe my hearings not as good like whatever I don't know if I've ever experienced it like I've never experienced those things but I've experienced like a really good car stereo like what you play like whole lot of love and II hear it like move around its core yeah you could hear that in a car stereo sometimes or good headsets good headphones again yeah ear ones yep can hear some shit that you've never heard before but that's where that that's where that Neil Young thing comes in because if it's like a compressed iTunes file yeah it's not rare anyway cuz they like they like blend it all the all the all the stuff into like one track well Jamie you've tried to explain the whole record sound right took a warmer sound isn't the idea I mean it's I was gonna said that what what you're just describing is these two cell that as like in stereo or like mixed in stereo before there was even stereos available it just means it's a left and right mix so you're hearing things mixed yeah versus mono which is just everything all together stuck together yeah yeah but if you like to play play around in a garage band you can really start to understand what it is because you can lay down several different tracks of different music different instruments different things and then if you want you can mix them all together into one strip of content and then like that's but if you keep them all separately they're all playing in it as a you know sort of as more of a symphony yeah so it's really just but it's a much bigger file you know but if you compress it into one then you can make like an mp3 out of it right and it just sounds just flatter sure yeah but you know it's it you know it gives you the ability to like raise the drums or lower that you know yeah so it's you can see why if you're real audiophile a real musician you're like that's the only way I want to hear be fish yeah I could totally get it yeah I mean I totally get especially someone like Rollins who's a musician himself and probably has like a deeper appreciation for the sounds and their purest form source yeah yeah do you know what octaves are do you understand what those are no like if you look at a piano it's really only like 8 keys over and over and over and over again so there's like a C but it's on that keyboard 8 times okay if you hit all the C's together they kind of harm on you sound really good that's when you can kind of tell that something neither feels bad or it kind of sounds weird when it's not harmonically good there are times maybe you would use that and hearing those are those harmonics are also hurts like frequencies they kind of go on forever our human hearing stops around 20,000 if adult males probably has been ruined a little bit it's a little bit less but that's when you have these giant speakers they kind of allowed the sounds that even we can't hear to exist because they affect the ones we can hear and when you're compressing them those sounds kind of get chopped off because you don't really need them and that's when digital music kind of sound bad and then this this radio or record quality is company radio that's why the resurgence records came back yeah that's it it's also people love the ritual of like laying the record down the turntable putting the needle on the crack sitting back you know they made this in 79 yeah last remaining people from Woodstock there is like a component of like rock music that just peaked at a certain time and sounded sounds a certain way right that like you know I know his Epling like stole a lot of stuff but there's something about that like even like the Creedence like clear like those dudes who just you know their voice is like you know just like that like that was a real original band - yeah and one of those dudes a fortunate son that's another great fortunate yeah and who say who sings simple man what do you call Allman Brothers no that Skinner yeah yeah yeah dude that's fucked up stories of all time though the way those guys died yeah do you know that one of them survived the crash and got shot by a guy whose land he landed on yeah yeah did you survive the bullet no we I think like like in other words Alec he killed him die die everyone died in a plane crash and this guy's like holy shit I survived it fucking oh my god it's like the worst thing that's so crazy yeah where'd they crash I think in like a I think in like a swamp or something that's right now I remember the story but a pond and I think that the guy survived the bullet that shit maybe I'm wrong I thought he died you might be right yeah I have no idea but goalie shit we survived boom yeah she's right worst fucking plane crashes killed Rocky Marciano to Buddy Holly the Big Bopper Big Bopper that's Richie Valens no so Selena oh no Selena are killed by her assistant ah there was somebody who crashed in a plane yeah they both ended up Stevie Ray Vaughan helicopter crash yeah how quick are people to pull the racist trigger these days this is ready I had one the other day where I was at a near comedy club in New York and the manager there's this guy dhruv's awesome guy and he's a black dude and I was leaving and I said goodnight to him but I said goodnight to one of the platters they were like basically wearing the same thing but all the comics at the BART was like a bunch of black design he says like I don't know what to tell you I'm like I guess I'm racist laughing but it was one of those were like yeah I have no excuse I didn't I wasn't paying attention but at the same time I like was like see a druid he was like um Dre you know and I don't think that's obviously like it's not because I can't tell black people apart I just was like on my phone paying attention it was like peripheral vision but if something's happened it's just funny to be like yeah you got me man it's just in my DNA he thought it was a white guy and it was a different white guy no we were shit yeah like it's at least in the comedy world eat make a joke out of it like the real world it's I'm at a comedy club everyone's fucking around but in the real world now I do that you look like a dick we're in one of the last groups of people that do something for a living that you can get away with saying ridiculous shit to each other and we all like it well I think it's dying though really I'm noticing depending on who's in the room comics like there's certain comics now that you can say stuff and they get offended and you're gonna well I I'm out like that's how I always felt about writers rooms the best thing about writers room in a comedy show is the ability to say stuff that you cannot say in civilization yeah like whores because even just a jump start the room that the horrible things you can stay and you worry about doing that now though would you worry I I don't worry about it but I am much more conscious if like if we're sittin at the table at the Comedy Cellar a much we're conscious have sitting around the table I'm just not saying something completely outrageous for just the jolt of it a lot of people used to do well yeah I'm one of those people if I'm like hanging out like rich Voss and Keith Robinson unleash the hash or you know but if there's a sure newer people I don't know I'm just going on especially younger comics I'm like there's like I'm that millennial component where like they don't they don't get that part of this is same absurd things and pushing it a little bit on stage and so you got a lot of groans I'm sure you get like that grow anything happens to people if they think you're going down the wrong path reaction like that's just trying to keep you in check my professor would not allow that fall bringing back to where I want it that's why I thought Chappelle's two specials the last two were so good yeah and he makes that point he's like our job it's our job if you see a comic not doing that like he's not doing his job yeah job is to push the line mm-hmm I agree but it's look there are days where you're like it's exhaust of course if you're not funny it's it's your ways and everybody starting like you have to you have to be funny first that's the goal the goal isn't to go up there and make fucking some remarkable point that's one to grow on no I think it's you got to be funny but in being funny if you can't you know know to people a little bit it's well especially each other that's what people don't understand if they really listen to the way we talk to each other like one of the things that people love is some of the podcasts that I do with dunk it with a re rather and Tom and Bert mm-hmm because they're so mean to each other yeah like Ari calls Bert what did he call him an idiot fuck he goes it doesn't work that way you idiot fuck and for a regular person a regular like a regular meeting yeah it's some fucking insurance office it's not gonna float would be the end of the conversation in human resources get called some we'll get a settlement completely yeah I mean I I found that the difference between The Daily Show writers room and the nightly show writers room was we went out of our way and we made it the most diverse writing room you could ever been it but that also caused problems because now all of a sudden you got like a right-wing dude and like a sensitive Brooklyn person and then like you know they're set in it and so half the time I was like okay everyone stopped like you're right brown is an Ivy League school but I and I see what you're saying about the fraternities there's you know it was that kind of stuff and it was like and I had to kinda little discussion just like people would get heated about something they were passion I have to like blow the whistle is everyone stopped like we're fucking around you know if people were getting sad people would like you know that kind of shit like somebody would pitch there's something in one day happened where somebody pitched a joke and another person phone had as their ringer just right worse there their alert for a text cricket noise so somebody pitched something in the meeting and it was a shitty it was just a shitty pitch which we all done it if we're in a writers room henna zone it was like drip drip and I was so bad the fucking crickets came in and everyone left but then later on I found out that right it was upset and the guy who had crickets on his phone they had a fucking thing about why if I'm gonna have crickets you fucked me I was going oh shit no no no you're great right or how sheís it was just a cricket joke it's like you know but it's I don't know so I thought what the Daily Show was not that way the Daily Show like when I first started working there and I was like a production assistant now I go into a writers room I'd come out like wanting to cry that's how I mean those guys I'd be like oh like I'd have a tape to show them like I got some photos to show you guys they'd be like shocker like they were just they were just rip it was like doing a roast every day they were like that shirt stupid that thing is dumb that they like okay you guys made fun of things just constantly yeah yeah well I became not that guy I was like yeah I'd like eat shit dude I did it you have some you know cuz you like you got hazed and then you got to the next level and the haze the next guy but in a writers room is that a necessary way to think to fuck with each other I think I think it's necessary show it's not I think it's necessary because you're watching a lot of somber shit you're watching news watching c-span you're watching speed trying to make funny out of it yeah so you gotta like come in there silly right so sometimes it's just getting that energy in the room you know it's like a warm-up and sometimes it's like doing warm-up like having a warm-up comic you know it's like you gotta get to end like you know you got to get the energy up we really got you can't watch and go oh my god this is terrible this is about right you got to watch it be like a nice shirt you know I always wanted to do a show called uh I always wanted to do a spoof call them warm up comedians in cars getting coffee you know and it's like just driving around the city Billy hey look at this asshole nice tie you know like due to traffic later like hey why don't you stop sooner old man you know and it but it's that kind of thing where sometimes you just fucking comedy yeah but those guys were mean they work they were all and they were like old grizzled stand-ups and they were mean it's different I was gonna say it's different than like a sitcom writers room - because sitcom writers room they have to think about character develops you know where the plots going yeah you guys are reacting to the plot it's tribal yeah yeah yeah so it's almost like you have to be more aggressive in that position everything is like it's it's almost like everything is a reaction to an affront like a affront to your sensibilities to your information - and trying to look at it like not as a human right no like you can't look at it it's like a reasonable minded person you have to look at it like what's the obscure take on this what's the way to make this honey you know so you can't come in and go you know like you can't watch the State of the Union and go wow that is a good point that is Dage I thought watch the State of the Union go wait did he just say what would a George Bush say when you're human human-animal hybrids you know things like that where's that we got to watch out for human-animal hybrids and we're like well let's let's have some fun with that he says that reason no that was the Union probably like Oh three or something you know it like ones that I just remember like we got to have 50 tons of gas on a mustard talked 50 tons of mustard gas on a farm whatever you're like little these little weird phrases as he was trying to sell the war to people you know and then we would grab them and make little montages out of them or create the scenario of what he's talking about there's a fucking human hybrids thing where's he getting that wasn't there something that they were talking about doing some research really recently they were gonna make a human Pig hybrid yes he says they're gonna grow work that's crazy yep what if they give you a better one like what if they give you a heart it's like 50% better yeah they're like hey you want a bigger dick we just grew one on a pig you know you want to pick dish well if they give you a pig heart but and you start thinking like a pig yeah that could happen like you there's you realize like some of the thinking takes place in the heart what I think what they actually do is grow a human heart in a pig is the idea like I think that gross human organs pig so it's not a pig's heart but maybe the pig memories get into your yeah that would make sense oh it's an Pig memories dum-dum yeah and it's poison so hold on go up to the top so I could read the the thing oh you're human big hybrids created in the lab here are the facts hmm whenever you hear that they've already been making people out of pigs right by the time you hear that by the time it gets to us I mean how far down the ladder are we on the information food chain you know yeah I mean who the people is pickle they're pigs lungs are breathe and what in the fuck watch Pig blong pig lungs filter human blood in a lab holy shit man that's I have a Google Alert set for that watch pig lungs filter human blood in the lab you'll get overwhelmed it's every day just don't stop with the pig blood yeah what screw a human ear on a lot on a rat and they they grew a human ear ear onna on the back of a mouse yeah I don't know what that was about though that was a buddy gets like replaced because I don't think they were taking the ear off the rat I think they were like trying to show that they could do that mm-hm and now they do it to people like they grow you a year in your forehead and then you keep that for a couple of years yeah and then they cut it off and then put it on your ear but they're not joking but you don't want it on your forehead that's where it would grow best just put it on your back yeah this guy had a nose growing on his fourth stop yes he did that's photos you know it's not Photoshop he had a an accident where his nose was severely damaged so they grew another nose on his forehead and then removed it from his forehead see that's real shot no it's seen how dare you distrust me I believe so this dude a fucked up nose they grew him this nose on its forehead oh it's our friend feeling DeFranco so see if he's got any any actual footage of homeboys nose that's it hmm I'm pretty sure that's a real story that's what is that you guys growing a hand out of his foot I was his hand got that sometimes they'll do that if I your hand got severely damaged the Guardian kept alive on a leg okay that's so fucking how good was that guy got his ear growing out of his arm to replace his other ear all right bro they're gonna be able to grow that shit in a lab soon it's gonna be an interesting fucking time and I like your idea that we think that we're missing like what comes next that we're gonna miss it yeah because it seems like things are happening at such a crazy rate that if you did check out now you might just miss him or eyetality yeah you know yeah you might or you might miss downloading your brain yeah they're working on that look at those downloading your conscience going a horn look is that screw horn out of her head what a shit horn looks like she just took a dump out of her head of shit horn did

whoa some people have horns coming out their fucking cheeks this is nuts Chico gets them make that bear so am i stupid can read it was that say between 60 and 70 cutaneous how is that I say after Taneyhill taneous horns are more common in older patients with the peak incidence those between 60 and 70 they're usually common in males and females though there's a higher risk of the lesion being malignant in men they're more common in people with fair skins huh that's the Asian thing I guess huh would you consider that but some agents don't have fair skin like yes no it's efficacious it's not which is that well that website had more Asians Wow weird people get fucking horns yeah no I just think it's weird that you don't you don't deal with it right away imagine trying to explain to someone a thousand years ago if you had horn that you didn't do anything oh god I didn't make a deal with the devil that would probably happen in like 1962 I heard he does not sleep I heard him on my rooftop last night on his haunches breathing heavy can I run to the yeah yeah yeah use a little boys from here my favorite bang my nitro came right through Rory can't handle his nitro that is a fucked up

out how long do you think they'd grow four or it takes to get that long oh it's good question like do you let that go do you let it go when you go to the doctor she's gonna fucking horn but a lot of those people that they like that one guy that had a horn growing out of the back of his head they guy looked like he was in a very very rural area with dirt ground like hmm it's kind of a Horning a problem that's a dog bro is that a cat I guess its nose I thought its nose was that black spot well what is that oh that's that dude that had that fungus tree thing yeah he had that horrible fungal infection like warts that covered his whole body and made him look like a tree dude I mean what in the fuck is that that's like a life-form that's consuming another life-form like the barnacles on a pole that's stuck in the ocean I mean as almost as like that like these these things are growing on a skin what is that fungus in sport it's a wart right warts a disease yeah so if it's a disease and that disease is actually growing on his skin that's what all that is Oh God motherfucker nature can be ruthless imagine being that dude and you're like why me like what kind of shit luck is this we're looking at this guy who's got there's a few people that have it apparently they have this tree disease where it looks like they grow it's a like a war a war disease it gets completely out of control God died described it as the cutaneous horns skin oh so it's the same thing yeah it's just all over that actually looks like is that no that's the guy from guys his skin has become like he's become like a beast it's like you watch Game of Thrones yes that's stain that's Stone skin disease yeah that's what it looks like he does look exactly like that that's weird fuck it's weird yeah that's what Medusa myth came from people growing getting that you know right oh like snake head right maybe it just got distorted over the years to be like you froze like a stone but instead of just you were just covered like a rock yeah I mean a disease like that if you've got that shit a thousand years ago people absolutely be convinced you were cursed yeah like something did that to you a demon-possessed you well think about like the logic to early medicine you know yeah it's like it's like your head hurts we should let some air out of it look yourself at cojo holes in your head yeah how about seizure they thought you were you were possessed yeah I'll give you a seizure Steve Martin sketch on SNL I'm the barber remember that feels like medieval barber which is like their medicine man you know he's like trust me huh who's the barber here we're just gonna drain your face you know if like it's built all of his remedies were just death I watch The Exorcist again the other night whoa did go through the head about that's what a lobotomy was they go through the eyeball right through your eye right through the night I thought that's going up here oh wow thought it was going up there no they just scramble it stirred around Jesus Christ one great no anesthesia no sto spike in my eye I think they put you under times it didn't I think oh Jesus Christ sometimes they didn't sometimes they just nuked your brain while you're sitting there they're scrambling it around just imagine that they did that what like what year are they doing it that way a lot dude they did it a lot in 1900 go to that photo that kid right above where your cursor is right there BAM whoa whoa they lobotomize that kid look at his eyes are all swollen up from the blood holy shit they did it to accounts dude they did it to a kid's like he just needed some adderall holy shit there was a I feel like there was a place they were doing him so often that they had to they couldn't even do as many as I needed there were hundreds a day what yeah please do oh my god that's insane you imagine that they thought that that was a good thing to do it's insane and and but they thought that was a good thing to do during the time where you can take pictures yeah these are photo cameras existed yeah cameras pretty modern era holy shit yeah and that was going on in lobotomies were going out like that one of the Kennedys had a lobotomy what yeah there's a Kennedy sister who had a lobotomy for real yeah that shit was going on into like the 50s and 60s remember oh remember hundreds was the flu one flew over the cocoa Cuckoo's Nest that's like the end of the movie did they lobotomize him at the end of the moon did they electric shock him he was kind of done he was like forth or not the mouth yeah I don't know if they did it would think it was electric shock though wasn't it yeah but I I don't know if it was you know the same outcome okay hmm look at this during its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s lobotomy was performed on some 40,000 patients in the United States and around 10,000 in Western Europe holy shit the procedure became popular because there were was no alternative and because it was seen to alleviate several social crisis's overcrowding in psychiatric institutions and the increasing cost of caring for mentally ill patients so they couldn't take care of him so they just scrambled and fed him gruel yeah the guy was doing 20 to 25 a day unlike unlike now and we just let them wander the streets doc man what the fuck man that's crazy how many people that is yeah look up the Kennedy I think it's one of like JFK sister's got a lobotomy dude I was in Fresno recently I was doing a gig I was doing a gig and rosemary Kennedy hmm mentally impaired um yeah so what I was saying as I was doing a gig in Fresno and there's this giant population of people living on the streets out there like you go down streets it's just like a Skid Row type deal Wow well you're like everywhere you look to the right and the left is a homeless people like a home in Tennessee yeah very similar they have carts set up things laid over them they're living on eat them garbage everywhere and you're like holy shit Wow and then I found out that Louis tharu did a documentary on it is that it from yeah from Fresno yeah and then I found out that Louis Theroux did a documentary on it and that he said that Fresno is the meth capital of the world Wow yeah see if you find that that but um it was real weird man it is weird weird but that does not look like an American city it was weird yeah and you realize like wow these people got fucked yeah they got stuck in this herbal situation now they become this thing that people pity when they drive by yeah lingering on the side of the road luckily we have city addicted to crystal meth that's what it is luckily we have Christians who will come help them yes the country full of Christians these people - that what it's a 2009 so it was in 2009 that it aired and it's probably gotten even worse since lost yeah I didn't have no idea was that bad yeah that's insane dude it was it was weird driving around there fun shows though nice people I was gonna ask you a house the house the Kratt fun fun I did two shows two shows there two shows Bakersfield had a great time man but the places that I don't go to normally I'm never there yes I was like I'm going back to uh Comedy Works in Denver soon yeah I got a couple fun cakes camera did you film there no but I showcased there right that's what you were there yep now or the night of right I did a show Thursday and then I did an early show on Friday before that was the one where Chappelle came out it was crazy how fun was that that was so fun we were hanging out and I got off stage and Chappelle was just in the greenroom I was like what are you doing man goes he goes oh man just hang around I go you might go up should I fuck yeah yeah I ran back out and pulled the people back to their seats yep I was sitting in the crowd watching was awesome it's mini sometimes he'll come in at a Comedy Cellar and do like four hours so when you first got on stage I was with my girlfriend's like we're gonna be here awhile so and he did like 30 minutes yes like worked on a bunch of new stuff it's really fun it's also just cool that you let him do it cuz a lot of people won't want Chappelle coming out after they just killed the show you know no I love it yeah he's awesome I wanted to watch - yeah he was amazing I think you had I mean your your hour is awesome - man I still like quote stuff from your hour about like vegan that's my own vegan cats and all those other older stuff yeah but like the guts yes but just murderer stuff as well yeah I can't wait to get this new another way when are you doing it April so you said that you did one and you I take those showtimes I was gonna do with it I was it was but yeah I thought it was gonna go to Showtime but then like the deal kind of got funked up and now I own it and I don't know it's good I'm really proud of it it's like a really good house I worked hard on it you know I wrote a lot of jokes and I went on the road like non-stop that year before and just ever thought about Amazon yeah I've thought about a lot of those places why people are looking around you know they're looking at like some options to places to send it and you know it's just a slow process like the process of getting people to watch it first you know when you send somebody something to watch like they're like sure and then they you got a nag I mean um you know so there's a couple of people that may be interested and I just put it out you know yeah Jamie didn't you say that Amazon Prime something like fifty percent of the households have Amazon Prime can you say something like that I think when you have Amazon Prime you get video like you can watch videos for free yeah I think people you'd have to let people know it's some of the resources that are available but I feel like Amazon is starting to do comedy specials now oh they're just great if you if you're not getting one from Netflix or HBO or Comedy Central yeah you know 64 percent of US households have an Amazon Prime like do we just got to figure out how to get those people to watch comedy special I feel like you got on Netflix before it was a thing I got on Netflix in 2005 yep that was when I did my my very first special I did on Netflix and then we sold it to Showtime it was the opposite right but I'm saying it so like my the way I think of it now is like what is that what is that thing now like what is what is you know what's the apartment that's cheap right now it won't be like tents yeah right wood so it's like you know so that that's the thing I'm trying to think of it's like there's got to be different ways to do it more interesting ways to do it than just you know putting it on iTunes and being like it's ten bucks you know or whatever like a you know there's so I'm just thinking of that way I'm trying to think of it as like it doesn't have to be it all of it it's just for people to see me do do stand-up so it's like that's the goal so it's really more about creative ways but I'm kind of going through my head that I like what about this what about this what about this you know and it's it's social media like it's good and bad for some stuff and you know but it's a lot of it's about how you get it out there you know and how you release it and if something buddy catches it and they you know becomes a thing you know and all so it's it's hard to like sort of it's hard to sort of game the system but you're like thinking that way you know like well the news you put it on YouTube that's probably the if you wanted to get it to access to the most people if that's how it was your concern that would be the most people yeah because if we tweeted it and we talked about on the podcast and people enjoyed it and they thought it was and they found it was free and most people especially if you have Apple TV you have YouTube built-in right and then you're just watching just watch it on your TV yeah I do that with a lot of shit now yeah you know I think YouTube is for sure the easiest option because I think there's a giant percentage of people that watch youtube videos on their phones I bet it's probably more than half yep I think is it Jamie yeah I think most people just watch it on there for a lot of people for sure it's certainly a giant chunk whether it's 50 or more 50 percent or more you're dealing with a giant chunk of people that just would have access to your comedy on their phone yeah almost anytime that is a matter of like do you break it up into like right four minutes sections so people can like share it or do you just put the whole hour out you know there's like so many different ways to like I think you should do both I think you should have like the full version and put that out on your website or on your YouTube page and then put chunks you know so if people just want to watch the chunks they can watch the chunks maybe they'll watch a chunk or two and then like oh I got to see this watch the whole thing and then watch the whole thing in its entirety and they see where the chunks fit in yeah that's a good way to do it yeah because if you just let people know you know people want to see good comedy you let people know and you can only like we can only crank out so much shit yep so like there's a lot of people out there like hey yeah dude I'm looking fucking laughs what do you got yeah and I feel about it too is like it's you know you know better than anybody whenever you do anything like you've filmed something whether you're in it behind the camera or put your name on something you want it to be good and I'm always honest with myself I'm like that that was I could have been better but this I was like oh I'm like proud of it you know like I like it like I feel really good about it of course that's the one you can't get out right stroke being it's the first time I'm like ah boy this is really something I stand behind it's like go fuck yourself are you in a financial position that you have to sell it or can you just put it on YouTube like - you know I can put it I mean I bought it back and you know I could put it on YouTube not sell it the goal is for people to see it and I you know it's not like I it's not like it cost me like fourteen million dollars you too bad money too you know you can get some ad money if you if it's a start watch yeah YouTube is like actually clamped down on that now how they yeah they're making it there's a lot of like social media stuff that's sort of falling the sort of like Wild West model of lining the the YouTube is clamped down on what the advertisers yeah you have to have a certain amount of just reading about this you have to have a certain amount of views to even be in this is a world we talked in and deal in all the time so Jamie can explain to you this oh yeah yeah they just and that one person I was reading that like only 1% now if people are on YouTube like the top one percent it's not that hard to get plastered threshold right now it's just like a thousand hours of views which if you have a thousand of users you wouldn't get you'd get there within like a month okay that's good to know heard a couple weeks yeah I kind of knew where you're going with this yeah it's just like if I set it off at the pass what I'm saying but create making money on it they're saying most people much more difficult after that pudy pie guy that pootie guy guy said a bunch of racist shit and turned out he got a bunch of Nazi jokes then he called someone the n-word and then boom next thing you know it's everybody's revenue dropped off like substantially it's very tight on how revenue gets distributed and who gets what's safe for advertising and even stuff that doesn't even make a whole lot of sense like things get D monetized we get our podcast D monetize it doesn't make any sense it's like okay that one like what would what did what was even said that was offensive like what is it the decides what your podcasts go all the time all the time different episodes get D monetize it's crazy yeah yeah and we'll talk about controversial things we talk about controversial things it almost always gets demonetised that's weird you criticize YouTube it gets demonic there's you know they're strict about that's like it's amazing how quickly to like I'll put my I think I was telling this before I put my best of nightly show real from on camera stuff on the night of the show on YouTube yeah and because it's Comedy Central content it's a big just flag within like seven minutes I get an email it's like this can't be accepted so then I was like oh maybe it's because I labeled it like best-of and I put Comedy Central as a search word so I just took out all the searchers just like best of Rory Albanese I didn't say anything about what put it online ten minutes get an email this this video has been flagged it as Viacom content it's it gets taken there hmm like it's pretty remarkable how quickly not can yeah we do it all the time that's why we said we couldn't play that video right it happens everyday things real act yeah yeah they have algorithms I mean they can just capture music and clips and stuff like that they can they can capture music from a clip from a scene in a movie that they'll find like if you're playing a scene in the movie and like say Goodfellas and some didn't we do that recently yeah and what was the song was it wrong stones Lela oh come together and they were like fuck you pay me then went straight really what it made it may have been that's funny it may have been if it was come together it may have been a Bronx Tale that's just as you can't leave right cuz Goodfellas has a great soundtrack but it does not have come together man but uh yeah it's not such a great scene that he's like I'm gonna ask you gentlemen to leave you know I get that dude have you seen that Beatles Cirque de Soleil show in Vegas and now you're seeing that no it's called love you have not seen it fucking amazing yeah it's so you know like it's so interesting as comics like most of the shows that we see are comedy like I saw a book of Mormon that was the last time I went to a play unless it was like Ford you see Hamilton one of my kids look at me yeah what do you think I thought you would see that's a cultured man you're interested in all things to do that's good ever that our is I got literally know nothing about Hamilton yeah I'm just joking yeah no it's funny because I went into it like what's it what's the craze about you know and like this is gonna be so overrated and then I watched I was like I was good it was really good loves exist you know love Broadway plays on nothing but I thought Book of Mormon I actually saw it twice I love that and I thought it was you know as funny as something could be yeah I was Jesus fuck it those dudes by the way Matt and Trey they're on another planet like they're five somewhere else know what movie I watch that we're talking about like movies that people don't talk about enough that's so fucking perfect Team America oh my god that movie is like flawless it's one of the best movies ever for comedy yeah it's it you can't even believe what they accomplished in that movie like they have you ever seen the full uncut scenes the way they had sex and drop logs on each other on each other the way they start the movie they told I saw them interview they told the story about the opening scene in the movie is a really shitty marionette you know and then it widens out and it's a marionette in France using a marionette opening so he said they said when they fucking screened it for the studio that's why they did that it was like a really shitty looking and you heard all these what the fuck did we ped spend all this money don't you know that just reveal there's the full unedited sex version they did this like way over the top to make it pull stuff back yeah it's really funny yeah they just decided to do it this way so they would have stuff to edit out this is fucking crazy oh my god and I think apparently they it's so yes yeah and they did this so that they could have like what you got to give us some of it you know they would give us a little well good they went so far over the line everything they went so far so fucking crazy yeah like he's peeing on her all over her face or hoping on going oh my god I mean it just goes on forever yeah but they did that so that they would have room for negotiation that's how they worked yeah they those guys are just geniuses man and that movies like the whole concept of they need an actor yes how important actors are no bad come on scary urine Hey fuckin shitty maker boy yeah durka durka durka durka and it's the Star Wars Cantina see don't like we're gonna transmogrify you or trans more of you and then like all that stuff happens to his face it's like 20 minutes of like like they make it like its face off and then it's just hit they just glued some hair to his face it's so funny yeah there it is hilarious this paint him a little brown come on Gary act your way in we need a Top Gun actor that's what he says he goes you're a Top Gun actor it's too bad this took so long to make does another almost broke down dude like it just fucking I can only imagine yeah how much time it must take this is so pain State hey it's taking I mean are they moving each piece as it's happening and then filming it and doing it over and over they're doing multiple camera angles multiple this shot at like a movie that's why it's so good you know I need to watch it again yeah it's me forgetting the scene I'll tell you this is him get and then it then it's basically the Star Wars Cantina when he runs in and you know and it's really funny yeah but it is a movie that you could come home at like 2:00 in the morning and just so like I want to like kill an hour and just throw it on like at any scene it stopped that oh and don't forget about the fucking South Park movie yes you're right South Park movie where I thought that was okay with the devil the devil fuck yeah I'm a long time I guarantee that Old South Park is still really funny still hilarious yep it's really funny I mean when it comes to overall content it's one of the funniest shows if not the face of all time dude they turn what else it's like Simpsons them Family Guy family people yeah fucking rip on a Family Guy I know Southport they remember the world war they take born into the writers room in the Family Guy and it was two manatees yeah I know if they drop a ball and I like drop a ball in a thing and then it's just a joke comes out so it's like it's like old TV show reference you know that's it just broke his formula down yeah it's funny though it's fucking hilarious I think I think seth macfarlane like I thought those Ted movies are really funny I didn't see them yeah still they're not like they're not I heard they're hilarious yeah they're not like flawless movies but they're funny like there's just a couple of scenes in them that are like so funny that the whole movie goes up like 10 points because there's a few scenes in there like there's a scene where or Ted's telling them about the weedy bought it was like and it's like I forget the exact dialogue but it's like he's like yeah it's cold like he's like I got some weed it's called like kill me now please you know and he's like why'd you get that he's like well the only other options but please make it stop make it stop like he's naming the weeds and they're all like it's like paranoia if you'll retain it's really funny you know sort of like maybe the the the jizz and the hare scene and Something About Mary yeah it was so funny it took the whole movie yeah and then it's like you remember that yeah cuz there's other stuff that's really funny in that movie that gets lost like Chris Chris Elliott having the best wife ever is really funny but he's still in love with Mary that's it's like a joke that kind of she's like I baked cookies you want a blowjob and he's like still in love with another woman that's how amazing Mary is yeah man there's just too many goddamn movies yeah that's when what I'm saying about they're constantly making movies but the movies don't go away I heard this annihilation movie's supposed to be amazing is it I keep hearing good things I haven't heard you know every nerd shit from anybody I know though I just keep lying to han through yet either have you seen I haven't seen that either I've been to movies in a while very rarely go out to the movies annihilations by the ex machina guy though oh really yeah that movies and that movie that's one of my all-time if I had 20 all-time greats that's in there it is yeah movies in there especially for me because I'm bitch I'm really obsessed with the idea of artificial intelligence and where it can go and like to see it in a form like that I'm like I'm buying this I'm not necessarily buying this one-man operation there's one dude as a super genius it's programming everything and doing yeah I think it probably a little bigger than that sure especially the initial launch you're gonna have teams and team but he's you know he's like the Elon Musk of that like he's like the head of that I get it idea go in and your disbelief enough was it is that the only part of the movie that I gotta go okay I just gotta soon this guy's this the ultimate super genius and it seems like we were looking at something in the future anyway it seems like this is not current time yeah it seemed like it was about 30 or 40 years in the few that have that black mirror 5 to it I'm like it's a little bit it's it's realistic but it's a little bit in the future Brian I uh I I find that with movies what's so funny is what you're willing to suspend your disbelief by is to do a bit about this it's like like like you'll go see like spider-man you know what I mean and like it's about a fucking dude who gets bit by a spider and then like then there's a scene where like someone makes a cell phone call in a basement I guess reception like that yeah this is fucking unrealistic you know like the stupidest things like it'll be like a white cab driver in New York Kevin Spacey Superman movie by the one that like came and went very quickly Kevin Spacey was Lex Luthor and the other that other dude was Superman like Spacey at least the Superman movie oh that's right and Amy Adams I think we're who was Superman who's like some dudes some dude and then like it was like he's Superman and then it was like he's not anyway there is the dude yeah his name's like Superman Brandon Brandon something Brandon that due to his Superman and yeah he was Lex Luthor he's the George Lazenby of Superman why did I not remember this at all well there's this heaven spacey with his head shape yeah it's it's a bad movie but there's a scene in that movie where Superman flies over like a like the Brooklyn Bridge and a fat white guy with a cigar and the newsboy hat goes what the heck and I was like this is the worst movie I've ever seen has driven a cab in 40 years he was in Batman vs. Superman to Kevin Spacey no they just showed that clip what was that image that you were just looking at with him and long hair five new stills from that Batman vs Superman released why was he in that movie I didn't see that movie and I assume you didn't either because I respect you yeah I watched it on iTunes winners like yeah how bad was it it's pretty bit like the longer version of it except like those Wonder Woman's in it she's alright but it's and there's like they redo the whole fucking Batman as a kid and the bats and he falls in the bad thing I'm like how many fucking times have we seen this kid fall in a bat cave like like they have to like re tell me how he became Batman and the whole thing was his parents get shot a flashback and like remember like you know dance with the devil in the pale moonlight or whatever like that shit was the Nicholson one and then they did the one with Christian Bale the origin story of Batman you know right Eisenberg is Leslie sir he's a new Lex Luthor yeah it wasn't Batman vs Superman oh okay yeah in the new Batman universe or the Superman universe I guess he's so whoever Justice League is just as bad really yeah why hurt breaking my heart bro I don't know what DC can't do it what is out now though isn't there like a some sort of a superhero movie out now besides Black Panther is there something coming out now the New Avengers that they had the big infinity or someone's that thing's coming what's that coming the summer long as you let the Hulk freak out and building up for the hole all these five years of movies and selasa vendors have been building to this big story got to get rid of that dude with the bow and arrow stop so you got your inner I love that guy but you got to give him a better superpower yeah you can't have just a regular dude with shitty recurve voila shooting slow ass arrows this garlic Johansson's just like a girl who was trained by Russians to kick ass on board this guy's ridiculous though fuck outta here bro and see for him first of all I'm see what he looks like when he pulls back his bow do you think he does it right yeah probably nope nope let's get three arrows fuck out of here bitch can shoot three hours at the same time they'll all be slow as shit he's got some mystical bow doesn't make sense it's too much power so the power must all be in the projects like a tech bow you know it's so stupid it's all tech the whole thing is stupid because he's got like these missile tips on the end of this slow bullshit ass bow that's a slow ass bow like it's a slow no he's on the right side because he's shooting where is this thing it's on he's pulling back with oh yeah right on the right but some people do do that they do it or not yeah if you learn it that way you can do it that way it seems weird it does but on a compound bow you would definitely have it on the other side but I've seen people do it that way the thing is with a riser like a one of these bow risers a recurve bow riser it's kind of a different thing because your arrow is making contact with the riser as well there's like way less accuracy with one of those things huh especially that traditional kind of a setup the way he has like if you look at archers in the Olympics they have a bunch of different classes that they compete in and when you have an arrow that has to brush up against the side of your bow like that like those traditional all those are the hardest to really develop real accuracy with it requires a lot of feel man you got to really practice with that thing and know that you're pulling the bow back exactly the same distance every time because just if you pull it back an inch more it'll have like a bunch more feet per second power just go higher or lower if you don't pull it back far enough yeah yeah he seems to be doing that in every picture I'm sure they trained him and I'm sure some people do do it that way and it looks like in some of these things he's shooting left-handed okay well then it's the right way so he's shooting left-handed that's why it's on the other side but I felt like on the other side it was his right arm you know Pitts his left arm okay duh that's why how did I not notice that yeah he's got his left arm up so he's drawing back the bow with his left arm that's why it's on the other side but I have seen people even people who are right-handed on a traditional bow but maybe it was like one of those stick bows not like a traditional bow like a but if you if you were pulling back with your right arm it would still be on the outside of the bow right if you were doing it with your right arm a compound bow it's on the other side so if I'm holding it with my left side the arrows gonna be on the left side right I think on some traditional bows and I'm talking out of my ass a little bit I don't know too much about traditional bows but I think there are some guys who put the arrow on the other side and I think that was actually a part of that lars Anderson's video where is neck the neck the guys name the guy was the crazy arrow expert shoots all those arrows at the same time think that was one of the things that he was saying was to have it on this side yes that's exactly it was well he was saying to have it on that side because it makes it easier to put on to the string if he's grabbing the arrow and just throwing it on the swing League she ain't going over the top to the other side right yeah that's what it was look at all these guys they have it on the left-hand side all these guys have it on the left-hand side it's an opposite pull back with the right and one on the Left yes so he's got it that's how he has it that's how most people have it and this is like what he's got in his hands right here this is that was a olympic target bo so what he's doing is doing it instead of going around all the way around to the left he's explaining how much wasted motion is in that gotcha and so instead he's saying you go to the same side and he shows all these images of people with arrows to the same side they all have it on the same side and it makes sense that would be so much easier and quicker to do it that way totally makes sense yeah completely makes sense I think this for accuracy I would have to talk to my friend John Dudley about this he's a master archery instructor I bet there's something to do with torque but again that's another thing like if you just shoot with the same bow the same weight arrows over and over and over again with that it's sort of like you know how you know how to throw a rock like if you ball perfect example if you see if you have a baseball there's a tree that's like 30 feet away 40 feet away you know how far or how hard you have to throw the ball to hit that tree right you know you can actually like get pretty close like that yeah you get pretty close to a spot in that tree we're just throwing it well it's because you've done it a bunch of times if you played catch with a bunch of people you kind of know what to do with a baseball right well it's the same thing with a bow and arrow especially that kind that style of where you don't have a sight that you're looking through you're just pulling back you kind of know where the arrows gonna go you just kind of know because you do it a lot of feel yeah but you have to do it every time you have to bring it back exactly the same spot of your face every time because if you go here it's gonna go different it's gonna go further or if you go in front of your face you don't pull it back all the way it's gonna go shorter right but in some cases you want to be doing that so you just have to no no you never want to be having it with the different with a different form you always want to pull it back to the same spot so another worry mat different positions so in other words though then the range of the bow is the same every time every time yeah that's the only way you're ever gonna know it's gonna kill go if you really want to go well you can lift it up but you're just aiming in a different spot but you always want to pull it back further no okay I always want to pull it back to the exact same spot what's called the compound bow it's actually called the wall okay a place we can't pull it back any further it just locks in place when the arrow is fully drawn and then you just release it yeah so release is hard that's the thing I think that's it - like now smack against your arm it's just a forum issue yeah once you learn how to do with the right form let go fast no it's where you're standing if you're standing like this like totally sideways the string is gonna hit your arm you're supposed to open up more so you're drawn back like this gotcha so there's space so the arrow it's very rarely do your forum get hit by a string super rare with someone who fires a bow I'll know is how to do it yeah but like those old timey dudes I mean they're just firing arrows in the middle of fucking Warren shit and that's why they have those big bands across there for armor to protect themselves in the strings yeah and they had like crazy powerful pose that you got to be a beast to pull back like the Mongols their bow was a hundred and sixty pounds to pull back Jesus Christ those people must have been so powerful man yeah that's crazy yeah and then just shooting these steel tipped wooden arrows into people's bodies with you but with like a compound bow like the one you use you're pulling back my four pound 84 pounds but it feels like what like ten it know it feels like 84 pounds until about right here and the cams roll over you know they have these mechanical can't these cams give you like this mechanical advantage and as the cams pull over boom then it gives you like a big let off then the let off it's probably somewhere around I'd have to find out it can be as high as like 85 to 90% let off though Wow so you're only holding like because the police is 20 ish is that like just the pole does the work yeah and then it's about trying to achieve a surprise shot then everything once you're at full draw and fully locked in you have proper form and you're aiming at the target then it's about you're using a release aid with a compound bow it's not like you're letting go with your fingers like you would with a traditional bow you have a God in your hand or on your wrist and you get to a certain point and then you lock on and then you just start pulling back with your finger touching the trigger so you don't activate the trigger by pulling your finger you put your finger on the trigger and you activate it with your back you can't flinch you can't let go yeah you can't freaking who's like you keep pulling and it automatically releases yeah but there's a thing that you we have called impact bracing like we brace for impact that's why if you see somebody like if they have a round in their gun and it's a blank they go to hit it or it's a dummy round where it doesn't go off but you see them go like that as they pull the trigger they have a bad trigger pull and they have to one of the things they do in training I'll give your watch Tim Kennedy this guy fought in the UFC does it has a bunch of training video footage as a Navy SEAL Ranger yes like my cousin actually is like a huge he's like a competitive shooter yeah honey I was like a crazy Instagram following and he's like you know and like quick-draw yeah like all that stuff I've watched tons of his stuff and he's just like he's a beast you know he's just like oh and he does like you know he does those drills the drills it does except for like you're like carrying a body and then wrap up you know like obstacle courses guns and all that so it's pretty amazing Google whether it was Kennedys I know he's a ranger I'm pretty sure find out what out what else did but he's got a bunch of videos of him shooting on the range and he's actually active military again which is crazy quit the UFC went back into the military he when he's pulling is like 2 to 2 and then he goes click because he got a dummy round and he's like there's no difference you know movement there's no movement and that's what he wants to train for yeah one train for that that perfect ability to execute a special hundred percent of the time in a combat situation sure yeah yeah like the other things they have are like do those you know that movie thing scenarios like in a house and you've got like a gun too ugly how do they do that do they have like a wall that they shoot against I think they have a wall they shoot against and they just put like the projection oh okay so it's like a target paper I think it's how it's done what's this Jamie Tim Kennedy's thing just go to his visit Wikipedia page just tell you what his er credentials are good as wiki go to all son of a bitch what are you doing show me videos he's hunting hit font for Hitler right now is the tim kennedy is yeah it's on that show hunting for hitler what is that what are they there's a conspiracy theory that hitler left and moved to the south america let me see what it says there Jamie yeah new naval forces [Music] isn't that like it was some eyes down the side there what does it say there goes sergeant first class Special Forces Texas Army National Guard right well yeah his fuckin walk and Afghanistan yeah he's an animal yeah so seven Special Forces Group he's a special dude and he's a very inspirational guy he like watches YouTube say everyday like doing rows and fucking crazy workout all getting after it yeah you realize how lazy you are with so many people now you realize that with you too man i watch your shit and like i realize it from them that's why is it yeah that's what's made me so fuckin psychopathic yeah that and my goddamn dog my dog loves like he was always scared to getting in the car now he jumps into the car cuz he knows if we get in the car it means we're gonna go run mm-hmm so we drive down to the trail and he gets out he's like fuck he just takes off so I have to keep up with them so I'm getting this great workout at least three days a week so how far you running two miles but it off-road running it's ridiculous shit it's hard it's hard yeah today I did it with a different pair of shoes I do it most the time I do with those five finger barefoot do you like having this yeah that guy's book the barefoot running book no I did not but I heard about it and that was all I needed to know yeah those people I bought I don't even bother yeah and I'm searching it the way he like lands on it he liked lands on is on your ball your ball your foot right yeah well I got it from Mark Sisson Mark Sisson who's the author of the primal blueprint a really interesting guy he's basically said that shoes are like a cast and that the problem with those five finger shoes is they have set a bunch of things is going to prevent injuries and and they actually had a class-action lawsuit against them cuz a bunch of people got hurt it'll prevent injuries eventually but if you go too hard initially your feet are not in conditioned right dude I was stunned how weak my feet are when I started doing to EFT on martial arts like most of my life so I've always been doing things barefoot but I had bitch ass feet and I didn't realize it I didn't realize it but they call that I started doing yoga yoga taught me how weak my feet were like I would be in these positions and my feet would give out before anything that's interesting like cramp up or has a cramp up and also I've basically had flat feet my whole life over the last year and a half of running with these barefoot shoes on now I have an arch Wow dude I didn't even notice your foot into a - an arched foot was just weak I figured the whole thing was the whole structure was weak when my legs were strong because my legs are used to lifting things but they're always used to doing it with shoes on right now that I do all that Hill running would like basically it's it's the only thing that sucks is like sharp rocks I'm gonna have to run over like a little rock I feel it yeah here's the one right in your fucking foot but it isn't the concept of that - is like you're running on the balls of your feet but you're also sort of like falling forward using the momentum of gravity to carry ya each yeah so you're not doing as much impact will you change your stance right if you're running forward on the ball your feet because if you're running backwards on the heels you're kind of like you're leaning back more as you're going forward you just have to change your gait you change into a leaning forward gait but if these seem so out of oh yeah it took a while to get it down though right let's fucking hard yeah especially the way you we're normally right I tried doing it yeah what app because that guy came on The Daily Show years ago and talked about I tried doing it but like after a while you just start going oh it's just like you know like that's right in your form you know you're changing your form on something you're just so used to doing it's hard to do that right but it's the only way to do it it really is the only way to run all those other ways are like the way that they developed for that thick healed running shoe way were you landing on your heel risks or it's terrible for your knees your knees aren't mechanically designed that way and they think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people who wear those kind of shoes develop knee problems whereas a lot of the people in that book which are running completely bit on the ball of their foot a lot of them were wearing like souls that they made out of tires like strapped into some sort of a sandal and they're running like yeah those guys like run like hundreds of miles like they're like shot in the mountains yeah that's pretty crazy you develop a toughness on your feet for sure mine aren't there at all like I'm a bitch like on the way down especially because I'm going down deep to this canyon and I'm running back up and out and when I'm going there's some ups at the end of it - and it's almost like a bowl but when I get to the sharp spots on the way down it's hard because you're you feel like ah and you know it's coming yeah yeah I feel like if I just keep doing it eventually my feet toughen up but for sure they've gotten stronger yeah they've gotten way stronger they feel different it sounds so stupid I'm listening to myself I know it sounds stupid but when I'm walking around my feet feel different like they're feeling the ground more right like they used to be just like whoohoo they activated muscles in them that you had an active it exactly that makes sense it does look any other body part you know which we don't think about it though when do you ever think about strengthening your feet never but it's like anytime he strengthen like a secondary muscle or something like oh yeah that's why my posture was so fast you know it was like you know whatever it's like there's always some you know some other thing to work on it just makes me think - for like just physical movement like how often do you need the power of your feet like how often are you pushing off of something or lifting something up and using your feet it's kind of amazing that we never take any consideration the actual strength of our feet yeah I had worked out with this guy for a little while and he showed me these like like rubber balls that you can roll your feet on like to engage the muscles oh yeah yeah yeah and like there were parts where like I would hit a part of my foot and the pain was like because it was just like a sore muscle from walking you know like and it's just like massaging it out but like parts of your body that you're just not like engaging and you just roll your foot on it and then you find the places that need to be like rolled out and fuck man like it hurts like like you're going between each toe and like they know that area here and it's like it's fucking painful because your feet are just you know doing what they're doing all day and you're not really paid at all you just put him in the shoes and fuck it lacing them up and don't think about him you only think about him when they're hurt goddamn it I got an ingrown toenail and you're pissed off yeah fucking stupid feet fucking feet always getting my way people that carry you around all day you don't give a shit fuck you it's crazy yeah well it's just apparently according to Sisson and it really makes sense that your foot the strength of your foot just atrophies if you just stuff it into a shoe because it has this hard surface well you're not really feeling the ground there's always cushioning so your foot doesn't it's not like giving in in the natural way of ball the foot first resists with the center of the foot in the arch and then eventually drop down to the heel it's not doing that it's just giving this Russian a push nice lob it's a sloppy ass foot it's weird yeah it's weird when you think about it that way yeah you know because that's not how your foot was designed your foot was designed for a very specific method of moving around and we just changed that but yeah fuck you nature well I get like that sometimes with my hands like a lot of times I'll do stuff and I'm like I'm not gonna put like work gloves on for this or whatever cuz it's like because there's a party that's like yeah maybe I got like a splinter but like aren't you supposed to get some split like aren't you supposed to like like have the ability to like just use your hands the way they came you know something or sometimes you know it's good it's also like a dexterity thing like it's good to be able to like get in somewhere and screw a nut on something you know that kind of stuff where it's like there's like a tactile and I feel like if you don't do that kind of stuff with your hands they get kind of the same thing like you lose your like dexterity and you lose your ability to like touch something that's rough and not go right have you ever like seen the hands of a really good carpenter yeah I mean those guys my uncle's always and the speed at which they can like Papa Papa nailing oh yeah I actually got my uncle for Christmas here this year a magnetic wristband that you can put all your like screws and stuff on they ought to keep him in your mouth and he's like hey just keep sending me photos of been building stuff but there's a wristband full of like screws like it nails it he's like I love these things you know that's Larry yeah it's so funny but you know people who like actually are actively fixing things at doing things like dude I think we did like three and a half hours yeah what time is it is a 4:15 this is a ridiculously long podcast shit it is so easy to do a podcast with you Rory do what I love
