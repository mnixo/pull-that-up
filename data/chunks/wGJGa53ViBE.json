the Joe Rogan experience trained by Joe rocky block my night all day ladies and gentlemen welcome to the post UFC wrap-up show with Tony Hinchcliffe hey everybody and me your host Joe Rogan we are on a flight right now coming back from Dallas Texas sorry absently just kicked that lady's chair but we had a great old time at a double risin wireless theater on Friday night and and then the UFC last night and now we're headed back shoutout to Ryan doobie had breakfast with turned out to be alright turned out to be an interesting guy I was a little worried about him I first came in strong with a few too many questions interrupted a little bit but turned out to be a very good dude but you never know man you know and meet some strange dude have breakfast with them could be rough but we turned out to be very cool I think I snapped at him though I was like what is with the questionnaire bro relax Matt Magness he got nervous but he was a good dude he just oh thank you man the young lady's bringing us the towels thank you she's got a crazy accent and I don't ever think like this but Tony was wondering what she would sound like if she was having sex yeah anyway so while we're on the flight back we got to give up my little wet towel and you like to caress the towel hold onto it for a little bit I like it I like to feel like a cold so hop and she took it back when it was that for to refresh shoes on the idea would it make you know that you're not in you're not in business class right coach yeah this will give you a piece of toilet business class they treat you almost as good dumpin how's that work yeah you having flown in business class a long time you don't remember what it's like back on flucos just a month ago that's one thing like if you can't afford it it doesn't seem like it'll be worth it but what's worth it is you don't think about as much you have more space because relax get off quicker you get on quicker but people don't like it it's weird like people like Southwest I feel like it's an egalitarian airline we get on Southwest and you know everybody is the same yeah it's not that bad it's effective it gets people on board not too much bullshit I think it's a good system and you can occasionally get lucky for next to some fun people they met a girl over the weekend that works for Southwest and she fell like like a you know human travel a lot if you ever want to give you discount on Southwest my son like okay sometimes you have to take them though JetBlue is a good airline that JetBlue that we flew from Buffalo to New York City JetBlue's nice yeah I feel like it's just there's a thing going on where they just decided to shove as many people into a plane as possible forget about how good the experiences but what if you work for an airline I would have to imagine work of a JetBlue feels better than working for like like United right now everybody hates United after that dudes got beat up and dragged off the plane oh must be such a bummer I mean up it like flight attendants have to deal with all sorts of mean people that are snapping at them because that guy got beat up right people sound like make a reverse bread my god what are you going to do drag me out of here yeah yeah oh for sure I just offered you a bag of pina [Laughter] - er right like what a terrible thing to see we decided I'm sorry sitting down he's heard about the fly I mean and they say nope you got to get up and it's really weird but like made the decision security guy probably from the airport probably not perfectly free United and he's just like he's like we had it with that asian surgeon doctor guys like you know what give too much of an attitude for an asian guy dragged you out of here is that what happened I don't know if it's like I mean I don't know but anything to do with the Asian guy part but it felt like it I think the story was that they had some important United employees that had to be somewhere like that day they had to be that somewhere for some sort of a meeting and so in their company their idea is that these people take priority over the customer to the point where they like physically removed a customer and beat him up I mean the way they grabbed that guy and scream and like that is crazy for someone who has done nothing yeah and all that guy did was be a customer just like one of the most devastating things you could ever watch if you like one of the people that's in charge of publicity for their company you do it locked up fuck did you guys do like oh my god you beat that guy up and drag them off the plane so an employee could steal it see your inconvenience and you say you're not as important as our employees our employees are more important than you like that's so crazy that that's their policy integrate to be a doctor I think that Marcus creepy too so it was was a doctor yeah with the doctor dentist for symptom but he had patient the Nick Lang he's like I have appointment equipment with flight my patient meat man that's so crazy that's so crazy it's just so sad it's so sad especially 48 for that's a really controversial right so if you like to think of the morale and the way it feels to be on that airplane versus what it feels to be on like a JetBlue you get those nice big seats little TVs behind the seat not bad at all right so a good ride it's like just enough space like maybe now if you're a big giant person the pro like a dude my size is just enough space if you had you met my buddy Justin Justin collared in Vegas yeah the giant yeah he's a legit giant like seven feet tall it's huge yeah like that guy he came to JetBlue without being that's but those are the outliers you know simply the flatbed that I so do they yeah man JetBlue is a solid not job Joey Diaz the big JetBlue for that was a JetBlue air airplane commercial we're doing here it's not what we're trying to do we're on virgin right now which is my favorite they just got about by a lot might be gently I wonder what's going to happen what do I give a fuck this is early morning nonsense talk with Joe and Tony I thought you guys want to talk about the fight we will God we will warming up so Wow before a fight when do you think that you wanna and you will go on your first date I think it's going to be really soon is my theory as you saw in this fight and she defended her championship last night she's very into me she kept looking at me dude she did keep looking at you between every round she made a point for like you know like I felt like sort of felt like her back up corner man she looked over at you pointed to you it started talking to you at one point yeah I was like this is crazy I know even Joe in d-theta at one point like what that no and she's your guys pointing at Tony and talked me to him yeah it's hilarious and like I'm you know if we inspire each other he's like looking at me and I'm like clapping I'm looking at her like oh that's so crazy and then she was doing some sort of an interview before the fight and she said something and people were laughing and they were joking around about it she was maybe Joe Rogan and Tony Hinchcliffe would take me on the road with them she's so funny she could be she could do anything she the way she work me she's already funny to cheese she's a bad woman she gave her a proponent piece of cloth cut out from look like a belt just advance of the across the lake so she probably did that herself right like in the bathroom and shit at the hotel I'm making her plaintiff depends exactly this is all you get bitch this is as close enjoy a piece of cloth but man that girl that she fought Jessica and Ross what a tank yeah a woman of the tank it's interesting in the women in that weight class they're all very tough and they always put up a fight up until the round go on she just doesn't get any more tired than she does you name Ian like she does but she doesn't seven officers are way down you can see the slightest evidence of it in the last round that she was slowing down a little bit but still always on her feet still moving both of them man they're both in phenomenal shape because you got to give it up to end Raj she took a fucking beating man way of beating and kept coming forward a lot of fun late kick she absorbed with a little go on coldest iron leg she had a switcher stand a couple of times switches back and forth she's getting that leg chewed up she got tagged with some good shots including a few head kicks yeah a lot of big kids yeah five in ten like big nappy head working from the front snap kick to the chest which we hang yeah makes me friends hurt anybody yes it was a really interesting combination even go to do that all this is now you get to understand why Tony was attracted to her voice but it was a perfect combination of like a ruthlessly powerful attacking determined person versus like a person who maybe doesn't have as much physical power or maybe doesn't have as much pop on their shots but is a brilliant tactician a brilliant technician like her technique is so good manner footwork is so good she pops that jab out the way she like she like slips that leg kick in slap you know like she's so high-level man and Raj kept trying to corner her which is like no not today no we're not staying put we're not standing in front of you she never really stood in front of her she kept moving she kept doing a lot of like just one punches I noticed the honor was in the first few rounds a little bit different than the multiple combination but I usually spear throw and I was going to yell like combination the venom like what the hell do I know then I start yelling set it up set it up you wanna you know what's interesting man the real high-level kickboxing like World Championship muy Thai and Bellator and glory and all those like high-level kickboxing event to see on television it's all three minute rounds and what she's doing is she's Kate boxing a massive footwork but she's also fighting op takedown defense which makes you more tired and she's adding an edit two minutes it's really interesting well I mean if I showed you at least all the fights that I see in which is over the last four or five whatever UFC fight if we took if we made a compile a ssin of her getting taken down yell on Eng check she pops right back up yet every single time again Gedaliah against Valerie Letourneau again everyone she has she refuses that absolutely refuses data yeah sheared mentality to my old wrestling coach I know wishes I huh at the time field and he cannot and it's hard big muscular person on your back but she just like Steve through it she's a better one to step at a time you know Murphy she plans her but she coked up and she stands up like she doesn't even look at it like a challenge she's also uh superior athlete and a big part of her athleticism and in her kickboxing is her legs she's a big part of it is her ability to move which is like a lot of plyometric type activities and also her ability to throw power like in her leg kicks and their knees and stuff like that so her base and her legs are really strong and when you take her down she's so technical with her mo tired that she becomes that technical I'm sure where they're grappling to so she's doing the right things and she's got a lot of power a lot of physical power with her legs she's explosive and fast or balanced is sick very very hard to take down and if you get her down good luck keep it uh now she's a little cat yeah she's really interesting man into full control what a came to be League you know oh my god I'm like forget her name which - Jessica and Raj yeah clowns Raj when and Raj who put her against the fence she would spend she would put her again equipment almost immediately yes like she didn't want any judge to think that she had control at all for a second here he didn't return boat she didn't have control it was really interesting because he was always dangerous though even though she had control of entourage I'm drought is still winning bombs at her yeah any one of those could shut the lights out that girl was so tough man I'm so impressed I mean I'm super impressed with your honor because I mean she's so skillful or movement was beautiful and the fact that she was able to do that for 25 minutes against a marauding challenger like that that girl just kept coming forward man she tiger she kept coming forward kicker keep coming forward I mean it's really hard for women to knock out other women in that way class especially right but I think that it would be beneficial that some of these women if Johanna was a little bit stronger to knock them out I think taking 300 of those hep hep hep hep like a little demon down hands to the Fayette plate I hear what Cormier said on his doing commentary look she should have gone to jail for she did the Carlos partha she should have gone to jail and he was laughing he was a funny dude man Cormier is fun and he's so comfortable now it's really interesting so loose his trash talk is better yeah he's a different person I've never heard you guys both on there at the same time are you guys both covering the like like what's happening yeah yeah yeah all of it is that weird for you at all your rate love it yeah yeah it's awesome and it's I like doing it with him and I like doing it with Dominick Cruz too and I want to do it Brian Stann but man it's fun it's like doing it with a friend it's like you know and plus you're both enjoying the fights together like there was one point to Daniel Cormier is a fun guy man he's really fun like he says funny shit and let him look over me in the middle if I like a crazy fighter like slappy on arm go cat tail like look at you and and they're like mounted sometimes like would he like share a moment with you like where he looks just like are you seeing what I'm seeing like holy shit you know and he hi how you doing I just I just ate I just ate yeah we just we've all just hate right before we got on board yeah but I'll just like a water please I'll have a copy as well just cream please thank you um but do he's really funny man like super funny I'm like real friendly so good it's real weird how people don't see him that way like in the public eye and I think he's been like a little stiff in some press conferences but the recent one that he did with John Jones it was hilarious hear what he said to him which he goes he goes does John he goes I don't even know if his fights going to take place if you don't get in trouble for steroids or doing cocaine a sand blasted a prostitute and I do he was hilarious what is that even mean you know to be he was hilarious he was talking over John John was frustrated he was laughs and he was all jovial it's like she's found the fun in this man yeah he seems found the fun in it is really interesting he's oh great that's another one and you quite I mean him the Diaz brothers in Yohan are like really my everything yeah DC's really really really been growing on me especially I mean it's like just so many people have him counted out again humble even in the second fight did did she won the first one and so people are like no I'm gonna get his head knocked off and yeah man you want to talk about being in there with someone dangerous like you can hear and feel the wind blow by you and Rumble miss with a punch yeah like it causes the plugin a tornado in Japan somewhere when rumbled and this is the punch here in Vega like that's just crazy but don't you think in that fight the rumble was kind of done with fighting any people about looking back I think he was trying I think it's sort of a cop-out way to look like you didn't lose twice to Cormier by saying I'm going to retire anyway it's like dude if we're going to go out like that and maybe retire before the fight no I think he wanted to just first of all I'm sure he wanted the money was real good money and I think he wanted to give it one more try but I think that as good as rumble is and I think it's physically one of the most talented guys of all time if you don't want to do it you should be doing it and clearly if you're retired afterwards is because he didn't want to do it this doesn't take anything away from his ability or who he is or should it in any way be thought of as an insult it's a decision that he's made a personal decision in life and it's his decision to make and it's just but when you make that decision it changes who you are it's not a bad thing but it does change who you are there's guys that like they're they're focused they're like a max Holloway focus and goal right now is being a champion focus and goal right now is being but he's not thinking whether or not it should be fighting anymore like he's not thinking that way and it's a personal decision one day he's going to think that way and when he does he'll step away - just like Rumble did but he probably had already decided in his head he's going to step away and you think he would have stepped away how do you one that he might have yeah he might have might've decided to go out with the Bell look he's been in a long time there's a lot of heart bite hard training sessions he said it himself I don't want you punching a head anymore I don't want to wrestle with Jews anymore and I get it man it's like you know as talented as he is he has to do what he wants to do that's what a man does and so the human does if you want to be happy and fulfilled you can't do something just because you're successful at it and so he just didn't want to do it anymore and I think it should be applauded that he had the the sense of self to do that and that he could thank you very much because dude he's one of the top contenders I'll taste it happen after you okay thank you very much that's so like at you you know I mean Daniel Daniel beat him up both times but I feel like the second time I was just so surprised he was clenching with Daniel like this is crazy I get that but are we good thank you or maybe he wanted to go out with a bang and try to take Daniel down know which would be crazy but either way man the dude had an awesome career he's had crazy highlight reel Kos that will be his forever you know like what he did to clover to share what he did to Minotauro Nogueira was yeah Ryan Bader I mean come on son Rumble Johnson put the heat on people like no other watching guts is gonna try and breathe in like flying all the way together in the world to watch a guy cry in front of his own people because some monster came at me yes but you know what that just goes to show you that in life sometimes you got to do what you want to do regardless of what everybody else thinks because here's this guy who's if not number one number two right behind the champ right so you got DC he's either number one or John Joneses and they've never fought so we don't know but if it's Rumble and John Jones did fight then we would know it rumbles number two over he's number one in terms of life it's the biggest challenge to Cormier but you know he's got to do what you got to do it's the cool thing about you know I can't lie to you to make decisions like you don't say to a guy a man oh come on fightin over moon cuz I he's like I don't want it shit I never even trained it like come on pussy scare like no I don't want to you don't have to you know and that justice Rumble was really good at it doesn't mean you have to keep doing it hey Devin yeah now he's going to go knock down airplanes by the sky what thing is vagina are you drunk and what happened to you you just fell apart you like in the middle of that riff and you lost faith in it but I can see in your face like I'm just gonna follow through with this I'm gonna leave this parrot out here yeah I think he's going to do something with football he's involved with the Rams or something like that in like the business side of it that's a rumor I heard I shouldn't be spreading rumors but anyway real good due to rumble Johnson's always been a super nice guy like that dude and get that highlight reel that he has hit kick knock out of Kevin burns I mean that's crazy knockouts man the duty knocked out the one from The Ultimate Fighter Jesus Louise's remember that oh he's a beast every time he hits somebody where their knees buckle yeah like he hits them we need electrocute their body put their whole body it's really interesting because he obviously has very good technique and he throws his body into everything very well and you know like he's obviously a really strong guy but the strength that he has the power that he has is striking is almost like you're born with that like he has all the elements to accentuate that power like he has all the technique and he has like his movement is excellent he's quick so like he's delivering these shots it's really well-timed but it's there's more than that there's there's a component that it's like a natural gift that he has for hitting really hard and it's what separates in looks like you have all these people that are like really really dangerous and then you have Rumble like he's this total different dimension of his own where you just can't get hit if you get hit you're fucked and the only guys been able to absorb it somehow is Cormier yeah it he barely was that's like like I mean that's why I love I mean for me it's really growing on me so much lately it's like her he did afford that and I hear of a crowd like not given credit for being an outstanding wrestler and barely avoiding I mean we did got his head got hit by Rumble in that first fight especially and like ill started coming down but he waited it in fought a battle of battle in the getting hit and recuperating is a huge part of it and not getting stuck in a chokehold by a wrestler is another part of it yeah you know Cormier survived his part and it surprises me that the crowded begins him I think that fight against Silva sort of heard him with the crowd because of course yes he's going to wrestle the shit out of it so what are you going to do I don't think knows it I think was all the John Jones stuff is the fact that he got the title sort of in what many people consider an illegitimate manner meaning they stripped John Jones which makes sense that they stripped him you know he violated the code of the organization and he personally a mentally fucked up made giant mistake but everybody knew that John was the baddest motherfucker on the planet when it came to 205 pounds it was one dude that dude was John Jones and the only thing that was beating John Jones did John Jones wasn't training John Jones did this press conference to the day with Daniel to a generals talk about credit shit John went deep he goes I beat you after a weekend of cocaine you know and to Michael Johnson was crying laughing he was like oh shit oh shit that's the most cold-blooded up in the world I mean the Wayans brothers you know blatantly smoking pot and beating up their opponent is one thing it's a brag about doing an entire weekend of do Jon Jones a bad motherfucker I mean nobody just does cocaine ain't that means either drinking probably hooking up with hookers or whatever I mean that seems to be how many people do cocaine I don't know how it work but is anything like that they you by yourself you know what Jon Jones could be the best of all time really could still it's only 30 years old gotta realize one way for us to know Daniel Cormier cocaine for a weed ah no no no no no no no no I cut you off I think I think Daniel in that fight was hampered by emotion and I think that John really got under skin and really talked to him and got him fired up to the point where was detrimental to him he got overcome with emotion John is good shit talker man we did an interview where as I sat in the middle and Daniel passing my right John taught to my left and dude John's ruthless he's so ruthless he put whole another part of the game racket up there with you know with boxing in jiu-jitsu but you didn't even get to see it they didn't even put part of it online the threat to the best shit but I'm explaining about shit-talking overall like what I'm saying John Jones's shit talking to Daniel Cormier the best part didn't even get online the best part is called him as pussy he was like he goes you're my pussy because Joe is going to be my pussy it was not fuck you up every time we fight it's just like he's like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what what happens he goes you know every time we fight I'll fuck you up he goes you supposed to be a big-time wrestler this is I took you down man because your Olympic wrestler I took you down he's like I beat your ass and you get Daniel was very mad I mean the two of them were it was very intense I was that face-to-face interview yeah I was in 10th you were in the middle in like a director's chair no that's how Max Kellerman does it oh you know yeah I wasn't a director's chair Max Kellerman doesn't I think better honestly because Max Kellerman does this he sort of faces the screen and the fighters face each other the side enters right into his left we had it almost like a service semicircle and so the fighters would have been better if we did it at a table to HBO did it but it was the only time we ever did it it was very very intense very intense Jon Jones is uh he's a bad motherfucker dude and like DC had this whole crew with them and Jon Jones is like I'll fuck all you up I'll fuck you up he goes don't look at me big boy I'll fuck you up like I cute I didn't scare him leave the dude to stare at them and try to give him some attitude Jon just straight up look so it was like I'll fuck you up don't look at me like that you think he's going to make it to this fight oh yeah for sure yeah for sure he's not going to fuck this up and it's what's fascinating to me is when you watch these guys John at each other when no one can see that's when you know there's no press this me a couple other people that around but a UFC employee this is real this is this is two guys trying to get under each other's skin and John was very good at it so this was after the first fight when they were supposed to fight for the second time that he got cancelled and John got stripped in the whole deal so now now they were finally going to go after it but John's only been back in the office got him one since then against open st. Preux we were so all this shit's been going down and the only time John's been in the cage since all this shit went down is the opening four since they were originally going to rematch he caught open train Peru we beat him but he felt like he was off it seemed you like gave it good being I think over ted cruz real good game and i also think he wasn't planning for ovince st. Preux we had the Hoos plan for someone else you know that was when Daniel got injured wasn't it no the Daniel get injured I don't even remember I'm not even gonna look it up how about that folks the point being that's an interesting fight man they're going to go at it again in July and now Cormier it's got all its momentum on his side Cormier beat Rumble he defended against justesen or did he beat Gustafson to win it because it was it was Rumble because for me some know Cormier be rumbled to win it that's how you got the title that's right and then he defended against Gustafson and then he defended against Rommel yeah he's about his pot filled non-tidal mentioned between that's right that's right that was a weird fight yeah that was yeah double leg takedown shoot low call it through yeah he does not a bigger man that the ref course if it one of those like if it ain't broke don't fix with anything yeah well Cormier is just such a stud Russell you ever seen his fight with Dan Anderson been a while dan Henderson who's a beast you know he's a former Olympic wrestler himself but it's not really the same size and Cormier just threw him around man I mean just threw him all over the place I think he choked them out to let me choke them unconscious but if he just manhandled them and you realized like how strong Cormier really is and how good his wrestling really is it's like super super high-level shit man that vitalizing laid the toga so with son chase Sherman and Rashad Colton Oh Mike yeah yeah good lord Rock'em Sock'em robot crazy in an octagon it was interesting because again like I don't know what you guys are saying in common carrier just far enough away where Eric and area like I noticed that the guy knotless son but his opponent Rashad their sod lashauwn just give him some random black names from an all-black neighborhood call everybody listen up he was kicking Rashad leg over and over again to where Rashad been you but yeah then he kept going for this knockout that it's up keeping attacking the leg like what do you think about that well we definitely got a little anxious and he allowed were shot to get back into it by whopping them with some haymakers but you know it's just part of what can come with experience he's a young kid I'm think he's only 24 years old 24 or 25 Sherman and if I remember correctly and he's under the tutelage of Alan Belcher and so I think he's got like real potential man he's not also done from some work in Albuquerque I think he was there with Winkeljohn the Jackson people in Albuquerque so great coaching look real good man look real good on his feet and just just it was a slobberknocker man crazy back and forth heavyweight fight but that kid can get it together like he's got real good movement real good kicks just got to make good choices like decide when to go in when to charge for when to put yourself in danger he didn't have to you could have kept doing what he was doing the students kind of incapacitated with those leg kicks yeah I was a fireworks show yeah one of those ones where was that is like a from American Top Team - who the shot now the opponent Sherman no no he's a pretty sure he was with Jackson's that American boxing had like so many lighter oh yeah right yes pretty crazy thing I'll be pretty good yeah yeah they did pretty good I mean you oughta one obviously junior got knocked out the one was called it's Rob with Eddie Albert pulled the monster doll who's American Top Team lost to Maya and as close the decision is very going to get this is a split decision and Daniel was trying to reduce yeah he was like he give the guy more credit for doing damage for the first half of the round or do you give the guy more credit for being able to control the guy and go up to submissions for the second half of the round and what is worth more it's a really good question because the monster doll Demian Maia fight like one round of it particularly like the second round is a really good like case study and judging and maybe like athletic commissions should review that fight and say hey this is a this fight is a really good example of a fight where it's really subjective like we and we have to kind of quantify what what is more important like if you get the exact same amount of time but one thing hurt the guy and one thing didn't is that a you know is that a does it go towards because he goes go towards the kickboxer or to go towards to like the one half of the round where the guy was fighting off being strangled for every second of that two and a half minutes what do you think I don't know it's an interesting argument like on one side I feel like monster doll did more damage and that that should be worth something but a second part of it like he was threatening at Moskva doll wasn't threatening at all once my got on his back you know so once my I got on his back is like Jesus man this is a this is a constrictor on top of you and you know Marvin all did defend at one time and at the end of one of the rounds got the first round I believe got Maya off his back and landed some good shots at my I was trying to take them down and control him again so he did get off some damage so arguably he could have got that round because he did a little damage in the beginning Maya took him down and defended successfully and then he did some damage at the end but you really have to like have a real conversation about what's most important this control most important or his damage most support or his threat most important because like Mars Vidal wasn't close to knocking Maya out he didn't have a like staggering around the cage but that could have come at any moment so it's like there's threat there and he's clearly hitting Maya more than Maya's hitting him so you have to assess like what's more threatening because when Maya has got you down it's got your back boy there's a really high likelihood you're getting choked but yet mom's did all figured out a way to get out of that so he should also get a little bit of credit for his great defense but more credit should be tomorrow to Maya's control and Maya's attacking and Maya's owning the position like he pretty much control the position for a good chunk of that fight when he got the back or when he got him on the ground so it's a weird conversation such as last night with the Texas State Athletic Commission some of them did these people like work with other thing people that are in Las Vegas some depends on the Commission that's a good question I think I would have to I'd have to look it up to be sure but I think some Commission's will bring in more experienced guys they'll hire people like especially with referees you see that there's referees like Herb Dean is like super experienced and you know you get like evolving it's also super experience Danberg leotta super experience and you get these guys you'll see him all over the place they'll do it it's so you ask her Dean after that Eddie Alvarez I don't know we heard yeah the answer would it be well her principal herb is like one of the most reasonable and logical guys you'll ever talk to after a fight like that he's not he's not emotional at all he's and it's one of the reasons why I think he's like the gold standard with him and Big John McCarthy in my eyes who are the best the best and you know not there's anything wrong with the other people it's a lot of great referees I think Dan Merkley oughta does great job too but herb is so like calm in there he just makes good decisions and he is not a big fan at all of God's playing that game of touching the hand down the ground and avoiding the knee he thinks it's a bullshit anything if you get hit when you're playing that game he's he's going to let it go he's like this too it's too much of a scrap like any offers of saying this is a fist fight and he's just trying to win and there's he's pulling triggers and they're in questionable moments the referees not stopping them he's not saying it's knees down the fighters down like you can't even see sometimes if you're holding on to a guy or you're in a situation where you're just a few inches from him you're not sure whether or not his hand is touching the ground but you are sure you could fuckin iam in the head a lot of times just going to go for that knee to the head really imitate that chance and I think that's what Eddie said and I think Dustin believed them too because you know Dustin stood up for him in the post fight interview he was like don't you boo this man like he's the guy who got hit with the illegal shot and he was still saying don't boo this guy so I asked her after the fight I said what did you think now go these are the old rules right so if it's the old rules and one hands down then it's illegal right he goes yes he goes but I don't feel like it was bearing weight he goes you know he's definitely playing the game and he definitely was putting his hands down but I felt like the first time it wasn't bearing weight and that's how I define it and he's like and then the second time it was a legit mistake the second time was it was definitely illegal but I felt like he was in the middle of throwing it when it all happened and I think he's correcting that so he's the guy that's closest to the action and he's going to make like the most pertinent decision I also think it's going to be a weird issue with referees that do events that have the new rules and then do events that have the old rules and it's pretty much universally agreed that the new rules are the way to go so with the touching of the hands on the mat it's going to be interesting to see if there's like an interpretation that favors the way that new rules perceive it versus the old rule so that's how her kind of rep read that fight he went with the sort of the feeling of the new rules of what people want out of the new rules but still within the confines he believes and he knows a better than me of the old rules why we're in the new rules without the protected class I don't know you know I mean I think it's probably different with it with each organization they have to make decisions and they decide themselves whether or not they I mean it might be a budget issue maybe they don't have time to review it I don't know it might be they disagree who knows man and you know these athletic commissions can make their own decisions when it comes to that but as far as like the good of the sport it would be nice if we all agreed and I think I don't think the real concern would be whether or not it's bad for the safety of the fighter I don't think it is because I think it encourages fighting more than it encourages stall techniques so if you give someone a stall technique like the ability to put your hands on the ground you won't get indeed in the face you're going to take it some guys are in some situations it's going to be a desperado move that if it's there you're going to reach for it but if it's not there you won't reach for it so like in terms of like the actual effectiveness of overall fighting and like the realism of real of fighting it's better to get it out we don't want it in there because it's I don't think it really does protect people I think the people are going to get need are going to get need I think what it does is it protects you for that brief moment but in the decision that you make to do that like you're making a purely defensive decision you're putting your hands on the mat both of them so this guy can't knee you in the face that's you know that's like not a good sign in a fight right you know you're in a bad position and sometimes you can rebound him with that position no doubt about it but it's I don't think we should reward I don't think she'd have these escape routes where someone can touch the mat and not get Billy it's like a mime based what I say you know so I think her was right ultimately but according to the relate the strict interpretation of the rules it was an illegal blow so it's interesting that he made it in no contest he can clearly get away with that in court as the way right well it's um you know it's open to interpretation I guarantee you the I haven't read anything online but I guarantee you it'll be a controversial I mean it's just a hot-button subject for people to be debating it back and forth and there's going to be people that agree with her there's going to be people to disagree with them but you know ultimately that's the toughest job next to being a fighter at MMA be the guy who has to make those calls and I give them a shit ton a respect man I used to be a baseball umpire like turn and that that was hard and like to think like man so much passion yeah like a tie and if I go to think that this side goes crazy but if I go out that's like yeah yeah so close and to think that those guys have to make those decisions with Duke health and wide that those are fathers and children and brothers and sisters and everything like that are you gay yeah knowing how many punches and whether the person's just sort of seems like they're out of it or it was still defending themselves yeah whole livelihood yeah crazy yeah it is a crazy job then it's um you have to do a lot about MMA you have to really understand what a guy's actually in trouble when you need to step in you know get this feed a bunch of guys get hit you got to know when a guy's done and it's subjective and you know you can make that calls and sometimes you make bad calls there's nothing to do about it I mean in the early days Big John McCarthy was refereeing a fight between Matt Lindland and Merlo Bustamante and Murillo Bustamante taps Matt Lindland and then lemon said they didn't tap they restarted the fight they went back at it again and then Bustamante chopped him again I laid around they tapped him twice in the same fight when it happened we were commentating I believe so and like you see him tap on the video do you remember trying to remember if I was commentating it's hard to remember it's like they all get blurry after a while I'm pretty sure I was but man I might not have been now that I think about it I'll have to go back and listen but I remember the fight clearly because I remember I remember going oh no he stood him up another gonna make him fight again I'm like that's crazy already won though he won like all you do is look at the replay and you can see Lindland tap and he said look he's if they give him another chance to fight he's going to take another chance to fight he can con his way back into a fight he's going to do it so he he said I didn't tap doesn't go back in there again in such a ballroom head was moving my hand back well the more baller moves Bustamante tapping them again they're really in any con um of the guillotine the second time but that's happened before that's happened in place before with guys that they didn't tap when they did and so because of that people have been forced to like hold submissions and you know and wait for the referee like literally separates them but that's also what got like people are super sensitive about that with knee bars over like with chokes doesn't seem to bother people as much like people don't get mad if somebody holds on to a choke me another thing I thought was really cool from my the other females like and the ladies kicks on her back oh yeah unbelievably effective coordination yeah right on the yeah trying to hyperextend those legs and so even from our angle it looked like it was really working you could see her leg bending back and she didn't want to fuck with that after a while no the beginning crowd was one crazy if it's a bigger girl drag her to the middle of the rain by her foot you know what I mean I got the crowd into it but as the fight went on she was beating the shit out of her from her back what you up eat it was very very very often again like I wish I knew what you guys were talking about over there because over there I'm like it's interesting because we're sort of watching the fight in arena you're sort of like on an island by yourself when you're not we need under the head spot on you can't hear you guys right but man you're only watching it right in front of you - you're not really seen it on the monitors very much right so it's all very like we're just trying to make sure that what you're seeing is real it's weird not hearing you guys I hear you guys everywhere else at home on the internet on a phone but you're that close to the action yeah having a fear of the bar yeah so what were you guys what was that like for you guys well I was impressed well saying they like what she's doing is like kind of next level up kicking like her Up Kicks were so good and that Aguilar was making a mistake at me right in front of her was Daniels point and then Aguilar was neither can jacked she kept getting hyperextend and Daniel's saying all the different things she could do to avoid that but I was just so impressed with Cortney Casey's Up Kicks I was like she's taking objects to the next level and I'm thinking like man I bet Up Kicks are just one of those things that if you just practice it you get really good at it I bet we haven't really seen the full potential of up kicks I bet somebody would just be so deadly that you won't even want to get close to them and they're on their back they imagine that opponent the one that just lays down it is the path well they just pretend to fall down fuck you up off their back hey I still feel like Nate Diaz was setting a trap for Conor in that I can fight those two times that's what it very well did I totally see him he was trying to make it look like that was one of their plans make it look like Conor got me on the chin like Conor overreact and then you say that didn't you say that I never was clear he may have said it in like a post press conference or something but it felt like a mouse trap to me and I don't even know I don't even know if he would admit that it even if he would because I don't think you'd want to give away his arrest right right well I think look he's has got such a giant advantage on the ground matches Nate Diaz became a killer wrestler like Nate Diaz is like you know a Kevin Randleman back of the day like shoot these power doubles and creating boots-on-the-ground ignaty is his ground game is very high-level man he's super nasty at mixing up strikes with his submissions to like what's setup that's the mission first of all the strikes on the feet he popped Conor in the jaw had him rocked and then got him on the ground it was busting him up on the ground and then Connor gave up his back trying to escape the mouth he chokes him I mean they beat him standing out well that shot Connor cook was absolutely garbage so he was just it was really her yeah yeah he was just trying to hang on it was Hank trying to hang on India's harbor remember last week but that too like tarpon yeah the guy who was oh yeah he you know he's the new striking coach for American Top Team oh really yep Wow I did not know that or the black billions I'm sorry the black billions sorry yeah he's a new strike and coach was like the man that's such an offensive thing that I just said you don't even know black going into the American Top Team of a giant they have a giant rivalry with each other the point where they had an Ultimate Fighter where the two teams faced off against each other for a whole season so my apologies to American Top Team Blackzilians got either way Tarver is a bad motherfucker remember when he knocked out Roy Jones yeah dude there anyway he said that it should be Nate Diaz going up against Boyd Mayweather could make he has beat Conor McGregor and I'm totally on that clean wavelength where it's like yeah what are we talking about here like I just want to see more of the Diaz brothers overall in anything I guess my fingers but well I agree that it definitely would still sell a shit ton of money which it's on a pay-per-views rather make a shit ton of money I mean I just don't think that Nate Diaz has the international appeal that Conor has right Nate Diaz should Nate Diaz and America's goddamn hero I don't think the UFC is totally aware of what a big star he is either I think they think he's he could be just three four five for me Aylmer burger is to Ireland yeah for Mexico well he's American bro I know we're all American but my point is like you know they need that I think I think you have to be really still leaves a huge Mexican superstar I think they've had them and I don't mean from Mexico Mexico I mean like this Mexico I won't be able to get into it and it's a big part of it well that's one of the champions one of the things people are excited about with Yair Rodriguez but it just bit off way more than he could chew last night against Frankie Edgar Frankie just mauled them like literally mauled them I think that's defense to good up well as a person who's the kicker like you you realize when you're kicking you're standing on one legs I mean you're vulnerable you're just more vulnerable to being taken down by a guy who's an Elite MMA wrestler when I say MMA wrestler I mean a guy who's used to catching kicks understands where the kicks are coming where they're coming from knows what it's happening there's no hesitation dives on it and takes you down no thank you I don't know thank you I know I'm good I'm good on everything thank you very much thank you I feel like I'm watching Frankie Edgar forever you have been I mean he beat BJ Penn for the title shit I don't know when it was but I want to say it was like two thousand eight or nine maybe that was a long time ago man they still in the heat at 145 I mean he proved with that fight that he is in the heat it looks great afterward he want didn't even look like you caught that very in the yeah it just goes to show you how good Aldo really is you know because all those already beaten them twice the thing is man I want to see Aldo vs McGregor but it's a hard sell when someone knocks you out 13 seconds it's super hard to say I got to get a second shot oh I think it goes both ways I think it makes it hard to get another shot at them and I think it makes it easy to get another shot at him because we know that's like goddamn anomaly I know we would all feel silly if they did it again and he knocked them out in eight seconds and we're like are you pocket me tell you something he could Connor could if he does that that we melt down that belt we melt down the gold into a crown and you put it on Potter's head and you say you're done go enjoy your crown done your honor you're now on Game of Thrones you're no longer a fighter the Donati amazing it'll land Westar you requested a crown yeah I don't fly for Bell city board I fight for crowns i melted myself into the crown it's a terrible accident that's I don't do it that's what the Undertaker once did you want to melt it down the WWF belt into like a championship I got neck what really really now what actually I wasn't him I was like a The Godfather it look like a pimp he was looking up you on the air WWE have the gold melted down into like a pinch necklace oh my god this way fuck you about to lares my necklace man I love the storylines like that yeah it's wrestling is so campy it's so silly it's my the thing about wrestling is don't man when you joke around about it people get super upset to be supported to oh they get that man you think it started very happy I think it goes both ways it takes so real moron to get upset about there's a lot of real morons out there though well hey you read me about one thing that it was not real and we know it's not real like that part's not surprising us but you kept saying like Game of Thrones one's real it is you're watching a play you go to see musicals and why as well be singing singing you did Daniel for me to be aggressive oh yeah I'm sure he's a silly fellow yeah but there's definitely a lot of that I mean we talked about this years ago on a podcast where I said you know I think more elements of pro wrestling in the UFC would do them justice because it just makes for entertainment instance then that you know this Irishman has become a big deal the Diaz brothers would be sub characters we're starting to to find out more about the characters and that's sort of what I meant nothing fake or anything but just the entertainment heart is a big side of the USD and it's a big side of boxing and it's a big side of all of sports and I think the UFC is like really embracing that and also having a little bit of trouble embracing it but also embracing it well I think they definitely embrace it but you also have to respect the hierarchy of championship like one that like the demanda Nunez Ronda Rousey thing when they were doing that big promo and they were only featuring Ronda Rousey I don't know whose decision that was I'm not going to criticize them they did their best they created a very interesting compelling little piece that got me fired up about the fight I got fired up about the fight when I saw that so they did a good job on it but I don't think they paid nearly enough attention to the danger that is Amanda Nunez and I think that if they showed that it would have made it even more compelling because Amanda's a fucking monster that chick hits hard she's ferocious she's nasty on the ground and she knows how to win and she's an attacker and if they just showed the highlights man to showed her beaten up Miesha Tate strangling her they showed her putting it to people man the way she did to Sarah Kaufman or not Sarah carbon ceramic man she's a beast and so they didn't even really concentrate on it and she was the champion I was like well that silly I got em all for the show best part but you're missing out on one star here you're focusing on one on your current star and missing out on an opportunity to highlight a new star and by the and that's not even that's what I'm saying is that that isn't the showbiz way to do it the showbiz way to do it is the pumpup nooner yes and to show that when like a Vince McMahon was running it I know that sounds crazy but that's what he would do it since he doesn't know who's going to win he would pump up newness instead of our honor we already know Rhonda when Rhonda beats Muniz it's like Rhonda's back you know I had heard that Vince McMahon was thinking about buying the UFC when it was for sale you know crazy that would have been if he took over he's bought all of his other competition except for boxing throughout history and handling the UFC obviously opposition but I think that I think it would have been interesting to see what he would have done is yeah sing to see if he would have let it keep building or if he would have just cut it out and disintegrated it well it's also interesting we'll see whether or not it's problematic to have a guy from the showbiz side of athletics which there's no doubt about it those pro wrestlers are fucking athletes yeah you can't look at Brock Lesnar and tell me not an athlete can look at John Cena tell me he's not an athlete the rock all those guys you're fucking stud athletes no doubt about it yeah I don't know the gay guy yeah that Marco that's the guy that yeah like when bronc muster did that 360 flip in the air and landed I was fucking ahead and still finish the match like okay that's if you like Cirque de Soleil you think those people are athletes for sure this motherfuckers a serious athlete but there's also the fact that it's entertainment so if a guy goes from that time the business and then goes to the side of the business where it's supposed to be pure sport which is the pure sport MMA right and a sport that has always had a reputation are these the whispers of being fixed you're always hearing about a fixed fight like in Japan in particular you heard about a bunch of fixed fights and it was a recent case where someone in the UFC had an offer to fix a fight but didn't go through with it but there was evidence apparently there's a big story about a couple of a couple of weeks ago about the first evidence that someone was attempting to fix a fight so even though it didn't get fixed someone had tried to put influence on someone to fix a fight allegedly but in Pride we know for a fact that happened I know - I know firsthand from people that were in six fights I know from people that were told that a fight was going to be fixed for them so it's not it's not speculation whether or not there was fights that have been fixed in the past so to have a guy like Vince McMahon come over and run things there'd have to be a very clear delineation they thought he'd have at least really good idea no really no doubt about it on our but I know that the Diaz brothers would be fighting and it would be crazy should it be Conover Nick after the Nate thing and it would be I think you're right and in things like that because if he knows that pop you know what they do is they just listen to the crowd yeah that's how they write it it's not like some thing where he's going to stick to some well sometimes he does the play every buddy needs about one guy Roman reigns because we just keeps letting him win which is like for the first time of storyline that we've never even heard of the crowd hates this guy but they keep letting him win so now we get to nothing but eat nothing but booze because we're like fuck this guy's sucks like we know you're going to let them win and make no sense but we do something with us really good but other than that guy other than that exception you listen to the crowd and then like you know I mean it's just another perfect example looking back with the Nunez Rhonda thing looking at that analogy he would have focused on the Diaz brothers any would have focused on Nate waking up and smoking a joint and going for a run like he would embrace that side of that storyline because that is the interesting part that's what everybody's saying about you know the Jon Jones Cormier thing over the that wrestler is like I did cocaine all weekend and beat you up but the Diaz brothers have been running triathlons while drinking tequila and smoking joints like it's nothing like they don't even think about that it's like how we have a cup of coffee in the morning they literally smoke a joint I read it in thing they smoke a joint before getting up and going on a 10-mile run fuck out of here it's guys they're animals and that should be embraced that should be talked about it should be part of their storyline that's what I love about them is because by the way even though I'm not a super athlete that's sort of how I live I like smoking pot I like drinking at night with my friend and I think I still can get my work done and do all that and have fun and be productive and that's sort of where I connect with those guys and why I like the style granted on the comedian it's more fitting for my lifestyle to be able to smoke pot and drink but I think that's them being able to do all that inspirational and goes to show you that you can have fun again work hard and work hard enough fun yeah they're really unusual - and that most people associate triathletes and you know endurance athletes and the like like that they you don't think of them as like slugs he says oh but you think of Nick did you think it was just bad motherfucker that also happens to run track Lee he's not like some granola-crunching I'm just street dude who knows how to fight and it meet you please thank you very much thank you it's funny because like yeah there they go both ways to where it's like yeah that's a bug-free dude who if you look at his Instagram he's Steven that's like a little bicycle outfit but Michaels aware it's like why yeah please and again we're in a fuckin bicycle helmet got out of here what he has a hilarious story about getting a brawl and one of the things people didn't know any better like something happened he was riding a bike and he wound up getting a fight with his other dude is riding a bike and a couple do at the same time it takes one dude down get somebody he loved clucks his leg up beast was nude up got back on his bike and drove off so just a fucks with them imagine that you're in a bicycle race and you're like you know what I'm mad at this guy I'm gonna start a fight with this guy hey man she want to go looking for fights you can find them there's a lot of people out there just looking for a fight I mean if I was going to look for a fight that's where I would look for a bunch of people racing right foot unit face right Boyd you clock off when you pick the fight with Nick Diaz you're likely to just do this little bicycle shorts I'm gonna beat his ass all of a sudden you're like why is my knee sideways it is ripped what a fucking what a crazy moves doing a street fight he'll hooks you tears your knee apart just thing you know and not only that I expect that so many more with those guys like yeah and they also look like street fighters that are going to punch you in the face but they're also great the high level black belt you know jiu-jitsu super yeah 100% highest degree so it's like they just become and I think that helps them that perception like psychologically like it's like you know it makes you think like fuck this Punk they're realizing that there's eloquent Beauty coming at you in the art it's just because they look one way it's almost a distraction of like it looks like a Venus flytrap how it's like already and it's like you know the office that but it's like make to made to bring you in and then it's smashed by using its natural element I think it's sort of reverse where they sort of make you think they're punk but they're not the smartest there it's a trap yeah yeah that's a good point man it's like you would think that dudes that have that kind of shit talking attitude couldn't really fight but they play real good and they're real technical and they have crazy endurance and discipline which is what's really weird about it how much discipline they have you know you would think a guy when a guy would talk a lot of shit like something motherfucker Stockton motherfucker that's not going to be a guy who run marathons and swim back and forth from Alcatraz but it is that's what's crazy Bell thanks so much is it ok if your voice is used in the background of a podcast is it ok if your voice is in the background of a podcast or recording something many people are not ok fine ass right on my man that's another you have a beautiful ass ready just a comedy podcast we do sometimes we do one on a plane on occasion thank you all right thank you what's your name again Silvia Thank You Sylvie so he's our guest for this evening ladies and gentlemen you heard it Sylvie a lovely lady with a beautiful accent they treat you nice up here in first class yeah super nice lot better than being as the dude in the back I'm going to take your spoon afters in your mouth and I'm putting in my coffee I don't give a fuck how about that dude I'm not scared of shit even put it in my mouth oh look tonight but like people will share joints you won't share a spoon what do you think you're doing bitch don't be scared really wacky and a part of their success man and another crazy thing is that is how psychologically damning the flatbed so yet the way that I think you have about it it's fucking hilarious individually and because of the bid I've gotten to think about it a lot more and sort of analyzed with a lot horn from different angles than just as I was it's an MMA fan before and really figure out what it is sort of behind it I mean not that I know more than anybody but it's sort of like the guys it's but it makes you overcharge all of it suddenly become a matador and you're the bull by poking you like that because if you punch another guy in the face that's expected and if you kick your opponent in the head that's expected but open hands slapping your opponent like makes people laugh at you and you can hear like laughter your crowd it's a different type of roar good or like that Ric Flair whoo that you hear a lot lately that little slice the pop I feel like even though you know a lot of this guys talk about tunnel vision in this map they can still hear that crowd they eat off that energy just like anybody does it alive anything you don't want to get slapped don't matter what you just don't when Randy cooked or fought Tito Ortiz he spanked them got on top when we stacked them and then he had him stacked in the spanking him and the crowd was going crazy but this expected but oh man it's ridiculous some ridiculous shit happens at fights the first time Nicky has fought Robbie Lawler I'll never forget it because I knew about Nick I knew about his fights with Jeremy Jackson who's this really talented striker that was on The Ultimate Fighter but one of getting in trouble he's in jail for something I forget what it is it might be something bad like see jail for a long time but anyway when I first saw Nick fight Robbie Lawler he got into the cage and Robbie Lawler was a phenom back then you know it's probably like he's probably 20 years old 21 years old and Nick just starts going Stockton's motherfucker starting Robbie's like what is this dude saying yeah like he's like come on bitch come on bitch come on bitch and why call it this you can see Robbie Lawler's and like I can't believe this dude is calling me bitch like I can't believe call me bitch he's like trying to get you emotional and oh he got inside Robbie's head a little bit oh yeah we got them fight on earth but they don't want to show you those blood whenever got Nick never fought Connor I know but if Nick did fight Connor kind of be in a lot of trouble next with different animal that would be a Robert I was saying that would be a really interesting fight and everybody's like Nick Diaz so much bigger I'm like look nikki has fought 155 pounds Nick Diaz can get to 170 no problem Connor fights at 170 that is the fight yeah or Nick or Nate that is the fight shamrock the pot we look I like the idea of them coming that's a good I like that did I like that market maybe look at Kimmy knuckles on that shamrock in the pot League that's strong I'm Dana White yeah they need to hire you that's a great idea would you be interested in trying to turn this ship around absolute battleship was taken out to damage I'd be a little lost Rhonda get some water damage I'd really I'm not even kidding I would love that and B I would actually enjoy it like I mean like who seven eating it we should have a meet him puts a fan of the USB and entertains it that my brain naturally Watson yeah you got to do another bike companion yeah those are so much fun I missed those never not just to do one of those so long whether they like I think a lot of guys back in back in the day it was a TV to want to be on like The Late Show with David Letterman himself yeah and I'd so literally my goal is the do you more my companion doesn't beso fun like the cool yeah they're so fun man they're the most fun learn some of that water they do go off the rails and the booze gets flowing there's just no doubt about it on both sides everybody's side it's just people get so great you know in the booth starts flowing but it's the best way to watch fights because you're not interrupting anybody it's not like you're like talking a lot of shit while you're in the arena and the other people trying to enjoy the fight you're just the comfort of your own little studio there you're talking shit with your friends and people don't have like if I did that during commentary it would be incredibly disrespectful like if I wasn't watching the fights and we were talking about UFOs or pussy or feed thanks guys like Bigfoot or whatever the fuck we're talking about you keep it up like even yesterday I did some Jay Raj like let's talk about the fight that was a crazy moment oh it was nice and one of yeah Jason Knight crazy motherfucker you're slippin choke Adam a bit on the jello to experience we just did a companion with WrestleMania via micro wrestling friends we do a pro wrestling podcast now here did a companion five and we got to do that you and I have to do all those hat because that's what we're going to do let me know when there's another big wrestling thing and you and I will do a wrestling companion yeah I'm supposed to do a soccer companion with Ian - she really needs a good sleeping no no no we're going to get high as fuck we're going to talk some shit about soccer and you're going with me - okay see Ian knows a lot about soccer oh yeah Ian Edwards the real soccer fan he does a soccer podcast with some other dude I forget who it is we having soccer speak when people think I'm here to tell you that's real spark they definitely have some fake moments in soccer I'll tell you that like when guys accidentally barely get touched in the face they fall down like they got shot there's a lot of bitch shit that goes on in soccer games I mean that I say bitch shit with all disrespect to the bitches out there I'll disrespect I'll respect rather whatever team they got like that's like demon oh that's my team bro yeah I gave them the Santeria before I told we're gonna win this shit at all costs very soon definitely not someone's retarded when they believe in demons like it's a funny thing I just have a bit about this I need to bring it back but the bit was that like you could talk about God you want and all you want and nobody freaks out but if you start talking about the devil people go Wyatt and the bit was that like George Bush can go make god bless our troops in Afghanistan and everybody goes that's that's a beautiful sentiment but if he says we've located the devil he's in Pakistan is in the mountains and we are going to knock them out of existence and evil will end on earth you'd be like what hold on wait a minute hold on the actual devil like you found the devil and you're going to go shoot him because that what you said what the fuck are you talking about you think there's a real devil like if someone was on TV they started talking about the will of God we wouldn't have a problem with it but if they started talking about the devil having influence on all the events of the world and that we have to repent and we have to realize the Christian Way is the only path like whoa people would go with the fuck are you talking about the devil like that's the one aspect of Christianity in 2017 is super touch-and-go with the populace like that's real fringe stuff which shows you like how the religion is sort of evolving in a weird way it's moving away from the most ridiculous thing to the least like the least ridiculous thing is like this universe is so big it's so infinite what is the likelihood that something far more powerful than us created it probably man who knows makes sense and would have got it's love and love that binds us together and creates everything that is life and all the building blocks of life and it's all this one infinite plan that's too complex for us to understand we can call it God okay I'll buy that I'm a smart guy I'll buy a non secular or a secular god but when you start talking about the devil like an actual devil like an actual demon that is tempting you into doing bad things like come on bitch I can't do this with you like that's too ridiculous for people today totally crazy that video that you tweeted out a couple days ago that had the entire history of the universe in ten minutes what an amazing so amazing and it's just good to show you how Billy religion is because it's like three minutes into the video for ten seconds like Jesus horns you possessed it you worship Jesus Jesus died half of ya and all the other religions too yeah but it was one small part of such a huge millions of years hundreds of thousands gaps of space in between you know what I was horrified by in that video how little I knew about what he was talking about Hattie I'm higher than money was like one oh my god who how many M happen Wow okay that's what happened like I really need to like get a comprehensive some sort of a book that'll give me like a great world history that's something T Z to pop or you know what I need to do man I need to listen to Dan Carlin more this in the hardcore history but see there's just some there's so much history I mean if you go back thousands of years like Mesopotamia to today how many different things you have to be aware of and I give an event I think about this stuff when I'm out there in Joshua Tree in the middle of the desert I just took one of those trips few weeks ago I'm looking around he's raw like sort of by myself you crazy beautiful mountain ranges that don't even look real then thinking like have you been doing all this time again like pop you know not talking to them but literally like wandering they just like everything everything is always changing it is just as like I seem new and temporary to those mountains like you watch that video of the history of the world and all of a sudden we realize move mountains it's temporary as a group of lava but it just doesn't seem temporary to us because our time frame is messed up but that all that shit needs to be underground like that causes all the molten rock from before it's the main thing that the perspective switch on every like everything is something else entirely that shit was all in there water in the ball in the mantle on the center of the earth now it's high up above yeah it's all up and like crazy I mean obviously have a decon mushroom as well having me yeah like that's what it took to get it out yeah if sometimes take something like that just to give you a new perspective on it like you've been Hawaii not yet oh you got to go I'm planning on it it just has Theo just went yeah you tell it we look at growth battle winning but the COS girl to Hawaii in the picture it's amazing there it's amazing it's it's a volcano it's a series of volcanoes in the middle of the ocean they're popping up and there's more of them that are building up around it it's like a museum that you can go to they show you the history of Hawaii how it was created and they also show you the surrounding islands and gee I guess it would be like lava vents or lava like volcanoes that are underwater right now but they're building up and eventually great the surface of the water but they've actually spot and I think I can't remember what part I think was in the South Pacific where they actually watched islands get born they saw volcanic activity and were there while islands were breaking the surface of the water like you can actually see it in some places and I'm pretty sure they have video of it you know it's basically just breaching the surface of the water but that's how an island is born and that's what Hawaii is then like once you go above that water you're probably never going back now I don't think so I mean who knows I mean maybe millions of years later it flattens out again or it becomes like Yellowstone and it blows up and the whole top pops off of it that's the nuttiest shit super volcanoes do they think that a supervolcano I'm going to say I'm trying to think of how many thousands of years ago I forget how many thousands of years ago it might have been like 60,000 years ago they think that the human race might have gotten down to as few as a few thousand people yeah but these supervolcanoes when they blow they kill enormous amounts of things people animals but we're so weak bro when we have to live in the natural world we have to try to hoof it out there with the bears and the moose and shit we don't make it man we're only do like we have been living with clothes on and with fire for so long we're such bitches they even cave people were bitches compared to animals you know you still need a cave like by figuring out caves and by figuring out fire and how to stay warm we fucked ourselves it's probably what made us martyr yeah well we when we first manipulated our environment we first figured out how to manipulate our environment there's been like a bunch of different stages of it but one different stage of it was shelter so you could be safe so the animals weren't picking off the soft ones so people didn't get as hard as they were before they had shelter they had some people that survived that maybe we wouldn't survive a few decades ago or a few generations ago or before they figured our caves so those people get to fuck and those soft bitches make more soft bitches and then they figure out weapons and then people survive even further and they you know and like they don't ever get a chance to be like if imagine if people would be people with the brains of people with the bodies of gorillas why are we probably be covered in hair and parking yeah well it's a compromise because in becoming softer and softer we become smarter and smarter right like you don't associate Elon Musk with being the most shredded barbarian on earth right no you associate him with a bin a gentleman in a nice suit a tie it was a reasonable human body right but when you think about someone who's like just a super conqueror like some Brock Lesnar type dude you don't think a brock lesnar inventing some new way to manipulate traffic in los angeles to cut down commute time from Santa Monica to LAX to three minutes going 130 miles an hour and up up and sled underground let's put it to this way I'm not taking Brock Lesnar's rocket to the moon is a perfect way to describe it it's a perfect way to describe the rocket yeah so it's like as as we become more and more civilized we all and more and more like innovative figuring out new ways to like stockpile food we just get softer and softer and softer so when something goes wrong like boom fucking volcano blows up and you lose everything and it's like it's there's no Sun anymore you can't grow food anymore you got to go find things to eat in the woods everybody dies you almost nobody left they got down a few thousand people and they say that it happens in North America every six to eight hundred thousand years they Yellowstone just follows you know they didn't even know about this until satellites when they had satellites was as soon as they start looking at images the Yellowstone region they there was a theory of if being a caldera volcano and then they confirmed it that the whole Yellowstone I guess they would call the basin the elston basin is really one giant crater from a volcano that was so big the top blows off and lava shoots like a mile out of the sky and it just blocks out everything it's like the ultimate super earth did they just have you ever seen that website on Instagram of internet page rather dr. pimple popper never seen it hilarious this chick was this chick she's a doctor but she's a dermatologist and all she does is like Lance cysts and squeeze them out you can't look away you can't look away right now I watch the videos but not like that I even followed that person yet but I thought I've got gone off on like YouTube Camden put that yeah keep pushing and just watching it sport out and like I don't know why I can't stop watching but it is interesting like whatever goes on deep in our bodies talking with doctor well she's amazing at it because she's a doctor and she has fun with it so it's hilarious but she has funny captions on her little Instagram account it's fucking hilarious dude and she has exploders she she cutting holes on people's head and squeezing out like a banana of pus and I'm not even exaggerating it's disgusting some people's bodies are just nasty they just have these like literal softballs on the side of their face and keep caught them and squeezes out all this yellow shit and blackheads inside your fist it's so nasty I'll watch it if you insist upon but the city pot get in zip get it get it said that's like what the supervolcano is to the earth it's just like this giant exploding plus of lava and it happens all the time man in terms of like the history of the earth it happens every six to eight hundred thousand years they have thousands of our thousands of earthquakes in Yellowstone every year thousands of little rumbles the comedian earthquake is the common for a live sleep you're going to do them he's a battle Bittaker the funny dude he's a good dude - yeah it's a really friendly guy one of the coolest stories like that I mean he's one of the coolest not completely mainstream famous comedians I know of and I remember working the door at the Comedy Store he's pretty famous ten years ago I got you're just white I mean I got but a black community earthquake is a monster yeah and the black community that's different my people are lame let's just face it exactly because other white people laugh at earthquake yeah in the point is like I didn't know about him until the door guy bookstore and then all of a sudden somebody's like earthquakes popping in and a pop into the Comedy Store if you don't know like we've already set lineup so you have to be like a monster like a big Chappelle comes in or find other like they're popping in something like earthquakes popping in I'm like fuck is it the earthquake of man the guy literally got that name from because like they said that when he used to perform in Atlanta he was the Quran would shake ah really what a beef he's like a black Joey Diaz sort of he's a very yeah he's a very very funny dude and you know earthquake is he's been around man he's been killing for a long time I couldn't I just there's nothing more fun than finding out a Greek you didn't know about you know what else is cool meet know me is a nice guy yeah that's nice when you run into someone like an earthquake or some other your respect I think they're really funny and the coolest fuck you yes you know or the nicest thing and that's one thing like comedians that don't have other comedian friends are always so weird to me there's no I only know a few of them but they're so weird a handful of non comedian print and I see them very rarely and it's fun I mean we have fun but I mean I really can't let it rip a comedian yeah one that's having fun is like working a lot you know I do know what you mean but I have a lot of friends in our comedians because I feel like it balances me out a little bit yeah you're like a real superhuman you have like hunting buddies pro wrestling buddy my hunting buddies of my favorite friends yeah they experience UI hunting buddies are some of my favorite small white mark yeah we love like me I'm in the John Dudley yeah ribbit yeah the rivet yeah they're really good people man my friend Adam green tree from Australia yeah yeah we had a good time up there man in Melbourne god damn that was fun Adam green trees the salt of the earth but it's like those all those guys are they've experienced like an intense form of life and adversity they're hunters and their bow hunters which is even more intense like guys like Dudley and guys like cam like Ranaut they don't have a your chip on the shoulder they'd have to prove themselves to anybody they're out there trying to do better for themselves and better at this really difficult thing I was thinking about that man because I'm wearing this shirt today to ascertain where this is a Eastman's bow hunting shirt they sent me it's a bow hunting magazine and a podcast Eastman's elevate is this podcast that I listen to and bow hunting and I was thinking about it like these people that pursue it the way this guy from the Eastman elevated podcast name's Brian Barney or the way campaigns does it or the way John Dudley does it or Adam Greentree they're like it's it's not just like they're hunters they're also like athletes like there's this is a very difficult pursuit it's not what everybody thinks it is like it's not just simple as finding an animal shooting with an arrow like getting to the position where you can shoot an animal with an arrow you have to be physically fit it's hard to do you got to get up a giant fucking hill you got to be able to get there in time you got to be a patient you got to be knowledgeable you'll be quiet you got to be stealthy you got to be skillful you got to be able to handle pressure you got to be able to handle your nerves when you're ready to make this shot on animals life with a bow and arrow there's a lot of shit going on man you got to be safe you're up in the mountains by yourself you got to be aware there's predators out there like real mountain lions bears you're running into Grizzlies the other thing in the other day how do you guys eat when you're out there bring food we bring food like balances now you bring well there's one company that I actually had the owner on my podcast goddamnit what the fuck is Chris's last name I got a I go to Google his last name now if I don't I'm going to feel mad at myself but he's got this company called green belly meals by the smell of all the good make more animals no I mean it can shit now I feel like I have to log on and find his name we all have it on this anyway I forget his last name I apologize dude you're a good guy I don't mean to dis you by forgetting your name you wrote a book too on the Appalachian Trail I just had a mom such a fuckin space cadet the problem is in the morning tell me if you feel like this when you have to get up early in the morning and like take a flight my brain literally works on like 30% of its capacity it works build like we have I'm gonna find him on my little podcast list here or you got them in here yeah no I'm just fuckin stupid dude yeah member when I put him grumble Johnson knocked airplanes out of experience yeah oh okay Chris cage that's his name sorry Chris yeah it happens you fuck up but my point being he makes this makes these meal bars called green belly meal bars and they're super dense you have one packet it's 1/3 of your nutritional requirements really heavy in calories and like you want to take stuff like that stuff that's dense like people take a lot of almond butter and peanut butter like healthy fats there's a company that I really like called fat fudge they make this woman she makes Mary she makes these little packets and they're like paleo fudge got MCT oil in it and raw cocoa it's really good for you again like real healthy fats you want to take things like real calorie dense cheese is good like salami is good some people like to take candy bars they like like some simple sugar like they're really crashing to pick them back up but the demands are like pretty extreme and the demands of on your body and I think that's one things people underestimate when you're going like 12,000 feet elevation 13,000 feet elevation the air is super thin you're carrying a pack if you have a rifle the rifles heavy you're in you're hiking and you're going up these steep steep hills and you're doing it for many many miles to try to get into position where the animals are and if your bow hunting you know you you've got to do that and then you have to draw your bow back steady yourself and execute a shot when you're holding your both it gets difficult you're holding it freehand the rightfully should rest on something you know you can rest it on a log and all you have to do is just squeeze slowly and evenly and pull the trigger I use all the cheat code when Grand Theft Auto I'm not even my way through the missions on that I did who do you do stand up and stand up is one of the hardest things for your brain that you could do as far as like dealing with pressure this is coming from someone who's you know I know you wrestled in high school so you had some one-on-one competition that was nerve-racking when you were young and you know and I did a little bit of wrestling in high school and I fought in martial arts tournaments for a long time and all those things are scary and nerve-wracking and but comedy is almost a scary at least was like doing it the first time I was so scared the first time I did it and you do that and it never and when you push yourself I mean you know what I mean like we do it never ends I mean there's like probably tonight when the lineup ends up falling how it falls I'm going to be my wife 15 right I'm to whatever ends up happening I'm going to be it is like last week you know last week I remember I had my best Tuesday spot in my life and it was like you know 11 p.m. or something like that Kevin Hart Hopson does an hour I end up judging growth battle he popped here injured an hour an hour hop in which is a devastating blow that means that everybody including myself is going on an hour later plus the audience's drained extra training from watching one person do an hour when the rest of the show was fundamentally cut a perfect team then it's that alone makes it a drag like it that's interesting I didn't know guys were doing that now I didn't know they're allowing guys to do a whole hour where they not been having hard comment weird you know I really shouldn't do that though I have fucks with a lot if it's a regular night was it a regular was Tuesdays I would you said yeah yeah that's that's not really that cool because like it's cool that he comes in that's for sure cool but a whole hour well that's like part of it worth Tommy people about Tommy was in the same back in the day because he would literally go don't thank him what are you crazy thing you can do to them an hour here Mitzi's o'clock you know he went up with that shit I think he's probably the only one that would talk to people like that Jews I'm going to pee so we're going to pause this I know folks I never pee during podcast but I've been drinking a lot of water I'm trying to hydrate myself more it's right now it's a problem so we were right back all right we're back ladies and gentlemen you know what technology where they really been slacking is in the innovation of making airline bathrooms not smell like poo yeah it only smells like the - specifically to their because someone's pooped it into a hole in the ground and it's not even really a toilet bowl it's not wishy-washy water you're plopping a log right down on aluminum siding it's like if you were doing like like it's like the koala daycare things where you pull the table down oh yeah eating breakfast stuff that's what careful people love pooping on flights by the way it's like it's like little get nervous it's people get nervous they have to poo there's people like you know the seatbelt sign goes off and a guy just goes and takes a dump like report fun to make as a broker 3506 if you get

shout out shout outs are lesbians it's amazing that that's like that people are so jealous that we don't like a girl like dick as you should like a girl like dick because this isn't that like like you want but no really you really what you want is her to like your dick right no other days don't want to just like dick in general those girls are problematic yeah but it's it's commonly understood that all guys love sex like all guys love pussy oh yeah but you're only supposed to love like one kind of girl or one girl but guys it's testing whereas girls it's thought of like to be virtuous like one day maybe you try one out you don't like it anymore you get a new one but what ones it can't just look good because there's too many people as it is yeah you got a lot there do you know how bad people must have loved dick Baskin people died in like all the time like nobody lived and when there was nothing else going on there's nothing to do other than this one fun ticket that's the other front of your body and no one would tell you that you're not supposed to fuck there was one new in a language yet yeah it was just fuck yeah but it's fucked and you watched your friend get eaten by Jaguars in front of you yeah we made babies together human intense a baby must have been before they knew language as you you're smart and you have a do you think here's the question like how smart were humans or like modern humans when they came up with the first noises that meant things like the chimps do that now do you think do you think they have noises for shit like they must right like certain noises for stuff I think it all comes back to like animalistic stuff right for like it yeah I pointed something oh yeah and then like you hear that noise it's like oh that always means make I'm sure I'm almost positive I read something like that that they they did that with certain monkeys they had certain sounds they interpreted after a while like they do this sound always when an eagle's nearby have you ever seen those harpy eagles in Venezuela you know what that is some monkey Neagle bro a monkey a monkey eatin eagle i'd love to eat monkeys in Etobicoke yes they do one of the things they found about some of the early humans when they found fossil skulls and shed they found that the inside of skull had been scraped which there was like some speculation that maybe it was tools and sometimes they looked at the scraping on this one looks like a Raptors claw they think it was people that had got killed by Eagles like that early human beings were prey to larger Birds yeah particularly is one in New Zealand that they know existed you know so there's all this speculation about like how many different birds existed and you know we have like a pretty good fossil record of really big Eagles and these things called terror birds at a people and shit like that but they think back when were like smaller monkey like things that we probably got jacked by Eagles man especially there was a hot eagle that lived in New Zealand alongside people for sure because I think they made it extinct just thousands of years ago at 14,000 years ago or something I might be wrong about the number but it was a huge eagle that had like a 10 foot 11 foot wingspan and they ate people if birds could talk if birds could talk they would just take shit over Oh God it birds somehow like learned how to talk today do a big yeah they would just take everything over fuck your computer mine now yeah we have guns you have instead of gun their bird the guns change everything depakote nada you're in one of those tanks with a slot and you got the machine gun out there and just blabbing about this guy like a gun only has one barrel the birds can attack from multiple angles at one yeah that's true we stick to the attack but you hide in a tank you shoot him out as God they don't play that they don't know help stay above and they'll let you run out of your artillery if they were burning up to talk but maybe smart enough to let you run out of bullets right like what have that hands along with the wings and they know graduating climb out of the tank it's me talking bird it would do what they do with like goats how Eagles grab goats and they throw them off cliffs yeah that's cold-blooded shit natalie is they dragged them off cliffs throw them to their death like they know what they're doing it means it's a ruthless animal man it's a fascinating animal so they think that those things preyed on people like early humans they found these skulls the inside of them all scraped out very cool dog there's something about birds man they're just so they don't give a fuck about you like if you look at a dog or even a cat a cat at least purrs and looks at you and like likes that you petting it there's like an interaction between you and the cat right hey gravity affects us we're on the same level and you look in the eagle's eye you know what and why am i keeping you alive right crazy cunt but they're looking at us yeah exactly they're looking at us like why do you guys just stay on this floor why don't you go how do you get flap your arms you fucking idiot and you guys can't move around you just down here like pray right you just sit here on this level think about what an eagle can do it swoops down and scoops a fish out of a fucking River a big one it carries it away grabs a fish you know fucking strong you have to be to grab a salmon with your hands those talons that sink into it it just carries it off flying that that sensation oh my god what a ruthless bird it's kind of nuts that's our national bird - somebody didn't want it to be was Ben Franklin I think thought it was like a punk ass burger though he had like recent court I read it by really whiny has an eagle whiny camera with him John Adams with Jefferson one of those weird old guys but like they're like Huck the eagle I could easily fuck the eagle yeah okay gangster but it's like they're all so oh I wish I could remember what it was like he didn't like like how they like squawk but he told him like squad dear son you know I need that rocky bird and he really should it be an eagle that were America looks for really looks truly the most truly our Eagle is a pretty badass word of grass bird rather well there's no shirt we should be a puppy yeah so sneaky we don't have to be some killer murderous thing I can't be something to executive fucks you out yes but with the YouTube system like a snapchat filter as we are one of those puppies with cartoon one little dog here yeah we'll have instead of having like a mascot that's an actual animal we'll have a fake one like a like a team like teams have a gopher that wears a tie test Olivia did you call its football team yeah yeah exactly we'd be a mascot you know I mean the whole idea of having a mascot is count crazy isn't it yeah a national animal if a were evil murdered Google's colors don't run bro yeah the whole thing is weird like we have a bird wait we're a bird wherever okay and Russia's a bear I get world Bull we're fucked I have news for you bears and eagles also I can put my money on the bear all day long yeah alright that's a lot of good that's not a good deal there sure the limit the other countries look at us like we're morons for that like this Afghanistan here that we have like represent this eagle and they're just like what are they do don't think that other countries have an animal to I think other century some people just like there they don't even there's anything there comprehending of our silly shit that we do Oh murder cognac America do you know the Mississippi State Flag still has Confederate flag on the axe I wanted to learn with it last night when the guy from Jackson Mississippi within the two white trash guys caught the white trash guys you know who I'm talking about they literally like to own it first of all how dare you pick a man Jason Knight in Chad Kelly did you pick him but the guy from Jackson Mississippi his whole family was in the audience her family and friends and they were all wearing the same shirt yeah and I just thought it was the Confederate flag I didn't realize that it was the Mississippi State Flag and they were going fucking crazy like they were the craziest patch of people in the whole arena last night literally they had a whole section that was insane and I ended up staying to the sound guy who I was sitting next to I'm like look at these crazy people they have the Confederate flag on their shirt and he's like oh no that's just the Mississippi State Flag and I'm like oh wow I didn't know that I'm a complete idiot I thought they were just going to look in the barn across and Victory up there like they seemed like they were the party do you think that people know that Mississippi has a confederate flag their state flag I didn't know no how many people do think like outside of Mississippi or even were that I would probably guess if you and I don't know then I would guess somewhere in like the 10% I would say 3 to 5 percent I think 10 percent is very giving Wow how they not know that people right now are screaming you're idiots everybody knows if you know that then I'm guessing you live in one of the community with one interlocking stayed away from Mississippi if you know or you're one of those people that really got into the Confederate flags origins when they pulled it off the General Lee or you memorize overall just state flags in which cake whoa this is one of your hobbies were out of control but when they pulled that state flag or they pull the Confederate flag rather off the generally they pull generally up if they don't have the Dukes of Hazzard on TV land anymore because of that flag yeah sound fascinating man like for years and years and years and and I'm not saying I'm not against the idea of pulling the show I understand the sentiment behind it that it in their eyes that's a racist symbol but it's just vamping to me just purely from like just an observers point of view like oh look at how the culture is shifting like we used to be able to have this on TV and no one said a word about it it was on the roof of a car that was on television and the car was arguably one of the big stars of the show because like you got Catherine Bach it's hot as fuck you got the daisy dukes you got this work yeah and then you got a Bo and Luke Duke right there the stars and then you get the fucking car man what was the cops name well there was Rosco Pete Coltrane Boss Hogg and Rosco P Coltrane right that's all I really yeah Ross Boss Hogg and Rosco was a sheriff right again I didn't know who's the sheriff will he was the mayor mayor Boss Hogg right wasn't he there's a sheriff Rosco Coltrane I sorta don't remember and then it was Cletus who was in love with Daisy Duke remember when they made the movie with Johnny Knoxville and ethicist and of course I don't remember that nobody could I don't remember that I literally don't remember that that movie was so bad I got the TV show canceled did Jessica Simpson was hot as the Sun at one point in time at one point now leaflet uh why I'm on it don't Homer Simpson might be the greatest character in the history of television really probably because because he's so kart it was right out there with Cartman a carbon might be as well yeah like they're almost like with a homer he's like the ultimate buffoon and and he's immortal like and you do anything to him you know they both are it's interesting him in Hartman both don't age and yeah sort of troublemakers very stubborn it's very much the American Way anyway imagine man imagine if Homer Simpson adopted Cartman like that's a movie yeah yeah Wow yeah another one Homer Simpson a goth party thank you gays look two totally different styles but you know it's like you get your king of the hill style of a animated comedy you've got efforts for families coming out soon some season two I but that's going to be killer as a funny show man that's a really funny show in a really watch comedy shows when looking forward to the return of house cards and the return of Game of Thrones that other piece so I've watched efforts for family it's legitimately funny dude it's a legitimately funny show but yeah I'm looking forward to that I gave up on Game of Thrones I mean not Game of Thrones Walking Dead so when I gave up a Walking Dead I created some space that house of cards felt so much better about myself I can't deal with zombies anymore I'm tired of numbers I'm with you buddy I'm gonna do zombies are dead to me literally just after miles like okay this isn't this can't go anywhere when does civilization rebuild Wendy dummies kill all the zombies what are these um bees eating how they staying alive how they here for so long are you just how come in on two skeletons now they stop rotting they rot for years other just rot for years how about fuck you yeah really not making any sense anymore yeah it should all be dead it should be gone I never got into the lock they violate physics yeah they violate nature it's not just that it's a zombie it just it doesn't rot away photography doesn't rot away it's dead like come on you told me it's dead right so how come it doesn't like in the beginning of the show like at the beginning seasons they had like more shit going on you know like remember when they had to blow up that building that had the anti zombie shit in it where they created the zombie in the first place it was a guy and his wife turned the whole deal that was that was walking dead right I don't remember in the beginning it was just better it was just it seemed like it was interesting and after a while you're like oh I get it it's always going to suck up to your life always going to suck it sucks hear that it's going to suck there and then this guy's going to get killed with a baseball bat and this person is going to turn into a zombie you're gonna have to watch this person get torn apart okay I get it you're just fucking with me doesn't really mean while the game of thrones guys were taking literally just blowing our minds yeah and as is house of cards yeah Alfred Hart paid me because they were I feel like they were really giving up and even though it's obviously fiction I feel like they're giving us a real window on sort of how stuff does work in a weird way even though it's again it's fiction like did they just show you how people communicate with one another to get what they want they show you what politics is how you can use that in your everyday life but now it's just that business you know they are in the business of like being shady to one another that's what it is a weird feel crazy very bizarre industry almost all gossip drama and lying the people and knowing keep up favors yeah bipartisan politics all that stuff that we see on a daily basis in the real world it's just like they're doing a fictional account of it and what I really exaggerated it is I was gonna say you can tell that they're doing their research yeah you can tell that a lot of that is real and I mean they definitely push right the players around it is pushing people on yeah yeah but they're definitely cozy colluding with you know the crap and leaking things and trading favors and I think it's a lot of why shit so goddamn stagnant if the Republicans or the Democrats tend favors and the Democrats or the Republicans in favor but what the fuck are we doing yeah yeah it's all weird but uh it's a system that's been around for a long time and it just never been exposed in a drama the way it's been on this show in this show like they go so deep within obviously the bunch of crazy shit murders all the studies shed look but who knows man we look at some of the stuff that the Clintons were accused of and some other presidents are accused of you look at the Kennedy assassination with little fuck knows what's really going on behind the scenes of these people they definitely are colluding on some things you know they're definitely talking and coordinating things and they're strategizing and they definitely have plans it's just what what extent is it really going you know another great show that I can't wait for come I don't know when it comes back stranger things on Netflix to watch that season I just watched episode 1 I'm not really in the like alien how dare you like Pro Wrestling and not like aliens you son of a bitch really different thing you yeah one of our wrestling's I uh are you telling me you not into seeing this new Ripley Scott alien movie that's coming out Ripley Ridley Scott rather the dribbly Scott I saw that let's leave you for that the other night I do want to you know good lord that looks good these is what they can do now with special effects make things way more terrifying that has always been my favorite science fiction franchise I mean it was a couple of them there were a little air yeah but I'm a giant fan of that that creature what do they call the Gina form xenomorph xenomorph nobody call I thought it was probably alien that was a lunch I think they called it a xenomorph I forgot maybe I'm making that up but I think that's what it is but it's that that creatures just the most terrifying alien ever just as vicious insect like thing that grows to full size in like a few days that's totally possible to man is totally possible we would have to get some food though that's the only thing that I didn't like about that like how's it growing without food yeah it has to be eating those people okay but how many people does it eat to get to be 700 pounds or whatever it was yeah seems like it would have to eat 700 pounds of the people to even get in the ballpark of 700 pounds yeah where did it come on its own ship it came to the dudes chest remember [Music] yeah we grabbed the whole of his face that it makes it suck its little alien dick and it comes in its stomach and it makes a person inside your body and it blows out your chest remember that yeah coming back the face grabs it with his hand and then literally like an alien tentacle dick thing comes out of the palm and just mouth fucks you it's a great a a great animal I guess far as like something that someone created to terrify you it's an amazing being you know I mean that's why I think it's the best alien science fiction creation and also it's HR Giger's like design so his design was so freaky and dark and twisted like it was a was like the creature of the Black Lagoon meets like the wiring of the Millennium Falcon it's almost like a like semi mechanical looking an insect-like but also like kinetic it looks like it has muscles and looks just like you would just rip you apart man it was terrifying letting giant head of it Gary shut up the fact that it's blood of man at an acid I mean come on so I'm not that animal that thing that alien being is the coolest creation I think in all of science fiction and it's this is mixed with this week man this Friday Mike dork is on full point right now full sci-fi dork we need see movies you actually go to the movie theater like a normal human being ever what are you talking about you go to look blinding your Joe Rogan Lee I mean I don't know how that works I'm right next to you want a normal plane I go to normal restaurants with you I do share with you all again to the normal claims oh when I'm by myself I'm not flying this dodo plane it's still plane oh yeah no I'd say the movie theater like everybody else man so like you're gonna get the alien there's like a friend or are you you want to go on a date and so you're doing you beat around the bush mysteriously again he's going fucking movies man we're in the movie what do you mean you go to the movies like buy a ticket the money so no with a friend he's crazy I wouldn't go by myself that's a little rough that's like that's weird - umpire sell people would like stereo hey man Joe Rogan's got no friends like hey I got friends just no one was no one's available right now okay this is this time is convenient for me I'm a big alien yeah it's like watching a movie at home by yourself totally normal going to the movies by yourself ooh I've done that before on the road though and it's off and you actually get to enjoy the movie yeah people going to movie with people can only be a distraction I think I've only gone to the movies by myself man make less than maybe six times ever my whole life is there good trip I live right next to a Tarantino movie theater Oh wailing really cool movies they're like they just had the 25th anniversary of rental Boyer dogs this past month and they played it every night at midnight for like two weeks and that was my point oh yeah I don't mind going and checking out a movie by myself at all what I ate is going with someone that like has a fucking bag of candy but they keep digging into and shit or crunch crunch or I know it's like a cheesy subject but how popcorn became the movie theater food makes zero sense it's one of the smelliest dudes it's one of the weirdest sounding food makes people dig in it's too much it makes them at pain there's like I miss the laundry list of complaints enough yeah it's definitely not a quiet food and it's really yeah and when you get in a bag that's the worst someone's ruffle in their bag around or plastic anything in plastic we got to dig into the plastic crackle crackle crackle all these bags to release Kiki's bag they make it so that you break it open trying to open it the police's keep you apply everywhere no they know I mean you have to buy single factory that's the dumbest conspiracy ever these are pieces we call the 50 greatest pieces he raises pieces it's not it's not reaching species it's it's Reese's Pieces see this is one of the great conundrum it's like the berenstain bears yeah okay it's confusing if you think it's one thing but it's really another thing okay well whatever peanut butter cup Reese's Reese's peanut butter cups yeah REE se grease Reese's yeah yeah I think it's maybe an Ohio thing definitely always because I feel like maybe well people get used to train shit wrong like in Texas they say especially that's a big thing that people say instead of especially especially yeah yeah I don't know it's like the X in there it'll say well y'all is especially need to worry about that especially it's a beautiful accident Texas people are truly a disability that might be my favorite act they're just so cool even when I disagree with someone from Texas like one time one time a cop tried to arrest me and my buddy Matt it'll Whataburger is like eight years ago and we didn't know why he wanted he's like you guys need to get out of this little better it was like 3:00 a.m. it was our first time in a water burger ever we had just placed their order I just handed though the cashier five dollar bill I'll never forget it and a sheriff comes over my shoulder and he goes you and your friend need to get out of here I'm like really what cut to our other buddy other comedian gets in trouble for defending us it's like you can't kick my friends oh no first triple a water burger why are you taking them out of here in the cops like don't worry about it in cut to the next day our buddy winded up spending a little bit of time in jail that night depending on me and my other little la friends got the leaf the water burger but our buddy from Texas got in trouble our buddy from Texas the next day has his friend who's the chief of police on speakerphone and we're sitting in the car traveling back to California and he's like so what happened now what happened buddy you know and the chief of police literally goes yeah the cop told me that you were defending your friends it appears the villa according to this officer a couple of faggots were five metal Whataburger or something like that and me and my buddy were obviously a couple of faggots in this story we start dying of laughter I mean dying of laughter holy fire with that said the guy with this Texas accent you could tell he's wearing like a cowboy hat cheapo police a couple of faggots god-metal Whataburger and me and my buddy wherever like a play argument at the time like you know about whatever it was we weren't obviously we weren't fighting he's me and Matty Gert grabbed a California kid like that's hilarious ah the water thank you dude that's hilarious so the cop was just being homophobic totally you know so we you guys joking around about stuff yeah we were literally having some like a fight about like like if it's like a play argument I can't remember who knows what you know literally a couple la comedians excited to be on the road probably opening for free for we were working laughs that is so funny so you're just basically being comedians and being loud absolutely they decided you were two gay guys in the middle of a spat yeah Wow yeah well there's definitely that in Texas too like in the south in general like I had some friends that move to Nashville from LA love - I do - but they had this idea that they were going to you know they're going to be in Nashville and Nashville is all open mind and artists and she said like right around like the third or fourth time I heard the word nigger I was like oh okay this is like there's some outlying areas that you're in a Walmart an hour away from Nashville and you hear that kind of talk and you're like okay I'm still in Tennessee yeah you know whoo but at least they don't have a confederate flag yeah and their t-shirt Jesus Christ but I mean like the way that that cop called us a couple yeah you know double faggots like I believe that Wow convinced me I guess I'm an actress I'm a faggot in California I'm Tony I wonder if that's like where you were you were in Houston right during that yeah what I was like eight or nine years ago that was in Corpus Christi okay I don't think that would happen in Austin now yeah yeah Austin has got a more progressive yeah Austin is a total livable place yeah like it would be a nice place to live you and enjoyed there when we do shows there man barely particularly epic shows oh my god yeah cap city yeah man yeah cap city's amazing Austin City Limits that theater there that's amazing yeah it's a special place man in my eyes Texas is a it's a different spot it's like it's more rowdy in a lot of places in the country but it's also friendly yep it's got a lot of like good qualities like a happy a lightness to it yeah it's like they greet you at the front of the store when you walk in but they also make sure you're not feeling ya know it's like yeah it's just a little more extreme on both levels yeah but then there's like so much space to like what you're talking about is just the cities and what's interesting is the cities are just a small percentage of this monstrous landmass that's known as Texas you don't realize how big it is they have to drive through it you're like oh my god yeah things like a.j yeah it's huge it's an enormous state great place it's crazy all states have different fields man they really do like a show in Albany is just going to be different than a show in Dallas it's just going to be different it just is going to be diabolically worse Albany New York oh my god no yeah you didn't enjoy it up there huh never again what do you think it is you think it's just like a lack of opportunity up there whether it's not so good people feel trapped yep keep going all your hundred-percent right Burkhardt you could go on and on the why is the real that's the only think though that it up in Albany well they got stuck there they were there from another time you know their parents were there their parents parents but don't you think that like in Samaria such a nice kind of those might be 35 minutes remaining and I was always shit this is outside with a furniture piece so CJ the next few minutes duration identities overhead or secured ability its revenue remaining service I talk to these centers looking at apply my language she know she's on the show yeah except I didn't even know the

savage yeah oh God you have to learn how to fight I love it I'm gonna have to learn that it satisfy a woman an actual woman alright ladies and gentlemen um so one thing that did happen this week ever laughs how to cancel something came up so he won't be on this week and he'll he'll have to reschedule he's a busy man but he's got his a new new project war porn industries which is great shit you can catch it on YouTube check some of the videos he's played actually no I don't know if you can get it on YouTube I've seen it on Instagram though but I think they're trying to figure out how to distribute or how you can get it but they're doing that that's an independent project you know I like I like that music is kind of going along the same ways that stand-up is going you know they're doing their own shit and they're trying to do things independently I had a Shirley Manson on the other day from garbage and she's kind of breaking down the music business and what it's like and how difficult it is to make money as a band today and how now music companies they take everything they take a piece of merchandise to take a piece of your live touring they take a percentage of everything everything you do across the board so they do these deals of these artists or when they distribute their music they essentially own a chunk of them and they give at the end of those it's very weird how did it go on and stand up who's doing around stand up this is weird company you know I can be whenever like comedy dynamic who does that a lot of our friends they make a lot of our friends what do they do they distribute but what's weird is that they sell it which they don't really sell it but you need to have some of these big company you need to have like this looks bureaucratic bullshit you'll ever hear in your life you would never put up with it like you probably get the vibe that because here obviously at the top of the game but I'm like what do you make a deal where they don't own their specials that we were saying where we first of all don't think they own it forever second of all I don't think they own the entire thing but these companies take twenty thirty percent of your special for absolutely zero reason especially you already have to give what ten percent to your manager and then that bubble of ah well I know there was a broadcast production company that David Taylor and our Sapir had a real problem with because they were pitching a television show and they created a television show they wanted someone to help them try to sell it like we set something up and these people apparently wanted a ridiculous amount of money like 40% of the show and they're like whoa whoa whoa there's a hundred percent and there's two of us and you get 40 are you fucking crazy they wanted more than a third to just come in and just sort of like help them negotiate a deal with their products I didn't create it and sculpt it they didn't they didn't you know didn't think it through and do all the work on it so people get real squirrely when it comes to those kind of weird deals where you're not a content creator but you're instead some company right and there's somebody else that creates the content what's beautiful now it's like guys like you or me or all these people to do podcast you're all of a sudden your own content creator and you could you don't have to be it you don't have to have all these fucking people in your ear you don't have to have everybody giving you their own I'm a pinion and like special man yeah happy iPhone that's great I think about a show like have you ever done like Colbert or one of those shows you ever done one of those when you do do those one thing that you do realize by the way you drank both my water it's a son of a bitch I had one you had one now you have one right here when you when you watch those shows you see how many people are working behind the scenes like wait a minute hold on like that's one thing that I noticed when I did that dudes which was named Bill Russell I cut the podcast guy I did is HBO show almost like Jesus Christ we're just hits him and me sitting down having a conversation and there's a curl rule of people here like this is essentially like an over staff podcast no doubt no doubt and because of that it all gets like weird for weird yeah when I made the TV shows man with I wrote you know major Comedy Central show and the thing that shocked me the entire time and I don't mean slight shock I mean sure shocked with the amazing weight of money they have they're just throwing money away why do you think that is they don't know any better or the editing stay on their own and old Hollywood system right when they were coming up they were trained that way it's like a comedians all were still only focused on getting five minutes on The Tonight Show that's how I feel like some of those executives state instead of being like what's next right this Nets like thing we'll never have to worry about that I remember one exact literally saying I'm not kidding you in 2011 we don't have to worry about them you don't have to worry about the internet people always come back to TV it's priceless they will always come back and I remember literally thinking I don't know that's like watching this well it made sense up into the point where you could watch the internet on your TV and then all games rock well yeah but then he was also yeah but he wasn't saying it like that he was saying like they're always going to need TV channels like he was saying like yeah well there's always people like that man I mean there's people that tell you how to do clean comedy there's people to tell you how to do this you have to do that right and they convince themselves and then all the sudden they can't even see the light well you remember that girl you were dating that was telling you that you had to do dark comedy you should be all dark Jackson people get shit advice all the time we just do it's a it's a real common thing man and I don't sometimes I wonder if they're trying to sabotage you but you sometimes I hear people's really shitty advice Mike do you really believe this or you subconsciously want to sabotage this person are you like not making sense but you're pushing it pretending you're making sense like what's really going on here just like your own internal turmoil bubbling to the surface right having a lot of people I think a lot of people want to be given advice from people they think are smart sometimes go give those people bad advice not realizing that we know it's that advice hoping that we give them good advice that makes them yes maybe like that you'll correct them and give them good advice I understand some people also yeah evil maniacs and they think that they're right all the time yeah it's super hard to just step outside of yourself and look at your own opinions look at someone else's opinion to go who who's right here is you automatically want to think you're right so you start out from the position that you're right and because we get attached to ideas and the ideas sort of become a part of you they define you they're not just an idea it's you and your idea all connected and that that's a real problem that a lot of people have with thinking I've had it myself and something that I've had to work really hard to push away to knock out you know thinking and learning how to think is like one of the weirdest things because it's one of the most important parts of life but it's one of the few things that we discussed here in school like when you're in school you're learning information but are you learning how to think are you learning how to be objective are you learning how to look at yourself and look at your actions and how you treat others how you treat yourself and what distractions you're throwing up in your life in order to deal with your you know like especially if you're not getting things done if you're procrastinating you're putting things off if you have any addictions or things along those lines start creating all these problems in your life to distract yourself with and they don't teach you about that in school it's really interesting it's really interesting and they don't put you a lot of shit which is really interesting it was just thinking about this last night well I was smoking weed before going to bed and I was thinking somebody gave me a dirty look those blatantly just smoking and joking like it was a cigarette in front of it it's now I don't give a fuck right and but somebody gave me a look like a might not well Texas they do that I know California nobody gives a shit that's why you're used to doing it if you're hanging out at the Comedy Store outside some of the parts to join up it's super normal yeah so what's crazy is it like if I was if I took out a pill bottle and put a pill in my hand and popped it in my mouth nobody even goes what's that you know I think they do give me anything oh I do let's see somebody take a pill man what's going on dude tripping let me go hoodie up to you man Ranger if I see a dot do pop a pill we make eye contact I very well might say what's the pill man I'm nosy meanwhile is funny people get judgy about joy ree-ally but it'll have a drink right in front of you right yeah and an antidepressant and and a painkiller and an anti-anxiety medicine but don't give you a funny look for smoking to join self-medicating after meditating you know what I need yeah but the joint the problem is maybe you email him other people have to smell it and some people think about like secondhand smoke they think you're in some your way you're making them smell this thing that you're doing you see I'm saying yeah I get yeah like some of the big stinky Cigar they're sitting right next to the bar you but Jesus this guy's stinky a cigar or cigarette did you smoke cigarettes oh you don't realize how vile they are but when someone else doesn't smoke cigarettes melted like like I had to be with Stanhope we were in a closed room we were talking about something then he just sparks up we're in a Comedy Store bar the little comedian's bar I have to stand outside awake did you smoke three cigarettes in five minutes I got to go outside there's no air left in this room yeah which is all cigarette smoke you know you can think about it because super normal I love it how much do you smoke now I'm coming back a little bit pakad a little bit left look a lot we're getting there I really am from work I just got some uh I just got this DVD set that supposed to like hypnotize the magic out of it what's the make you realize with like a terrible person to artist movie well you're not a terrible person you just being silly yeah tortured is like I know that it's bad it's an interesting feeling though I've smoked one of your cigarettes before it gives you like a little head rush look it's good to do right before a show yeah I mean I don't think you should do it because if you do it you'll get addicted and you'll smoke a lot of them but if you're the type of person that could smoke one cigarette and then go do something I think it has a been kind of proven that nicotine you actually wouldn't have to smoke just take nicotine gum but that nicotine has a cognitive benefit but it's actually like a nootropic yeah can't imagine writing or performing without it not really that part fear wow that's crazy I can go without anything else but that's that part that's crazy they started on it you know it sucks where I'm from in Youngstown I'm not making lazy excuses but where I'm from tons of people smoke everybody smoked in my parents smoked and they both quit now but when I was growing up it was like my I thought my dad was cool as hell this cool Italian guy what up tone and he light up a cigarette all cool like a real Italian guy with his Zippo and the maracas marlboro lights and he looked cool in it and my favorite movie was Goodfellas my whole life and everybody makes smoking look cool on that real weirdo Robert De Niro Joe Pesci everybody fucking smoking his Ellen cigarette eatin pot taking the lobster out of the ice everything looks better in that movie it is crazy that cigarettes are thought of as a cool thing and it's also there's a thing where you know that it's bad for you you're doing it anyway because you don't give a fuck it is definitely the weirdest stupidest thing that I do like I've never even tried cocaine not one which I think is almost like unheard of for somebody doing stand-up in a life for ten years I've never tried it either really nope yeah but I mean we're late and the reason why I don't try it is because I don't you know I don't want to know I don't know I did a tea once it's called masa de cocoa it's a tea that you make with coca leaves and it's not like a super mild tea like you know the coca leaves they chew em and it gives them energy almost like like a coffee thing but I didn't like the feeling I couldn't shut the fuck up I was talking too much I was just feeling like really and that was just from that it was like god what would I be like I'm coke said anyway so yeah and being from I think that I want to do it that like shitty environment coming up right and now that I'm used to doing everything with that crutch like it sort of just trying to like blow they retrain the grain and slowly create new habit figure but definitely any quicker pain good move ya mean it so back here help if you don't want to die young man and you don't want to like have a slow death either oh shit that's it ladies and gentlemen and on that note we're going to wrap this bitch up bring it on down I see the ground outside the window no chemtrails again I keep waiting all right folks we'll see you thanks bye
