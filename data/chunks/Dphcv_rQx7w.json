the gyro can experience I know you're not a boss in comic now I grew up and it Worcester in Worcester tells us as soon as eyes old enough to leave I you are a Boston comic whether you like it or not there's a reason why that there's so many fucking funny guys from that shitty part of the country and it's not shitty but shit is shit yeah the weather shitty the gross I think everything about well not everything obviously hyperbole but I did not know the girls were nice till I moved to LA I didn't know they were capable of being nice fucking dumb as shit we're fucking hillbillies man Eddie Braavos and probably this girl met this girl in Boston and she it was just a fucking Hail Mary sacrifice 2:00 in the morning move way back in the day many many decades ago anyway she goes Wow while he's like making out with her and pulls his dick out whatever he goes she goes you gotta tell your friends that's what I remember growing up I remember the only time I ever got to fuck with the girls were so sloppy drunk and belligerent that it was like we had to argue before we got to fuck and then when we did it was over I was like oh I gotta go home get me the fuck away from this you better fucking claw me like that the cold weather is it the fucking savages that lived there that came over on boats from Ireland one of my first real girlfriends when I was 16 17 I kept in touch with her you have remotely here and again and I remember and I had to be in my 30s going back and I call in yeah we'll have a drink and hey you look really good and she goes you know she goes yeah well maybe if you hadn't a fuck sherry months and we'd still be together so fucking funny but they do they hold on to that shit yeah forever that's that's a fucking good a jail free card it's one of those few pat myself on the back times in my is is just comparing myself to most of the people we grew up with and knowing that one night in my life would be something they wouldn't remember that would be like the fucking biggest shit I don't remember doing I've done television shows that I don't remember well yeah you were on my show and I'm like yeah this sounds familiar if they were on the news once in the background they'd have a still photo of it somewhere they're fucking grubby fucking Foxborough Framingham fucking when I was 21 years old you could have easily talked me into doing some fucking comedy course no -
