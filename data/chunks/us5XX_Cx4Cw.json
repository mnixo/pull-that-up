hello freak bitches that's the problem in psychiatry is there are no real biological markers they're trying to use radiographic studies like SPECT scans MRIs PET scans and what have you as rationale for starting people on medication but there's absolutely you know in the biomarker or the biomarker panel that we have this is a direct correlation between someone having had head trauma regardless of it was mild or a blast trauma like Andrew had or a slip-and-fall or someone coming up and hitting you behind the head or MMA or boxers or Moutai and there's absolutely zero that they use to regulate what they're doing it says ok today's Thursday let's try this drug or this is Friday or else this month we're giving you this satchel of meds as many of the vets have come up and told me depending upon the day of the week dictated what groupings of medications they were given and so what but let's break it down for people what do you feel is the underlying cause of all this that's related to TBI ok great question and the answer is number one from the head trauma it elicits chemical changes in the brain that we call inflammation and this inflammation leads to disruption of chemical processes it's like you know the old alkaline batteries or the car batteries where we used to put distilled water into it well if you put coca-cola in it it totally changes the ability of electrons to be conducted just like in the brain so the chemistry of the brain is altered by the inflammation and it starts shutting down systems so that the nerves in the left side of the brain can talk to the right side or the frontal lobe of the brain can talk to the temporal lobe of the brain so you have disruption of executive function which is your ability to make correct decisions about things right and wrong why do we have over a million veterans incarcerated that's because they can't make the right correct decisions about how to respond to an in aqueous you know approached by an individual that they don't know and they respond by assault or with physical or anger or yelling at people and that leads them into jail or into incarceration so anyway the inflammation leads to hormonal deficiencies in the brain and what we found is that there's since 1986 dr. baylow out of Paris found that we have enzyme systems that take cholesterol and convert it into hormones that actuate and regulate our brain function from schizophrenia to ALS to Parkinson's disease to bipolar to all the different disorders there was a recent article that I sent out to our journal group in Andrews in it and it was about management of anti of neuro inflammation brain inflammation to treat psychiatric diseases and in the past six months we've been starting to see a lot of articles talking specifically about inflammation creating all these things that we're trying to treat with medications that are ineffective last month had a class in Arizona and I presented a group of articles and one of the key articles was the fact that they found people with atypical depression that's depression that doesn't respond to traditional medication so you're on a whole bunch thirteen medications and you're still depressed so they found in 61 percent of these people who were still depressed with atypical depression that they had growth hormone deficiency and then when they replaced the growth hormone within one to two months their depression disappeared and they had some beneficial side effects they slept better they had more mental energy they were socially more adaptable and their reactive scores that creates you know an assault situation they were calm someone said boo to them and they said huh who do you as opposed to getting into their face so it's a very clear and it's becoming clearer and clearer in the literature around the world now we've been doing this since 2004 and the inflammation is really the problem so unfortunately there is no specific medication they talk about use of aspirin and and ibuprofen in things like Alzheimer's disease which is an inflammatory disease I know I shared it with you in the past that if a football player has one major concussion on the field he's 19 times at greater risk of the alzheimer's between thirty and forty nine years of age because it's an inflammatory illness it's not you know genetics by itself there are people with genetic predisposition to it because they generate this thing called beta-amyloid but trauma any kind of trauma to the head can elicit increased production of beta amyloid and lead to these problems I get I get heavy you know I'm gonna talk about life and death you can talk about life now that is what we're doing we're living and some people are dying that's life and death we're all what's really interesting is that we're all gonna die yes and and that everybody pushes away mm-hmm and I guess that's normal to push away you know thoughts of your death but the real enlightened like the Buddhist I'm into Buddhism Eastern Eastern stuff they say it's a way to get enlightened is to die if you can check this out is to die before you die meaning completely kind of go into the fear and they claim that the fear is releasing ego which what they mean by ego is like like you have this beautiful studio and you have a career and a wife and a kid kids I guess and and it's like letting it's like you can't be attached to it you have to die to that like in other words you don't own your wife you don't own anything really because we're just the bottom line of it is is we are temporary yes and impermanent and it doesn't mean you can't enjoy you know like you're in the prime of your life right so why think about your fucking death mmm you know whatever you and then the incredible institutional entrenchment that happens when you adopt a certain of you right and then it's so hard to reverse out of that particular chosen line of thing it becomes almost impossible you know this institutions are not built for that they're not really built for science you know science is supposed to be as I said earlier self-doubting self-questioning you have new observations so you change your course that's what science is supposed to be like you you test things and they don't work out and then you move on to another idea but an institution its own is it's it's almost like institutional science is like an oxymoron because an institution is meant to not flip-flop on their publics not to change their views not to loot not to allow people to lose faith in them so it's it's there it's it's it's the wrong kind of body to to do science so it's made me much more much more cautious about how much I want our government to do because if I have just turned over this one little leaf and found this huge disastrous program you know I just wonder if I turn over any other leaf what what at what else would I find I think you'd find similar incompetence yeah so so it's changed my political thinking quite a bit and then I think it's also you know when I see the way that the scientific debate is played out and I and you know I know the science so intimately now you know I know I've read every single nutrition experiment that has really been done since the mid 50's and you know when I see the way the debate plays out in public you know I see that a American Heart Association presidential advisory which I see is a you know it's it's not honest science or our last Dietary Guidelines expert committee in their report saying you know we should we should all eat a plant-based diet and you know I can see how bad that science is and so you know I see that that I can see now so much better the the way that PR firms spin messages and the way those messages are echoed all over and the way you know it's just the way it's what's happening in our politics it's it's happening in our science and and so I think it makes me somewhat despair about our ability to have good science rise to the top because you know when you have institutions like Harvard and Tufts and you know all of our top institutions are so deeply invested in this wrong hypothesis yet I don't even know I don't know where people should turn to you know how how do we sort ourselves out of this mess so yeah nutrition science is in bad shape and I and it changed my it's changed my faith in expert advice maybe that's the bottom line I I really don't trust expert advice because I see the way it is manipulated by financial interests and and professional interests and intellectual conflicts of interest and and so you know even little tiny things like anything a warning label on a bottle like you know careful of this plastic or this or that I'm like I don't believe anything unless I go back to the original science and read it all myself which I could never do I just won't trust anything anymore that's not a good place to be [Laughter] [Applause] [Music]
