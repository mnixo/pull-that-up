Phil oh yeah I need a science advisor I definitely need a real on staff scientist to check things like dr. oz now he's not real unless I'm saying you need that I need a real one okay like dr. oz he got in trouble for selling horse shit right didn't he get brought in front of Congress I assumed all these people were kind of unqualified for their dr. Phil is actually really good guy yeah he's actually a real good guy I like one of those TV judge bailiff cops that stands in front of judge just got arrested for murder no yeah really yeah dude that's my favorite of all the kind of reality shows it's like the Judge Judy bailiff character that's right judge do you think it's like a DEA agent that eventually wants to try coke what the bailiff yeah like you just around I mean he's probably a real bailiff right so he's probably around so many goddamn criminals man I don't think that they're real bailiff I haven't got that he's a fake bailiff I just assumed it's it's Hollywood man mmm true it's like the same outfit from that Court a complicated gig you could just hire an actual cop that way you're doubly protected you have a real cop that's standing there yeah really yeah really doing it and then I'm sure they can do that gig just find a guy was nice that's up I think that's a much higher paying gig than a cop yeah and with you know give a cop a break well with that type of money comes corruption and you know that's true that's right that's where it gets ugly the cops get mad at him they set him up yeah they plan to plant a gun on a plant some trap into this dude what's this do got set up all the kind of like motherfucker got a hundred fifty grand a year job put the fucking gun on him you guys been paying attention to OJ on Twitter no no man what's he doing it's one of the strangest things ever he's just talking on Twitter just talk about like football politics and the comments are just the most ridiculous shit everything you would expect I'm sure he can't read them the comments are just filled with just murder jokes yeah really okay no not his comment you know his comments like under his like his thing that under his business all people that comment on his post it's all just murder Joe as long as he's not making murder jokes I guess no my friend has the largest OJ Simpson t-shirt collection of like the free OJ juice is loose in the in the world and he had an exhibit here in LA a couple a year ago at a museum a hundred fifty shirts pretty pretty amazing but you know who I like to follow on Twitter which I we were talking about earlier I don't really look at Twitter that much but I do like Jose Canseco a lot okay yeah yeah what does he talk about it's just like crazy it's his extra crazy and he was offering like a for two thousand dollars you like spend the night and I can attend with him and like look for a big fight oh my god yeah it started with him when he shot his finger off and then it fell off you know he's tweeting about that that that's what piqued my interest when I was 19 years old I worked at a place called the Boston Athletic Club and Jose Canseco and some other baseball players walked in it's so amazing how big he was he was huge a huge person you'd just gigantic man you know it's so handsome look like a professional wrestler looks like a fake person yeah it really didn't even look like a real person just a giant handsome super athlete can't lift weight someone huh fucking weird you know like he's one he's one of only four people I think that has 40 home runs and 40 steals cheese in a season I mean he was on steroids it I think oh he's looking for Bigfoot he really is he said I am a Bigfoot expert the most famous Bigfoot picture or video ever taken was a costume the individual wearing the costume is none other than Andre the Giant check it out I don't think that's true I think that's pre Andre the Giant's career in fact that picture was from the 60s look patterson-gimlin footage well Andre giant was alive they are you saying Jose Canseco doesn't know what he's talking about yeah I'm gonna go out on a limb he's incorrect here have you seen what Andre the Giant could drink in every pot yeah it's incredible yeah we had Jake the snake on Jake the snake used to drive him and he had amazing stories about driving on Jake would you designate drink like 24 24 beers in like a half hour oh well the way his hands were so enormous that the beer they didn't even look real they look like mini bar beers you know his hand just covers everything he was so huge but I saw a guy like Jose can sake I'm like well there's no fairness in this world this is unfairness how I mean that kind of the same species in this world good interest you learned early yeah it's a good lesson to learn mm-hmm yeah the first time you really get dunked on yeah I think it's important to kind of be reminded of like your position in society in the world when I was when I was at 10 or 11 I was listening to the getting driven home from a little league game by my dad who's one of the sweetest guys ever right I'm gonna listening to the Indians game and this new this new shortstop who at the time was terrible named Jay Bell like dropped the ball and I was like dad I bet you want a better shortstop than Jay Bell my dad stopped the car Patrick I love you so much but you're 11 and there's no possible way there's only like 50 professional shortstops there's no way that's it I just like man my dad's never gonna bullshit me that's kind of cool that's very cool yeah that's very cool yeah you don't need to be bullshitters he pulled a lot of kids today they've been bullshit of their whole life really oh yeah you're the best you're the best son you are like go and take that job yeah it's yours well there's a lot of wacky people too that are living through their kids you know they're they're like all their expectations of success have now been turned on their progeny oh yeah you know they have this thing they just want their kids to kick their fucking kick-ass slow down yeah fine line yeah how do we get an oak Jose Canseco's Twitter it's crazy huh it's crazy it's a while dude wild man I mean it's cool that a guy that it means his life stories incredible if you think you ever had him on I'm guessing no no you should have him on oh my god that would be great bash brothers yeah I haven't just held exclusively bash brothers stories people are always gonna be mad at him forever because of the steroids thing right because he told them so the guys that was on his other bash brother was found out right mark mcgwire mm-hmm I don't know man I don't know much about the the I mean I know the difference between doping and steroids or mm-hmm but I kind of feel like if you're I don't know about steroids necessarily but if you're if you're riding a bike across France and like I don't know I just I feel like you should dope a little bit I'm not doing it someone needs to do it well doctors have actually said it's probably physically safer to take the steroids if you're gonna do something like Tour de France it's so insanely grueling on your body that you want to be able to recover mm-hmm but we have this weird thing it's like there's a thing that makes your body work better but you're not supposed to take it if you take it we get mad at you but we want you to do good we want you to do your best but we don't want you to take this thing you could drink yourself to death yeah we're never gonna solve that but we don't want you taking steroids because then you'd be too big and you hit too many balls like do what but how's everybody fuck you everybody or nobody yeah it's the cheating thing the thing is it it affects kids that's where it gets dangerous is because you if you find out oh my god these guys just openly do steroids and they tell you what they do and then middle schoolers will be doing it yes they do that's the real fear the real fear and because that's that that would happen because there's middle schoolers that are professionally like competitive sure all over this country kids in high school do steroids you mean like also you do so you do a bunch I know somebody did a bunch of steroids and he was describing to me the process of that he literally was doing anyone a bit get big you know and I was like so what do you do what do you do when you're big he's like yeah well you got to start taking these estrogen blockers and like all this stuff either what the fuck you think yeah if you don't if you don't take your body stops making testosterone and I was like what the fuck I was like well that's what I mean like this is probably controversial statement but I like well Bruce Jenner said he like um like did steroids for breakfast I mean did that you think that like depleted his testosterone production they don't I don't I don't think they believe that there's a connection between gender identity and testosterone levels I think they think it's a wiring issue for a lack of a better term but there is always a thing that happens to people if you take steroids that your body has this inability to make its natural hormones and so you get depressed it was like a depression time and keep be really funky for a lot of athletes is that where like Jose Canseco's out there looking for Bigfoot because you just need clear his head could be he also had some MMA fights he might have got his brains knocked loose like he he had one MMA fight against this fucking big giant dude what was his name early early MMA no was it was after his whole career thing had gone he got it he had a fight with was it hung man Choi it was hong-man choi hong-man choi is huge so him just accept this fight it's crazy let me see you about God it's like yeah hyung that Choi is like literally seven feet tall Jose Jose Canseco is an enormous guy I'd recognize him from movies he's not enormous compared to hong-man choi and hyung my choice was a professional MMA fighter he fought some really really tough guys in Japan so it was a total complete mismatch but he needed whoa he needed the chatter so he's still you know that looks like eyes of choi that looks like when you have like a real GI Joe guy and then like the generic GI Joe guy looks like he fuckin found Bigfoot and even though like Canseco still a fuckin gorilla I mean he's a stout man super powerful gigantic man but that just shows you how big hyung man Choi is you get he got pummeled yeah I think he blew his knee out if I if I remember correctly I think he threw a kick and he blew his knee out and then hung man fuck filmed and I mean Danny Bonaduce - yeah was it just oh no did he really I just saw a picture understanding the game god he's so much bigger than Danny Bonaduce he's a really huge guy right there oh my god he did Danny Bonaduce is crazy Jesus well his head looks like it's been photoshopped on blame it wasn't that cancer kills brother wasn't that his brother posing as him super tatted up oh my god he's not though no he's not even it's one of those that's one of those checks that you put on it's like a rash guard but it's got tattoos on it it looks like your tattoo down I wish our brothers would start posing as us yeah I don't think that that was Kent Seco I think it was can't say goes brother I think it was they found out later is it like how Gallagher has Gallagher strut we're talking about that Gallagher - look at that guy that's not can't say go his name isn't mentioned in there Oh Danny ia oh I mean he's still a big giant dude - I mean the only way this story the only way this story could get publishes with that resolution of photo excells but this is that crazy you I don't know if you look at Facebook or if you have it but I do have it I keep up with my high school friends and my parents friends and stuff and the amount of stuff I see retweeted or reposted I'm from the left and the right is just so crazy man these weird fake websites with the most outrageous and they all you could tell it thick you know most people know it's fake because really one like and everyone's just afraid to acknowledge to the PERT like your own man that what is that that's not really jose canseco man well how about those you won't believe what she looks like now websites you know it sound like CNN you go down the bono of CNN dude that's my Instagram I scroll back a couple years I'm like what the fuck happen to me oh my fucking quit smoky and I got 35 pounds I've got went gray and like fuck man how much does smoking affect the way you feel not smoking is a I feel amazing but and it was a weird addiction I had heavy addiction how many cigarettes were you smoking today a lot man like to pack so easy whoa for buffer like 18 19 years oh I know but I had I had a baby coming and I just I just set a date and notebooks no no no anything no pills or set a date and that I bought a 12-pack of beer and four packs of cigarettes and went into my studio and just smoked every cigarette and drank every beer and just felt like shit on purpose knowing that I wouldn't want a cigarette and I never smoked a cigarette Wow but I did gain a lot of weight I mean chicken parmesan tastes a lot better we're not smoking cigarettes it's like you know I don't know you have kids I had my first kid last year and you end up you go through that you know I think most people go through that you just realize like oh shit like I'm almost I'm 39 I got to stick around for this this kid and I cut the bullshit so that's what I was that's what motivated me to do it it really affects your taste buds huh I think it affects your your metabolism you know what makes you speedy right it makes you speedy it makes you just say shades your appetite yeah you don't I eat I eat like normal meals now and I've gained weight but before I realized I was just like barely eating food my friend Tony smokes and he went down to the Joule then he quit that toe totally Tony Hinchcliffe and he would smoke cigarettes before a show I go to give me one of those things like what does that do for you I go give me one of those things and I'd lit it and I hadn't smoked a cigarette you know more than a decade and the last time I did I did it for like a play I couldn't believe how high I got I'm like oh my god this gets you so hot yeah like it's crazy yeah but it does the first couple of chased the dragon once you're back in there yeah you're not getting that but it is amazing like on its own like what the the hit that you get from a cigarette I'm like holy shit I feel great well I do like I don't I feel like everyone so my uh it'll be in a situation where like oh man I actually really do want a cigarette but instantly I'm like that will mean for me buying a whole pack being right back on it although I was like it's like well maybe maybe I'll go do get myself one week in the year or just torture myself and allow myself to look forward to that one week in the year smoke some cigarettes deal with yourself I think that's possible I think I'm capable of it because I do have a pretty good willpower I mean I was able to quit the people that would be like addiction specialist would tell you that you're fooling yourself you're fooling yourself buddy if I try to pretend I'm in addictions let's say I'm gonna doesn't specialize come on no you don't need it yeah no no gone without it this long without great everything else I know I mean but then I go back to why do you want to open with it but then I would open up the store to this whole thing like why do you need anything that's a good plumbing and then it's like it's like it's because it's fun and if I could do it for one weekend and it's be the less harmful than every day yeah no I mean everybody has addictions everyone's full of addictions whatever it is like I'm addicted to sleep I think that's my biggest addiction is like I I'm like well that was a bit my biggest fear really about having a child how am I gonna look what I need you know I mean like freaking out and to this day I'm like I get up to take my stepdaughter to school at like 7:00 and then I'm like I come back in the house and I just sneak back into bed and I try to avoid having to wake up to take care of the baby I have excuses ready to go like I got so much to do later today and a couple more hours that's a good thing for your body yeah I don't know if people get that so that's a good addiction yeah solid healthy addiction I think if you don't get enough sleep it's the worst thing for you I mean I have nights when I feel it craziest meat so I feel like everything's barely keeping it together you know I'm functioning like 70% I know that I know when I've reached a wall of exhaustion it's like when I go like I need a nap and then I lay down in it and I just have a full-on like existential crisis like all so stress I get reassessed out yeah but yeah I mean the sake of everyone's so weird because if you think how many people are doing it right now listen to this smoking a cigarette all of them know it's bad for them but everyone's just drawn to it just a weird and it kind of represents that you're having fun represents it you're you're you know you're free doing whatever the fuck you want smoking a cigarette I know it's bad shut up I don't know I've found it it's only like that once when you're like 15 like this and never like that again then it's just an addiction well smoke I do smoke the cigar bones on that and I think that there that's the thing about that similar between the two aside for nicotine is it because you don't get much nicotine from a cigar it's like not not so probably not at all but it is like you're okay it's like I'm telling myself and everybody around me like fuck off for however long I I have this time to myself yeah I mean so it is like it is like it it is there there's that aspect to it and I don't know I mean I think that if you marketed cigarettes right man you could get every motherfucker smoking because you could just say like it's like the new Koko cacao nib like Native Americans use this shit it's a natural antidepressant get on the fucking this doesn't have any any chemical no chemicals is there a difference as a cigarette smoker between the high you get from like an American spirit or you know a hand rolled cigarette versus like a cool you know you just get mean when you're smoking cigarettes you just into your brand and I got I actually bought a jewel based on a recommendation from a from a friend years ago so long ago that I'm they follow me on Twitter like they must have looked at who was buying this shit and I was one of the few people that was verified or something it was two thousand fourteen or fifteen and that's when I knew like when I knew that could not be vaping I hate it and I was like the minute a you look like a idiot but be like it's like temperature thing for me it's like it's too hot it's like fucking gross and it's like might as well does not be smoking true gonna smoke the Joule thing but it's weird cuz my my stepdaughter like all of her friends like fascinated by the Joule specifically hmm it's like an epidemic with these like high school kids that want and I was like that's a funny joke until you all get addicted to cigarettes because that shit's fucking real well it's also some kids are having problems with the oils in their lungs right I don't know yeah there was yes I was probably for not moving around that's right is from looking at their iPad all day I think we're saying that they've grown some sort of infections their lungs they damage their lungs I don't know if it's true though you know it's like well those stories I just looked at the headline and I didn't look into it at all it's Facebook one like opposed now it's Jamie do you know is that legit like did have people really experience of your lung disease associated with vaping is that really they're just trying to link it or there has been studies saying that maybe this is from it because there's some sort of high school that did it but that's why this this might just the cigarette lobbyists trying to shut that down well it's the number that's weird it's like not that many it's like a couple yeah like what are they doing I don't know me I don't think I don't think that the government should be regulating that kind of stuff I mean it should right make sure it's like safe but I shouldn't outlaw it I'd saw the California or someone well it seems easy for kids to get that's where it gets weird no it's like the reason why we keep kids from cigarettes I don't know it's not fair to get them hooked on something that's that physically addictive that young when you're still your brain is still forming you know it's like a sneaky trick keep it away from kids at an early age but it makes him feel cool man well I mean is it I mean I feel like I don't know I mean if it weed wasn't that hard to get when we were high school but now it must be way easier so I don't know do you think is easier to get weed or cigarettes if you're in high school in California probably weed I mean people people I know people here they're like when I was smoking like oh my god I can't believe you smoke and then there's like smoking a joint I'm like yeah fuck off yeah fuck off and they drive her driving around in their tesla'd I'm like that's a cool ass fucking car but what happens when you get like a 300 pound battery full of heavy metals in a dump like a hundred years from now I don't know what the fuck happens fuck knows what do they do with the the metals from the batteries oh I'm just saying like these giant estates in the jewel on the top I'm saying like I'm the sane man that the thing about the Tesla and all these electric cars I think that they're really smart and cool but I but the idea of having to to filter all these rare earth minerals into one place that much right it's the first time that's ever happened it's a good argument well interesting argument had a we had a buddy who who had leukemia and bone cancer actually and uh the doctor his doctor who wasn't a quack I think he was at the Cleveland Clinic like this is from having too many heavy metals in your system that's how you got this he's like your heavy metals are out of control and there the doctor said did you grow up near mine and the kids asked his parents he's like what's this about and I oh yeah we had you on a commune in in a in Colorado we lived there for your first year of life in a mine like an old mine it was like an old mining town and I said that's probably what it came from I don't know I don't know I'm talking about me but that that makes sense they would guess that from a mine I mean if it gets in the air you're filtering like the heaviest metals down so you're like if I don't have you been to like there's a town with it called Oh Jerome Arizona my wife's from from Sedona and near there there's this little mining town called Jerome it's really cool like kind of touristy spot but there's this giant slag Hill I mean it's massive and it's just like all of the all of the shit that wasn't copper or gold or silver but was heavier and sinking to the bottom when they're looking for that stuff and then they throw and that's the kind of shit that's the rare is the mineral stuff that they make you know cadmium and wood else lithium so it's just laying around well it's just just your eye when you're in these mining towns which would concentrate it because it was all the stuff they wouldn't use it in a waste it was waste his waste stuff so did they know has anybody done some sort of an environmental test to find out what effect it's out in the water or the I don't know man the soil I don't know we'll find out I know what do to add severe bone cancer because he grew up in an area that was irrigated with like different pesticides they put pesticides down it got into the groundwater and then quite a few people in his neighborhood got cancer and they made it correlation who knows if it's a hundred percent would caused it but a bunch of people got similar cancer that's from how many died my grandpa was a landscaper and he used to he had a plastic bucket and he would take the pesticides and he's filled a book with water put the pesticide and mix it with his hand every day oh Jesus died of bone cancer so same thing well I've heard I've also heard that lung cancer a lot of it a lot of it is caused from actually the fertilizer used which is and when you it's like a pump ammonium the same shit these two kill the Russian spy you know it's like basically like it's the isotope of lead I think or and if you if we heat it up it becomes this ice w and over years of smoking your body builds up small amounts of plutonium eventually you know you and that mixed with the carbon the radioactive carbon isotopes of smoking you know that's why I mean I think you figure that out I'd still be smoking if you could just get rid of those two things well if they just figure out some sort of stem-cell Sprague and they're every day at heals 100% all the smoking damage how many people would go back what if looking what would it heal the brain damage the smoking give you brain damage I know I mean like Jose Canseco if you know that that really cool you're thinking they may be someday able to regenerate tissue in in the brain but they they've never been able to prove that they could do it it's just a theory they think they could regenerate disk tissue to and I know they're doing Studies on that like the spongy stuff in between your spinal column they think they could regenerate that stuff it's done but there's no no proof yet but it's it's exciting stuff I mean it's excited I personally prefer to ignore all all metal medical stuff because it just freaks me out I went to the doctor like to give it as they get a physical for the first time it's just based on me I got quit smoking I'm getting some weight let me just get let me just figure out where I'm at and we also needed one for our torso insurance he had to be physical for insurance and I went like I think what's up with this like how's my heart look and the woman literally the woman is pure like I can't get this other I don't I think I got it right the EKG thing I think looks really good and then they did some blood work like yeah it looks really good there's a high levels of this and that what's that it we don't really know but just will check in in a couple months and as I came back like yeah I think you just gained some weight but we're not really sure like basically I don't know I mean I've seen medicine save people's lives before and then I've seen also like it be like you know see you know they basically it feels like out they still don't know what the fuck is happening in your body a lot of times yeah so it's like it's best to like probably avoid a lot of that shit it's like if I try to avoid getting sick definitely if you can that's my medical advice that's solid advice well I mean like I went and they told me that I had to stay elevated liver enzyme I think that from drinking beer or something like no actually it's just like it's not it's not even like it's not that it would be different it be the opposite okay what's it from like I don't know don't worry about it nothing oh wait I went to this other guy who like you think okay yeah you've got some fat in the liver and as a is it because I gain weight because that's why I'm here in the first place and like probably that's it I think what should I do about it like just lose some weight if you can I think he's just like since he gets physical he's just been laying it awake at night just I'm just like stressing out okay I'd be better off not getting this physical cuz I could have diagnosed myself of being a fat ass myself like I don't need this shit but you know what you needed you needed someone who's a doctor but also can take you several epps down the road this is what we're gonna do here's what your plan is what it's all about bedside manner may I talk about that because look that I had this person be like if look if there's something really that you really need to be stressing out about I'll let you know but otherwise I'll stress out for you I'm like I mean if I know that there's one thing that and like you know someone really close to me had a really severe life-threatening episode or this year that was very fucking traumatic for everybody involved including myself and I I ended up gaining like 20 pounds in a month basically 15 pounds from this and I haven't really going to shake it and that's what led me to get this physical but watching this thing happened to this person was very close to me was like I was like what the bedside manner was just like insanity because it was the first time I've been in a real someone it wasn't didn't have a like a long-term illness just like life it's life or death and he it was like there was no there was no comforting it was like oh yeah at any minute this person could die for like five days I think is there anything he could do like mm-hmm no not we've done everything just you know just uh sit tight it was like fuck yeah it's like yeah yeah yeah PTSD do you think like emergency room doctors have PTSD we're off to right oh yeah well you think well the idea that this one person had to sit me down and tell me what was going on and like the look in this dudes eyes it was like he looks freaked out but he was he he wasn't calming me at all you know I mean it was right but he also didn't want to lead you know he couldn't pretend it was gonna be okay but yeah I guess conversations with someone I can't imagine a day multiple times I can't imagine yeah people get mad at you sometimes well man I can't imagine it's that is I I could never do that job I think we don't think of them as experiencing it traumatically because they're doctors we think they should be able to handle it right but I mean they're just they're also humans who are seeing dead humans like those consequences affect every one of us with you when you look at that all the time I don't buy that you don't experience some form of like intense stress I mean I've experienced intense stress from doing the thing I love the most playing playing concerts I mean I've experienced it firsthand where it's like and it that's way different when does it yeah like when obviously like telling someone they're fucking loved ones like about to fucking die but uh do you still feel it manager for me it's all about you just being in the right headspace hmm you know I mean like when we first started playing we were play these indie rock clubs you know because we come from that background like I guess what they would call now a hipster shit or whatever and that was just people who like you know really passionate about certain types of music that wasn't massively appreciate it you know which is still kind of what we're into but because that most of the people that were coming to our shows were like the high fidelity type record store clerk you know you're playing a show and it's just like arms crossed laughter was it pretty good you know we'd be a little we bake 2222 you know kids and the the the the the gatekeepers were like 30 you know 32 year old now I would look at them as pretty being like you know supportive but at the time it was more supportive but at the time it would felt more like judging so if I get in the wrong head state said headset headspace and I'm out on stage and I go man everyone's heard like judge judge us or something hmm you know I mean like what you're looking at this big crowd but then I have you know I only do and I tell myself I was like the worst band of all time is probably played the more more you know like some terrible like menudo spied two more people you know I mean like this isn't that many people it's like like tonight we're playing The Wiltern like there's like three thousand people it's like this be honest like the worst stand-up comedian like I don't know herbal I don't know man I'm like like the fifth Jonas Brother could sell 5,000 tickets in LA probably so it's less stressful when you when I like or Gallagher to could fly sell 3,000 fucking tickets in Los Angeles come on that's how I look at it you know I'm like oh we deserve to be here more than that in person we put our time in that's a hilarious way to look at is why would you concentrate on things that you think that suck is that alleviate anxiety does it actually work no I read this thing that Captain Beefheart one of our favorite musician said and it was like if you started if you think about what you're doing you've already lost the battle I know that the reality is that I don't need to think about and I know Dan doesn't it we don't need to think about what we're doing so because you we're not thinking about what we're doing like the trick is to stay in the moment with music but I can play and not think about it and then I start thinking like what's that person fucking thinking about okay it's like I'm like I got another conversation happening here I'm like and like an intruder yeah there's like I liked it like temporary schizophrenia like Pat what if you just stopped playing yeah there's like I actually remember thinking that on stage at Glastonbury everybody you know there's a two hundred thousand people or as close to that and oh I just stopped playing like what would happen don't do that don't do it just keep going yeah yeah yeah Pat so I had an almost line a breakdown it and Lollapalooza one new year we both it was intent for both of us actually because you know it was I mean you should tell story I mean I just remember it from my point of view I don't know I don't know what was going on through your head at the moment five red voice he was getting into this thing where he would be really anxious and drink a lot of Red Bull oh no and so we got on stage and it was like a sea of people and he was on his fifth red bull and his eyes were like saucers and he's just staring at me I had to like talk him off the ledge right like I did like put my foot up on the riser and kind of lean in and kind of talk in a voice calm voice hey man how you doing you know what I mean I was just I was just exhausted really I'm like what do you want to do whatever you want to do is cool me yeah what just let me know he had to calm me down how many Red Bulls does it take before it become speed I don't I don't drink that shit anymore but you know I think we also have been playing these shows and it was exhausting yeah most of it had to do with our schedule our and it was in the middle of summer it was hot as hell and I I would think I was severely dehydrated but but I mean I was cuz we played this one show in Des Moines right around this time this was in 2010 right so this is this is when this happened was at Lollapalooza 2010 and this is the festival that we had played like four times before so it wasn't like something new and we weren't even headlining this time it was just like we were on stage doing something I was actually looking forward to the show but this is like a pivotal moment for me it was like I I just kind of missed the beat of a song something that no one else even noticed other than probably Dan and there's a whole shit and I got like I spun out and I just kept spinning out you know I mean like you're like a panic attack on stage and when you have like a panic attack like you know you tend to get a panic attack doing the same thing you did before so I for a while I was having a pet like a little mini panic attacks every time I was on stage but I got through the set and everything was fine but it's like funk and a part of it was it I looked out and there were like 50,000 people we've been playing this festival four or five times before and to like crowd starting at maybe 5,000 people and now here we are doing most of the festivals watching us play and it was like oh shit like what's fuck's happening finally people are here and that I can't fuck it up now I went to go see this dude here in in LA in Santa Monica named Carrie Gaynor like he specializes in like just I mean look man I didn't know what get so good I didn't know what to do because I didn't like a couple friends and I like Mantis get some beta blockers get some get some valium drink some beer Riley I can't doing that shit before I go I can't be relying on that before I play those like I I got a recommendation to go see this hypnotist who specializes in like quitting smoking and fear of flying and also stage fright there's a lot of like actors who are gonna do like plays for the first time so I went to go see Carey at his house and we were playing some shows at the Palladium and he he did this thing hypnotized me and the second night I went that the first night we played it was like better the second night we played it was like pretty much gone and then I woke up in the hallway of the Roosevelt Hotel and that stairwell in my underwear at like 7:00 in the morning and I'm gonna like in this in my in I'm in the staircase in my underwear at 7:00 in the morning and I walk and I just remember like this number like 708 I think it wasn't like that only been to the room one to two times a night and my girlfriend at the time was in there luckily and I went and knocked on the door she said what the fuck where the fuck were you go and I said I just don't know hypnotism is real geez have you ever been hypnotized yes yes did it work yes yeah yeah there's a guy who's on yesterday actually his name's Vinnie Sherman he hypnotized a lot of fighters okay and he as his fighter yeah he gets them into this it's really interesting I guy I've never had it before and I wanted to try it I was like okay I had these thoughts it was probably bullshit or for people who have weak minds but it's a state that they can talk you into and someone who's really good like Vinnie could talk you into this state and then you're totally conscious but you're definitely you definitely in this weird tunnel where you feel safe like mentally safe it were and you can talk and think about things in a way that's almost free of normal regular anxiety you can you can address the anxiety you can see it but it's for the brief amount of time while you're really in that state you you can get rid of all that shit yeah this is very weird this guy Kari I remember a couple things specifically that he said and I went so that he said like you know you you know you're afraid of messing up that's the whole point of like being in a rock band is like it's okay to mess up it's not supposed to be perfect you know my perfection isn't something that anybody even wants you don't mean like if you go to like an art gallery and you see like a Thomas Kincade painting no one wants that shit he was telling me all this he was he was telling me this shit like he was like basically like you know your personality is you know everyone's flawed we're human beings it's okay like yeah whatever like you're not supposed to be perfect you have no desire to be the you know there's no cup drumming competition you've entered you know I mean and it was like I came out with again fuck it like I'm supposed to just be here having fun and that it worked and then I got really nervous a couple years later when we were supposed to play the Grammys on TV and I just got really fucking nervous so you got about it and I think I got nervous because it's just it's like one of the things it's not natural for us right it's like we're gonna be playing music on stage with all this pop music and stuff that has nothing to do with what we're about but we couldn't say no we have I think we had to do it because we we couldn't just knock it till we tried it but um we had sat through the Grammy performance before in it and it was atrocious I mean it really is like so alienating for I mean especially when the big pop stuff comes out it's like what we do is is something something different you know I mean so I want to go see him before we played the Grammys and he he did this whole thing is like well I was hypnotized and I remember it like he's like when they tell you thirty Seconds you're gonna start it's 30 seconds till you're on you're gonna start when I get to like 15 it's gonna get bigger when I say for like he's not gonna stop smiling and I was like anyway this shit we're a fuckin if you watch the video on this site smiling the whole time in the minute and the minute the song ends like I just dropped my drumsticks on leave me the fuck I'm never doing that again it was I will say it was like I think it's the best TV performance the why you never do any game because you never performed the Grammys again or you'd never get hypnotized again oh I would get hypnotized again if I knew zit I just the stress just the stress the stress you're the Grammys again pop possibly sure you know but it was like at the time you know it just seemed like unnecessary stress and then like this whole all this I think I had a couple of issues about the Grammys because the first time we ever went like we won two Grammys it was like this is the weird thing we go and are the words that were nominated for we're given away at the pre telecast this is the first time we were nominated for Grammys this is on a record brothers so we're there like February 2011 and my brother Michael was nominated for Grammy so he for a record cover of the year for our record so Mike wins a Grammy first right off the bat first award of the day record cover Mike wins it gets down to like the alternative rock category we win like rock performance of the year or something we go in the Staples Center conference area wherever we go collect our ward and we're standing on the side of the stage and they say next up are the rock song of the year they list all the nominees including us so we stay there because we're on nominated for this award and I and also Neil Young for whatever song and I so Neil Young wins that and this is Neil Young's first Grammy Award and at that moment I think what the fuck my brother Michael has had a Grammy longer than Neil Young I like that's something fucking crazy I'm like that's two knuckleheads have two and then we go and we win a Grammy right after him we went out alternative album of the year so now we have more Grammys than Neil Young within hence 10 minutes Chanin and I was like this is all kind of fucking and saying isn't it like none of it makes sense I start looking none of my favorite bands of fucking Grammys like The Clash don't have a fucking Grammy to clash don't have a Grammy No so I'm like that so then anyway I'm thinking about this the whole day just like this is insane I mean it's exciting that's cool but it's also like it's a lot it's like it means a lot less when your favorite bands don't have great right that should have them how does a Grammy work is it well wait I was gonna finish this thing real quick because this is what the apprehension I have about the Grammys is like this day ended with us going back to the hotel we're staying at which at the time was the Chateau Marmont and TMZ was there and it popped out like we tried to like just avoid the Warner Brothers has a party there we're trying to put all of that stuff just to go hang out with their friends and tea and a camera little bumps out at the liquor locker right there in the corner and I and the guy asked music how do you feel about Justin Bieber not having a Grammy and I was just like I'm sitting there thinking about the clash you don't mean like Justin Bieber he's got I like I'll sell him my Grammys for all the money he has basically what I'm trying to say like the motherfucker should be happy just to have a fucking career I said something like that and I wasn't it was just like I'm not it you know it wasn't even like it necessary a knock on Justin Bieber just like that's my response to the question I'm thinking about something else and I'm getting in a car and we leave and then the next morning I wake up to a tweet this is right at the height of the anti-bullying shit - which is like you know Justin Bieber right don't bully my fuck he's like the drummer from the black he should get slapped at the time I was like I thought it was the funniest fucking thing that ever happened but I was like you know what I can't deal with any of that shit like I don't want any of that shit and so I realized like that's that was my experience about my apprehension about playing the Grammys all came back to that I was like what is the fucking Grammy what is this shit I was like where does jerking ourselves off like congratulating ourselves does anybody watch this shit that really cares about us I don't think so well also what if there's like twelve great bands there's only one of them wind the Grammy of the year right is this second place third place is there anything like like the idea of judging art is always weird but to judge like one you got one you pick one and all these that are awesome it's also like it's it's you know ultimately isn't no different than any other election it it yeah like that year that we were nominated for album of the year so was so was Jack White so are we split our votes you know I mean like someone that someone had to either vote for us or Jack or like Mumford and Sons it's ultimately complete nonsense it seems like it perverts the love of the thing cuz it's like what you guys do is awesome I love your music but I I feel you're like I just want you to do it you know just when there's little contests and this is number one and this one goes this and this is the band of the year in the album of the year like says who and why is it a contest can it just be this is awesome shit here's some different awesome shit why we didn't yeah I we didn't bungle that was the whole motivation behind this record was like it was to not not partake in the current bullshit in the music industry which is so check this out do you mind if I explain it please do okay we had a conversation with our manager um about this record right you know release me and it went from everything like we have family we don't really want to be on the road for a hundred days this year we don't necessarily wanna do anything we don't we don't want to do anything we're not excited about you know so it came down to the promotion and stuff and it was basically like we want to get in front of people and play our songs and have fun you know and uh and the conversation came up with about the actual album like Warner Brothers was interested if we wanted to bundle it which is when you include the record like with a ticket right and a lot of people have been doing it whether you buy a t-shirt and you get a record and it's a digital download link and I think well how does that work and right well um you uh you would give five dollars from each ticket back to Warner Brothers and then you would get a record sale and I was like that doesn't make that doesn't make any sense to me and to Dan and uh yeah I thought well you it's the only way you're gonna get a number-one record so if you want a number-one record you got to do that and I said well I think well um so it's one to one like we get five bucks back and then we get a royalty and we get a reticular till right now you don't get a royalty and you only get a tick you only get an album sale count if they click the link and they have like we have a 50 percent click-through so in other words we would pay $10 per sale on Nielsen SoundScan by giving the money back that we've sold on tickets to Warner Brothers to our record label I was like fuck that fuck that shit at this point that is a crazy deal check it out we've sold 250,000 tickets on this tour so we would give back 1.25 million our record events for this record was less than that so that so it I was like if Dan and I were just our own record label we could give ourselves $5.00 per ticket and count and we just keep the beat of taking the money from the right hand to the left hand give you a link if you counted it we get the sale we keep the money that's basically what the fuck was going on you don't mean and it's a it's all based on fear like all of this shit like do you want to be relevant you know that's basically conversation that is basically being had not that direct but it's like as an artist you better try to get it gets good numbers get that first week up there and Dan I basically like fuck that fuck it it doesn't even fucking matter people are gonna come to the shows and they're not gonna come to the shows we're gonna make records people are gonna buy more than ocular by them and I think that it's really it's detrimental to the music industry like to to pay too close attention to certain metrics bands like the the whole system right now with these majors is like signing shit that has the most social media interaction the most streaming and I was like you know what when I was nine years old I bought Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby and I listened to that shit like I'm not joking like 250 times in a week like a fucking idiot I think that's who's listening to this shit there's getting a billion streams in a month it's like fucking nine year old more on our fan our fans have like you know they they got like 150 albums that they listen to on a sort of rotation at least and ours maybe one of them a month and I mean some it's like it's a different fucking audience you know I mean it's you look at Instagram and you sees these certain people I've never even heard their music they have and they have like 10 million followers yeah the other thing is that there would be any comparison at all like why why bother comparing well that's exactly right that's exactly right but that's the problem is that there are two different things that play at play here there's the music injury industry itself which is like certain people who work in industry high ups are like we need to sell records we need to we need like this pop producer to work with this writer and this artist and we need streaming numbers and then there's certain people you know like the old guard like the Lenny Warren occur or Seymour Stein or you know even got lots of younger guys to but that you know they're like actually what we're doing is curating art that we really like and it's either gonna sell it's not gonna sell and a lot of the records that we grew up listening to most of them we're records made by these kind of insanely eccentric weirdo people right that never sold records but have literally changed our lives and like Captain Beefheart being one of them you know like Tom Waits it has sold some records but still like he's it's a much different type of commercial viable thing but these artists are why we make music you know it has nothing to do with this shit it's like the difference between like the Voges you know I mean and like the Fugs it's like there's a lot of these the comparisons that you can make about what we do in our place in the music industry is is is to do what we what we do and for a while we were taking in like the mainstream aspects of music you know we were playing like the MTV Movie Awards and having these insane weird experiences only because we we hadn't done it before and we felt like we had to do it and I wouldn't I wouldn't chat wouldn't change anything but at this point like I think steer steering as far away from all that shit is what we want to do right now yeah there's no reason to lump you in with anything like why would any do you know that's one of the weird things about these award shows right you're lumping all these different musicians together that don't necessarily have anything to do with each other just all make me to check it out it's like we played the MTV Movie Awards in 2012 we got offered to do it we watched it when we were kids we were in LA already it was like whatever Aerosmith came out and introduced us and now I'm thinking like why would they agree to do to be on MTV Music Awards and what what are they gonna get from that whatever the whole thing was kind of bizarre you know I mean it's all really bizarre it's like we they need to be in the spotlight or something you know and we were just like I think we kind of realized how goofy was while we were there but we got an insane experience because we hanging out with Johnny Depp and Joe Perry and Steven Tyler and Al and this is crazy cuz after the after we do this little song wherever we're out stage but loud backstage by the trailers and um I like see Steven Tyler and Joe Perry and Johnny Depp talking and we walk over because we just want to see what they're talking about and I'm just saying well I'm looking at the shit they're all wearing the craziest assess accessories like they're dressed up like you know can Ark types of rock stars remember and they're like talking about and Steven Tyler and Joe Perry are talking about transport out are gonna get their arsenal across state lines and I think what like yeah man we can't we travel with a goddamn arsenal I think what like yeah and ar-15s that we have fucking grenades like this is insane man oh my god I think it's worth it we're here today just to hear these guys feel like they need to travel with grenades but then I was thinking about there have you ever seen have you ever seen their video game no dude the Aerosmith video game I didn't know they had dude if you if you watch their video game after hearing this conversation Dan lever privy to you like ah this isn't this makes complete sense good it never made sense to me it's like the terminator arcade game or there's like you know back in the early nineties it's that but it's them it's like a fucking saying you should put the put a clip up of that here we go this is his game good and then if it brings up a whole nother thing which is like Oh weird after the bottom after the bodycon shit like this is a real fucked up game to look at ya series oh right yeah when did this come out though this has gotta be old as fun anymore oh my god it's hilarious so there in the background playing and then in front of them war it seems feasible it just started Aerosmith into a game it's called cocaine psychosis but that's like the worst effort ever they just stuck data they don't even look good we kidnap them oh no Oh hilarious that's part of the game they kidnap him oh my god wow this is terrible it's amazing that we back then we're like this is so radical look how good the graphics are you get used to everything that's hilarious Steven Tyler's the nicest fuckin guy ever yeah he said they were really nice to just like I didn't realize they had to travel with weapons I didn't know they'd travel with weapons we never discussed that he's such a nice guy though yeah I met him at the Ryman in Nashville backstage - what else is recycling great place that is all right and that's like one of my all-time favorite places yeah so cool you just feel the entertainment in the walls it's like it feels like it's a building that's been entertained you know I mean I mean they did the Opry there for how many years I don't know so many people play there it just it just feels special every week there's something special going on there's so cool it is cool you know it's great that you openly talk about having these panic attacks because there are so many kids that I'm sure who are huge fans of yours who also have panic attacks and they can't fucking believe that you guys it with your level of success could still have these little battles you know that we've all had so that's so huge that you're willing to talk about that and say that that I'm telling you that happened that was definitely gonna make an impact on people I you know I mean once you have it like that first time I ever really had a panic attack I had one and then I kind of didn't have another one until this moment on that Stella Palooza but the first time really was in Amsterdam to London Dan bought some mushrooms uh and I guess they're illegal there I never I didn't dam bought him and brought him on the we were traveling in a van at the time and they were giant fresh mushrooms not even drying no man it was like a meal and then he brought him here like you guys you should take some you should take some I ate like the stem and I was basa I mean it was i eating a burrito I was after like 20 minutes I had for 20-30 minutes is like I don't feel I don't feel anything it Dan's like Oh eat the fucking rest no I eat the rest of this thing as a massive ass thing and like just you're sweating it smells like portobello mushrooms seeping from my skin and I yell to the driver I'm like starting to spin out like how do how do you get this to stop he turns around he only wore black and his shades on and I thought I haven't I thought at the time he was like Satan he's like drink loads of beer like whatta fuck and then I just like in the back just like fuckin like freaking out for like two hours and finally we stop I'm like we gotta I gotta get the fuck out of this van this is this is in 2003 he's a long time white knuckling your girlfriend we get out and like I think I just think it's the fresh air man I'm like we stopped at this gas station in Belgium and I walk into the bathroom with Dan and they're like this woman's like speaking in French like you know I think it's basically saying that caught other what's a fox you see what's happening Danny it costs money to pee here bro and I think what you think I know man is that crazy and I'm like fucking freaking out and I all I had was like 50 euros and I put it on the tray and Dan grabs it and puts it in my pocket and then put 2nd nickel there dude it doesn't cost that much to be like uh and then we both started laughing that moment and then it I turned the edge Oh from that and then it was an amazing experience we started being like laughing it like how clean their dumpster was like this right I think even the dumpsters here clean it was a bright red gonna eat off it you could eat it really it's really dumpster dive here okay eating a regular meal but I got that panicky thing right there at the top and I swear that shit open it up for me man there was no natural light in the back of the van also all the windows had the really dark dark tan black tint Oh so we were just in this panic van yeah need to get outside yeah I remember when this sliding door went open it was like when they went into Willy Wonka's place yeah all the light came in and yeah and then it seemed like it was crazy because when we got back in the van three fucking hours later like our driver like dude we gotta go think we've been here for 20 minutes he's like it's been three hours of you guys look talking about this dumpster so we we get back in and dance Dan like I don't know where his girlfriend I guess maybe happen at the time he's like do you want some bubble go and we've been on tour for a month and I never seen this bag it was like a trash bag for gumball oh my god what the fuck's happening this isn't just a music man and so he put on NWA and I was like we both started laughing I was like cuz it sounded like fisher-price music like so plastic and brittle and I do dude this is so bad this is so awful and then he put on Captain Beefheart safest milk and it was like the most incredible sounding record I've ever heard it was fucking insane but it was that experience that first opened up me ever experiencing that like what the fuck's happening like kind of fight or flight but for no reason panic attack thing and I think yeah I I deal with it mostly by just when I'm on stage I still get them occasionally if I come in too fast you saying that it was started from that trip is the first I've ever felt it man Wow do you think you broke something in there I don't think I took away too much I'm really sensitive to I'm really sensitive to getting high like yeah I I just it's not in my system it's not it's not for me you seem like you could have been a comic mmm have you ever thought about being a comic I don't think I could I like bullshitting though but I definitely I know I don't know you say funny shit man give funny observations and you're thanks you have a mean streak I'm dan I'm Dan's personal comic that's basically it yeah yeah he is it coming but yeah the you think that that was the first one and then from then it maybe is opened up the door and because you had one it makes it easier to have another one is that how it works well I was exhausted that day because when we were kids we were kids partying for I was I'd never been to Europe really we were in Amsterdam I smoked weed the night before which I don't do when we were drinking and I barely got any sleep so a super shitty feeling so every time I'm like basically tired I'm more prone to that shit and it happens like at the airport and I don't like the airport to me early morning flights it just it always kind of like that was really hectic and like everything's fucking moving around and tired like fuck this is a fucking miserable and festivals sometimes they're so crowded and like yeah but no I haven't had them I haven't had a problem with them really but I thought the hypnotism shit worked yeah it's legit if you can get a good one a good person who can hypnotize you can put you in a state of mind and sort of change your course just give you a little adjustment adjustment in your perception how you look at things it feels like you're in like a little bit of a tunnel it's very strange right it is it is strange I think it's like when people go see like a life coach maybe that's what they're looking for yeah just test some positive reinforcements yes I think it just gets in there better it's like it gets into the operating system better than a guy going what you need to do Pat yeah is prioritize okay I think we look at Instagram so like man I'm just so happy I don't know there's there's there's people kind of like this call yeah type of mentality on Instagram there's a whole there's a whole scene there nobody's self-help man just like got ass every one of these kids like went to a boarding school and like disappointed their parents giving people advice exclusively as a way to live it's just a strange way to go you know you got to do things to like a lot of things yeah you think it can't just be half dreadlocks well sometimes people think that the message is all it's important that is that is most of what's important but what's important is like but how did you start doing this did you just decide to be a motivational guy and you have you done anything else no right on school motivational guy that seems like are you just repeating shit do you really know that much about how to get your act together or are you just kind of you know this like there's a lot of repeating shit yeah a lot of repeating and I've repeated it myself I've like I've said things myself that are motivational things that I've heard other people say and it's you know because they're real it's it's effective you can help people but if that's all you're doing yeah it's also when someone has a a continuous message it's always the same and it's always positive it makes me really suspect because I might learn this self-help guy on the Metallica documentary who was offering the lyrics yeah that's the best movie ever made probably about music it's like it beats spinal tap it's like if there was a competition I have to come down on some kind of monster huh it made me actually like the well I've been made me as a fan appreciate those guys in a weird way their dysfunction like they became characters well at one time I'll watch the movie I make a man like Lars it's so annoying then I'll watch it again like I'll still think Lars is annoying but I like I still think he's right or so I have a different view every time I watch it yeah but ultimately I do I am I just I end up liking this guy's because of it more he stepped out in a big way with that Napster thing was it was an odd moment for everyone because everyone was trying to figure out what is this file-sharing thing how's it gonna fit and then the music business you guys felt it first like you guys were the big hit more than anything cuz it's not the same to watch a movie on your TV even if you can download the illegal movie I'm sure it'll have a little bit of a hit but people want to go to the fucking movie theater but with your shit they can once it starts people start sharing things you just you just get a file and everybody kind of just assumed that well I mean this is like this new frontier and it's not really stealing you're just copying it's just you're not giving them money for it but you're not really stealing got to this weird sort of enlarge was the first guy to say hey fuck you you're stealing like this but it was a weird fight to have because it's it you know hindsight is always 20/20 we know with what the Internet has become since then it's incredibly difficult to try to keep a rap on things and to keep things to like keep someone from downloading things like they just get theirs so if you have songs they get out there you know whereas that Napster thing was the first time this was happening and he was the guy who's is a really really wealthy guy who was a huge success saying don't do this like this is stealing well yeah it's like David versus Goliath type of thing I mean clearly people shouldn't steal but is it Metallica's job to tell people that maybe but maybe maybe they should have gone directly to Napster or to the record label but I thought you know when streaming first started becoming like a real thing we had to talk with a friend of ours who basically encouraged us to look at it and not do it and I went into it with our manager when we're talking to someone at Warner Brothers and said we didn't want to do it and they were like kind of outraged and like you can't not do it you can't not do it and I didn't really know at the time but I found out a couple months later that they they I found out a couple months later because I I was I was quoted in Ron stone talking shit about like Sean Parker and Spotify and it it what happened is I ended up getting a phone call or an email from from Daniel Hecht the owner Spotify and we had lunch together and he's fucking cool guy he's a nice nice guy very intelligent and I and I really saw his side of it for the first time and he basically without explaining it directly was like you know that he's paying our label to get our music what they do with the money he can't control he's not really like that at that moment I realized oh yeah there's some stock being floated to these companies which there was billions of dollars of stock was sent and the label has no obligation to give you Megabus they gave us they gave us like a couple hundred thousand dollars of it out of the billion because they paid it to us in a way the way the label does was they paid it as an artist royalty and it took all these deductions off of it and it was a made-up number it's it's there's a lot of money in the music industry right now you know and the problem is is that I think not like okay so my favorite bands for the most part don't have hit songs they don't get played on k-rock they don't have like a Macarena type shit under that's gonna be coming their way you know I mean and that and that's what pays money is like they because they treat almost every stream the same it's like there's a different variety rate for if you pay for Spotify and there's no royalty rate for if you're listening on the free service but what they need to do in my opinion is they need to say this guy is a Joe listens to music he has good taste in music he he he follows 500 bands which means that there's no possible way that he's gonna be listening to all 500 of those bands you know in even a six month period of time but when he does choose to listen to a song it it's worth like X like 10x versus this person who's listening to Oldtown wrote a thousand times a day yeah because Joe is like actually engaging with our thing and not just streaming this song for free and like a monkey like my mama you know like a Pavlov you know whatever mouth salivating every time they hear those little little Old Town Road wherever I was I look at my Spotify thing and I'll go months and I have all I pay for all of them I have like YouTube Apple whatever I don't have title but that's because they didn't they gave ownership to like 12 artists and they're like fuck you let's fuck is that just keep the ownership and pay a higher royalty you fucking cocksuckers honestly so I'm like so I think I look at my Spotify I listen to like I was like a hundred songs a month it's barely anything and I'm like the way to really do this it's fair is you take my ten fucking dollars right and listen to a hundred songs that's it because I've got so many ways to listen to music that you listen you take that ten songs and you give every buddy ten cents but that's not the way they do it they're like we pay point zero zero zero five six seven cents per stream how could you fucking know what you paid for stream if you're if you're a distribution service do you see what I'm saying yeah I'm giving you ten dollars and you're gonna take thirty percent off the top like Apple music used to do when you would buy a CD and then you take seven bucks and throw it towards the artists that would make sense to me but they don't they're like they're paying they're keeping all this fucking cash or they're to keep it in a pile and then at the end of day that is satiating like you know Rihanna's 100 million dollar check she gets every year you know I mean if I know a lot of artists who just they gets checks like two dollars and fifty cents for a whole year on a record that normally would sell like five or six thousand copies but there's no need like you have to basically be an idiot to buy a CD nowadays you know because it's a digital file that you ultimately could download from Spotify on your phone and have it with you forever yeah you know unless you don't have the Internet you know if you're in Alaska or North Dakota maybe you need to have a CD so so few people are printing CDs then it boils down to how much of an infrastructure do you need as an artist who how many people do you need to be representing you what how does your stuff get out there doesn't it does it get I mean especially with you guys doesn't it just get out there because I mean I just found out about you guys cuz somebody tweeted it I got Mike oh who are these guys I'm not worried about us bin it's like the new bands coming out new bands trying to break it that's what I'm worried about yeah it's like we're fine but it bums me out but I mean for anybody in the business how much of an infrastructure do you need in this digital time well you just need someone to figure out how to get it to people I think it I think in a way it's like when we first started our first record deal was with a small label not far from where we are here and the deal was this give us 12 songs pay for the recording yourself will master it which is the final process of making a record that cost a couple hundred bucks and we'll send you 50 albums and we'll give you like 12% of the money we make that was it and oh and we're gonna have a $500 marketing budget that was out was that that was the deal you know I mean so we basically I mean we made this record paid for ourselves and we went on tour with this agent and Ralph Carrera booked us a tour that kind of a mercenary agent who would like booked he booked the label I think paid him a couple hundred bucks to focus his tour and it all kind of started steamrolling you know I mean but we had no infrastructure we had no management we had no agent we had nothing we just kind of got in a van started going and I think in a lot of ways nothing has changed except for that when we got to the second level you know the set liked it there was a couple thousand dollars there for us to make a record there was opening slots that you know to arraign was a little bit different then but I think we've always kind of done it in a way that was pretty DIY and the way it's the same way it has to function now the only difference is there's fewer record labels that are gonna sit there and give you fifteen thousand dollars to make a record and maybe give you 10 grand to help you buy a VIN and that's the hardest step that's that's the threshold for things bands are having a hard time getting through you know once you get through there then it's like then you get to where we were four years which is you're on a bigger label you're making records and no one's paying attention to you the only reason why we ended up getting attention paid to us I think by Warner Brothers was for our wreck our six record brothers it was a kind of a heavy time I just turned 30 Dan just turned 30 and you know when he's turned 30 it feels like you've gotten old you know I mean and like especially in the rock-and-roll business and we had this good this record that I thought was great and I went into when to talk to Lyor Cohen with our manager uli or one of the guys heads of Warner Brothers and I and I was like we're like that were the most synced band on Warner Brothers which is when you get a song on a TV show or a movie or a commercial I think there's no other band for the last two years this had as many sinks as we've had but we've now I don't even know who works the radio department at Warner Brothers and we've been on your label for like four or five years and Lior basically like a that fuck he prioritized us like that week and for the first time was like we're gonna work on your band and when that happened that that's when the wall up loses shit that's what a radio k-rock everything fucking changed it took us six albums and it took us all those sinks all that shit all getting called sellouts all the time for a while for Gavin our songs calling yourself the same dudes it wherever first shows that their arms crossed sellout funny one you still do the same music stupid to say music I mean it's it's nice I think that you're different I think I think that it cut for this type of thing it comes from that idea that like maybe like oh that band like there I like to better when it was at my secret my friend's nice right okay so I don't want to share it with this dude that's why I think it's dangerous to have your song in certain things like if your song comes on in Walgreens you better watch out man like that's a red flag because we've had opportunities to have our songs sent to like top 40 radio and there was this thing where like if we one record of the year for lonely boy Warner Brothers was gonna service that song so top 40 it would have never probably been a hit but if we would have one time that Grammy it could have fucked a whole band up I've seen it happen with lots of bands like you just kind of it just like you become like play school level yeah but do you really think that you guys would change just I think you go dude it's a check that we would have changed but the thing is is like you start accessing like you start accessing you start have you started acquiring it's a fan base that's more fickle and maybe more annoying it's like okay I bet you as a Cubs fan like a Chicago Cubs fan in 2017 was like fuck this World Series shit yeah every motherfucker wearing a fucking Cubs hat do you I'm saying yes and and I do I know exactly what that food feel like that's it it's probably the same thing it's like someone's going in there to get like someone's going to get a shaving cream and this band that used to play it like the fucking casbah and San Diego is playing it well or checking out like they're probably like fuck this fuck this listen if you guys put out the same music that you put out in that time period it wouldn't have mattered your music is it it's it is it's you guys you know I mean it's not it's even though you've gone experimental and you've done different styles of songs and in some of them feel more bluesy some of them feel more right it's like it's still black keys if you guys just did that it wouldn't matter what you're on nobody gives a shit yeah I do give a shit fuck them I had a big realization that's like a couple years ago I did this record this guy from Cleveland Ohio and Glenn Schwartz this guitar player I used to go see Glenn when I was in high school when I was 17 he played at the this place called hoople's and in Cleveland Ohio and I guess use just a tiny little place he was the original guitar player in the James Gang so he like Joe Walsh says he's first saw him in like 65 or something and he was like on somebody's shoulders in purple bell-bottoms no shirt playing electric guitar solo and he said Joe Walsh said that that guy made me want to play electric guitar Wow you know and this guy I used to go see him all the time and he would play these songs which happened to be religious which is just like another story but it sounded like cream crazy anyway two years ago I had him at the studio and it was all these memories were flooding back of all this like heavy electric guitar and seeing link wray in Cleveland Ohio and playing in the basement with Pat and it was all at the same time and all of the sounds from the first Black Keys records we're coming out of this he's almost like 80 years old playing this fiery electric guitar and it was just like it's who he was and he helped me become Who I am and as soon as I finished that record I called Pat and we made this this new one mm-hm and it was with that spirit it was like and it was just the two of us and we never even talked about working with it we didn't even talk about it we just put it in the books and we got together because I knew that we always know no matter what happens Pat and I can make music because that's just who we are we don't even have to think about it whatever the fuck you're doing keep doing it exactly the same way what you've done it's I mean you've some of my favorite workout music of all time favorite driving playing music sinister kids more my favorite right about to get on stage songs that's cool that's one of my favorites fucking love that song that's the funny thing is like when you start look like sometimes I just nerd out and I start but not like when I'm just like sitting at home I look at like play counts of songs that one is one of those songs that we recorded like this is one of our best songs and it's it was one of the least purchased at least it's like it's like but it's funny I think it's one of Dan's papers too it's like it's fucking great song most of the stuff that uh you know that's what's important about music is it's just to do what you are good at what you feel yeah what you connect to and I think that I guess that's alternate what I'm trying to say is that like it's always been this way where it's like there's always been this noise of like you know annoying annoying kind of mainstream music and the problem is is that because everything is getting streamed on the same platform and there there's no more in like there's less independent record stores there's less these there's no college music journal there's nothing's kind of compared to it's like you know you listen to like the new like purple mountains record which is a guy who unfortunately passed away this summer friends of ours David Berman I mean I think it's maybe his greatest work right and the record has a maybe a million streams or something and in the compared to like oh whatever Drake is doing that gets lost it's completely lost in I I think that there needs to be a better way to highlight this stuff it's still crazy to me that there isn't like a website that I can go to as a as a crazy music fan that I think is curating music that I actually want to hear and I have we both have really like open minds when it comes to music but there isn't one thing it's just like highlighting stuff from the underground from mid-level rock have you ever thought about doing something we've talked about Rollins does it Rollins does what does he do every Sunday he's he's got a great show where he picks all the music all obscure cool shit you know weird old Stooges songs you know like we both had wants we both have the radio shows on Sirius Radio currently and the I don't know man I don't think I don't think many people actually even listen to that the thing about the serious thing you have to listen to it when it comes on yeah if you have it on something where people could just access well as access at any time it's hard it's also hard because I think that they're part of the problem actually serious yeah like this the way that they've programmed that the four or five Rock channels like there's a channel on there called the spectrum dan has a show in there and um it's like the triple-a channel which would be like KCRW here or whatever like the Morning Becomes eclectic I trying to think what what song it was exactly that I heard but they started tapping in like this should be a format that's highlighting like you know I think music that's current music that's coming out you know I mean like and they were playing like a couple of u2 songs on there the other day I'm like this is a band it plays the Rose Bowl why the fuck are you playing them on a fucking Triple A you fucking asshole you know me Isaac seriously yeah and then I go and I look to the alternative station and alternative station is playing like pop music you know I mean like literally pop music and then you go to the alternative channel and they're playing like five or six artists or the indie channel there's like there isn't there's like almost there's I don't know there's like under representation of I mean I think everybody this way I went to France this summer for a month I always wanted to take this trip my family that we went to the south of France rented a car and I decided I didn't even hooked my phone up to the car for weeks I just write when I turn it on I scan the radio and I heard a song I late you know that what the fuck is that on this channel called Radio Nova which is a nationwide not digital terrestrial station on in France I heard this song as it what is that man oh man that's like a new song by a Damon Albarn from blur from a record called Africa Express I never heard is amazing this song how is that not playing anywhere in America I listened to this channel every day for the whole trip and every single day I I heard maybe two songs in like 21 days that I knew it was all new it was all current some of it was classic even the classic stuff it was like a Janis Joplin song I never heard it was like true I felt like I entered a different dimension and I came back to the US and I put on my satellite radio I think why am i hearing the same fucking bullshit there's so much good shit out there and even when I go to the algorithm my algorithm on a I was sitting with this guy named John Vanderslice the other day he's well-known indie producer we were looking at our algorithms our predetermined Spotify thing and every single thing was something that I had listened to already except for one artist and it was it was something I didn't even care for like it's all the technology with all the ways to hear all the million songs on Spotify they still haven't figured out how to satiate new like someone's desire to hear new music do you know do you think it's because they try to program those those channels strictly to be commercially viable they just want to make money from it and they feel like if they put you to or in old Elton John silent you flipping through the channels you'll stay on it either if it doesn't match the format that you're looking for I think I think that they've gotten their asked so far into metrics and statistics yeah they've stopped any sort of actual curation using taste and the only way you get to something worthwhile is through taste I mean it's really the opposite process that should take place it should be you build the the art up and then the business files behind it but instead it's like you have this giant business that you have to keep feeding so you just keep you have to sell more and have as many channels that are commercially viable as possible whatever our numbers man I've had a show on that channel on that I've had a show on that with that company for five years I'd do it for free I don't get paid five years every month I had this one artist I worked with I was like I really think you should consider this for something that you might want to put on a playlist really like this isn't some paola shits with five years I've I think and they're like she doesn't have the social media numbers we're looking for okay I think you know what that means that you're what you're adding is just some dumbass it's good at social media like I mean yes I mean that's that if that's what qualifies you to get on radio then we're all fucked and well they should have a better social media so they don't have to think about that so when they find a new artist that's great you pump up their social media with your social media and then you put them on your network and people tune in and if you have a trustworthy list of people if you continue to recommend really good artists they go oh holy shit well I think yeah I think if good taste I think that you're not I think that the social media thing is a lot of it I mean I think it's um it's fake the numbers that the numbers of yeah I think that it you know there's this there's a couple he's like kind of like I don't know I don't want to name names I don't talk to you but it's like it's like this form of music that I it's like pop rap thing that it's always like some white dude with tattoos all over his fucking face that just came out of nowhere and like there's always like the I there's social media is always like man I've cleaned up my act I'm so glad to be alive and bringing their music to you soon but never had a hit and but they have like five hundred thousand likes on this shit you look at who's liking it it's all like mindless kids you know I mean not to say that that's bad but I'm saying like you can't as an adult like program and radio station look at that but this means I mean honestly was if you go back to 1991 right Nirvana's Nevermind came out like they didn't have the equivalent of social media she didn't have shit going on they had a fucking song that does knocked everybody across the fucking face and because the programmers are looking at these other dumb metrics yeah they're not gonna get that song across I mean like Billy Eilish I think thing is pretty cool actually and but I think there's a Billy Eilish to be found every month hmm you know I mean it's not that there's so much good music and to go to have to go to France to hear American music on the radio is is insane well why don't you curate something like this and put it on the internet it seems like a simple solution you have such like strong tastes well you have a love for this kind of music and you're already doing it unserious from zero money that's why we're here Joe we need someone to give us the opportunity well young Jamie's gonna he'll help you we'd all say hey speaking of young Jamie we're playing a festival in Vegas on Saturday oh Sh and uh little Wayne is going on before us oh shit which isn't the first time that's happened that's a good story would you like him yeah I would never met him personally miss music school but we've got big Wayne to come out with us you have to work oh okay way to do it Wayne Newton oh no shit yeah we lay in Vegas like we got Lil Wayne before us we have to have big Wayne with us so we booked that Wayne Newton is he gonna sing a song he's gonna sing longer hold me boy holy shit holy shit so you should you should time your psychedelics to be you can write about then - that's 12:40 a.m. that sounds amazing I know oh my god we played this festival with Lil Wayne um call it was called the Virgin Mobile fest and it was a it was a free fist yeah Baltimore CA tickets for free they paid us they paid bands well and everything the Stooges played we got to hang out with the Stooges and like which was amazing because we're backstage and like the Ashton brothers are stayed in their chain-smoking that arguing about how to change like a catalytic converter like this is so fucking Detroit man and they're so real this is fucking yeah I was like fuck man was in all just like this shit like and then a couple hours later we little Wayne's supposed to go on the same stage as us right at for us right for us you know that the stage manager is like absolutely no buses near the stage so we cuz it was a horse track it was like a you know well manicured horse track you couldn't pull a bus on the track so we we had a park our shit like way across field whatever and where we go over onto on the golf cart whatever and he's Lil Wayne supposed to be done he's not even there yet and we're like what the fuck's happening and then so he shows up the bus rolls up right to the stage right across the track jaian jaian like dents in the track and him and like I'm not joking thirty of his friends get off the bus probably and just immediately go right to the stage everybody except for Lil Wayne music starts playing from like a CD player and they play a whole set they a whole set and we're supposed to be out at this time so right we're like looking at the clock like our sets almost done and they're they're still playing like the fuck's happening and then it all ends the him him getting an electric guitar and like I don't even know what the fuck he was doing but it wasn't playing it but it was loud and it was like people were I think he thought that like he could pretend to be a guitar player at a festival and people would understand hit like would just not know that it wasn't good and I was just like this is fucking crazy like in kind of half the crowd kind of bought it I'm like which is also good for my anxiety which is like don't even have to be good anymore guitar but then we're like you know we're like this our sets what time do we what do we do now no the stage man's like well obviously you're gonna get paid and we're like obviously and like we could need to play a full set or three songs like no one paid for a ticket we're playing three songs they're out of here so maybe he does that again this time so if he dies like you might get there only see what us play lonely boy Wayne Newton which would be worth the cost of admission why don't you guys have him go on later doesn't that make me Priscilla we have to headline our egos I understand yeah I probably switch that around I'd take the hit head to Denver earlier it just seems like you guys yeah I'm just gonna wait do a lot of waiting we should I should say man I agree yeah I mean I don't wanna go on the limb 15 he's he woke up at 5:00 this morning what's he gonna do a helpful date he's a huge act too it's not like you can't headline things well you know he don't Lane he just left he just left the blink-182 to her I read because you know that people don't at the arena shows obviously people don't all get there for the support band uh so he was playing like half full room and I think left we could give him a full room in yeah I got I'll take that head cuz we could go play blackjack for an hour Wayne Newton might not be available though who's that that tore up that festival yeah oh that would like way to this yeah who said who set it up with you guys what what foots or what I mean that thing you're doing a show it's a festival so it's cured by a talent buyer usually in connection with like aids year Live Nation's it seems an odd pairing yep festivals now are ah I mean I think it's cool to have a hot parent and it's like like I said eleven years ago we had the same pairing with will Wayne but I think I do think you know the festival thing is gathering a little bit it's getting you know it's festivals are kind of for younger people so that hmm because that there's a lot more you know there's like a lot more pop kind of stuff you know I think we're one of the few rock bands playing the whole festival really I mean one of the few bands of the drum set that's for sure um it's strange time in do you enjoy these festivals I mean why do you guys do them at this point do you feel like I don't think we're gonna do that many coming up yeah we're kind of I think we're I think this might be one of the last ones we do for a while because I just think at this point you know if I was you guys I just wanna do my own shit we will we pulled out a Woodstock for that for that reason for that reason because we didn't want that to be our first show back and four and a half you mmm it was more money than we'd ever been paid for show our age was it well you sure you wanna cancel it we had it took four days of him checking we're like wow cancel it it's a it's not gonna be cool beat I don't want to play that as our first show back and he's like whoa there's a good chance it's gonna get canceled and if you cancel it you're not gonna get paid I think why would we want to headline a fest that's what gets canceled is this your agent yes that's hilarious they're trying to get you paid for something that might get cancelled I don't I don't feel comfortable taking money like Patton we got a guarantee I got a guarantee Pat that's hilarious yes which year was this which year would start this one this one okay be real showed us footage of the one that he was at which was how many years ago quite a few I saw him they're insane he's crowd surfing they took yeah people came to different shows with shows why look'st and I ended in flames it looks like chaos there's too many people you know helicopter folks in it's like all the cars are blocking the highway like this is a shit do they do it the same way I just remember a corn headline one night and it was just like a sea of fucking people and it was so dark and ominous you know what I mean is this fucking why and they all had that haircut that went on back then where that you'd shave like the sides in the back and then pull the top back you know there's a lot of angst in the metal on the metal ball necklaces metal ball necklaces I missed that one it was like ball bearings you know oh yeah sure I'll bear oh that's big accurate at least I worked at a record store when that corn record came out in 1999 and um that's when I first really got a glimpse at how fucked we are there's like a Modest Mouse record to come out and like I told that two or three copies of it and they're just like droves of morons coming in saying I need that new corn record well I think we had boxes upon boxes like fuck man we're fucked and I went into the bathroom and I was like like at the end thinking about this in the bathroom went that place was just covered in like pornography not like this is like so fucked up and then the movie idiocracy came out I was like this is fucking living in this shit already and then the last five years have happened I was like we're fucking so deep into this shit man so deep yeah it's happening at the same time they're they're cracking the egg that is artificial intelligence trying to get that fucking thing do they need it for certain areas I went to this I went to this rural rural County Fair Nashville a couple weeks ago because my wife want to take our baby to see the little piglets and stuff so we go into that but the 4-h kind of area and it's cute and like you know real right real motherfuckers who work their asses off in there but then we go into the actual fair part where and it is these corn these people I sold corn records to like 20 years ago are now there and dude I won't okay they had lemonade right which is basically like crunchy like crunchy lemonade there's so much sugar in this shit like everyone's getting like diabetes on the spot i order three large lemonade's there's six dollars apiece I gave the woman a $20 bill and she gives me back 15 bucks and stars and starts talking to me mm-hmm and as she's doing that she's doing this she's like she's like talking about fucking I'm not joking wheel of fortune just to no one I'm like this shit oh my god shows like Michelle what do i do do I give but she don't correct this shit like it's gonna be way too complicated just take it as like take the money don't feel guilty oh you're gonna embarrass her she doesn't even know what's happening she's talking about fucking Vanna White and like fuck and I look surrounded like men oh there's a lot of fucking people on pills in this country or something oh yeah it's like then that's where I was like I started going this rant on the way home my babies trying to sleep I'm like how is Bernie Sanders talking about paying back college loans when there's people who don't have a middle school or high school education I mean these if a lot of this comes down to just fucking education you know I mean and I was like that's a really weird way to talk about get it you know spending tax dollars actually is on pain back college loan but I think it just wants a free people from debt the the problem with college loans is people sign up for them when you young and dumb and you don't exactly know what you're doing and we're getting to a point in our life where do we sit we knew that we needed to drop out because we wouldn't get a fucking job from Akron University's philosophy the poor now we just have we started a band with debt we both had debt from school they both had debts everybody does I actually went to this art school they let recruiters come in in the fucking high schools it seems criminal to me it's kind of weasely they're they're kind talking you into something check it out I went to this may be a good thing for you I went to this school for two quarters called the Art Institute of Pittsburgh right and that I I didn't know that it wasn't accredited I didn't know shit they came and they recruited me and I couldn't get into any art school I had horrible grades in math so I tested into like four years of remedial maths was like I don't want to fuck you do that I like photography or whatever and after two quarters I had a teacher who just like he went to me in the morning like a after 10 o'clock or 10:30 class rivers like wreaked of whiskey and he said you say you I need to talk to you and he he busted out his portfolio which is all at this point this is like 1998 the shit's from the mid 70s in a dusty all the colors are faded they do you want to do this what's your life and it's fun it's photographs of cupboards cabinets photograph cabinets you get the fuck out of here kid this degrees meaningless its unaccredited you want to fucking be loading cameras what's your fucking life either you're the only one in here that gives a fuck and I think you fucking seriously think I'm fucking serious and I went home and I was like dad I I think I made a mistake and this school say $8,000 a quarter it was fucking expensive you know oh wow and and I dropped out so then I drop out and I had this whole other experience but fast forward to 2014 were on tour we're about to go to Pittsburgh I talking to the Pittsburgh post-gazette they're like and I owe ya man I love Pittsburgh from Akron two hours away I actually used to live there I went to this school actually it's one of the biggest scams of all fuckin time and what school MRSA Pittsburgh and it became like local news for weeks like so I just did it I did a pre to her interview with the same writer a couple weeks ago he's like hey man remember that interview we did about a new talk about talking shit on the artistry of history like anything they went out of business and like literally they kind of hold you accountable for it and I'm like well how does it cause go outta business because they're scamming fucking kids oh it was a scam a lot of college is a fucking scam Wow I mean I think I know right now I had a relative who was going to I've paid for a lot of fucking liberal arts schools you would be surprised how much how much I paid for I never went to a school I how about family members shit I paid for a year in Oberlin which is not fucking cheap you know I should get a fucking honorary degree from this shit I paid for the ship I don't have education I got asked asked to pay for some of Lewis and Clark you know and fucking $60,000 here school in Portland man and a lot there's a school called Oberlin liberal super liberal arts school really cool radio station a lot of cool people go to the conservatory you know very liberal school and Dan are pretty little motherfuckers you know and uh and it's not far from Akron it's close so we I would drive to Overland they had good shows there yeah 60 miles my girlfriend went there at the time and I would go see concerts and all kinds of shit but every time I would go there like all these kids that were like from New York City rich kids from New York or whatever big oh man I was at expressed an opinion about something Inuvik man you're just a townie dude like just a townie I'm like fuck you motherfucker like fuck who the fuck are you you just have let your parents have a bigger bank account than mine that's the only difference you fucking asshole and I don't feel bad that you don't have a job after you have a fucking to grieve here you fucking dick serious I don't feel bad that he done did a job after a college going to college I think I was like what I mean I don't know I was like fully prepared to it when I dropped out school if the bike keys thing hadn't worked start a lawn care business I don't know wash people's fucking windows I don't really know I wasn't gonna write papers I wasn't gonna write academic papers I knew that much believe it or not this is a tour basically this is you guys do yeah you get wound up my stepmom are my step my stepdaughter has her friends over right and I'm like and uh I I was like she had her birthday party she had three it was three of her friends over there all 14 and they were over for two hours already it was like beautiful day in the summertime and like I go up into their room and there's no sound I'm like they're all on their devices like you guys need to give me your fucking devices get get out of the room I'm like so jacked up like sergeant slaughter I don't mean to sound this irritated I don't know why I do I just don't mean to sound that I really I really don't care as much as I sound but we need I need to show you that there's other stuff to do and you guys should be hanging out and then like it was weird because I was telling him like you know when I was a kid we used to watch the troll - and like we would have super watch control - and make fun of the troll - the movie movie yeah so I'm like I go I go up there I get late at night like 1:00 in the morning they're all watching troll - but the thing that's like they're deep into the movie I'm like oh my god we always turned it off after the first we have to tell you you guys are gonna warp your brains watch it all roll - I've never seen troll - I only saw a troll one what's the difference oh no there is a movie I think called troll but it's not but it's not related they're not related no troll - is it relatable imagine like there's a troll was I'm gonna call my movie troll - but a man trolls my movie no no roles I could be I could be wrong I could be wrong but I really believe I really believe troll 2 is related fro is a hilarious thing if that's true that is a hilarity I'm gonna do to somebody I don't think I don't think the troll won't even exist actually really yeah how it's totally true how is there only troll - I know this is a big thing is a real screenshot well I kind of either there's this video store when we were kids who videos were a big deal for us actually and oh yeah Highland square video we find out there's a troll one because only control to it sometime something I know that makes it even more magical I don't think there's a troll woman search the troll wanted this doesn't know that's it's not related though man oh but there was a movie about these giant trolls or was it Leonard part 6 there's a Leonard part 5 or 4 3 or 2 1 but that's all there it's called troll - there was one movie I want to say it was a foreign movie that was really ridiculous about these giant trolls a few years back and it was pretty stupid too I thought this was it this is a different one well that's back in the time when like things were made that were horrible and it and it was almost like people didn't realize how bad they were oh look at this it has no real connection to the original troll which is his troll 1986 is not the one that I saw I saw some other one the trolls were giant there were like its biggest trees there like in the distance it's a revelation something about great bad movie so that's it's there fun well you know how like the secret knowledge of things like videos getting passed around before YouTube and it's no different than music was the same way it's like you can absolutely this weird record would come across you're like the first like mad scientist or dub record which you would never find it in Akron anywhere you get like a dub copy of that but it was like that was videos to like just go white yeah Jessica White yeah just go away yeah Pat yeah who you the first want to show me that yeah or Steve Bannock was that five documentary the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia holy shit dude I've never seen it but while they were making that we knew someone who was in touch with Jessica because we were we were we were in the Jesco based on that PBS thing from them we probably 90 we've got four track recordings we were basically quoting lines from the original top movie we were watching the stuff in like 95 96 yeah well check it out we we were playing our first show at the Ryman and our very first show at the Mother Church at the Mother Church in country music we we had we had Jessica come down from West Virginia in Florence and he got so fucking drunk this video got shit hammered he took his shirt off sort twiddling his nipples he started faking master pit and then his sister's dragging him offstage no one since Hank Williams that oh I've never seen that yeah he got he literally got thrown out the back door with his shoes fella but they were his grandfather's yeah I didn't like someone accused us of stealing his shoes I like the dude fucking lost his shoes steals you did you have interactions with him or did it just go on I spoke to him a little bit but you guys organized this oh yeah didn't you want to say hi to him I said I don't oh you did oh yeah he I didn't because by the time he was there by the time he I saw him he was wasted and it was and he was wild-eyed well yeah it was like for real sometimes the joke just gets a oh that's a joke gets to real shit I thought he was coming I actually tapped and do a shit but he's just so shit-faced he couldn't do well I recommended that movie to somebody and they watched it and he was like hey man why the fuck did you make me watch it what's wrong with you people live in hell I try to show people that like oh yeah this people like um you know some people that why the fuck would you watch a movie like that how could you say it to influence on you I don't know I don't know West Virginia is a strange placement and those people that are you know living in trailers and doing a lot of pills and there's like entire communities of zero hope and insanely poor that's one of my favorite states it's so beautiful there which Ward yeah Gorge the new rivers beautiful yeah I dated a girl right who lived right there but in Steubenville right on the Dean Martin Highway and man it was so pretty she could she lived in in Ohio and could see Pennsylvania and West Virginia across the river from her front porch mm-hmm there's something like kind of magical about that state actually you go in there oh yeah this is fucking cool there's this weird diners there's you know that but the thing is it's like there's no industry so people don't have jobs obviously then they also have their own property that were property is completely worthless it's like a lot of America's like that you know people tend to forget like a lot of people we're so used to seeing it I mean we grew up in Akron grew up in where the industry when I mean we have those big rubber money like mansions that are just vacant now you know and when I'm in like anywhere including a home in Nashville I'm like fuck the 3 million dollars for that fucking house I was like you could buy the whole fucking city block to Akron's three million dollars there's a house for sale in Akron right now that was the co-founder of Goodyear tires mansion 1.7 million it's like 18,000 square feet it's fucking insane Wow yeah and there's no there's no three-bedroom apartment around the corner from our hotel in Santa Monica what would you take same price one of them's 100 acres if one of them is made out of all materials you can get at Home Depot and one of them's hand-carved woodwork I'm still surprised that more people haven't left the big cities and moved into places more people working virtually I don't know why they have it we never I mean I never moved to the big city really Nashville's big city I've ever lived in Nashville's not a big city no but it's a it's got a good size there's plenty of folks yeah there's plenty so it's it's like it will sit it feels like the same size to me it's Cleveland or Detroit I don't know it's slightly bigger population wise but footprint wise it's smaller I think you drive through Cleveland it takes a long time it's a long if you're going lengthwise at least otherwise it's like really short so two months what like 30 miles long but growing up in Akron and like you guys had to feel like you were on the outside of the music business right like the business itself was in Nashville in LA in New York and you know growing up in an accountant is an advantage well we did but oddly Pat and I had a connection to the real music business but both in our family my cousin was Robert Quine star player who played with Lou Reed and Richard Helen avoids one of the first punk guitar players really influential and the Pat's uncles Ralph Carney saxophone player played on all the Tom Waits records b52 records all kinds of records uh-oh it was weird and these guys weren't like financially successful but they were critically lauded kind of individuals they were professional musicians and so they amend records and it was just so they woke up around the block from each other so what we want mean that we looked at that right the idea of making a record was what we want that's all we wanted to do it was making a record and then you know by the time we were selling that like 150 200 seat rooms we were like we fucking have made it this is it this is fucking awesome this is what we wanted and then we would be like what if we try to sell out the 400 seat room what if you know it was just kind of slowly went and then finally we got to this point where we're like well what if we trying to play Madison Square Garden and our manager is like yeah you could do it and we're like well let's do it and then we did two nights there and that's literally what started from playing that are his tour history like in Brooklyn or in New York was like we open for a ska band and on a Monday night in Brooklyn for 50 bucks we drove all the way from Akron 88 hours each way made $50 that's our first show New York and why and yeah that's a fucking Barclays or whatever but it also it was all like it was like it was like honestly when we got to the point where we were playing a troubadour like we fucking have done it we've we fucking got there they're like well there's another venue down the road a little bit bigger yeah that's well it's always you're a gigantic venue well that's why someone who doesn't understand anxieties never gonna understand how person like you with all that success could still get weirded out do you know I mean that's that's what makes it interesting like the the managing of the mind you know I mean Danny I was pretty confident but we're also that but we're not like would you know I think you're only as good as your last show really you know as good as your last record and you know you can't just skate by under shit yeah so I and we all knew bands growing up that kind of did right they had a couple good albums and then things kind of went off the rails dude it's like my favorite band is like growing up with Devo cuz they're from Akron and they're like this different kind of crazy band punk band you know and there is something special about acronym what's but it's something special about Ohio yeah well you watch you watch a band ledyba Dobbs and say get to get to LA and whatever happened there the change that happened and um there's something I mean that's been something that Dan I've been I mean I think actively trying to avoid is that that kind of thing hmm you know but yeah that's like I go home to Akron I fully get I fully accept and know that I'm gonna get made fun of for certain things I'm not I mean I'm gonna make a real individual get my shit thrown at me by my friends and they're gonna make fun of me for whatever rightfully so but yeah Akron Ohio and and the Midwest it's in an inspiring place because it kind of is a vacuum and the people who are operating there like 99% of them are operating this because they have no other choice that and they love doing what they're doing music-wise so you go to New York his first time and it's like you know the smallest little band has a connection to the biggest producer and if I take here too you know I'm gonna try it like it's like true good people like a will a group anytime there's like four teenagers playing music together here like we're gonna give you a big deal and get you on MTV it never fucking works out I mean that's like think about the amount of fucking bands that have come from Los Angeles how many great rock and roll bands have come from LA I mean seriously it's a fucking massive city it's the biggest county in the country the music industry is here and they take the last 20 years of great bands from Los Angeles to you you wouldn't have a long list same with New York City you know if you go the last 40 years the list doesn't grow that much do you think it's better this what I'm saying do you think it's better to be on the outside do you think it's better to be in a city where you're in kind of a small town here's what I think is best I think if you can really integrate with the music industry peripherally from the outside it's always best how so what do you mean like if you end up signing a major label like what we assignment we got some offers early on to signed to major labels early on and we did not do it mostly because the like the car they kept we kept being strung along like the contract will be there in a week a week would pass finish up two weeks have passed we call it'll be there next week finally we're like fuck this we realized at the age of 22 we realize if we signed this shit and they can't get a contract to us to even look at in six weeks if we make a record there's we're gonna be so fucking log jammed it's like we're never gonna be able to do this shit so we we took the gamble and we signed with the small indie and just kept fucking going you know and when we finally went to a major it was on a subsidiary of a major with really supportive president and we were kind of on outside still even over inside ran outside and we were able to do our thing we've never had a A&R guys sit around and tell us to speed the song up or or whatever but the problem is if you get in without having some of those boxes ticks and you get in you sound a big big record deal off the bat some fucking dumbass who has a communications degree from like fucking Pepperdine sitting down next to you big I think the hi-hats too loud bro I mean k-rock can't play that the drums are they disguise no he's talking about you know me and like that's that right there and when you get those notes coming from some dude it's your ANR guy that doesn't really notice to it I mean there are good a and our guys but most of them are these types of dudes and I'll be like yeah man like and it's it's basically what they are doing right then when they're telling they're getting in your head bag you got to change the hi-hat on the mix man what they're saying is when this record fucking fails and I can't deliver that any sort of fandom to you that I'm gonna say that you turn the hi-hat down too low or I turn the Hyatt he didn't turn it down low enough there's all cop-outs everywhere and what only way to get through that is to we we learned how to make records ourselves in a basement we had a tape machine at a hundred dollar tape machine and RadioShack microphones and we recorded our first record like that we did our second record like that our third record like that our fourth record like that and finally we went into the studio danger master and we we knew how to run a mixing desk you know I mean we knew what we liked so if someone came in that wasn't Danger Mouse and was like this or or one of the mix Avengers we've worked with if if someone came in and said the kick drum sounds like shit we'd be like fuck off we know what a kick drum drum can sound like we've been doing this and I think basically if you could spend the time get the time I get that that's why that's why they liked it back in the day it's like you know a record deal a record a band takes years to develop you know I mean it took us it took us eight years before we got a song on the radio of actively making records and touring and a lot of this stuff set up with labels where they want like a hit on the second record you know my I'm married to a woman who's sold millions and millions of albums and of songs that she wrote you know and when she turned in an Americana record like Warner Brothers gave her such to run around the shelves of record that cost 800 grand to make because they said there wasn't any hits on it that's that's no way to be an artist do you know what I mean yeah and so we've just always avoided that so they shelved the record they just didn't even bother trying to release it to cut their losses no man and then they charged her for it and then The Dropper I mean that's that's that's why so they shall vit they never release it yeah they've never really they just drop her yeah dude that's how that that's how they do this shit though archives of these labels are filled up with shit that's been shelved really hell yeah I mean and I don't know the business well my I learned all this stuff early on because my uncle Ralph who Dan mentioned was signed to Warner Brothers in the late 70s he made a record with his band called tin Huey it sold like 5,000 albums you know like failure and then they gave him like 30 grand to fuck off and they made some Retton they made a record in between then and this fuckin Shelton happens all the time how many good records that they have shelved what do they do with them ultimately like if people know about do I think there's a lot of good records but I also think there's a lot of records that started off really good and then pepperdine dude like remix this you need to remix it you need to do that into the at this you need to do this do this some dude just gassing you know yeah it's like it's not hard to just guess it's like if I'm if you're like looking at remodel in your kitchen it's like and you're an idiot you just put the stove here fucked out put it over to the left actually right up redo you know I mean but if you're really a producer musician that makes records and you turn it like you turn in a record it's so frustrated when you get someone that doesn't know what they're doing exactly maybe you should do this I actually had that happen to me there's this band called the sheepdogs this Canadian band they actually this record end up going platinum in Canada and in the US and never even got pushed to radio not not even one song but um like this guy Chad Blake who didn't I work with all the time who's mixed our last four records he mixed this record this guy's like a genius an audio wizard yeah he's a wizard ha he lives in Wales in a little house on his his wife works with horses he's got a little side room just tiny little room just like half the size of this and he mixes huge records so his guys he's a badass this whole records budget was like 60 grand including them living off of it and shit I took the entire budget and let the fur and it was spent on a little cheap studio of some friend of a friend of mine who's gonna engineer it them to live and the rest of it went to Chad to mix it so I get that I get that mixes back in this A&R guys listening to the mixes and it's like I think I think that high hats too loud on this song I'm not joking and I'm I'm on tour how much heard and I'm like I called danger buy something what do I do he's like you know what to do Isaac send him the same mix and label it makes for and tell them it's been lowered to see that's right but then he's like you also need to remember you've you are fucked now they will never service this song because that's the cop-out I say bullshit just watch and it is exactly what happened Mike and I thought of it like a year later and so I did you're fucking genius he's like well I've been through this shit yeah because check it out if you're an A&R guy right you're getting like probably six figures you report to a senior A&R who reports to a vice president who reports to the president and that if you stick your neck out and you say I want to take a million dollars from the fucking machine and I want to I want I bet bet at all in this band or even a quarter million dollars the odds of any band making it I like probably one in a hundred I'm gonna talk about even breaking even so if you're only an idiot would ever really get behind a band that is unproven mm-hmm so you your whole job is to deflect blame here I mean so like that's why that's what the problem is you know like if I was gonna sign a band and someone offer me they said I had a million dollar budget to sign a new band like I also wouldn't give them all the money because there's no way I'd make it back you know I mean yeah but yeah that's the music industry you just fucked up and I need you know you spend years and years and years and if you're lucky like wait dan and I have lucked out and then you look back and it's like I don't even know how how it happened there's all these other factors that come into it you know and you try to help a band one thing that worked for us would never work for another band so there's no there's no formula to it and it's it's really random as I saw it's trying to it's similar to this shit as like this chick I know was talk I was talking about ancestry.com and how she doesn't care about her ancestors house like you don't hear my ancestors that's interesting because like think about the odds a few existing it's like you go back just like 20 generations then that means that you have like over a million grandparents I think it's like 2 million grandparents in just 20 generations they think about all the fucking sperm and eggs and the odds of those each one fucking me happening it took 2 million a million two million people fucking and that happened over and over again to get to your ass you don't give a fuck about any of it I think that's just fucking ignorant obviously like and if you like and if you want to buy into the Elon Musk's simulation remember this that means there's some other fucker sitting at the simulation who made that motherfucker so it's like you don't the simulation hadn't been made by some motherfucker like there's always something deeper that thing about the thing about any thing is it son explicit it's unexplainable the fact that Dan and I grew up next to each other the fact that we were at close in age the fact that we have able to put up with each other's shit and find each other amusing you know after 30 years of knowing each other it's all fucking insane well you guys obviously have a very good balance well if you've been up and down you know but we you know that has to do with a lot of factors like we said you know not over touring is pretty much the big one right that wrecks people yeah yeah that can pretty much take all the art out of you suck all the life out of you fuck up all your relationships yeah you just don't want to be out there anymore no it's our homes our you through the whole thing you don't really buy into the simulation do you me fuck no no but I don't buy like what the same person was saying to me that there are atheists and they that's fine you're allowed to believe that but you you also have to accept that there's possibly that's not true yes and like that's what I believe and but then they went on to say that they believe in demons and I was like I don't know you got it I think my you know that my rationale about all this stuff is that it's it's simple I was talking about to my stepdaughter who's so smart so sweet and really changed my life in a lot of ways and we were swimming in the pool talking about life you know and it's one of these conversations it's like she's like what do you think that there's a God as she asked me and I said well we don't go to church or anything and I said I said I don't know but I think this is something interesting to think about I was like whenever I think about that I try to think about the end of the universe at the very end like the edge and I can't picture it as I can I can't picture as I guess I can't and I can't picture like infinity you know I can't grasp that at all and I said the mere fact that we can't grasp infinity will lead someone like maybe Elon to believe that we're purposely that was left off in some sort of simulation or whatever but maybe that's would be the argument I think that that the fact that I can't picture maybe I'm just an idiot but it makes it that I think that there's maybe something more there's definitely something more to it that possibilities way open but I do think what do you think I had this conversation with a guy who's actually an expert on it it's got Nick Bostrom he was trying to explain to me that because of probability it's more likely or very likely that we're in a simulation because of the probability of someone eventually creating it and that it's very possible that we're in it right now and more probable than not but then what does that I mean there I don't know that simulation has to be a simulation that why would it's why a simulation of what from what well here's something I know for sure okay this is what I know for sure this is by by my own experiences that we are the only people on this planet that have ever gotten to 2019 this is where we are we know there's a history behind us mmm we know that this is the peak we're at 2000 in at a freaky time a man we're at the tooth we're at 2019 right now if we are we know we exist we know we have culture we know we have incredible technology we don't have any idea for the only ones it's likely that there's other life-forms out there it's likely there's other intelligent life out there but there might not be it might be that this is a crazy situation that happens incredibly rarely where you have a planet that's this close to the Sun where these life-forms figure out how to fuck with matter in an incredible way and they start flying and sending things through the air that videos that instantly get to your phone this might not ever happen this might only happen here it might happen here and in versions of here which if you believe in infinity you have to believe there's infinite versions of this so there's infinite versions of life so it's almost built-in mathematically that there's so infinity is so big there's so many possibilities that everything that you've ever recorded has also been recorded by you in another place with infinite variations of each individual song infinite variations of each album that there's infinite versions and that infinite versions of each version and so that's insane the whole thing's impossible for our little ant brains to wrap around it that's possible - it's not it's you know it's unlikely it's a simulation I mean it's possible it's a simulation but it's also possible that this is as far as anything's ever gotten because we're wheels as far as we've ever got Pat and I are starting an intergalactic publishing company yeah we've signed futures the future right Zoology signed you to some universe contract for like a billion years isn't that like part of the deal I think with your figure on the sea or it gets like a billion years service yeah I think it's a billion years and think it's for the whole universe you can't even work another planets I think you know it's interesting to think about when I'm going to talk about something that you don't know the answer to like the simulation or the shore I'm your dimensions and stuff I I think it's all fascinating it's all possible man mmm but I do think when it comes down to it like a part of the thing that causes anxiety is it is it's it's part of it it's like accepting that something is real you know yeah like there's some times when you're having a panic attack or something like it's just even fucking happening this is even fucking real and and I think and I think being in the moment as much as possible if when I really truly feel like I'm living in the present I really feel like you can really feel how special life is yes and how if I was a billionaire and I married the same trick twice I would think I was living in a fucking simulation - that's what I think about you I was like this really fucking smart but he's a billionaire and he married the same chick twice dude you can marry anybody you wanted they gave it a chance I don't know they gave it one more chance - he might be living in a simulation well he might be interfacing with a different dimension than us now he might be I think about all the different sheets I you know my my stepdaughter went to his school for a while uh-oh ad astra it was a really amazing experience for her I believe yeah whatever school's raised that dude where what is that Astra what is that it's a school he has forgets his own school for her some of his children for some of the employees of of his companies really Wow he got his own school oh holy shit I just don't understand how that's all possible how can you dig tunnels under la make batteries make solar power electric cars make rockets shoot them in the space plan to colonize Mars yeah and then marry the same chick twice that's why I did it he didn't have any time to find a new check I think it might as much what might prove that he's a genius just that maybe give it a shot he gave it a shot what if he married her twice and worked out amazing like the second it's worked out really amazing than like a thousand different dimensions both marriages he did it because he needed it to work out in the home create random possibility yeah for no reason just create random possibilities in every direction every decision you make the universe expands is infinite different directions and infinite different versions of you that sounds terrifying but so does falling asleep you know falling asleep is weird we're all agreeing every night I'm looking forward to literally not existing I stopped being there for eight hours I don't I don't see anything I have no idea what's going on around me I think about that all the time so weirdest fucking thing people do man we all are afraid to die but no one's afraid to sleep everybody's looking for sleep I always I always have a couple reoccurring dreams and I haven't that I had one last night that was fucking insane a reoccurring one no it was it was it was based on something that sort of Israel I had this dream where every it was reoccurring where I'm in a house that I'm vaguely familiar with but there's all these additions that I discover and they're always on drop they're usually either really rickety and dangerous or like really beautiful and completely need to be fixed up covered like scooby-doo house type thing last night I had this dream where I was in a house I used to own with my wife and uh like there was a home invasion and I had something that they needed and they basically told me that if I I had it hidden and I said if I they're gonna come back if I didn't give it to him they were gonna kill me and um I was I was like trying to figure out how to keep this thing hidden and I'd still I woke up from it like what the fuck of course I had the PD like I didn't right now babe man oh my god no worries we're gonna talk about you when you're gone but all good things he's gone dude he gets worked up I would have had no idea really no I didn't it would have never thought he gets that worked up oh yeah he just swings he sits on the bus and there's like 9 10 11 12 hours between each gig and he just dude he's just do he sounds like a comic yeah he really does like he's been my you know our personal comic for 20 years seriously I mean he's funny as hell you should definitely do a podcast that would be a huge podcast him just talking shit about things him just analyzing what's wrong with the world I've told him that the corn people are coming though you know that right they're coming for him that to them 20 years of insults on cornfield I worked at the same record shop that he did yeah Quonset hut records I was there when when corn came at midnight sale people were lining up at midnight around the block kids don't understand that there was something interesting about going to a record store and seeing records that you had no idea what they were you'd pick up the album and you'd look at it you'd look at the artwork and like what is this and you flip it over to the back and sometimes you got roped in you know sometimes you get roped in just by a cool album cover it was a beautiful time beautiful beautiful medium do you remember when there were certain stores it would have those little stations and you have a button and you had headphones and you could like put the headphones on and listen to an album for a couple seconds feel like I spent my whole life doing that yeah I mean Pat and I went from city to city when all the record shops did they listen they'll let you listen to the whole album there yeah you could just stand listen it wasn't just like snips of it was the whole listen the whole thing yeah the good record shops were all like that and they always had with great recommendations I mean yeah yeah I don't know it's it's troubling you know like Pat says I mean he's he's thought about it quite a bit well it is in it it's also interesting for new young artists that don't have any distribution they just get viral from SoundCloud or from Twitter that yeah we're funny we are just finding out those metrics they just don't quite matter they don't quite matter in what way they don't sell tickets you know then you know what about guys like I mean it's not your genre but didn't isn't that what chance the rapper did or title the creator which one is it chance the rapper didn't he do it all from the internet sure and he's really huge right yes he's known as an independent artist but he did it yes it's tired of the Creator is a totally different thing okay I'm sorry guys it's Tyler Tyler and I are in touch every once in a while whenever there's a in between first and last name I get you know Tyler the Creator yeah chance the rapper Patrick the drummer those are like poolhall nicknames yeah Rey the fireman yeah you know I don't know much about I mean yeah I think the chance is a good example of like breaking into the industry different and a different thing do you think the way but I I also think that like there's it's just it's just interesting to see how all the stuff shakes out ten years from now who's gonna be around one what does what matters you know I mean back to my wife Michelle Branch she she got she she sold a millions of Records and she's an insanely talented individual and saying the amazing person in the her but her audience was wrote commercial radio you know top 40 and the thing about top 40 is it's like it's the same type of person that goes to watch whatever's popular on television or keeping up with the kardashians like someone who watches Keeping Up with the Kardashians is probably not familiar with Gilligan's Island you know I mean and five years from now and there's something different than keeping up with all probably not that show price still of your own but you don't I'm saying they just it's like it's a it's whatever's freshest and newest and so you end up if you if you end up developing a pop this is why we're talking knocking I want to get put it on the radios because it's a different type of fan it's a less personal type of fan when you get play it on top 40 mm-hmm it's like you know when you go through when I'll go through like certain friends of Mines parents records they'd have like all these records oh yeah I used to listen to that used to listen to that used to listen that and I go through dance dad's records or my dad's records my dad would be still listening to that shit when is that these people were buying like Billy ocean records yeah my dad was buying like cream records and he was a fan of music and this person was a passive pop fan hmm you know and I think that what you're experiencing is when you try to compare pop maybe some of this pop stuff has some sort of credibility because it's independent or whatever but um I think they're very it's a very weird thing trying to figure it out like I think in a festival nowadays is probably fucking really crazy that's why the Woodstock thing was fucking they didn't know what to do they booked the back when we were told about the festivals like we were gonna headline Saturday night when the Hawaiian up came out it was like chance the rapper us and I forget who lost was on it but there were a couple people there like three headliners and like that's that's insane like what are you thinking you're gonna sell 150,000 tickets it's 700 dollars a pop fuckin idiot just do a festival for 30,000 people do two Festival two weekends do a Pop Festival do a rap festival do rock do whatever it is but don't get you hit you're out there obligation per night was like 10 million and guarantees or something so they fucking dumbass it's like you're like I wonder why the fuck that was it with that guy he fucked up the first Woodstock and it's 50 years later he hasn't fucking figured it out yet that 50 years will you get it in 50 years dude Mike you'll get it 50 years now you'll figure it out buddy you know it's like that idea this repeating shit that doesn't make sense is like we've all done it but like even Eiland done it do you think that the music business is the way it is because it started out a different thing do the it was a different thing it was how they made the records it was the actual records they would put them in the stores but all that shit's gone now so it's just mostly downloads the music business is the way it's set up the way it is because there are independent people who have made very successful careers without having to engage the Machine right but traditionally if you wanted to sell out Madison Square Garden traditionally there are people like fish or whoever who have done it based on the backs of whatever things that they've done but traditionally if you want to make a record and you want to get Sebastian Square Garden you need promotion you need radio you need exposure you need publicity you need now almost all of that stuff you can get for free if you have like enough bullshit up your sleeve on social media you can get enough 13 year old streaming your shit you get to fucking MSG without a label without a publicist without any of that shit the you know a band like us in a situation that we're in now like you know we we can were in a position to be able to look at the music industry music this is this is just crazy that we're paying this person this much money to do what they're doing this is fucking insane and like you we can really talk have open conversations with like people like we're not giving you Warner Brothers $5 of record to bundle this shit because what we're paying you to be on your record label so that we get a fucking number on sound skin that ultimately you'll brag about like fuck all this fuck it but no but you can't do that that's a way that this power strong is still set up is that if you're on a label you you both bands sign these record deals they got to give that fucking money back to the label it's a 360 deal they got fucking not only that but they get access to your ticket sales like straight up like profit that's weird well it's always that was always where the musicians made money entirely there's up until streaming right I mean that did people cut record labels in on any ticket sales before that no in fact it used to be set up where a tour was a loss leader for to sell a record yeah that's why you'd see bands like I don't know fucking huge bands in the 70s bad company or whoever they would they would sell fucking huge ass fucking stadiums for like three dollars ticket maybe have a bunch of support sell a couple million records find out the manager stole the fucking money you know write a memoir about it that's it it's like the it's like a little bit time you know yeah it's like I come from like a indie rock background and it's always it was a sort of like and and us too and it's like you know when we're coming up with bait even kind of having any knowledge of the business it was like it was considered uncool do you don't you think so a little bit it's considered on school to know finances and they had to kind of really know like like what you know now what you just described the way you yeah but we've always been fascinated by it so I've always paid attention to it but it's funny now where I'm just like realizing you know like what this whole take we took a break for off the road for four years and when we came back three years after a break to make a record it was like we again we we had gleaned a lot of perspective you know and our conversations when we first charted making this record aside from like watching the news and talking about that and left making each other laugh at shit but it was like this band is something very really fucking special you know I mean the fact that we're sitting in this room you know eighteen years after after starting this band and it fucking working out and we're here we need to make sure that this band is always something that's fun and not a burden and not stressful as little should it be stressful it should be fun it's rock and roll yeah and I think that we've been spending the last year figuring out how to make every decision so that that way you know so like first this show we write do you want to do this TV show this TV show they know we want to do we have one out we both watch the Joe Rogan listen to Joe Rogan I happen to watch it but we want to do Joe's podcast you know I mean that's what we want to do that's what's important to us we don't want to play Woodstock it's not important to us does speak to us these are the things we want to do and taking that type of position with the band and also looking at the business side of it like this is fucking bullshit this is ridiculous you know what what what what what this band should be giving us is the ability to help other bands which is what we do all day long when we're not touring I mean in the last five years dance produced probably like 15 albums for other artists I've done a handful of myself he has a label puts out other people's music there's a lot of fucking work everyone we're not true and we're still working on other music and the craziest thing is this we stole millions of records we've made between the two of us something like 60 plus albums when I haven't finished a record I'm really proud of and I sent it to Warner Brothers the last time I did that they didn't even fucking respond to the email when that when that shit happens to you you know what you want to do tell them to fuck themselves you know what I mean and right now we're in a situation where our record contracts done you know and I saw what happened to my uncle Ralph do you need a contract no fuck no it doesn't seem like you do what we need is what we need we need people to work with people who understand that the Black Keys is is very important to us but it's also a vehicle that we can leverage to help our other artists when we're producing shit and it's so fucking infuriating to have been in this business for 20 years and honestly understand the business better than most fucking managers and be treated like dogshit by this person that you've made millions of dollars for do you know I mean well it doesn't make any sense that you need anything like that all you guys need to do is have studio fees or if you have your own studio produce the music and then once people know your shit is out nobody it's different because check it's different we don't need shit but if you take a new artist from Nashville you say and you make a record for them okay okay they need a agent they need they need they need they need to go on tour right they need to do all the stuff that we did but we we were like malnourished fuck freaks we were we were we were losing money the whole time we were able to lose money I rent was 145 dollars where we started and we practice in my basement and then lived in his parents house we didn't have we could we could make like $200 a month and be in the rest or in the black Wow no one else is like that's not realistic no you know so if you really want to well here's what's really want to start but if you want to help why isn't it realistic I mean it's realistic what why is it more realistic to go get in $60,000 worth of debt and not be able to get more fucking time well I'm just saying that most bands aren't two pieces most bands aren't like right we're human cockroaches like when we first started dancing then dams like I need wonton soup every day that's what I need three dollars and fifty cents I don't want on sue I need a pack of cigarettes Wow but you have to do them so you do need some finance listen you you you have to answer right in front of you you're a great talker if you just developed a podcast where you played new music and then talk shit the way you do now it would be gigantic maybe you just go on the road just do Pat and Dan you could call it Pat and Dan on the road and you guys just do it from your tour bus or wherever you just let him wind him up let him talk shit about things and then play music like music that you really enjoy if someone like Spotify wouldn't jump on something like that they'd be crazy it's a great idea and you could use it as a platform to help artists avoid the system entirely I'm thinking that might work but also it would work if we just tweet at Mark Zuckerberg that we need one hundred and forty five million dollars he'd probably do it probably just a good deal if someone wanted to do something like that it's a great idea because you can use it to launch like like I've done with comics on this podcast you find people that are funny let everybody know it's not hard get it get a group of people that are really interesting keep the conversations go and keep more cool people coming in and then you can use that to help other cool people and let everybody know you could do it through your social media you do it through a podcast and of course you you guys are still gonna do the same stuff you're already doing with producing people and helping them out but you definitely could have your own distribution network but be ethical free ethical quandary is free like you don't have to think about it you just give it to him for free you just do it as a podcast to broadcast him hey check out this fucking band I love it I love this song play it down that would help a lot with a exposure to new music yeah but I mean I think I guess what I'm saying is they're gonna need an agent to bookshop well yeah but I'm saying but what I do think is what I'm saying well the music industry what is actually what something that I think that I think we're trying to figure out now is basically how to actually really work again truly independently you know I mean where is something that we can figure out a way to actually do the things we're passionate about which is a lot of it is making records and trend and helping and even to make a record impress it is you know it's like it's at least ten ten thousand dollars you know I mean mm-hmm so I guess what I was trying to say was like you despair someone will look at your work and respected enough to kind of step in and help out because it's not like you're asking for a fucking millions of dollars a year to finance some shit you're asking for like a couple hundred grand but that's the problem with the music industry is that so is that certain labels are willing to give like a SoundCloud rap or like 15 million dollars you know but then they look at a band and they can't quantify their metrics like maybe the Black Keys or whoever and they they don't give a shit they'll help me out with this I don't understand it what do they provide but at this point to us physical distribution which is something the physical distribution of like a Vaughn LP that's crazy though how much is that yeah but I mean a lot of people buy them no no no no I mean for us really it isn't it isn't tons there's some marketing there's some stuff like that but honestly I mean we we get more from like Live Nation probably mm-hmm so they what does a record company do then like if you're a young artist they get you this Gary they scare you and handing over the shit that they need and then they sign you to a long-term contract is that how it works and then they pray you have a hit they pray you have a hit and if you do and you want to leave then you're fucked and then if you don't it say that if they don't think so and I think that you want to leave and you got two records left they shelve that record and take over that oh yeah that's what they do it just doesn't seem did we have this guy I guess he does check this out we had the stood who was president of a label at one point it got back to me he was taking credit for our success he wasn't even around when we broke yeah I mean and the credit he was taking was the most genius fucking credit this is how this is how smart these fucking people are he's like he said yeah man you know I don't think I really I really take a lot of pride in that band and really helped them a lot by just staying out of the way whoo he didn't even write a check for tour support or no promotion he's taking credit because he was smart enough not to fuck it up yeah I mean it's like I take personal credit like a Bojangles chicken for them being successful or or the new the new the new popeyes chicken sandwich I take a long you prostate I take a lot of credit though net chicken sandwich man because I didn't buy one I didn't fuck it up I didn't like put the wrong post up but that's a way better attitude at least a working attitude than the guy from Pepperdine who wants to fuck with the high hat wouldn't you prefer that guy who just gets the fuck out of the way I would say those are the two options didn't ya yeah all day I mean is he taking credit for it or is he just he's kind of bragging that he works with you taking credit but I think a little bit of credit will go to credit a little annoying to you dude there's a lot of credit that gets taken for a lot of shit didn't it seems like a fucking frustrating and infuriating business and I glad I'm glad enough to participate as comics there's no business wait we've like we're like in the fucking top point zero zero one percent of this shit and still fucking annoying every single fucking day it's just like it's that the trick to the music industry is to is to it's because if you really love music like the way that Dan and idea where it is the still the thing that were most passionate about you mean like I love music I only think about music listen to it all day but yet you have to find that fine line where like you don't win like you make a record you're really proud of and no one fucking hears it and no one that works with you even responds to an email about it you have to find that space where you don't want to kill everybody you know I mean and you still want to go make another record and that do you need to be connected to someone like this though does this is this a valuable thing in your world what to have this record company no no I mean not right so you can't let all this go right and don't do it anymore though the trick is to find to find out how to still learn learning that's the industry changes is to learn how to pivot and make it make it have it make sense so the real problem is young talent that's just getting started that gets signed when they don't really know their worth yet and they don't know how probably the problem is is that no one is investing in fucking real bands they're investing in like a songwriter they're invested in an artist that was a puppet that like they can go and like say this person's gonna listen to this right do this shit like a pop machine do you think that you could do it ethically that you could do it your way look I said you have the time for something like that if I was to run a record label the main difference would be that I would look at it as I let's try to fucking break even let's realize that some of the most important records here have never sold a million copies like The Ramones never sold a million copies of any of the records there may be the most influential punk band so what is this redefine what success is success is getting behind art that we really are proud of and not and not getting trampled and not getting the support that it needs this all seems doable yeah but then what you're describing with you seems dual but then think about this this is the problem this is the crux is and you think about the Ramones and you realize this is a bandits word in a van for 20 fucking years do you want to subject a band to that no you want to be able to elevate that band to the point where they're actually doing that comfortably yeah I mean and that's the hard part you mean can you though I think they'd be the same band not always right I think that you could yes it's possible depend upon the individual dude that's what Metallica has these therapists they're trying to figure out not a fucking figure I don't you think that part of what you guys are is your background when you were paying 125 bucks a month for rent and you were you know you were living with your parents so this is part of why you guys were so good because you fucking really wanted it you needed it you had to get to a better place we had no other options yes but I think there's what we got that flavors the music I think that's what we do when we try to work with people we see that same quality and other people mmm so people have already been down that road artists that are working with now people like Yola and people like Dee white do this as it changes all these people they're just ornery and they want it this is begging for an organization like your your passion for them important we're already sort of doing it where I should have a radio station or a podcast that just talks about these new albums and what's going on and what you're doing and I'm sure people would fucking love it and just play music play the music that you guys are producing play music that you enjoy that you find out about I mean it seems like there's a real easy fix for this angst I don't think there is because it's been going on for a little tease but for you there's a fix at least there's a better path for some of the HP Pink's is important because it is uh it's valid I'm also not Bert also by the way not that angsty but what I do talk about the business I get a little angsty but I I have a pretty chill individual to be honest most of the time but when I look how many business is so much easier well you know I mean we get to use it in our music yeah yeah I'm sure the drive is like the thing it's like you know right when I found this photograph that I just hung up in my road case up dan and I playing one of our first shows I'm like oh this is important I should be I should make sure I have this hung up because it just reminds me of all the fucking days that we spent like being fucking miserable in a van because we love music so much we go play a show for fucking nobody and maybe make enough money to get like a motel 6 room share a bed get up the next day and go to Waffle House I keep fucking doing it for years and years and years and you but it does take that type of motivation and itself it's frustrating when you do that and then you get to a point where it is the point that we're at and you feel like you've gotten really good at what you do and you help another artist and it's you realize that like after all that work it's like the myth of Sisyphus it's like Oh after all that work it doesn't move the fucking clock at all still these same motherfuckers are fucking are fucking helping you know and then you start realizing like what really has made a difference I mean I've heard I've heard people say take credit for our success be say that it was because we played the Spike Spike TV Video Game Awards what about eight that is watched that's what I thought I thought that made you you know but did that's the kind of thing that you're up against it's like yeah and that's that's the fear of the music industry that's the fear of worse like and we we we said yes to everything because we had all we were a band for like eight years then finally we started breaking and it was a it was like for the first time here's the offer for SNL here's the offer to have Leung Coachella here's the offer we had to say yes to everything even a Spike TV Video Game Awards and even especially when like someone's like you really should do it you really need to do it in fact if you don't do it like when we're standing there with with Hulk Hogan mm-hmm it was working it's worth it for that right but the point is is that what actually moves the needle what actually moves the news like there's a is it plain Colbert is it playing these things I don't fucking know man because I I watched baseball and then I put on your podcast and then I go to bed that's what I'll do it in the evening so I don't know who watches that shit but I know that I know my stepdaughter doesn't watch that shit I know she doesn't even out of work the fucking TV remote she watches YouTube all day you know I mean the times are fucking changing you know and I think that it's that's the hard part trying to pivot with it and I think if if you're it's like guys our age who are running these labels looking at these few counts in the shit and they're all fucking getting it wrong well they're getting it wrong because their businesses money their business is not music they're in the music business to make money you guys are in it to make music that's why I'm saying dude you do it you got to start your own thing it's it's a fucking no-brainer it's so easy for you to do you are you're obviously a great talker you're obviously very opinionated and you have a great love for music well we're gonna restart the BMG music great they'll be called the DP TB TB k like t became the music club but it's awareness what we're gonna do is you send us $0.38 will send you 50 albums and your parents will then write us a letter saying that you entered a contract as a minor and let's avoid it how do you guys write songs do you write them and you come to each other independently do you do you collaborate like only in studio do you write them in studio we've for the most part always just made them up just improvise them like in the move in the moment mmm and then said you liked it let's try to put this down again just sort of gravitate towards what we like and then just start building on it and all the stuff that doesn't work just push it away and just keep going forward do you have disagreements on what works or doesn't work when you're really no not usually it's always been like that ever since we were 16 and 17 wow yeah I've never really I don't think the older I get the more I realize how special that is you know I always took it for granted I mean I remember when we were trying to audition bass players we had this one guy try to come and play with us and I just remember it just fucked everything up it's like we couldn't even play it didn't even sound like us mm-hmm why it just didn't work and then wasn't when this other person left all of a sudden it sounded like a big band again huh it was weird I mean we learned to play together I I never even played never I mean I never played drums with anybody aside from it dan and me even playing drums in the band it's like because it was a kind of an accident I only had a drum set because I wanted to be a guitar player and I wanted people to come to my house and play the drums with before I had a driver's license I got a job washing dishes and bought this truck I bought everything you need for a band and like my friends would come over and they were all pretty much better at guitar than me but Dan came over and he was like the best guitar player of all my friends and I was like fuck what do I do with bass or drums I was like well you can't just jam guitar bass I sat down at the drums and that's what we did in high school so we learned to play together man so because of that there's like there is like a psychic kind of connection mm-hmm you know I mean we play now on stage with a couple other guys and it's it's it's good it's easy it's fun but there is something when the two of us start playing where it is we can like work in between beats you know it's pretty liquid our goal has never been like to be this tight kind of rigid like don't know I mean like tightness isn't something it's more about like the energy the feeling it's hard to describe but it's like yeah we never worried about if we got it perfect we always it was always does that this is the one that feels best hmm always what motor sport do you write the lyrics down do you write the music down once I made it I'll write lyrics sometimes I'll improvise words a lot of the new record was a lot of like improvising syllables and words really yeah yeah yeah there's just no rules absolutely no rules but a lot of times I'll be trying to UM be singing a melody while I'm doing chord changes but I can see Pat you know that's the thing that we've always done we've always been able to see each other when we play and record so you know and go with his movements and follow him that way so you guys just know each other so well you well you know we hadn't we hadn't been in the studio there for five and a half years and we didn't do any pre-production or anything and the very first idea that we had made the record yeah Wow I mean it's just that's a crazy man crazy connection yeah man that's so unusual it really is the older I get the more I realized that well you guys have been together for so long and this the thing with bands is like this is my first band it's at first I was never in another like the black he was like the first real band knows it first real ban I've been in it's so great so I didn't know any different I thought all I danced felt like this so you know what I mean that's the saddest thing when you see bands in the lead guitar players mad singer and you know it's like Oh guys come on really yeah it's always over some dumb shit it's usually like someone's wife is yep fucking mean yeah wasn't that what the date the David Lee Roth hey we've been through then shit man we've been through it and move it's like it's hard it's hard you know I mean like oh yeah if if I could go back in time and give like our 22-year old selves one piece of advice it would be like don't probably don't tour with your girlfriends until you like have a kid and they come out for a couple shows this avoid that shit and also probably like don't don't really have a girlfriend till you're like in your late 20s probably mmm what's the problem with touring with the girlfriend dude it's just a codependent motherfucker like me that it was just really hard I had to get through I've grown up a lot you know I mean but yeah it's just hard that's like the hard part is that I'm up for the work and Dan's up for the work and when we're on tour like that was going through I go through periods of time where I get phone calls to be like what the fuck are you doing motherfucker you know no like I miss you like that guilt or it's just like I'm like literally in the back of a for to convey like with like a torn-up copy of TV Guide reading it for the fifth time because we don't make money no cell phone or like with a Nokia phone like I get in the guilt trip and stuff it's like too real to even talk about our first two are a number Dan having to stop with the payphone Wow they have you at the pay phone in our like big I remember didn't like my brother Mike was with us I think a man like sucks to be Dan and then like literally like an hour later I really I have to get to pay for myself know NASA's been but you have to go through that you have to learn to appreciate a good relationship you got to go through those where the fuck are you really I mean that's the thing is like it's well I guess what does it kill you makes you stronger although I read somewhere that's not actually true so I'm shaky fuck's your body up in something here just takes two years off your life maybe it didn't kill you yeah took a decade off your longevity you know that's why that's why we're able to get to the spot where here we are 2019 and we're I don't think we're insane people we're pretty close to the same people we were when we were in our twenties still wearing some insane t-shirts I'm not because there's way too small for me but yeah you know I think that there's there's a time like maybe 2012 our shit was really blowing up I mean we could do no wrong and uh there was a there's there's there's the alternate universe for sure what we sure did to complete dickhead [Laughter] we died multiple times at the Chateau it's like yeah and this it is in this version of reality dan and Patrick don't play the Spike TV video game words they overdose at the Chateau Marmont yeah yeah do you mean you have to appreciate though that you guys have gone through quite the gauntlet it's pretty amazing I think that the best thing that ever happened to us is that we did an experience 6 success to our 6th album and when and what it is because if we would have got that we're 23 we would have never been able to sit down and realize what what fuck was going on yeah yeah everything everything about us has been just for ridiculous synchronistic yeah but it's also that kind of luck and timing and rightfully that's where the simulation comes in bro that's just where the that's I think that's just we're like the uniqueness and the crazy thing that's the crazy thing about life is that it is certain things are rare it shouldn't be that crazy that erases it like Danone eyes is so rare but it is right there aren't that many of them right but I mean there are a lot of like friends who start off playing music but they end up most of those stories ends like in either just failure giving up hating each other hmm or some shit version of that you know so that but yeah simulation I mean the simulation there has to be a simulator to play the simulation on and that's the problem it could just be were confused about what reality is in general it might be the reason why we think of the simulation is because it exists in so many different planes and it's probably always shifting all around us all the time and some of the way you think does have some effect on the world itself well I used to wake up in the morning and like drink a cup of coffee smoke a cigarette play a video game jam on my drums drive around hang out my friends now I I wake up and I do so much shit and none of it isn't necessarily stuff I want to be doing that I do think that there's no way we're in a simulation because I would never fuck you know simulated that you don't get to choose well you go through why am I then my mouse over Twitter if you if you just decided that it was a simulation you said well I don't like this discourse I want to shift some things about it it would probably be easier to do if you knew it was a simulation than it would be to shift them in your own life imagine there's doing too many things I'm just gonna take these I'm gonna phase these out and piss these people off ya know I that's why I think we're not living this simulation because every time I do make a decision to change something it gets better mmm so you're learning and growing in real time yeah real time I mean it it might be a lot of them telling you it's the biggest argument against the simulation I'm telling you is that Elon Musk married the same Woman twice yes straight up it said that you want a physicist to say that my dude has this jury my senator Sean Carroll yeah set it to him see what you could do it tell to crack the numbers on that shit yeah there's seven there's 3.5 billion women on earth and this guy married the same person twice the state circle think about that dude she's baby a probably a wonderful woman dude yeah yeah I'm not saying I'm just saying that maybe I missed her you know yeah it is kind of crazy but hey I don't know like some hazing that's like when you look at like I mean I've been married three times like a dickhead but it's like if you go cause if you look at my Wikipedia it's like I always joke like I had to get to wife number three just so I could like have that like kind of in steel fucking Wikipedia but it is like guys like that Ben Stiller you look like oh he's married to the same woman from 8485 back 88 to 89 back again yeah like who does that nice to drink Larry King does that shit yeah Larry King he just got divorced again at 85 I saw him left yeah we saw him last night is he partying a bunch of checks he was actually drinking champagnes the dad no it's very here might look very old okay yeah he doesn't look that healthy like this is postures not that no not that robust tits that way yeah that's that thing where you get to that age and you just have to like they get forced to just drink slimfast all the fucking day it's a bummer to think that someone's getting divorced at 85 but then part of me goes well is it a more of a bummer to be in a terrible relationship when you're 85 it's probably a better relief like if you're if you're fucking throwing in the towel at 85 you're done I mean you're like really I'm so tired and I can't do there's just done at 85 to throw that shit we all the work it takes just one woody there are 85 that goes to the ocean and just Chuck's his cell phone and fuck you flash whole new phone new carrier fuck you go stir what if he marries her again next year I could say that was no prenup be they could see how he he might marry a previous wife it's if she was gonna take care of him in his last couple years and they were close still yeah that would make sense Richard Pryor had that going on towards the end of his life he was being taken care of by one of his previous wives yeah I can see that that's sweet that's kind of like pretty sure that's like an Oprah bestseller it was definitely one of his wives I might have fucked that story up definitely one was why I just didn't believe it the way you told it that it that way in some in some simulation it is that way yeah that's a beautiful way of getting away with some sort of facts like what if troll 1 was part of troll 2 I've been like oh shit different dimension right well troll 2 is like the almost evidence of something wrong like like the the simulation has been like there's a problem in the record that's been put out of a terrible movie forgot they didn't put out the prequel do you know do you know who our Harmony Korine um he wrote the movie kids and spring breakers he drove while he's friends of ours and he was telling me this thing that blew my mind like five years ago he's like there's this movie called the peanut butter solution if you've heard of it no you think dude he's like everyone who watched this movie as a kid it it was made and aired on TV in Canada he's like oh look at the YouTube comments it's crazy and I went and looked at all the comments the same like oh my god I watch this as a kid and I forgot the whole thing I just now remembering it everyone every comment was that what he's like dude it was like mass hypnosis the way it was edited it's like that it kind of created everyone to like forget that they were watch it that they saw it and uh maybe maybe there is a troll one did he say I forgot it took it away no oh you know what it was it was troll hunter that's what it was right not to came out 2010 now yes that's the movie I'm talking about yeah that's the schlocky movie yeah pulled that up that's that's what I was thinking it's probably inspired by troll to troll hunter was these guys that were like trying to find these trolls and then you know it was just like just at the point in time before drones were effective he kind of bought in that there was no aerial way of finding this thing that you had to wait for it to pop out of the woods that's like I found footage movie right yeah yeah yeah found footage but with special effects of a giant troll that comes out of the forest as tall as the trees and it's so stupid it might be better then that of the terrible movie because it's silly yeah here's the trailer so these people like well yeah we're gonna find it so revealing don'tdon't get to the troll bro where is it that it yeah there it is see it was giant chasing these fucking no no Jesus look it there it is oh shit see so it's like found-footage but with special effects fun fucking stupid movie yeah you know like you never really scared that someone's gonna die cuz none of them are real people in your mind that's not that kind of movie nice it's like they could do whatever they wanted those people so that was what I remembered I just couldn't so maybe that was it maybe that was troll 2 with those two put those with little trolls troll - is there like human size yeah okay so I mean it's really incredible film the first half of it the rest of it I would not recommend it actually Dan's brother again all takes place in this town called nilbog which is even one of the best parts is that it it takes place in a town called no bog and the little kid like sees the sign in the rearview mirror like nilbog is goblin backwards so it's actually about God talk to us about goblins so Dan's brother had them personalized plate Ohio plate said nilbog so yeah my brother Jeff and that is hilarious that's hilarious but through the rear view mirror man said Goblin pretty genius that is very smart I mean if you need that in your life you need to be tricking people with work that's the way to do it for all about goblins it's a weird thing to fixate on it's weird my brother's strange strange character very strange do you know they have those new plates they're like digital plates and then if someone steals your car just says stolen that's cool it's weird though they're like a screen that projects the numbers and the letters weird yeah and then knock into that well for sure and and also they could track you like for sure they're tracking you because if it gets stolen and then they know exactly where it is so that's my favorite thing on earth is when someone like unfollowed you on Instagram like I'll shit my phone was hacked not a phone hacking is going on yeah well isn't that there was a woman who worked for CNBC who said her website was hacked wrote a bunch of homophobic shit by people say their account was hacked like guess what all they did they didn't go in there and push Russian websites that you know sell sex dolls no no they went in there just edited a few things to make you look like a piece of shit yeah but the Jag was a bunch of racist shit imagine if Jack was just fucking with people who's like watch this I'm gonna see my account was hacked and I'm just gonna get fucking crazy like Jack it's probably like those cops that want to kill people after a while he's just he's so fed up with the system and then when censoring people and just all these people getting deep platforms that he wants to just jump on and drop end bombs [Music] was an inside plot like you just decides look I'm gonna hack myself just so I can see the most ridiculous shit cuz no one's been arrested right no see if you were gonna hack the CEO of the biggest fucking social media platform in the world wouldn't you think to be a goddamn ruthless investigation they would send the Mossad after those kids like who did it who dropped the end bomb on Jack's Twitter page they'd find that person yeah it's like it they're worth a million dollars they'd hunt them down that's the play it's the playbook for it in step one one just my account was hacked yeah it's a move well I got one put one like literally it's like people like I just hang out with at the bar say that like I did get my my gmail account stolen once that did happen I was like wow someone can do that they just steal your Gmail dude I got 65,000 the emails unread emails in my account I like love for someone has to hack into that shit ain't nothing interesting in it all my emails are cool period sounds good period sitting around writing thoughtful s emails that is not me I don't have time that shit being thoughtful I call you on the phone if I need to oh my god yeah my shit was hacked in what did they do with it no my shit was that I know I'm smelling what they do what did they do they hacked in your was it your Twitter what was it they hacked in there and they found a direct message to you asked if we could be on the show did they say some fucked up shit about corn yeah if it's dude when I got in my last Twitter well I've had two Twitter incidents one was with Justin Bieber and one was early on I tweeted like and Earth doesn't like 2010 I tweeted like something so stupid not even funny like Madonna's crush I were on a tour bus and like me to drive it to a show and SNL was on I said oh Madonna's crushing it on SNL and it was Lady Gaga that was the fucking joke but I a year later it wasn't even like funny and she wasn't like that famous I wasn't laughs that's funny well a year later some like Gaga monster found it I was like you know go kill yourself mmm and I just I think I was one of the first people to maybe take this I mean take this tactic I started just retweeting the most vile shit that was like your fucking asshole kill yourself and I just would retweet it and it was like a once again right with atop this bolt like before there's like the thing before the me too is the bullying thing don't stop boy and it was just like these people were just like fucking crushing me on there and I started that's when I started being like fuck Twitter man like fuck it well people will also say that your bullying if you retweet it because your siccing your twitter mob on them yeah but like you could spin anything however you want to do it but my Twitter mob was like fucking at the time was like three thousand people in Ohio yeah it's Lodge yeah but then you know the Justin Bieber thing happened and it was like I just I realized at that point like it's a real uh like hey these are all kids these are a lot of these people are just fucking idiots like you shouldn't like you would be if you were 13 yeah if I was 13 it was like spout off anything like all these kids like are gonna add some thyme some point get at a corporation so I was gonna go through their shit deep and like get called into the office what do you see what's happening with Justin Trudeau the Prime Minister of Canada yeah they found brown face so he was dressed in a suit how did they find all three of them the same fuckin day well some I was searching for some shit you know mid but it's he was in a costume in 1981 and we're upset we really anything they make people were at real tweets were saying that he should be horrified by this racism like is he is he just in a costume because it seems like he's just in a costume pretending these an Arabian guy is that really racist is called Arabian Nights yeah was it I mean maybe ours insensitive now today but in 1981 guess what no one cares did a 1981 the one of the biggest films I think are not biggest a big film was uh so Silver Streak my brother will older brothers obsessed with trains back he works for Amtrak now but in that movie there's a scene where Gene Wilder has to put on blackface yes and um you know that of course we've never gone now and I could see I said well if I defend it but at the time when I saw that for the first time when I was six or seven like you know that was a different time do you member see Thomas how soul man remember that movie yeah those like in the 90s played I who pretended to be black to go to a certain school do you remember that I remember that a 2001 though not at 1981 just declare which one did Justin Trudeau stuff here's like 10 1981 yeah oh it happened in 2000 yeah yeah 18 years ago oh why does anyone where they here was anyone maybe I just repeated dumb numbers but what I don't know man I I've never worn a black face and I sure as fuck would remember it if I'd ever put it on that's why I don't think I don't remember that pulling that movie soul man what thomas Howell who was it that said they couldn't remember wearing it someone that got in trouble a lot of person before oh yeah who was that that was like a senator it's somebody from Kentucky I don't know I could tell you everything I was for Halloween that I was Orville Redenbacher [Music] pussy this is see thomas Howell and that's when he's he's the white guy and I forget what exactly it was tanning pills to get into school is that what it was you took tanning pills oh my goodness to get into a school he took tannic pills I've been the Harvard of some college or something like that oh okay so and then screwed ahead to when he turns into a black fellow and also did you see my Garrity's did you see what he was talking into what was he talking to a noose oh Jesus so he's gonna kill himself because he took too many tanning pills practice he couldn't get that College oh right well I took the tanning pills getting go but go to the picture of Hill who's looking in the mirror but imagine if you decide you gotta make this movie shit Jesus imagine if you're gonna make this movie today oh my god they would hang you is that Julie Liu this was like a harmless movie in 1990 whatever it was when this movie came out this was an absolutely harmless movie that nobody protested about nobody cared it was really obvious what was going it was not a not a great movie but nobody cared imagine if you put that movie out today dude oh my god and you know I was thinking about the other day I was thinking about how fucking insane Doogie Howser is I was like if I was fucking sick and a twelve-year-old was like seriously that's right he was a doctor he's a fucking 12 real doctor everybody get the fuck out of here motherfucker yeah like seriously but doctor was he dude I don't know but then I realized something I was like that it like this not only was he a doctor but like he every night after the day he was he would sit down at his computers journal and to his journal which is I know for a fact that like I don't know for a fact but I'm pretty sure that the whole basis of sex in the cities is based on that do you Doogie Howser I think they I think that they are connected you know how like they say that Family Matters is a and off of South Park Simpson perfect strangers perfect strangers the elevator door manners why was Adam strange rattling off different cartoons perfect perfect strangers is supposed to take place in the same universe as Family Matters but I do think sex in the city takes place in the same universe as Doogie Howser and maybe if you think of oh what's that guy that she's always trying to date that just had mr. big maybe mr. BIG's Doogie Howser as an adult uh yeah never know never know I never connected those two I don't think I ever watched an episode of Doogie Howser and I've only reluctantly watched an episode lesson City clowns on it a couple years younger than you so we were subjected to that shit but now kids don't even watch that there's three channels when we were kids yeah kids barely watch TV anymore what is it he was a second-year resident surgeon even cutting into people for a year already oh my god yeah kids today are not listening they are rather not watching anything they're watching things on their computer and then watching things on their their phone they think that somewhere around fifty percent of what you're getting on Netflix these days kids are watching on their phone yeah look YouTube's a big one too is it did you say this podcast most of it people watch on the phone 60% 60% on the phone and now they have phones like the galaxy note 10 is just all screen device you know you can actually enjoy it you can you watch something at six point eight inches it's like a little TV yeah I mean they're watching movies on them being on tour being on the bus it's a it's amazing really be honest it is incredible but when you guys tour do you always go bus to bus city to city or do you do fly city city or just always do the bus thing here's the here's the thing about touring is like it's a Dan walks in it's like man I fucking hate the fucking bus what happens is a typically a manager says oh you don't need to fucking you you just fucking fly private dude you hub out of this we'll hop out of Jackson Hole West Coast dude yeah fucking great the trip that the thing is is that the managers still getting the same same cut of whatever you're making you're just spending all of your cash like the most genius thing you can do in the music business if you're if your music business mat if your manager or business manager is to get your client to spend all their money because I just have to work more and your shit comes off the top yeah I mean you're playing three-dimensional music business chess yeah create a personal chef and a trainer and everything yeah I imagine to go off crash a Ferrari on stage every day then just be like Ted Nugent get a buffalo I need the buffalo I have I have a I have a buffalo ahead of my house too Ted Nugent gave you gave him a shell really wow that's huge 68 he killed him 68 really hmm 1968 that's what he told Michelle's brother was his a drum tech per year for a while shit Wow yeah it's a good way to end this podcast I know with that dude we did like three and a half hours Jesus it's 3:30 damn I'm telling you I had to piss us you need to do this you need to do your own a hundred percent and I think you could it could serve a great function what's so easy to do with us come on here again any time you want but it's so easy for you to do your own I mean you can get one of those little fucking zoom because there's a zoom mic right done it or sure make some like a bunch of different companies already yeah I'm sure you do and just get on the bus and with the ambient sound on everything it would actually be kind of cool to hear that and just talk shit and people would fucking love it and you could have that be like the interstitial in-between great songs that you love I'm not getting out opposed things good idea I think we've talked about it's I think it's an amazing idea yeah cheese yeah man all right you're gonna do it thank you for being here take love you guys thank you very much bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
