that's a weird thing to see someone have that because there's a there's an amazing like confidence that you have to have or like at least you have to get yourself to that place yeah to like you know compete in MMA like you said without looking at the side of the road and when you see that broken I mean I saw that uh that Ellen interview with Ronda Rousey yeah that was so crazy to me that really made me go like maybe she shouldn't fight it for a little while like I don't know if she I like she needs some more time off because this she went from being the like I'm gonna kill everyone no one has a right to beat me don't be a be nothing bitch and being that chick to being like I wanted to kill myself I gotta just have Travis Brown's babies I was like whoa she's gone from being this like untouchable mm-hmm I mean not even like she was like the best female fighter it was like don't even she's wrecking chicks in a second mm-hmm and then to seeing her kind of broken well it's interesting is these themes play themselves out over and over again and the traps are all there but everybody keeps going for the candy and they keep getting caught in the traps the traps of Hollywood are always there for any superstar athlete especially fighters and you know we've seen it all throughout history with Tommy Morrison gets in the Rocky movie and all sudden everybody's looking at him like Tommy Marston is gonna be the white up and then Ray Mercer beats the living fuck out of them and you just saw like fear and overwhelming anxiety attack him because he's in this movie and he's on the red carpet and everybody's saying you're gonna be the champ one day huh oh fuck and then it becomes this whole thing he's hanging with Sylvester Stallone they're probably doing blow and banging hookers allegedly allegedly but you know I mean it's like it becomes this Hollywood trap and Ronda was a giant Stila as a giant superstar right she's this undefeated women's fighter she's crushing all the competition she looks like a destroyer and then the fucking traps this all these movies start coming out all this these deals start getting made books start getting written all these television shows and all this stuff and all the travel and all those traps they keep your focus they tasty little bits of your focus like I'm good enough to get by without all that focus but there's no way because there's another person like you out there there's a lot of people like you out there and they don't have those traps if they don't have those traps are gonna have more attention that's being paid right away they have an advantage yes is they have their full focused on this there's also something dangerous to someone like Rhonda res by the way obviously it's just incredible I mean she's the reason why women's MMA is a huge thing but I think there's something dangerous about being such an amazing grappler getting a couple knockouts and all of a sudden feeling this kind of like oh yeah you know she got the knee too McMahon and stopped her with one knee and then was the other chick who she she hit the overhand who face-planted Alexis Davis yeah yeah and so now it's kind of going in there and even going in there with like a world-class boxer like Holly Holm she kind of goes in there with like well I can knock people out too yeah and I think that's a dangerous you know dangerous combination it's like being a blue belt you choke out a bunch of white belts and you think you're the shit and then all of a sudden you're rolling with Demian Maia and he wraps you up like a Christmas present beats the fuck out of you and chokes you unconscious easy you know I mean there's levels of everything and to deny those levels because anybody who looked at her fights would see like okay you have this Ronda Rousey this fierce competitor was one of the best judo examples of judo we've ever seen an MMA I mean her judo spectacular reason why she was a medalist in the Olympics I mean she's a sensational competitor her grappling is outstanding her arm bar technique is amongst the best in the world but she's knocking out these girls there there's no they're nowhere near world-class as far as like kickboxing and striking is concerned right Holly Holm is 100% world-class she is an eighteen time world boxing champion I mean she's a kickboxing champion she was in an MMA competitor for a couple of years before she got into the UFC where she was having these ridiculous headkick ko yeah she's a beast and for her to think that she's going to treat this woman this Holly Holm woman the same way she was able to bully like betch ko hyah and I say Billy not a negative way I mean just just attack her and go out her bench go hey I was she slow and awkward and not that athletic Holly bounces around that cage like a fucking kangaroo yeah she does all these backflips and shit she's spectacularly athletic and the idea that you're gonna have the same approach they used on betch go heya with someone like Holly home that's just madness and that's something that happens when people get so absorbed with this idea that they're special so absorb with this idea that you know when you're on top you think you are the fucking person you're the woman you're the man you're the shit no one's gonna fuck with you I'm just wanted through this bitch and then you get cracked and then you realize oh this game doesn't give a fuck this game doesn't give a fuck about your charisma it doesn't give a fuck about the Vegas odds it doesn't give a fuck about how much money you made or how many times you've been on Entourage or that's the amazing it's it's an amazing thing about MMA it's why I have so much respect for everybody who competes but it's like no one can escape this game's wrath no I mean like Jon Jones still has a lot of his career to go and he doesn't he has one loss on his record but it was not dominant you know when uh but you know you see these guys like you see Anderson Silva and he's just like he's a ninja he's untouchable he's the greatest fighter ever and then you see him like crying on the ground with a shattered not shattered but whatever when he broke his shin well how about when I cried in the ground after he won against Nick Diaz yeah he fell to the ground my favorite fighter ever by the way Nick dsi is just it's pretty awesome I mean the Diaz brothers are just the greatest they certainly are yeah but yeah well from going full circle then when he comes back and wins in the Octagon but I mean it's it's it's an incredible thing it makes you look I mean when watching Chuck Liddell who I just you know at a certain point you were like that guy's just unbeatable he's like Superman and to see him get knocked out and kind of his chin you know it slowly start to go yeah yes it's it's like this this game this game doesn't give a fuck doesn't give a fuck about your opinions doesn't give a fuck about you think when knuckles hit Chin's legs go limp and that's just how it goes and we saw that in the Rockhold Bisping fight you know Rockhold had this look about him that almost like he was bored that he was just like I'm gonna go I mean I'm but part of that I'm sure his gamesmanship he's trying to get inside Bisping's head that he's so much better than him that he doesn't haven't even have to like be serious and be concerned you know and then Bisping clips him with his left hook over the shoulder where he's barely seeing it actually I called it it was a Gregg's that we you said like a few beats before that we were like rouxelle it's keeping his chin right up in the air and he's kind of like a little lacks of days ago yeah I remember you uh in the in the Henan beret Dillashaw fight the first one was like a huge upset no one saw that coming uh and I remember you you sang as it was out you're like mantilla shows really light on his feet though she was really relaxed like sometimes you could just see a little thing in the way they're moving mhm they like him that's kind of interesting yeah I was telling you before we started recording my buddy hilarious comedian one of my best friends lewis jay gomez he does a radio show with Michael Bisping right and you would you've had a big J yeah on the show before so the three of us do a podcast what Legion of skanks you you gotta have Louis on your fucking I would love to he's like Jay yeah Jay jeiza got a special coming out which is gonna be just in credit what sit on Comedy Central our oh cool coming out on I believe I want to say June 17th yeah and I might it's like one of those days it's called a live at Webster Hall it's gonna be a fucking incredible special look for that Jay is like one of the funniest comedians on the planet very funny and Louis J Gomez is just one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life is a great comedian he's like bigger than a stand-up comedian he's like the Bert Kreischer of the East Coast he's just a hilarious person but so he's doing a show with Michael Bisping they do a show called the countdown on Sirius radio and he started doing the show I mean this before Bisbing has the Anderson Silva fight and it did almost seem kind of like Bisbing was a great fighter a big name but seemed like he was kind of you know going toward the end of his career like he had a couple injuries had the I thing and you're kind of like oh he was that he was a contender I'll explain the I think cuz the I things pretty bad yeah you probably know better than we as a detached retina in his oil in his eye they had to inject oil into where his eye sits so that his retina won't tear again so he has one eye that looks almost like cross-eyed and it's kind of black like his like he's on ecstasy like one pupils dilated it's very weird and he doesn't give a fuck he's got that one I fucked up and he doesn't give a shit he's still going in there and soloing and that is born for this this this motherfucker went out and fought Anderson Silva when one of the gutsiest performances I've ever seen I mean he the the first two rounds that he beat Anderson were just incredible and then the fact that he got almost put out in the third round and came back in one the fourth round and it was a fuck double thing because he was trying to say that his mouthpiece was out and he tried to circle to I don't know who the referee was I her yeah he's like and but herbes like look it doesn't matter like you got a I'm not stopping that you don't you can't call when to stop the action cuz you could say that the mouthpiece is out or you could just spit your mouthpiece out whenever someone said you know like landed a big shot and people do do that but you know herb is like look you can't say to me that your mouthpiece out I know your mouthpieces out but you got to keep fighting and then boom Anderson Lanza flying me on the jaw and then Anderson walks with his hands up I was so crazed if he won so crazy herb didn't call the fight yet so then the bell rings so then Bisping has to get up and recover in a minute from getting ko'd it was madness she got a little bit of extra time because Anderson Silva celebrated yes so I think he got like an extra 30 seconds or so but I mean but then right so and by the way too that's got a fuck Anderson up to because Anderson's now got this like adrenaline dump and then use and then you saw in his face he's like what no we're back to fighting and yeah but Bisbing man that fourth round he just bit down on his mouthpiece and walked him down and yeah I mean it was incredible crazy and then after that being the greatest ever to come and and you get on an injury right you get a title shot was ten days notice yeah it's the greatest ever I mean arguably Anderson's on the downslide but definitely let's not say arguably I mean losing twice to wide man it just didn't look the same when he fought Nick Diaz suspended for steroids comes back and and you know but he's still Anderson Silva say that victory gets that victory over the greatest of all time and then first round knockout over Luke Rockhold you know it's fucked up I was I was literally considering saying that Luke Rockhold looks overconfident and when you're overconfident you can get knocked out and I'm like I don't want to be a dick and then boom he gets knocked out us you did make the comment about him holding about not like having his head right there on the center relaxed it was super relaxed with his chin straight up he was pulling out of things with his chin straight up it's almost like there was no danger yeah and that was one of the things that he was saying that you know he was in no danger and it was also one of the same things that your Riya Faber was saying like the difference between me and Cruz is I can hurt him I can take him out and then when you see a riot got caught I think was the second round he got dropped and you realize he's in deep trouble like he realized holy shit I can get knocked out too and all those guys in you know it's a it's funny when you get it like like Michael bismi was a guy who the knock on him I guess was that he didn't have knockout power or whatever man talk about like a a 200 I mean fighting at 205 a guy cuts down probably I'm sorry 185 so probably something someone who weighs close to 200 pounds it's a 200-pound guy who specializes in in striking yeah he can fucking knock you out of course again and he proved it well he doesn't he doesn't fight like a like a brawler like he fights like a technician yet and when you fight like a technician you don't swing wild crazy ass punches with everything on him with your you know Wanderlei Silva style you know you try to find openings and that's what he did he found the opening with that left hook was really sneaky he had missed it before he was like stepping in and throwing the left hook over the shoulder and kind of like stepping into the punch and boy when he caught Luke he caught him at the end of the chin which really like fucking spins your head all that torque is perfectly placed and then you caught him with another brilliant one right afterwards followed up yeah man dude and you know he's had like all sorts of fucking crazy injuries back injuries neck injuries is fucking awesome yeah he's just tough man he just keeps going he just keeps going she had no question about that that dudes as tough as they come man just because he's one of those guys who's like been around forever and always kind of been knocking at the door so it's nice to see him you know get his moment well it's crazy to see well you see like there's knockout power right and then there's like Dan Henderson kind of knockout power that is just like she's fucking trust like Dan Anderson feels like this table when you put your arm on him he's not flexing he's like the like Ryan Parsons who's a buddy of mine who is his manager for a long time said that he would do massage and he would be exhausted he's like--he's would guys made out of wood so like when you look at him you look at amigo well it looks like you know strong athletic guy but if you felt him you realized where all this power comes from he's like he's built different there's something going on with him and he does when you were saying people who don't put everything into one punch puts everything in his like I mean it's like coming at you and it's so weird the way he moves too he moves in a weird way because he's very stiff he's not fluid like John Jones or like Anderson is very fluid in his movements Dan is like very stiff but when he uncorks those bombs on you they just detonate and you're just like what the fuck hit me like Hector Lombard never been knocked out to see Hector Lombard get knocked out by well he got head kicked he's probably stunned by that head kick and then he got blasted with that back elbow he was out cold yeah he was out cold when he hit the ground and then Henderson blasts him again but like whoa I saw I was like who the fuck hits like this guy it's like it's almost like you want him to hit you just so you could feel it just harder is that than normal what the fuck are you doing I want to start by like standing next to a guy who he hits like hit him real close to me I want to feel it his k-love Bisping at UFC 100 was one of the most brutal one punch shots in the history of combat sports it was just boom Bisping's dead stiff and then Henderson's airborne long before the referee can get to him and just slams him in the face on the way down and then from there out one of his logos was the silhouette of him flying through the air knocking out Bisping so imagine being Bisping not only do you have to deal with the fact this guy fucking knocked you out in spectacular fashion but his logo is flying through the air hitting you after you're already unconscious I would I would just say hang on in a few years we'll be champ you'll have a show with Luis J Gomez and everything will be good what year was UFC 100 it's a while man that's Brock Lesnar I want ya boy yeah 100 was like was it 2012 no earlier than that probably what year was that Jaimie I just pulled some up it wasn't at UFC 114 popped up definitely note that right it was UFC 100 it was the biggest pay-per-view of all time was Brock Lesnar's rematch with Frank Mir and GSP 11 2009 2009 wow it was that long ago whoa that's nuts yeah that is fucking weird it's been a long fucking longer than I would have thought yeah definitely I guess it is like a hundred UFC is later yeah Wow so seven years later he wins the title crazy yeah look the same card on the same card alright yet look there's gonna be some ups and downs your retinas gonna get all types of fucked up but you will be champion one day no one takes that away from him ever did you imagine if him and Henderson had a rematch for the title good lord can that be made I wonder if that could be made ethically because if you look at all the other contenders all the people waiting in line Chris why oh yeah Jacques RA Vitor there's just too many yeah there's too many but to boy it's hard it's a hard sell because Vitor just knocked out Henderson in the first round you know it's and yeah it's just man Vitor knocked out Bisping in Brazil and he knocked out Rockhold mm-hmm yeah but he just got Nash by jacques ray everything the middleweight division is just completely up in the air now yeah it's all it's all turned upside that's so weird in MMA what happen like you're kind of like oh okay I think I know where everything sounds yeah and then one thing changes I don't know anything I guess
