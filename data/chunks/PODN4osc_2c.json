join my day Joe Rogan podcast my night all day okay now what's the situation with cyborg at this point - chick just pissed hot again not good waiting for to see what the Commission does what kind of suspension she's getting at least a year at least what she pissed hot for is also an anti-androgen it's a die Oh has DHT inhibitor I used to rub that shit in my head to prevent hair loss they might give her a DHT and it's also used by people to take steroids to diminish the effects of of like when females take steroids diminish the effect it's also it's a masking agent so if you take steroids some people take that stuff as a masking agent she's 31 it's also a diuretic so it's a very weird drug called spironolactone lactating lactone but it has many different uses if she gets three years that's what she meant that it's not a good argument all the arguments that she gave her not good arguments that she took something out of competition that she was told by her doctor that would be okay when it's clearly on you sada banned list it's a hundred percent banned it's not like there's certain things you could take out us out of contests like the big ones pot like say if they catch you tomorrow and you're supposed to fight in six months and you're smoking weed like crazy they test you and they go look we gotta test you look I just wanna let you know but smoke a lot of weed they're like okay so I'm it's not steroids that's why John Jones didn't get in trouble when he pissed hot for cocaine three weeks out of the fight with Daniel Cormier because that's not in competition and it's not a performance-enhancing drug he's just partying right so what this is though it's a performance-enhancing drug not just a performance-enhancing drug but problematic in that it it inhibits its performance-enhancing in that it works as a diuretic and you're not allowed to use diuretics but it's it also inhibits your um the their ability to detect steroids in you she's in trouble she's in trouble you saw this gonna eat her ass up and if she gets three years well here's the thing all does she date she's in her mid 30s mid third day they time to get tested her because she passed on three world title fights they they had three world title fights lined up for at 1:45 which the weight class that she asked for she said she couldn't make it in 8 weeks and so then they gave her more weeks and Gabriel yeah they gave her a third test they're like sums up and whether or not they were going to test her anyway who knows but that's when they tested her that's when she pissed hot it makes sense and she did not reveal before that all that she was taking that and she does and then committing is it she's in trouble me here is when I hear she's escaping all baby that's huge this is skeptical baby now somebody's got everybody yeah the skins coping plea that this baby that's so climbs like bitch like what's up but that skeptical snakes so skeptical uh with with cyborg super skippers to get their thoughts fine have you seen The Skeptical house number fucker so skeptical kept and there's a skeptical Cadillac so rejected Cara Lee the house what the fuck is going once that's hilarious sup what is it it's not a real house yes those are windows what the fucking a window is that she'd have to go window do you think they did that on purpose hell naw what's wrong with people it almost seems like that was an accident it's so funny um go with sigh board gets three years she's in trouble I find that into when Rhonda lost again and she's throwing shade at Ron I'm like bitch you you just got bus for steroids how shameless are steroids she got busted for a dihydrotestosterone or no it's not a precursor it's a dihydrotestosterone inhibitor that's what it is inhibitor yeah and to me my brain goes you're in trouble yeah well you're in trouble she certainly could be in trouble it's one thing if she got she said that was she's got a bunch of issues because she really did wreck her body getting down to 140 which damage eyes yeah which I'm sure and uh that that's him trying to say when you wreck your body like I think she's saying that she takes in too much water now and her body is like trying to hold on to water and that they gave her a drug to diminish the amount of water I talked to a couple of doctors about this I asked some questions and they all gave me that snake face generally yeah like veg and you know her background - it's a knock man he dont fuck with anything that's illegal and you definitely don't fuck with anything that people use because they're women that take steroids even if it's just a coincidence that you happen to be you should look at every fucking label extremely careful question is that the worst cut of all time yeah it's one of them what do you mean cut but here's the thing man well gotta fucking do Sanchez Diego Sanchez made 145 he fought him 185 in Ultimate Fighter one can be flawless here's the problem she fucking deadlifts 305 pounds a couple weeks after passing on fights she passes on the fight and puts up instagrams of her deadlifting massive weight you're in you know and there was whoever the fuck handles her Twitter account cuz I wrote that up because I me and Brett Okimoto were having a discussion I don't like very good dude we were having a little back-and-forth on Twitter about it and you know he said isn't it weird that she's not fighting for the title and I'm like what's weird is that they patted that she passed on the title fight and then posts Instagram photos of her deadlifting and then she responded that it's just like what football players do when they're not in camp excuse me other day and I'm like what you saw that Golden Snitch was like what what did you say me want sauna she's not writing now I'm looking at the English is perfect I'm like this is not Jesus whoever works with her or boyfriend or whoever the fuck handles the the Instagram account like that's no excuse there's a lot of maintenance that you do that's not deadlifting 305 fucking pounds you do that to put on mass that is why your deadlift you deadlift to put on fucking mass she's got Mutoh mass he's got plenty of mass she has no problem with mass mmm you know I mean that's not what she needs if she really wants to fight 145 pounds she needs more than eight weeks to make the weight she would she should be doing his long-term cardio I guess that's what she's doing too though Joe she goes I do that and then the morning I run every mud come the fuck on those are those aren't as heavy as they can develop that power son no they're like more out of like light no no that's 307 pounds son that's 305 pounds bro that's what she's doing this is YouTube why did she tag why she tagged Abby Garcia that's worse see ya here we go help Debu start curling that shit you have the same doctor I don't know fuck say the whole thing is awful it's awful it's awful whoever the fuck is in her corner that let her post that video I'd be like hey hey hey what are you doing with your phone what are you doing with your phone you gonna put that online get the fuck out to me because the Golden Snitch is headily just waiting yeah if he's looking at that it's going it's a woman deadlifting 305 four reps we're going there 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning yeah oh yeah look it is possible that you could get that big and that jacked without anything but it takes a long fucking time and that's what you're doing that's what you're doing all the time if you look at some of those CrossFit gals that some of those are on steroids 100% but some of them are not and you can get big if you have the right genetics and you do that kind of lifting but that kind of lifting is for people that want to put on power she's got ridiculous power cyborg has some of the nastiest power you're ever gonna see in women's MMA bring them up probably the mo the most it's right up there with well she has the full range like she'll kick you and knee you and punch you in elbow you where's Nunez is Nunez will kick you hard but it's her punches that are fucking ferocious and she don't hit hard inside bored no way so I really wet Seibert hit you like gotta tie some braids she hits yeah she hits girls and you see Sheila God you know fucking kinda shuttle she makes world-class girls look like that grandma doesn't she's a beast mr. unfortunate that there's so much controversy like I would love if there was someone like cyborg with no shade attached to it no weirdness attached to it but now she's got these two strikes against her will a man a Numis she has no shade yes she knocks skills out she just merc Miesha Tate yeah you know can are you probably the number two most famous girl of all time in women's MMA let's just Merc the number one there's your star with no shade yeah right person you [Music]
