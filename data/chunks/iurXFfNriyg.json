four three two welcome back man hey thank you good to be here great to see you again yeah I like your new spot thank you thank you very much man you have a real flip phone I do have a real foot thing you said that you didn't go back to it you never left I never left her so you never went like iphone/android never no no never never even thought about it never even thought about it no you see people taking pictures and using apps nothing nothing I I don't need the apps I'm good there's no draw at all nothing using the internet answering email and I have I have a laptop at home and I do access the internet yes but when you're out you don't want to mess with it no I when I'm out I want to be out I'm in the world you know right if you're if you're looking on your phone you're not in the world and so you don't get either you know get either thing he was get along very well my friend Ari he went back to a flip phone uh-uh and he looks disdainfully sort of like former alcoholics look at everybody with a drink like there's no way you could just enjoy one drink you know all right yeah no I um I just look around at this I mean I'm an anthropologist and I you know I'm interested in human behavior and I look at the behavior like literally the physical behavior of people with with smartphones and it doesn't it looks antisocial and unhappy and anxious and I don't want to be I don't want to look like that and I don't want to feel like I think those people feel wow that's deep I'm a junkie you know it's really interesting because I was at a restaurant the other day and I was looking around and literally everyone in the restaurant was looking at the phone no one was talking to anybody and I was thinking what if there was a drug that did that what if there was a drug that didn't kill you but it just sucked up all your time and you just stared blankly at your hand and did everything that you do while you're using a phone people would be terrified like you're staring at your hand and crashing into cars you're staring at your hand and walking in the polls yeah I mean I mean there is a drug it's that's okay idea I mean I think the big lie of our generation is the phrase social media it really isn't it's anti social media and it has a lot of uses and you know whatever but it's not social in any human sense and if you look at suicide rates depression rates PTSD rates anxiety rates they're doing nothing but going up in our society mass shootings so you know just something tragedy just happened yesterday all those things they're indicators of something and they're all going up in our society despite the fact that we're a very wealthy powerful relatively peaceful society like something's going on I can't prove that it's you know the internet or social media where I mean obviously that but but the fact that those things are happening at the same time does make me wonder that these new devices certainly don't bring happiness because the numbers are going in the wrong direction well I don't think they're designed to bring happiness but they're certainly designed to give you access to information perhaps maybe with some discipline they can be used in some sort of a way that benefits us or not well yeah I mean all that information is available in your laptop at your desk at home right I mean I think the problem is when when people want to be socially and socially connected constantly no matter what they're doing mm-hmm and that I think keeps people from actually fully experiencing whatever they're actually doing I think there's definitely some truth to that but I do like the fact that I can ask my phone questions like if I don't know anything and I can add if there's a new feature on this Google pixel we squeeze the side of it and the Google assistant comes up and you can ask your questions you squeeze it and ask a question and that's space-age yeah or it's downright creepy I mean you know you look at it I mean I you know I get it like I mean you have all of human knowledge in your front pocket yeah accessible at every moment like I do understand the power of it and the appeal of it I'm not saying there aren't great things about of course there are it's just for me the downside outweighs the upside for other people I guess it doesn't but if you look again if you look at mental health statistics in this country we're doing something wrong because they're all going in the wrong direction I agree with you I just wonder if the mental health statistics are indicative of other issues you know I think lifestyle what you do with your time during the day and a lot of people live very deeply unsatisfying lives and I don't know if the phone accentuates that problem I mean we were talking the other day about we were at the airport we're waiting to fly home and there was some girl and she was talking we were just eavesdropping and she was talking about like the Amazing Race and how she you know on this show so boring now and I can't wait to and I'm gonna eat this and then I'm gonna eat that and I'm supposed to get a raise at work it's like all nonsense non and engaging not interesting there's no real life to anything she's talking about like this is most of our country or a large part of our country oh absolutely I mean the thing about social media is that it is our weapon eise's blendness I mean yes it allows it gives people a platform for the most mundane uninteresting aspects of their lives because they have to constantly constantly be producing some kind of output of communication well and if not producing it certainly absorbing it right yeah both let's feel like I'm mining when I'm on Twitter like nothing nothing nothing nothing Oh Oh murder yeah oh look at this monkey found Oh I mean they're now I mean there's other people you could have on the show that could speak more intelligently to this but I know that I mean I've heard that risk of suicide and face Facebook are correlated in other words people that are on Facebook and in social media they are at an increased risk of depression and and thoughts of suicide and that and that that's terrifying do you think that that's correlation equals causation no you're not I mean like do you think that people on Facebook all the time are doing that because they're already depressed well right I mean that's that's the question and and but the correlation means we have to look at something more closely yeah anxiety rates and teenagers of skyrocketed anxiety partly comes from a serve painful self awareness and of course that's amplified by social media cos you can never escape the opinions of your peers I mean that's crippling to people I mean we're not you know I wasn't the most popular kid in class by a long shot and when I came home whatever my problem whatever my issues were we're on hold until you know when I was a kid in high school there was issues around hold till 8:00 a.m. the next right you got a 12-hour break from your problems and now you don't and it's really tough on kids yeah I could only imagine growing up today I you know I think we got very lucky that the we experienced the Internet in adulthood you know for me I was I think I was 27 the first time I were got online and that's a that's nice you know and no one knew what online was back then you weren't leaving any traces you were just going out looking at stuff yeah you know that's right that's right yeah I was how old was I I was about 36 remember I remember a girl asked me should you ever logged on explained to me with that vent and then I literally said they're all that's never gonna catch on come on that's like really yeah Wow yeah isn't that what they said about the first computers like that was one of IBM's initial reactions to the idea of the personal computer I think that's the reaction to the first of everything except maybe the bow and arrow I mean like when they invented the bow and arrow everyone was like no that is gonna catch on that's cool right but everything else I think that's you know the skepticism like we don't we don't need anything more we're good and then you realize I mean that's the amazing thing about the human mind is that we invent this stuff and it doesn't mean that it's good I mean we evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to live a very different environment that we live now so these things that we invent it doesn't mean that there's sort of a psychologically good force but they definitely are incredible I mean they're definitely amazing things yeah I don't think that necessarily they're good for us but I don't think this is kind of sound weird but I don't even think they're necessarily designed for us I think they're designed for the future I think and I don't any think it's a design I just think that all things move in an ever more complex direction and that whatever a person is now is not gonna be the same thing a thousand years from now or a hundred years from now even I think there's gonna be some sort of symbiotic connection between us and electronics like we're gonna have it installed in our bodies well you know that gets to a kind of profound question like what is the point of existence of human existence what's the point of it is the point for as many humans as possible to leave to lead safe um human fulfilled lives or is it for the human race as an entity to produce the highest technological achievements and scientific insights you know and I don't have a vote either way I'm but that it does sort of seem to be the the question and that technology I mean we know does not lead to fulfilment and happiness but it does lead to scientific insight and to you know incredible under a profound understanding of the how the universe works in a physical sense yeah I wonder if what we're doing is just being caught up in the momentum of all this innovation and instead of like using discipline or using some sort of rational objective analysis of like what it takes to be happy and then maybe pushing pushing some of that stuff aside and engaging in actually physical activities going out and doing things and and making that almost like a prescription like hey you know look let's look at your daily chart hey you don't even get enough vitamins buddy you know hey you didn't get enough activity like you need that in order to be in order to feel right you'll feel balanced right and if feeling right is the point of existence then iPhones are probably not a good development no right if the exchange of data if the exchange of information is the point then they're a great innovation so it really depends on what we're all here for I was in San Francisco with my wife and we were walking behind these two kids who were talking about about robots and one was saying they were sort of geek kids I was sort of in the know about all this stuff and one one guy was saying you know they're taking over you know in 50 years you know we're gonna be humans are gonna be completely unnecessary but I said to my wife you know we always were unnecessary like none of this had to happen it's not like the world needs human beings to exist and for some purpose right we are here but we didn't have to be here and so if robots replace us we go right back to where we would have been if we didn't hadn't if we hadn't evolved yeah and it was it was just a funny way of thinking about it like none of this is actually necessary it doesn't have to be happening no it certainly doesn't I mean look if we are finite life-forms if you're going to be lived to be if you're lucky 90 years and when your health is going to fail then you're going to die what the what should be our goal is to feel good right to have community in relation that's a big part of that book tribe your your books fantastic by the way I've read it twice and so I read it again I read it before and then I read it again since since our first podcast oh thank you very much yeah I've been getting a lot of I keep getting a lot of good responses to it and you know I think partly I mean whether you're a Democrat or Republican this is a pretty unsettling time in this country and and I and I think people are coming to the book a little bit just partly because they're wondering what is the glue that holds us all together and is there does not exist still like I mean I think there's a real question in people's minds about what is it that binds us together well there certainly is and you really covered a lot of the sort of just not commonly discussed aspects of it like the need for real community the need to really and the need to have something on the line you know the need to be in situations where there's real consequences and that it seems that this is part of the glue that holds us together well I mean to think about technology is it buffers us from real consequences in the physical world which is what's great about it right and but the downside is that as you as humans get buffered from consequences they need they need each other less and less in order to survive so now sort of modern modern Homo sapiens in a suburban house with an iPhone and a garage door opener and all that stuff you know you get a paycheck at working you don't need your neighbors you know to gather help you gather food or hunt food or defend yourself from the gang from the other neighborhood I mean it all kind of gets taken care of which is a great liberation from your neighbors from your community but it deprives you of that essential human reliance on other people around you that's what makes people feel good and safe and like they're leading meaningful lives and so with that transition to having a life that's not part of any community that is a really tough one for people and I think that's part of the reason for high depression rates and such you know in high PTSD rates in our society yeah I think that lack of community is a very using thing when you see most people just sliding into their garage and shutting the door or going into their house and they don't even know their neighbors how that that's really highlighted in your book how alien that is to the human experience until fairly recently this idea of like living in these in like I was in New York City this past weekend is enormous apartment like my friend Jim was talking about this he lived Jim Norton lives in this enormous department building those I don't know anybody there he goes I live in a house a building essentially a house with a thousand people I don't know any of them hey yeah and listen I mean I live in a little tenement building but it's the same same idea these little cubby holes we all live in but you know I got to say and I grew up in a suburb but I got to say at least in the building I live in I'm in the Lower East Side at least in the building I live in I run into people on the landing and the staircase there's no elevator in the staircase and you get to know them a little bit the problem with the suburbs is that everything just don't you know everyone's a stone's throw away and behind a big hedge and you and you don't you you don't have to share an elevator with anyone you're gonna be totally isolated and I grew up in that environment it was crushing and I you know I was laying on material since I was lucky we were affluent family but and I was not lucky in any human sense that's so fascinating you say it was crushing to live the American dream I mean a lot of people's ideas the American Dream is living in a nice quiet suburb yeah and listen there's a lot that stream like about it but but the the the the data will tell you that people in those situations are not happy I mean in by the metrics by which we measure human fulfillment human happiness mental health they suck in the suburbs and and and and generally a modern society ms as affluence goes up in society the suicide rate goes up the depression rate PTSD PTSD rate all that stuff goes up with a twith without clothes yeah I've noticed that in some of the circles that I I'm hanging around with now because of nice people but the children of my children my children's friends parents yeah them interacting with these people that I don't know from work I don't know from social circles and and most of them are great but a lot of pills yeah like like half of them are on pills of those yeah they're they're taking adderall they're taking anxiety medication and they're taking antidepressants and they mix it all together with alcohol and there's some new freak out every week and there's literally no physical fear for anything that everyone's driving a Mercedes everyone's living in a gated community everybody's it's all smooth edges and nerfed corners everything is very soft and easy and the the the big appeal seems to be the newest objects yeah chase the newest objects and it's a really well known phenomenon if you introduce a disaster into that environment if you introduce the Blitz in London or an earthquake or what have you a flood tidal wave a war people wake up out of their dream I mean they're in a kind of dream state and part of something for some people that's in you know induced by pills and some people it's just induced by isolation but they're in a kind of dream state where they are not part of society in a meaningful way and a catastrophe wakes them up out of that and and people I mean over and over again you can hear testimony of people saying well I really miss those days you know the days after the earthquake during the Blitz I mean you from generation after generation that goes through there there are things right there are tough things those days are missed and they're missed because people the thing they actually like most is being an essential part of a small group that is struggling to survive like that is the human experience for hundreds of thousands of years were wired for it were wired to like it the people that responded to that challenge tended to pass on their DNA the people that didn't respond well didn't pass on their DNA were the descendants of the people that sort of threw it took some thrill and from that challenge and and acted well and with sort of vigor and with community in the face of hardship and danger were the descendants of those people inevitably and because the people that didn't act well didn't survive as well right they didn't pass on their genes and so that's one of the things we're missing and the big the big trick is I mean I'm not saying burn down the suburbs ban the car and live in a lean-to I mean if no one would say that huge benefits to this society - but the trick is how can we have that closed communal connection that buffers us from our from mental health problems that makes us feel meaningful and fulfilled how can we have that and have the benefits of modern society you know like can we do can we do both and I think that's the big challenge because what I see in America I love this country what I see in my lifetime I mean when I grew up we didn't have mass shootings I mean you know like that what that didn't happen you go into a church with a machine gun and kill as many people as you can let's just didn't happen what is going on I mean to me it's a country and kind of I mean those things are all a symptom of a country that's in the kind of psychic pain yeah you know all the people on their iPhones I guess I sort of get it but I it but also it makes me think you're anxious like you're so anxious that you can't bear not to look at your feed for more than 20 seconds what's in it it's an addiction yeah sure I mean you're literally getting dopamine shots every time you check your feed yeah and and they're very small it's a trickle it's not like a real like it's not really worth it you know get any real good feeling very rarely it's like fast food like the end of it the end of it you know you go to close the drive-in you know get get your cheeseburger and fries and shake or whatever afterward you're full but you were you didn't get any nutrients and in social media is the same way you're sort of socially full but actually it's all calories there's no nutrition I mean there's nothing that nothing to sustain you you know that well I've found for me personally that people get a lot of fulfillment out of tribes for lack of a better word of like-minded people doing similar things that are difficult absolutely like I see it amongst like rock climbers a lot of rock climbers they they find like real community and other rock climbers and runners get it jiu-jitsu it's huge and the jiu-jitsu community horse you know and I experienced it in a deep way the first time everyone hunted yeah cuz hunting was almost like like I had a wall that I didn't know there was a or on it and I open up the door and oh there's a whole new area back here like your your DNA like goes up we know what to do with this we're hunting now and you feel like wow this is crazy like this is lighting up parts of my brain or parts of my my genetics yeah listen I went through that same door when I started boxing you know I started late in life I was 50 I've coming through a big life changed my first marriage ended and I need some need something a little different and I think one of the things that really works for people is a situation where they're evaluated for their behavior rather than for how and where they were born yes right so or how much money they have right which is a funk you know is you know is a function of some degree of how you were born where you were born and yeah but so you know in high school you were evaluated for the family you come from for how you look for all that stuff you don't have control over any of that stuff yeah but in the boxing ring out hunting you know whatever there's a million things like this you're evaluated by your peers for your conduct and that you have complete control over soldiers are the same way you know and I was with this platoon in combat off and on for a year in eastern Afghanistan those guys didn't care if you were good looking or bad looking if your dad was in prison or not at least give a right that what they cared is how you acted in that situation and would you would you would you put the group the welfare of the group ahead of your own welfare and that was this basic human basic human question is the group more important to you than you are to you and if we all answer that question yet with a yes then we're good and so you know when you're in situations hunting in the gym jiu-jitsu whatever it is where you're not bringing your street identity in there you're just you're just a human being trying to act as well as possible with dignity and respect for others you're good and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you suck at jiu-jitsu right as long as you have that basic respect and hard work ethic and being freed from those things you're not responsible for and so and are not judged for it that is a huge liberation and it really makes people feel close to each other yeah so people need money and it's also do you think that a lot of what's going on today is just the fact that I don't think people are supposed to work in an office all day I think it's probably bad for your biology I think it's sitting in a chair all day is terrible for you I think staring at a computer all day is terrible for you all these things that people do or just counter to their contrary to what your your body was designed for and that must cause a lot of depression and anxiety in people yeah I mean if you if you want to know what we were evolved for you can look at modern-day hunter-gatherers who more or less anthropologists agree represent our evolutionary past and you'll find that there's at least two hours of pretty vigorous movement every day you know fast walking basically two hours a day by virtually everyone in the community you are almost never out of contact with I mean out of physical profits proximity with other people that you know extremely well there's about four or five hours a day devoted to survival food gathering that kind of thing we work 8-10 hours a day right the most quote primitive hunter-gatherers and some of the harshest environments in the world spend around four hours a day surviving but it survival is a group endeavor it brings everyone together everyone's needed high-protein low you know no processed foods obviously I mean the diet you know obviously it's a very pure diet and people who live like that have extraordinarily good health and if they survive you know childbirth in those first early years often live into they're in their 70s 80s to 90 I mean you know Western basically live as long as Westerners do with no medical intervention I mean it's pretty extraordinary that is extraordinary when you think about it I mean what we saw an article and I didn't I didn't read the article but what the headline was something along the lines of I was talking about artificial intelligence and it was whether or not the rise of artificial intelligence will will even out inequality and I remember looking at that in one and just boy that that's like giving into the high mind like artificial intelligence is gonna cure all the woes of the world like let the computer think for you and everything's gonna be even and you know and now that I'm thinking about it the two guys we were walking behind in San Francisco wasn't robots it was artificial intelligence they were talking about I mean obviously they're connected yeah and and but yo is it was AI and you know it see I mean it's either AI is either the final blossoming of the human mind or it's the end and I don't think anyone knows which it is it could easily be the end I've been thinking for the last few years that it's we are some sort of a electronic caterpillar that's giving birth to some new butterfly and what we're doing is we're we're the biological thing that makes the electronic thing and that the electronic thing is gonna go thanks we got it now and then I mean we assume that the things that we hold dear like emotions and camaraderie and this feeling that we have of community that that's important but if we live and we die like it's important to us while we're alive but what if we didn't exist is it important and you know air quotes to the universe is it important to the planet but not necessarily just important as a human my understanding of physics is that it was incalculably unlikely that the universe would exist and that life would start on this particular planet or on any planet that it was extremely unlikely that even the universe would exist yeah yeah and so it's hard to say that anything would be important right to it to it to a system that that statistically shouldn't have happened and it doesn't have a conscience and moral mind behind it like I mean no of course we're not important I mean if we were sitting on the moon and you watched a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States that obliterated civilization if you were sitting on the moon you'd barely be able to see it you would barely notice anything happened yeah right that's the moon and that's pretty close of course it doesn't yeah so you keep in mind that all those emotions everything we are had survival value in our past or we that we wouldn't have those things right we're the legacy of an evolutionary process that went on for million years so if we feel sadness if we feel anger if we feel shame all of those things had survived survival value for humans and and the individuals that had the capacity for those emotions made better citizens within their you know community we're better hunters we're better whatever and so those emotions we find them meaningful but actually what they are is they they helped us survive and now we have so altered our circumstances that survival is no longer a question and so what do we do with those feelings what do we deal with those capacities the ability to hunt the thrid the dopamine that you get from hitting a target I mean teenage boys will sit in a basement for hours days years playing video games their practice their training for hunting right there for hunting and war and they're getting rewarded with dopamine which is exactly what should have been happening for 500,000 years and now there's nothing to hunt nothing to fight they're still doing the behavior as they should because they're wired for it but there's no useful purpose for it and they're making themselves irrelevant they're human casualties of this technology and it's I find it really tragic are they more irrelevant than someone who plays sports I mean I think our relevance comes from our our relationship with our community and with society right and and I mean at least if you play sports you're part of you you're part of the human community and and when you're in you know when you're playing a video game by yourself you really not by yourself but a lot of kids what they're doing now is they're playing these online games they're playing against other people they talk to each other online they have like headsets and they mean eSports is a big growing thing and it's I mean it's it's a fascinating thing because it's also sort of based on your ability to perform you know the the ones who are the heroes are the ones who are like when I was playing quake there was this dude named fatality was his name just kill everybody but it was you know he was the he was the King because he was just the best at the game so in the community of people that were only judged by their performance he had risen to this very high level but it was a community well you know if you look at humans you look at chimpanzees we clearly need the proximity of others like the physical proximity above so I mean the only way I can evaluate that is to say that's an that's awesome training for hunting in war right and the military does use those games to train their soldiers and so I get it it's effective what I would do is look at suicide and depression rates in gamers and see are they above or below the national average for that age group mmm and if they're above then there's a problem yeah either depressive people are seeking that as a refuge or that activity makes people withdrawn and depressed and you know like either way it's a problem that needs to be solved it I have no idea what the data is but that's that's where I would look now when you're researching all this data and you're putting together a book like tribe and you're you're putting it out are you thinking to yourself that you have no that it's not just an interesting study on human behavior but it's also probably important for people to read to kind of get an understanding and these are to get an understanding of what it is it's causing people to have all this depression and anxiety that it may be this is this is something that needs to be said I mean any category category statement I shouldn't make but a lot of authors when they write books it's their firm conviction that their book needs to be read by the public and it will help the public in that way right to illuminate life illuminate America illuminate the world in some way that's important I mean that's just a starting point for the two years of work that a book takes right you have a child your assumption is the child is going to be a good person in the world not a terrible person will end up shooting up a church right it's just a starting basic assumption so for me when I was writing tribe I was trying to make sense of a number of different a number of different things I mean one was that what the soldiers I was with in Afghanistan I was really struck some months later that a lot of them wanted to go back to this sort of flea-bitten godforsaken outpost where they got shot at every day and didn't want to come home to the US it's like that needs explaining yeah right and it made me think of this uncle that I had a sort of surrogate uncle named Ellis Ellis Ethel he was a he was Lakota Sioux and Apache is born in 1929 out west and he had a very rough interesting life and he's very well write and I remember him telling me he was sort of mentor figure for me and I remember him telling me when I was in my 20s that you know all throughout the history of the United States along the frontier and this is how he put it he said white people were always running off to join the Indians and the Indians never ran off to join the white people and so now here was this fact again like oh no one wants to go go back to or go to the sort of modern world and this wasn't even the modern world this is the modern world in 1865 or 1755 or whatever I mean at the the right at the time it was the modern world right right but so no one know it's basically the post agricultural revolution world the industrial world the world of organized religion organized government of an industrial economy and an agriculture based system where people had jobs you got up at dawn and plowed the fields all day and went to bed and your minister and your king told you what to do and you know whatever that's the modern world and that's what nobody wants to be part of including the soldiers I was with that Restrepo right and so it just made me think maybe what the soldiers are missing isn't war although that certainly has its charms for some people but its community is that they were with each other community with consequences that's right exactly community with consequences likewise for the Native Americans for the tribal societies in North America maybe with the young men young men and some young women along the frontier we're looking for was an escape from the sort of oppressiveness of the congregation on Sunday mornings the oppressiveness of the society that they were toiling and the regimented nature of an agrarian society maybe what they longed for was the closeness and freedom of a of a tribal society and and indeed I mean there was this incredible sort of hemorrhaging of people from the frontier to the to the tribes and some and even when people were kidnapped on raise by the Indians kidnapped from there log homes on the frontier and abducted and forcibly adopted into these tribal societies when when given the chance to come home to be repatriated you some years later very often these people refused to go they didn't want to go back they wanted to stay with their adopted tried their adopted community that that is a that's amazing to me and it says a lot about what would the way humans are wired to want to live yeah that's that was one of the craziest aspects of your book that I'd never heard that before and how many people had done that the were they they were kidnapped and then they said we like it here better yeah that's right and again we're talking about more than 100 years ago so that what we think of as modern society today is only escalated those anxieties and woes and all the things that separated them from the tribal world that's right and one of the things about tribes is that they're sort of inherently Galit Arian it's very hard to pass on pass on wealth in a non capitalist society and in a mobile nomadic society it's impossible that can pass on wealth because you can't carry it I mean there's no way to carry wealth when when you're in a nomadic hunter-gatherer Society so so they're very very Galit Arian and they also guard against these sort of abuses of power sort of one alpha male trying to sort of like bully people and take more than his share or for that matter people sort of freeloading and not contributing to the group survival effort and sort of scamming a little bit of food here a little bit of whatever their hmm both of those sins against the community are really harshly punished so it's very Galit Arian and I got the Galit arianism is something we are all wired for right and I think one of the de stresses of a modern capitalist society is that it can't be egalitarian and and and that's that's painful for people but then if you introduce a crisis the Blitz in London for example an earthquake in Italy that I studied what happens is that money doesn't matter anymore when the floodwaters are rising when the bombs are falling social class doesn't matter at all it's like being in the in the boxing gym how you conduct yourself with respect to the others around you is actually what gets evaluated and you know a poor man can be brave and generous just as easily as a rich man there's no advantage to being wealthy or powerful when it comes to those basic human qualities and that is a huge liberation and so I'm you know I live in New York City and after 9/11 there was a bit of that in New York City I mean you know as long as we're people in New York a lot of rich people you know whatever obviously we all know that but after 9/11 no one was rich or poor or anything we were all New Yorkers wondering if there was going to be another bomb dropped on us basically another attack on the city so what happened in New York the suicide rate went down the the violent crime rate went down Vietnam vets in New York said who had people who suffered from PTSD said that their symptoms disappeared after 9/11 everyone was needed and people and everyone for a while everyone was equal because we were all facing some danger that terrified us and that for all of its tragedy that is an intoxicating social state to be in for human beings that's so bizarre it's so bizarre but it's also so make sense one of the things that I thought also thought was fascinating in your book we were talking about PTSD PTSD sufferers and how people in these veterans hospitals would be absolutely furious if they thought someone was faking their symptoms and that that they had to be physically restrained to keep from attacking people that they thought were just juking the system and how many people are on PTSD benefits yeah I mean the numbers are really elusive but you know what I have some anecdotally from veterans as well as people within the VA administration who are you know acting as therapists or whatever group counselors is that there's certain number of people or not you know I don't know what the fraction is but the certain number of people who were not traumatized in war and PTSD is hard to prove or disprove and it's you know sort of obviously wide open for either an unintentional misdiagnosis or an intentional misrepresentation whatever and so I mean of course and any bureaucratic system gets scammed and PTSD benefits are no different and but it really is traumatizing I mean seriously Goering and traumatising two soldiers who really were traumatized because they really were in combat and keep in mind only about 10% of the US military experiences direct combat how would they know if someone was seriously traumatized and the other thing that's fascinating is that as you were talking about in these small societies freeloaders are looked down upon as are the the greedy alpha males who try to dominate the wealth like that in these societies like egalitarian ideas are a much more much more openly expressed it's much more important that this is represented by these people that are legitimately suffering seeing someone who's scamming the system and angry whereas like say if you had a hurt knee or something like that you were going to the doctor and you saw someone who was faking a back injury you wouldn't be upset right well they were just robbing money from the insurance company and just getting free well yeah I mean he doesn't have a sort of emotional cargo - right but combat does I mean if you're in combat and you lost your best buddy and you got trauma from that as well you should and then you're in some group therapy thing that the VA was some guy who was on a rear base the whole time and is claiming 100% PTSD disability for some that never happened like yeah that would make you angry it'd make me angry yeah because combat this is extremely emotional and again I don't know he's a one in a million one in a hundred 1000 I have no idea what the rates are I'm not even sure what the if the VA does and there's there's you know in some ways incentivize not to find out but but it's I'm I can tell you from like the real-deal combat vets that happened as they smell it instantly and one way it gets sorted out is that those guys who are misrepresenting themselves get questioned by the combat vets hi so what unit were you with like so what happened exactly Oh a mortar hit the other side of the base that's a pretty big base I've been there you know I was a mile away and you're traumatized are you kidding like you know they'll get questioned right right so I mean like you might question someone who's bullshitting you about how much you know how much fighting is done with the MMA or weed I know whatever I know wherever your area of expertise is I'm sure you can smell a fraud instantly right yeah well everyone can that's one of the things it's one of the characteristics of humans is that because we live in collective societies where we have to sort of trust one another we're extremely good at smelling out misrepresentation and fraud we're really really good at it and it's one of the things that feels intolerable is to have someone who was unfairly gaining gaining from the hard work of the rest of us and right and and I should just say when I say egalitarian ism I don't mean that there's no hierarchy right right I mean complicated systems need hierarchy need order right need huh I mean groups need hierarchy so that not everyone to general not everyone's a private I mean you need organization within the group but I think yeah latarian means that nobody gets extra rights you know like all have they're basically the same rights in the group that's what that means well it mean it all completely makes sense is it particularly makes sense the idea that these people who were real combat vets who saw real action would be instantaneously able to discern whether or not someone was faking it yeah and this but that this it's sort of mirrors what you're saying about these small tribes that in these small tribes someone who's a freeloader is extremely dangerous to the group you looked at as a liability you looked at as someone who just can't be trusted and you need trust yeah you need community and this is this is like what you're saying about combat troops that what they want to know is that you're gonna be willing to put your own safety secondary to the safety of the troop right and and if everyone does that everyone's safer but if no one if some one person doesn't do that I mean that's always in the movies right it's always the one guy who runs away or the one guy who sells out or yeah that's right and you know those those human themes are enduring and very powerful so sometimes speak to a lot of liberal audiences right and and so I love doing this to them like oh and I'm a Democrat so I sort of know those people pretty well right I grew up in Massachusetts and I get it you know and so you know I'll say to them okay who here is against war and doesn't want to know anything I have anything to do with war and uh and of course everyone raises their hand and and then I say okay who here is paid money to go be entertained by a Hollywood war movie and everyone raises their head it seems like a contradiction but then I go on to say to them as look if if if war can get a roomful of pacifists to go pay money to watch it so something important going on in that narrative yeah it's not you're not going to the movies to watch people get killed right you're not you guys aren't all sociopaths you're going to the movies to see these very ancient human concerns of who's loyal to the group who's a coward who's brave who's willing to risk their life for someone else I mean these are these are things that have kept humans alive or endangered them as the case may be for a million years of course they're compelling narratives and in war you see those things happen like in a sort of accelerated intense rate I mean that you know you grew up in a suburb you almost never see someone have to choose between their own safety and the community it never happens that's the problem with the suburbs in war that happens every Momo so so it gives you this sort of like human narrative in this incredibly compressed intense form which reconfirms the value of the human values we all have about okay if you're in a group you you have to love that group even if you're if you dislike some of the people in it like that's what it means to be part of a group and that's what has kept humans alive for a very long time you even see that narrative in science fiction futuristic movies like The Matrix right the ones I have sells out the the other humans to the to the matrix and just says look I want you know I want to be in the matrix I want to have a great life and eat good food yeah I mean listen once you sweat you are aware of this narrative you see it everywhere and I mean one part some research that I did that didn't actually make him to the book I couldn't quite fit it in but I I interviewed someone who had a consulting firm in Hollywood that did basically sort of like market research for the big studios and they would they would screen films for audiences and then ask the audience's questions a the ending about the characters about how to construct the plot they would sort of trying to figure out what's the public want to see right so what they found was that in disaster films very typically where a community was facing a disaster right a plague or you know a flood or a war whatever went you know when the community had to rally to survive right an alien invasion but what does a million scenarios but it's all the same basic story you have these different characters there's usually a male figure that takes the lead to de physically defend the space right there is often a female figure that's connected to him that sort of takes place of the of the community that's being defended take takes care of the dresses the wounds dresses the emotional wounds I mean takes care of all that stuff while the the man or the men are sort of physically defending the place there's awe and then there's a guy who often was really wealthy or well-off before the catastrophe whose continuing to act in a self-serving way even during the catastrophe when everyone's needed and everybody it's mad at that guy well that guy always dies always dies and then there's another character and again this is just very common in these narratives and weaselly beta male yeah no exactly yeah exactly no but that keep in mind that these narratives afford by public opinion right this isn't the studio's trying to make the public force-feed the public like gender roles and you know whatever this is the public saying I like that I don't like that so the studio's are responding to the questionnaires that these researchers give out so one of the really interesting things and this is totally inflammatory but the the role of the person defending like physically physically defending the community when they try to put a woman in that role people have a problem with it and and and frankly often women have a problem with it like it's really it's really really interesting and women are just as important as men in a crisis or in anything right but with the what the public seems to want is the guy with the sword and the woman with the band you know with that sort of reassuring you know like it gets divided like that and it's not again it's not the studio's forcing something on people it the people watching these films saying just voting on what the narrative that they like best but the the other character that I thought was really hilarious there's often that there is a an estranged husband who's betrayed his wife and family in some way he's on the outs right with his family and his with his wife and then the crisis happens the Martians invade the floodwaters rise whatever it is and he comes to the rescue and does the right thing and saves his wife and family and maybe even the wife's new boyfriend I mean it even could have gotten to that stage right and because he does the right thing she takes them back it's funny it's really just playing out these ancient archetypes it's exactly what it's doing I mean they rise I mean those storylines resonate because they're ancient and because those those roles in society helped us survive and there's always the woman who in absence of the strong male figure rises to herself right I mean when some of the research I did with tribe where I found I studied this um coal mine disaster in Canada so it was all men trapped two or two miles down in these collapsed passageways two miles down I mean two miles down an angled shaft yeah so they had an explosion some gases ignited and the passageways collapsed so they're two miles in there Gaslight there they're there their batteries last you know 24 hours their water lasts 48 hours pretty soon they're just sitting in darkness not knowing not only if they'll survive not knowing if their bodies will ever even be recovered in no way I mean they're sitting in darkness trying so whoa this is what happened I mean obviously the situation like that takes needs leadership so in the first minutes and hours there were these sort of alpha males that weren't necessarily crew bosses right they didn't they weren't within the higher in the hierarchy there were just guys who grabbed a pickaxe and a shovel and said come on guys we're gonna try to dig our way out and they basically I mean literally attacked the problem of these collapsed mine shafts there was too much rubble to dig through there were two miles down so and so they would they dig dug and dug and dug and it required these these guys and again it was all men down there but there was one sort of leader was this very aggressive he didn't care how anyone else felt oh you're scared I don't give a grab a shovel we got to solve this problem like totally unimpacted n't dig their way out and they ran out of batteries and they're sitting in darkness a new kind of leader was required and that was someone who was able to keep people's spirits up who was empathic who listen if a guy was really scared was able to say hey listen man it's gonna be alright it's okay to be scared we're all scared you know that kind of voice it's a different kind of leadership now typically in society the male role would be the guy with the pickaxe attacking the problem the female role would be the person sort of like trying to keep the group emotionally together and and and functioning and but what happens in a situation where there's all of one sex those gender roles will be filled no matter what it'll just be filled by people of the same sex so if it was all women down there someone went woman would have grabbed the pickaxe and taken on what would be typically considered a quote male role but she's female right so the gender roles that society needs to survive in adversity in war in nature in a collapsed coal mine it needs both gender roles but either sex can fill those roles it's amazing and we will sort it out so it doesn't matter who's male and female what matters is that those two basic kinds of leadership and caretaking get taken care of Wow so how do those guys get out they eventually I mean the rescuers eventually got to them how long were they down there for they're over a week I might even in two weeks I mean they oh eight days I can't remember actually something something like a week how did they survive I mean barely I mean you know they they ran out of water they were they were eating the bark off the Timbers that you know the support structures they were eating coal I mean eating coal or trying to yeah they were drinking their own urine I mean you know yeah and they the guys died I mean not everyone survived one guy was trapped his arm was trapped between two collapsed Timbers and they were you know is a pretty lively conversation about he was begging them to cut his arm off so that he could at least be free hmm and there was a pretty lively conversation but there other men in the group like did we do that or not right and they decided not to that if they all they had was an axe they're like we chopped his arm off and free him he might die from that right and he was removed from where those guys were so he was lonely that was the thing he was lonely he was I cut my arm off I wanted to join you guys and they didn't anything he died Oh amazing he amazing it's intense yeah and so you know I mean not to whatever to steer this conversation too much but you mean that's a that's a microcosm some ways for America right I mean every country is potentially trapped in the coal mine trying to figure out how to survive we don't know I mean the day before 9/11 we didn't know like 9/11 was coming right right we don't know what's coming right and the only way for any group of people whether you're 330 million or you know 18 people as it was in that coal mine the only way for any group of people to survive is to act collectively right humans don't survive in nature by themselves and so in that coal mine both kinds of people were needed they happened to be all men but it didn't need to be whatever it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean sex doesn't matter they needed both kinds of people they needed aggressive alphas that attacked the problem and didn't care how people felt and we're interested in like strict law and order in the group you do this you do that you do what I say this is a survival you needed those kinds of people and you needed the other kind like hey we're gonna be all right are you feeling okay yeah we're you know like that kind of collaborative empathic person you needed that also so when you look at the politics in this country you need both conservatism and liberalism right you you cannot I mean a completely conservative America will be well defended right no one's gonna mess with us right America first like no one will mess with us but what will let what will be left unaddressed as some of the internal dynamics of this country which is you know frankly not at the foremost of conservative thought I mean sort of racial disparity economic disparity and all that stuff like you know I mean that's not at the foremost of the conservative agenda and it shouldn't be it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be because this is the forefront of the liberal agenda and god forbid you have a country that's completely look run by liberals it'll get overrun immediately by the nearest armed neighbor right where did liberals just aren't wired that way to be suspicious of the world but what liberals do quite well is to try to figure out a sort of system of fairness within the group that gets you know just tries to equalize things and get everyone to sort of participate and to be valued and taken care of like I mean that it's all lovely right I mean that's needed also and so that every country is at its best when you have both of those dynamics going on and they're in a kind of dynamic tension with each other but neither completely takes over and one of the things that breaks my heart watching this country is there's this idea on both sides on the liberal side and on the conservative side that the other not only is totally wrong but totally immoral and shouldn't exist right it's just not true and this country is not gonna find peace until both sides of that political equation sort of reach across and shake the other person's hand and say look I disagree with you on almost everything but I'm glad you're with us I need you and I need you because I don't think like you do I need you to think like you do and until this country figures out how to do that we're gonna be in this sort of awful partisan strife that eventually will destroy is like bullets are not going to take down this country words will and they're gonna be our words and it just breaks my heart to see this dynamic not only going on and on but getting worse and worse it does seem to be getting worse and worse and what seems to be new is the idea from the Liberals to silence people on the right and to to think that free speech is important what's important is their ideas and that their ideas are especially I think now that Trump is president and I think people feel even more Boldin dinner definis I mean listen I mean I think it's well I mean honestly I think it's equally both sides but I agree with you I mean the problem with the right with the left for me and again I'm a Democrat so I you know I love evaluating my own size problems because they drive me they make me more upset than the right-wing problems right because because they're my people right and I'm like come on could you like can you act a little better to see the irony though that you've chosen a tribe and the tribe of people that you don't even know and that these people are just it's a political tribe well I mean I listen I some of those political ideals and the conservative ideals I don't I don't share and but I would hate to live in a country that didn't have conservatives in it right even though I just I mean because I disagree with them but I don't want to be surrounded by people I agree with right and there are conservatives that do not want liberals in this country right shame on them sure right and likewise for liberals like I may hear it on both sides so I think both sides try to silence the voices of the other side frankly I don't you know that's that's a sin I think that's committed equally on both sides but one thing I wanted to bring up because I actually made a mistake last time I was on your on your show I mentioned a book and I got the name wrong and it's such a good book and I wanted to I just saw on Twitter that people trying to find it they couldn't because I got the name wrong it's called our political our political nature-inspired I named avi Tuschman and he collected an awful lot of data about the fact that political opinion is about 50% determined by genetics in other words you inherit about half of your political opinion Wow and the other half is acquired through experience through exposure so if you grew up in a liberal family you're gay you're probably you're you're about 50% likely to wind up being a liberal because you absorb though that way of seeing the world if I'm a Democrat if I grown up in a conservative family I think I'd be a conservative and I actually think having read this book I think I'm actually a genetic conservative that adopted liberal values because of my environment and I think there's a lot of people who are genetically Bros who have adopted conservative values I mean it's about 50/50 but the point is so it's avi Tuschman our political nature that's the name of the book I got our I just wanted to correct that but the point of this to me is that and he knows this I mean scientists know this because when they look at identical twins that share almost all of their DNA identical twins later in life are far more likely to have the same a political opinion than fraternal twins which don't share all their DNA you understand what I'm saying yeah yeah so that's how they know this when they look at identical twins there's a much higher concordance of a political opinion later in life than for fraternal twins that's how they know that's around 50% of your political view is determined by genetics if it's determined by genetics that means it had survival value that means that liberalism and conservatism both had survival value in our evolutionary past and is and as a result has begun become encoded in our DNA like other behaviors like generosity other character traits like generosity courage things like that those are all encoded in our DNA because they had survival value well likewise conservatism and liberalism which means that in the argument the discussion in this country about politics you can disagree with people go for it democracy comes out of disagreement and compromise is great but what you cannot do is point your finger across the aisle and say not only are you wrong but you shouldn't exist like go away disappear you're not part of what America is it's that assertion is completely contradictory to evolution and if and if it's contradicted your evolution it won't work well it seems to me that people have a really difficult time managing conflict even managing verbal conflict that when someone disagrees with them they want to silence that person they want to yell at that person they want to scream and they they think about their own thoughts rather than putting themselves in the position of the other person or objectively recognizing that there is an important factor that both it's it's important to have both sides it's important to even be challenged on your ideas so you can solidify what's the root cause of your ideas what is where were they coming from what what how much have you examined these ideas how are you just married to them because they were given to you are these things you've adopted or the really well-considered thoughts that you've put through the mill right I mean the thing is there are rules to contests right I mean their rules and MMA right there are rules in boxing there were rules in marriages right I mean if you you would never stay in a marriage where your spouse treated you the way the political parties treat each other right now you would never stay right I mean just incredibly contemptuous mocking disparaging tone that both sides have like you like I'm out of here you know my wife clearly just thinks like I'm a complete dirtbag or nowhere I talked you know you don't talk to someone like that that you have any respect for all right I'm out of here I think no one would stay in a marriage like that and what's happened and this is new right this I we didn't grow up with this like this is a new thing where the political parties talk to each other I mean disagreement is great right come from you know eventually you compromise and you figure something out where nobody's happy but that you know the Machine goes on right that the ship sails on what's new now is this contempt hmm and it's toxic in marriage and it's toxic in a country too and this is a new thing and I think and I think if you really if you really take in the reality that this truth that half of our political opinions are genetically wired you got to get rid of the contempt yeah I mean it's part of what we are is I don't think most people are aware of them no or not right that's what I'm talking about it I mean you know and Congress plays on this right it's a great campaign strategy to like say things that are hateful things about the other side and consolidates your base and if you consult and both sides do this right and if you consolidate your base then you're more likely to win the election you have a you'd in a more solid political position so they can send we know but behavior behavioral psychologists will tell you that one way to make a group cohere make it close ranks and strengthen its group commitment to itself one way to do that is to introduce an enemy and when there's no enemy groups naturally dispersed because people just go off to do their individual thing of course you know you have the freedom to do that there's no threat anywhere introduce a threat boom everyone's in a group so what politicians do they they create a threat where there is none you know they say that other political party they're actually trying to destroy democracy they're not part of the democracy they're actually trying to destroy it they're trying to destroy this country the same thing happened to the beginning of the Spanish Civil War my father grew up in Spain and I studied this manner Civil War quite a lot the democratic reforms that were that were coming in the 30s you know just land redistribution things like you know with the vote for women yeah but you know pretty normal things but they were a threat to the power structure in Spain and the military and the serf are right in Spain the fascists basically said that those democratic reforms were people who are trying to destroy Spain so you create an enemy that consolidates your power and you go on to win the election it's great campaign strategy it's just terrible for the nation yeah this lock her up lock her up when when Trump was running that was the big thing right the enemy but yet this was the enemy that was Hillary Clinton she represented the evil Democrats or just been stealing and robbing right and I you know I listen I totally understand being in disagreeing with Democrats right but it's a different matter to say that they're actually antithetical the Democrats are antithetical to free democratic ideals but just seems to me to there's not a good party right now the Republicans are a mess the Democrats are a mess there's not right no they both suck yeah and and so reform them right I mean or created yeah what is isn't there an also an issue with just having two sides right having the Yankees versus the Red Sox every year in the World Series well those two sides do represent this sort of the genetic strains in our liberal and concern yeah I mean that it's gonna it's gonna break down one way or another direction right and so I mean it is sort of a binary I mean our brains are sort of binary in that way I mean as humans surviving the wild you have to defend your group and you need fairness within the group the two things you have to do to survive and remain a group right right and and so those tasks have been sort of like subcontracted out to conservatives into liberals and it's been that way for a very long time and you can even see some of those same behaviors like in search in chimpanzee society right so is very very ancient behavior so I like it or not I think you have two groups but it doesn't mean that the two groups have to act so abysmally with each other and and I really think that if you want to save the if you want to sort of save this country morally politically nationally maybe you really you know really what you need is a bipartisan committee in Congress that calls people out and calls them out first doing and saying things that undermine our sense of unity as a nation so when Democrats say he's not my president that undermines the understanding of what democracy is no easier president like he got voted in man like that's what happens in a democracy is the guy you didn't vote for ends up being your president that's what a democracy is so just deal with it right I hate that I hate that I'm a Democrat I didn't vote for him but I hate when people say that and likewise when Donald Trump sit when citizen Trump was accusing Barack Obama and I understand not liking Obama I don't really care if you two like him and I like him but when citizen Trump accused Barack Obama of not being a citizen and the GOP didn't repudiate that I mean think about it citizen Trump was telling every veteran and soldier fighting overseas that their commander-in-chief was an imposter was a fraud was not an American citizen and has usurped the White House right that's a terribly destructive thing to tell men and women in uniform or in a trench getting shot at right and the GOP like the DNC with this stupid he's not my president thing the DNC is not rejecting that idea they let people say it they don't denounce it right the GOP never repudiated that stupid idea that Trump came along with and for the good of the nation they both had to write and this isn't a free speech issue right everyone has the right legal right to make a fool of themselves go for it but that doesn't mean the two political parties have to stay silent in the face of things that are completely toxic to our democracy and they really should have spoken out and I think some kind of bipartisan Commission in Congress that would call out those out the worst outrages and call on the political parties denounce them that that would be enormous ly positive thing in this country I agree with you but I think it would take a truly exceptional person to look at the other side's faults and and not capitalize on it yeah you know and and especially even if it's a false thing like the Obama thing with with Trump or any any number of things you could find in that regard but it seems to me like this is like the perfect time there was ever gonna be a time where a third party which was some sort of a centrist type party would come around this would be the perfect time where people are so and we also I think people recognize that what we're seeing on the right and the left in regards to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is you're seeing people that are pretending to be this thing right with Donald Trump he's a lifelong Democrat yeah and that also needs a Republican he's talking about God and I mean this is this like it's a show it's a little dog and pony show on the right and on the left you got this woman who was part of the the Clinton Foundation there was essentially was a pay to play scheme they were making millions of dollars and hundreds of thousand dollars for speeches that they would give to banks and this is not some sort of a a real liberal this is not a that the the ideas that you were embracing about liberal values I mean no I mean the two parties basically have become sort of cartels to keep themselves in power yes that's a great way to pray and yes and and you know Hillary was absolutely part of that on the on the on the Left and you know it all of its antithetical to the highest ideals of the framers of the Constitution and the people that established this country and and I mean I hear you about the centrist party that would be great but there's you know I mean the way the power structure works the way the cartels work is they got all they have access to all the funds right all the money right were you where do you get the money for something like that you need to build something from from scratch and get up to speed and turn in time to win an election that's very very hard to do but at the very least I mean a centrist party could fall prey to that kind of toxic rhetoric as well I mean but I feel like there should be norms where freedom of speech is an absolute I mean we get it but that the parties don't that they have a moral obligation to denounce things that no undermine the unity of this country I don't mean people in disagreement with one another I mean a basic level of respect for the other person's personhood for their citizenship for their right to participate in the democratic process and when someone accuses the president I'm not being a citizen in the u.s. they're basically saying I don't respect this system like I I think the entire system is a lie and and and I don't even think Donald Trump thought it was true I think it was a tactic and and that the GOP never called that out is really shameful you don't think he thought it was true that the Obama was actually born in Kenya cuz I think he did cuz I know that he's really good friends with Alex Jones and talks to him all the time I think he believes a lot of very wacky conspiracy you know I think he starts out believing it but i by the end I mean does he I mean did he did he did it for seven years so many people did believe it though I know but he'd be that but the thing is he was doing something that worked he's a pragmatist one of the things I really like about him in a way I mean I hate that I find him sort of a moral in the way that make that gives me the chills but he's also a pragmatist right so I think he's completely capable of advocating a position that he doesn't believe in but I don't think he needs to believe it he's like enough people believe in this that this is working for me what was the benefit for him even chasing that idea down I mean he wasn't running for president back then do you think he was fighting it I think he's been good I think he was considering it for a long time so he was doing it to sort of deteriorate the Democratic Party yeah and yeah and to see see of this you know this immigration stuff also man I mean maybe he believes in that stuff maybe he doesn't it but doesn't it doesn't matter what he figured out very astutely is he identified a Democratic demographic that feels like the country's getting overrun by immigrants right and you know statistics don't really bear that out but people feel that way if people feel that way they vote that way and he figured that out right and so I mean more power to her right like I mean I'm not questioning his I mean it worked for him right but the only thing that I would say is like please don't say anything that undermines the nation's sense of unity right you know that's the crucial thing that's the thing that's keeping us safe in the world is that we're a unified country yeah and when you disparage the courts for example you're splitting the country apart and the intelligence agencies yeah don't do it right like you're drilling holes in your own boat but are you astonished that all that works that he can do that that he can disparage the intelligence communities that he could disparage the courts and that no one calls mouth no one says this is outrageous this is stupid especially knowing all of his campaigns ties to Russia that are coming out now even more so well listen I mean some process is happening that will eventually catch up with yeah like I mean I mean I I don't know how it's going to turn out am I surprised yes of course I'm surprised I'm also surprised that the the Democrats that you know within my lifetime went from being a party that was deeply concerned with the poor with the working poor with people with with people and working in factories you know what I mean I mean those are at least the highest ideals right in my lifetime they went to they became a completely elitist organization they didn't give a  about those people right so like that surprises me too right so along comes Bernie Sanders who would have you know whatever his issues these least sincere you know you don't I mean at least you trust the guy like that guy is speaking his mind and the thing about Donald Trump you speaking his mind like he's not trying to he's not doesn't have these awful poll-tested opinions like hillary did and jeb did and all those guys like he's like no no this is how what I think I don't care how people you know how people react on this is as Martin Luther said here I stand for I can do no other you know a lot of places that Trump stands I don't agree with but I actually I'm actually impressed by his ability to say something no matter what the repercussions this is kind of cool well it is definitely a first yeah you know I mean he's I mean at the debate when he was talking to Hillary Clinton and I forget what exactly what she said you know and he said because you'd be in jail and the whole place went crazy like who the has ever done that no I doesn't debate it's amazing and it worked that I you know like my hat's kind of off to him although I disagree with him I'm almost every political point that he says he holds but I but I gotta say like like it worked and he I wrote an essay and I was talking about different kinds of courage and you know there's sort of physical courage right and I mean literally you know being courageous in the face of harm to your body and I feel like Trump is you know he's a bit of a bully and I think that to me bullies and cowards are sort of the same thing right they're just two different sides of the same character trade I said but that's not all Trump is he's actually morally he's actually very courageous like he's not a moral coward he will say exactly what he thinks no matter what he the opinions gonna be he has extreme confidence and who he is or he doesn't give a I mean that's moral courage you're like this is what I believe it I'm gonna say it I don't care if I don't win I don't care if I go to jail here I stand for I can do no other it's a part of his elitist mentality because he does believe that he's above right a lot of the repercussions for saying he's that but a lot of people who are leaders are cowards yeah the thing and I disagree with Trump on just about all of his policies right but the thing I do kind of have to tip my hat to is that he's not a moral coward he words he will say thing that every political pundit in the world will say no that's gonna get that's gonna destroy you you're gonna attack John McCain and you're gonna hope to win the Republican nomination and you're crazy right now and he did it anymore not just that but he attacked him for being captured I know and I think Trump truly feels that way and I don't agree with them but I do respect the fact that he said it in the face of all political advice he didn't give a he said it because he believed it that's moral courage I just disagree with his opinions but I that moral courage very few people have it you know has it and I just I wish he used it to unify the country and he's still splitting the country and I don't think he has any desire to unify the country I know very self-serving I I agree and I you know I don't think Hillary did either you know and done you know what I mean and that's the problem with our parties right now is that they're serving themselves before they serve the country well I think it speaks to what you were talking about in your book that no one is looking at this like a real tribe and this is a enormous tribe of 350 million people but there's no one person that's standing out as a real leader and at least what Obama was I mean whether you agree with his policies and there's a lot but I don't agree with its particularly and where the way he flip-flopped about whistleblowers and freedom of the press things disturbed me greatly yeah because I know how intelligent he is I know he's a lawyer he was a statesman though I mean he really came across as a guy who you go oh well that that guy should be the president he sounds like the president he's he has a fantastic vocabulary speaks clearly he's very he's a highly honed human being that's right that's right no I know I agree and I you know there there are things I didn't like whatever that about him but but absolutely as a person I mean he brought a huge I thought he brought a huge sort of gravitas and dignity to the office dignity yes definitely without a doubt you mean he was probably one of the best ever at that but I think that what we need now is someone who genuinely wants to help the country be unified yeah and someone who genuinely wants to help the country not help their party not that help themselves not just think well hey when this is all done I'm gonna make  a million dollars a year doing speaking fees or whatever however might they make when they do that well you yeah and you're gonna I mean we need I mean we need that to stay to remain a country yeah right I mean what like I mean it really is headed towards a bad place I think and so that person is gonna have to overcome the server the reflexive reaction of the left-wing you know he's not my president like and the reflexive reaction of the right-wing the right-wing hated Obama in ways that were completely out of proportion to Obama's actual policies right and you know when Mitch McConnell said you know the Republicans job in Congress their foremost job is to make sure that Barack Obama is a complete failure as a president like that's not serving the country not at all right so so you need a leader who's actually able to overcome that toxic thinking in both parties right right I mean who like is Jesus coming back like I was gonna do this is gonna do this but I think the start is a bipartisan Commission that starts to call people out mm-hmm right see you you have Republicans calling Republicans out because they're on this you have Democrats calling Democrats out you need it you got the free speech to make a fool yourself go for it but you're not gonna undermine this country without being called out by this commission and and I was talking with someone in government pretty high up about this and I said you know I had said my thing your bullets aren't going to destroy this country al Qaeda is never gonna destroy this country but our own words will can destroy our democracy like that actually could do it if we play this hand wrong and I said that makes partisan rhetoric actually a matter of national security and when you can think about as a think about it as a national security concern then you actually have a sort of political and legal basis performing a commission that addresses it and I really truly think that should happen and if it doesn't hopefully something else will happen that works but it's the only thing I can think of that will begin to address that they can they can rise up above the partisan interest of both parties because those the parties clearly don't seem capable of doing it on their own now when you write a book like try when you outline all these issues that people have and all these issues historically the people have had do you try to consider a solution I mean do you do you have a solution are you just examining all the various problems that we have so I mean tribe was me trying to make sense of sort of what ails us right starting with you know people hemorrhaging off the frontier to the American Indians like and on up to the soldiers I was with mass shootings you know what something's something's not working for us right what so it was for most an analysis and towards the end I talked a little bit about solutions and one of the solutions I talked about was making a concerted effort to get rid of contemptuous partisan rhetoric in government and I really felt like that trickles down and pollutes you know it pollutes the water stream down like downstream it blows everything so that everyone all US citizens are drinking toxic water from from that rhetoric and wondering if the unity can survive like will this will the center hold you know you hear your parents screaming at each other in the bedroom and saying unforgivable things to each other as a child you might rightly think wow this marriage isn't lasting this family is not lasting that's how it feels to be a citizen of the United States right now my mom and dad are screaming at each other and so I talked about contempt disagree if you want don't speak with contempt about someone you share a combat outpost with and that's what this country potentially is don't you think also with the mom and dad analogy that it also shows you how to behave in your own life that's one of the things that's really important about the president is the president does sort of represent the best example of what we can be when we were kids growing up that was the thing like he asked a kid what they want to be if someone said I want to be president we're like holy you're really going for a kid you want to be the biggest job that's the number-one position so you're supposed to be the best person ever which is why we hold someone to such an incredible microscope which is almost even more impressive that Trump won after that grab the audio recording and then he could just brush that off hats locker room talk yeah well it's right in a way he's kind of right I mean it really is kind of up that they did try to use that on him and pull it out the last minute but it does give you also an understanding of how he thinks and behaves when no one's around right I mean you know my problem with him was that I like if I look at the worst of his behavior I mean people send Society says people to jail for the worst thing that they did so it is actually legitimate to judge people's worst behavior sure and evaluate them on that basis so if I look at the war look at the worst of his behavior even if I was a die-hard Republican who adhered to all of the things he says he believes it if I looked at the worst of his behavior mocking a gold star family mmm like mocking a disabled person hmm I had that it wasn't real dumb you know that mocking a disabled person was sort of trumped up he does hate to use that word trumped-up he does that whenever he's talking about anyone like he's like when he acts flustered like Oh what are you gonna do like that they tried to say that he was mocking a reporter that it was disabled but it's pretty clear that that's not right well I mean maybe so but with a dis it with a question from someone who's visibly disabled maybe you just don't do that right you know what I mean like if that's a pattern maybe but maybe I'm giving them more of the benefit of doubt than I should if it was the only example that I wouldn't be thinking about it but there is a sort of pattern that that that model from Mexico who gains him weight that he was mocking I mean like the mockery of less powerful people is sort of endless and right so to me I wouldn't I wouldn't have that person at my dinner table right you know I mean like I just with my close friends like someone who was acting like that he started acting like started doing that and my dinner table I walk around I get up I walk around the table where I put him in a headlock they dragged him out of my house right right I don't want to think that about my president right I want my president to be someone I'd be like glad to have at my dinner table I would have I didn't vote for George Bush but I love to have that guy at my dinner table Ronald Reagan dinner you know what I mean like he's the first president I mean like no man I don't want to subject my my friends to that they ever read woody arrow Woody Harrelson's account of dinner that he had with Trump no he said literally he had to get up in the middle and go outside and smoke a joint just it just relaxed himself yeah I was talking about it I think he said early 2000 he had dinner with Trump and he said he never met someone so narcissistic so self-obsessed yeah and you know the you know my worry like in this conversation is that it will somehow seem partisan and like I would be saying the same things if Trump were a Democrat well you said something about George Bush that you would be happy to have him over I just think I hope that what comes out of this is that a hero will rise and that someone will someone who's really a legitimately good person will say look this is a this is a  travesty like so so someone who actually could assume the role correctly will step into place and we'll see that very clearly in comparison right well what I mean you get back to your question one of the solutions that I talked about it's not in my book but I talked about this isn't is national compulsory national service with them with a military option and in that your question was how do we make this nation feel like a nation right and the problem psychologists will tell you that the more you sacrifice for something the more you value it right if if you're part of something that doesn't require any sacrifice at all you just don't value it very highly right the advantage of national service and I don't mean the draft I think I don't mean military service I mean national service with the military option I don't think it's moral to force someone to fight a war that they don't believe in but what sort of service would you you know whatever whatever it is the nation needs a lot of stuff done right and and whatever that may be but the point of it is so if you had a military option but otherwise you could teach in schools otherwise you could dig ditches I don't whatever the nation needs done this work of this Corps of workers at 22 23 years old does it for a year my first wife was from from the eastern from Eastern Europe and the young people formed work brigades in the summer and and helped harvest like harvest wheat and stuff like that was what she did when she was a teenage girl and it was incredibly good for the kids over there and it made them feel like they're part of something right and so what I would say there's a downside to national service which is the government's telling people what to do of course there's also an upside which is it makes everyone feel like they're part of this thing called the United States and it puts white people and black people in rich and poor everyone puts them all into a big pot and stirs them up just like the military does and they get to know each other and so everything's is it upside and downside to everything right so National Service has a very obvious downside but the upside isn't discussed much which is that it creates an American identity a shared experience that all Americans have that they could like in Israel there's compulsory service and that that is a common ground that every single Israeli has whatever wherever they fall in the political spectrum they all have that shared experience and it's enormous ly potent thing in that country keeping it bound together in this country I think needs something like that I think very healthful well it would be nice if people did have some I mean if you if you some sort of connection to what it takes to keep things running whether it's help fix the streets whether it's you know help do something but the problem that I would have it probably I would have with it is the idea that someone from the government would be able to require you to do something and that if you didn't do it they could treat you the same way the IRS treats you if you don't pay your taxes I just lock you in a cage which is well I mean one made it one way to do it might be to incentivize it by and so instead of making it mandatory incentivizing it by giving people really large tax breaks for doing it yeah but young people are going to think about tax breaks they're gonna think about that man I wanna skateboard alright alright gonna go alright then they have to I mean listen to driving listen for most of this nation's history we've had a draft is the government telling people what to do right and likewise with taxes you don't pay your taxes your Jail like I mean the government does too you know the government puts red lights and intersections and you have to stop I agree but to try to do that today it'd be extremely difficult the distrust of the government is so high and if the government comes along and says you have to do all these things and then we go wait a minute are you doing these things are you gonna join the military you're 55 years old you're senator are you going to go pick wheat or just the roads it definitely has to start I mean you can't you're not gonna get 60 year olds and natural service right they're already involved in our lives they're the great thing about 18 19 20 year olds 22 year olds is their their lives haven't really started yet I mean that's why it works in Israel yeah so are people gonna object you of course they are but the question is how do we unify this country the truth is like if we wanted to unify communities you'd ban the car right right people can you know they they're living they're spending their whole lives within walking distance of their home that will that will unify communities we're not willing to do that what will unify the country's national service we may not be willing to do it but that's a different conversation from would it work or not my opinion is is that it would help it's a good opinion I mean I I definitely see Meriden and I definitely think there would be something that would be a fascinating debate to have back and forth I just wonder if people at any point in their lives today would be willing to give up for them for the government I think people are used to this kind of like free ride I pay my taxes and that's all you got from me I don't have to vote I don't do anything you know in Australia you have to vote if you don't vote you get fined well that you know that's what you set it right there that's the misconception it's not for the government it's for your neighbor it's for your fellow citizens everything you do you pay your taxes not for the government you pay your taxes for the country but you pay them to the gun pay them to the government there's no auditing of your taxes and I think that's one of the things that freaks people out today like you don't know where that money's going they don't have to tell you and if you don't give it to them they'll lock you up right and that's the problem with the large-scale society is that collective effort it's not clear that that collective effort is going to the whole entity it looks like it's going to the taxman it's not I mean that's a delusion right but I mean the cheque is to the IRS the IRS hands it over to the government that that's but then spends it on the country I mean that's the reality but it looks like the IRS is oppressing you yeah but that's actually not what's happening right the IRS is an arm of government that you elected in right and it's been charged with getting getting money from people like that's just the the IRS isn't doing anything it was like it's like TSA I was standing in line at TSA and someone was complaining about how long it was taking and and and the guy next to her they didn't even know each other and the guy next sir he said look they're not doing it for them they're doing it for us bro they're searching all our stuff they don't care right they're not on the damn plane they're searching our stuff for us likewise with the government the government isn't doing it for itself it's doing it for us right we'd like to think of it as one entity right we like to think of the IRS as the government you know they are collecting the money we're almost think of it as them spending the money as well right we don't think of it as them as distribute to the rest of the government that's right yeah that's right so if you want to gin up as sort of like anti-government screed like it's easy to play on that misperception because it's an easy misperception right to have I mean you get a $200 parking ticket in New York it definitely feels like the parking Bureau it's like is is vengeful is you know what I mean has targeted you personally they're going to take your $200 and spend it on itself that's what it feels like right the truth is that that $200 paves the deal fills in the potholes that you're gonna be driving across next year yeah that's the truth of it right you know what we're talking about solutions for the woes of society and the end particularly the individual you have sort of found your own solution in journalism and an embedded journalism in these very dangerous environments that this is how you have sort of reinforced your tribe and you talk about that in the book about how you know how well you slept in this very tight confined in these bases with all these like very loud snoring men but but the fact that you guys were all together in this very hostile environment that was your solution well I mean it wasn't a solution in the sense I mean it wasn't a long-term solution right but it did give me this experience of sort of sort of shared a shared fate right I mean it saw a collective effort right I'm as part of this group and my my welfare was tied to the welfare of the group my actions could help or hinder the group I was judged by how I behaved in the group right and that's that's our evolutionary past and it felt great right yeah and so that you know the trick is we you know you live in a dispersed modern society where that's just not going to be the 24 hour a day reality for most people throughout their lives but it may not need to be you may just need a little bit of it you know maybe you get a little bit of that sort of collective that collective norm at the boxing gym you know maybe you get it in the military you know maybe you get it hunting you know whatever like there are ways to experience it and maybe you just you know you maybe you get in a church you know I mean I'm not religious but I understand trick to be a profoundly communal activity and so I'm not saying burn down that suburbs and band the car although that would work pretty well maybe for your own personal sense of sort of meaning and fulfillment in life finally find that collective experience in little bits and pieces and the little goes a long way yeah and doing something doing something difficult to think it's also very important absolutely I mean getting the other shoe pool with your buddies every Thursday night that's great but it's not quite what we're talking about yeah yeah difficult things and things that test you physically and mentally for some reason they're those seem to be a requirement for people and when people don't don't fulfill that requirement it seems to me that those are the people that are most unhappy yeah I mean the state there have to be stakes involved yes there are no stakes to pool right to golf right there pleasure sampling right that yeah but that's not a collective you know I mean that's not a collective state right and they're pleasant activities but what you know what what reproduces our evolutionary past is being in a small group where the stakes are but the stakes are serious if not life and death but even even if it's not life and death at least they're real physical consequences and that collective action makes you more makes the group more able to navigate those adversities successfully and when you do that a it is it's an intoxicating feeling it's what we're wired for it's what we're missing in our sort of like modern lives and you you don't need you don't need a huge amount of it to feel better another thing that seems to make people feel very fulfilled is creating things working with their hands creating anything whether it's furniture art just making something doing something where your mind is involved in an actual task of bringing forth something into existence that didn't exist before what well think about it I mean again in terms of evolution if doing something successfully produces a chemical reaction that feels good a little bit of dopamine or in terms of communal connection a little bit of oxytocin the the trained monkey that we are will continue doing that good thing so so basically the tasks that helped with survival get rewarded with neuro chemicals that feel good yeah and the things that are dangerous to us and and less than our chance for survival don't feel good so being isolated being alienated from your group being an outcast it feels bad and your survival chances go down right right you don't want to stay in that place you want to join the group again and so there's these neural chemical reward incentives and punishments that gets our heard people towards this behaviors that help survival build doing things accomplishing things building things that all feels good it's clearly what we needed to do in our evolutionary past and it's reinforced and creativity factors onto that how that likes a lick are like painting or something like that like there's something deeply satisfying to people that are painters well yeah and what they're I mean art they know from the from the incredible paintings on the caves and in the caves and France and Spain let's go and the other caves that art is one of the things that's used to bind communities together in ceremonies I mean you can see in church I mean there's no there is no church in the land that doesn't have art on the walls right right the depictions of Christ or whatever or one uh the visual aids that helps bind people into a group like oh we all believe in the same thing right so art is a great binding force music is an incredible binding force it's a rhythmic like rhythm heavy drumming rhythm we'll get a whole group of people sort of moving in unison and Jonathan hate has talked about I talked about that sort of hive behavior and how it works and very very powerful so what I would say and I'm just guessing here but I would say is that the arch that are so intoxicating to be engaged in their survival value is that it makes the group cohere around a unified idea and that music does that the visual arts do that the spoken word poetry song all those do that as well and so they say you have a group of people that are they're unified on these all these different levels so what happens when the enemy comes I mean the music starts the sort of like visual pageantry starts like and you get you know like the you know the wartime posters showing heroic soldiers with rifle and bayonet right you get the art of the war art right you get the martial music all of that galvanizes the public spirit to face the enemy and it worked extremely well Wow so you think that that's one of the reasons why art is so satisfying I mean I just assumed that our evolution has produced that anything that feels good to us mmm had survival value in our past so if creating art feels good that's because we are genetically predisposed towards doing things that bind the group together generosity feels good right if you walk down the street and give someone five dollars uses a random dude you just give him five bucks and you measure the the neuro chemicals in his brain and your brain you get more of a high than he does right so generosity feels good it's clearly adaptive and helps groups go here mmm right yeah and art as well so let art like when you create something amazing what you're realizing is that someone's gonna see that and go wow that's incredible like you're gonna get a great feeling off of seeing your art yeah you have the same vision right oh I painted that tree and this other person or that antelope or that bison or whatever you find in the walls of Lesko and this other person comes like oh my god that's an incredible bison there's no like you did something that the other person connected to now you the two of you are joined in your understanding of what that painting means mm right and that's a very powerful thing so if you drew that bison and no one else in the world ever saw it I'm guessing that the chemical rewards for that creativity would be let will be lower yeah I you know I noticed that in my children my kids loved to draw and one of the things that they loved is showing their drawings I mean they loved to draw but like not yet not yet right and then when they're done look that's right and then just like boom they did they're getting that little rush themselves and you get the rush and I mean look I mean just do it it's easy to test like take a musician measure their neuro chemicals while they're practicing in a room by themselves and then put him in a in a in a stadium filled with 10,000 people and see what happens right I'm guessing the guy yeah in the stadium with Bruce Springsteen in front of 10,000 people is experiencing a neurochemical reality that he's not getting in his living room not only that are probably a neurochemical reality that very few human beings will ever experience that's right some sort of a strange but think about the power of that I mean you know any musician on stage is basically acting sort of in the role of the shaman yeah right they're like I'm going to act I'm going to act as a conduit between you all and the divine mm-hm right and my music is gonna do what my words are going to do what my dance is gonna whatever it is but I'm the conduit right I don't matter I'm connecting you with the with a divine feeling and that feeling is gonna unify all of you and I'm gonna play these chords I'm gonna sing this song and like magic you all are gonna be snapping your feet in unison yeah like how do you get ten thousand people do the same thing at the same time you sing him a song it's the only way to do it that's an incredibly powerful thing and that's the I mean that's the power of the shaman I mean Bruce Springsteen isn't the shaman literally but he occupies that space in a modern secular secular society doesn't have shamans but it but in the old days that's what he would be do you feel that way when you put a book out like when you pick the book out when you know it's done you read it it's done and you send it out there do what kind of weird feeling that you yeah these people gonna really it's an interesting thing about a book because you actually never observe in real time people's reaction to it right I mean I'm not perched on someone's armchair watching them read in bed you know what I mean the general public about like reviews yeah well that's also very it's very distant I mean but when I started making documentaries for the first time I had the experience are the experiencing of watching other people's experience when I'd done all right I'm not watching the audience I'm in the audience and I'm watching people react to Restrepo yes I never got to see people react to the books I've read because I'm not in their damn bedroom right right but I am in the movie theater I'm watching people react to the things that the film's I made and I wouldn't say well it's apples or oranges I don't know which is one better ones what you know whatever but it's a very different experience and it's incredibly powerful which do you like one better I mean movies just can't they don't have enough bits of information right I mean a book you could really communicate information right very sophisticated ideas and they're permanent right there they are in the person's bookshelf and the person can underline that paragraph and go back to it you know you've actually effected the sort of communal thinking you've affected the way people understand the world a film is an experience more than it is it's sort of data dump and or a philosophical argument and that experience is very very powerful and it acts from a different part of the brain than a book does it's much more emotional I mean I've you know I've I've choked up I've teared up watching my own films because they're personal to me you know I've never done that reading my own book rereading a book that I've written so it's a different experience and I would and I would say this is just different parts of the human mind like it you need you sort of need both so no a long answer I don't have a preference I feel like I need both now this documentary on Syria yeah when is this available well it we make is called Hell on Earth our website is Hell on Earth calm its how'd you get that seems like that would already been taken that's true I thought about that I didn't I wasn't in charge of getting it but it's right so it's called hell on earth it's about the Syrian civil war we made it for National Geographic I made it with Nick quested my partner and all the films that I've made and it brought it broadcast last June it's gonna you know NatGeo rebroadcast everything that they do obviously you can also go to their web site and stream it it's about treatment today yeah absolutely it's about the Syrian civil war how it started and particularly how Isis why Isis rose up out of that and we all know what Isis is this is grotesquely violent radical jihadist movement and and that we have all seen you know seen their video heard of their videos or their beheading people and you know in front of a video camera and ghastly ghastly things he said why did that you know why did that happen in Syria how did that that mutation occur at this point in history in that place and so the film examines that and were you there did you go to Syria no you know after my friend Tim Hetherington was killed Tim obviously I made Restrepo with and he was a brother and a good friend and a colleague and he was killed in Libya in 2011 on an assignment that I was supposed to be on with him the last minute I couldn't go and he got killed and so I stopped more reporting after that frontline reporting Syria was so dangerous that you couldn't think of going in there I mean in numerous kidnappings and beheadings it was basically a suicide by the time we started working on the story it was a suicide mission so we actually worked with Syrians in Syria who were documenting their own war including an incredible family that was living under in territory under Isis control and surviving and they were trying to figure out like do we try to escape or not and of course if you try to escape and you're caught you're dead they will drag your family out of a pickup truck and line you up in a wall machine gun you but they were worried that if they stayed they'd also die and they decided to escape we got a camera to them and a very nondescript little cell phone camera and they self documented life under Isis and the decision to leave and the their flight through the Isis checkpoints through the front lines all the way to Turkey and they self documented and it's part of it's the sort of through line in the movie absolutely extraordinary family Wow and so then they're in Turkey now Peter in Turkey they tried to get to Greece on a rubber raft on his OD AK they returned again this is also documented by them it's in the film they returned back at the last moment by the Greek by the Turkish Coast Guard sent back and now they're in Greece on they're actually doing really well they started a small business they're incredibly hard-working resourceful beautiful people I mean they're you know like I wish they could come to this country we'd be lucky to have them and they'd be lucky to have us they're an incredible family and if you see the film you know you see what I'm talking about that's a that's a big point that a lot of people felt was missed and all the criticisms of immigrants coming over to this country you know the stops close the border stop allowing Muslims stop allowing all these people to come over from these these dangerous areas the somehow none of these people would be agents of these dangerous areas coming to destroy our democracy but these people are trapped a lot of these people are people that are experiencing these horrible conditions much like many of the people that originally made it to America in the first place I mean country is immigrants this is what this country is my my father is a two-time war refugee all right I mean he fled Spain during the civil war and he's passed away he was born in 1920 1923 he fled Spain during the Civil War then he fled France because the Nazis rolled in and he came to this country he was a brilliant physicist then we were lucky to have him right now and he was eternally lucky to be part of this country as well so I what was on about Trump's try me not to get political again but I got to say what was odd about Trump's travel ban that there were countries that we'd never been attacked by right like no one from those countries had ever attacked this country like I don't like one of those countries doing on the travel ban this lunatic that killed people in New York was Becca Stan like that wasn't on the travel ban like I mean I understand trying to create a filter that keeps bad people out of course every country does that I just didn't understand this specific logic of those countries on the list it made no sense to me no it made no sense to anybody and it's also you you're assuming that everybody in these areas is bad including the people trying to escape that sounds that sounds insane and that sounds it's just it's cruel and anti human to not want people to have a chance I'm not saying don't vet these people out don't interview them and communicate with them and find out what their backgrounds are as much information as you can get yeah of course you are you concerned cuz this is something that's been bothering me I was concerned about my own reaction to yesterday's mass shooting that I was almost nonchalant about it I was like well there's another one like we're getting numb to mass shoot you know I asked myself two questions and and I didn't mean to ask them and I'm just being honest in telling people this I asked myself I wonder if it was a white church or a black church and I asked myself I wonder if the attacker was an Islamic radical and a foreigner or was he a homegrown American I assumed it was a he obviously yeah and I don't even know what that says what those questions say about me or about the country but it's really interesting those are the first things I asked and I didn't like I didn't like that those questions came to my mind so quickly there was something about it that didn't feel good and they're very obvious questions to ask I mean you know it's clear that those are very important things to know but I didn't like that it came to me so quickly yeah I asked the exact same questions but I also felt like it's just these are patterns there's they're inescapable patterns whether it's the Vegas massacre or this one or the the Orlando shootings it's always a man and is it a Muslim or is it a crazy white guy well you know I try by right about mass shootings they're a very particular thing I mean there's gang shootings in Chicago or whatever that may have a kind of logic to them right like you're controlling turf there's money involved drugs but it makes sense though so you a bunch of innocent people get shot that's the price you pay for gang wars there's a logic to it there is mass shootings are completely nihilistic right it's someone killing as many people that he doesn't know right as possible before he dies it's totally nihilistic and what I found and I did a lot of research into it that that caught those kinds of mass shootings typically happened in middle-class communities like otherwise safe middle-class communities or small low crime Christian communities they have never happened in the inner city even literally never happened they happen in communities that are otherwise very safe very Christian very very boring frankly and it really made me wonder like is there I mean lots of countries have as many guns as we do every country has crazy people in it in them right we are the only country that does this to ourselves and we do it only in a certain kind of community right weird doesn't happen in high-crime low-income communities right it happens in the most sort of like small quiet Christian low-crime bland suburban or rural communities that's where it happened so what does it say why is it that these communities are not producing crazy people but somehow those people come to a place where they think this is a good thing to do like why is that happening my theory is that the the deep alienation of the suburbs of small-town America the lot the lack of real community effort and the lack of national unity in the mean the mass killings have risen abruptly in the last 15 years and I you know it's hard for me it's you don't murder people in your own community when that happens it means the community doesn't exist at least for the murderer and do you see any connection or do you consider any connection between psych drugs I mean I don't know how many of these people are on psych drugs tremendous amount yeah like there was a study that did see if you could find it Jamie they connected all the mass shootings that have happened over the last two decades with all the different medications that people are on and every single one of them was on something well or or was what withdrawing from some okay so there's the here's the question are the drugs creating the behavior or the drugs treating a mental disorder that itself is tied to the behavior very good question right I mean there's no way to know the mass shootings of the nihilistic sort that I'm referring to started a ruff abruptly rose in the 80s mm-hmm okay and then doubled since 2006 and I think they're increasing even more since then so every mass shooting over the last 20 years has one thing in common and isn't guns yeah this is it right but that's not that's not just positive right you know what I mean like it's see you're right it's not correlation isn't something to quickly addition it could be the depression is rising hmm I in alienated communities and the depression is getting unsuccessfully treated with drugs so all these people are on drugs but really what's happening is that and this is true suicide depression PTSD anxiety alienation all of these things are going up in society I mean that's just statistically true unquestionably the question that I would have about this though is that when I've talked to psyche psychiatrists about it they say that the dissociative aspect of these psychiatric medications are part of the problems that people do not feel they don't feel the connection even to their actions that they can do something horrific like shoot pee and they might be even doing that to try to get to get some feeling listen that's totally possible I would also offer this idea that the massive national addiction to violent video games is a dissociated experience you're shooting people they're not real people that doesn't happen you know right I mean I know connected somehow I don't know but I'm just saying what you just described happening in the streets of America is exactly duplicated digitally in video games right but the video games doesn't it doesn't keep you from feeling things in the real world where the psyche medications do right but did the experience of shooting at human targets that aren't real right if you incorporate that into how you feel about shooting and then you go out into the real world it may not be that hard to particularly with the AIDS of a dove psych drugs and whatever depression is sort of endemic in this society right now it might not be hard to to transpose that dissociated experience in a video game with digital images transpose it onto actual humans in the real world if you're sufficiently disturbed that's a very good connection and an interesting question because I've heard it discussed when they talk about war and how kids that grow up playing like Call of Duty and things along those lines they get really good at it would be actually better in combat they would have the tactics mapped out in their mind better yeah yeah absolutely absolutely I mean look there's a TV program called active shooter right like and they go back I've just heard about I haven't seen it I've never watch it but it's it's they go back and recreate they interview everyone who survived an active shooting incident and recreate it and now people watch for I mean on some sense entertainment right TV is entertainment they watch for entertainment recreations of acting shooting incidents that are I think partly the result of the kind of deep alienation that happens in a media obsessed society that we're no one's talking to you know I mean it's a perfect circle right like well they're definitely escalating right I mean we had the event in New York where the guy runs over all those people and then a couple of days later or happened the one in Texas look this is this is happening not over the scale of one year one every few years we're getting them once a week well yeah and what's interesting in New York there was an ideology behind it so it wasn't nihilistic I mean it felt lyall is stick to us but to that guy he actually believed in what he was doing but the real mass shooters that they're just out there to kill as many people as possible it's hard to know what the ideology well this guy was dishonorably discharged from the military for something I forget what it was so he was in a position what's up it was a abuse on his spouse in trouble right and he didn't have a license to own a gun but you know he owned whatever guns that he had he got them illegally in Colorado he drove to Colorado that's what I heard he got it was in Texas oh you think you got him in Colorado did he get him at a gun show or something like that yeah I mean we're looking at little tiny details the real question is how the does a person do something like that I mean shot babies you know I mean shot five-year-olds and the whole thing is just it doesn't even make sense and I don't know if he was on a psych medication or if they know he was but you know just the staggering numbers of broken individuals that are committing these crimes is just very very confusing like and you think that it's tied to well what you were saying to about communities about inner cities where you have impoverished high crime areas but they're not seeing these things do you think because in these high crime communities are dealing with much more life and death and the struggle is much more real that they feel more connected oh you know I this is totally a theory I mean I have no idea it's just that the truth is that those awful sorry tangs and mass shootings in the streets have never happened in a high-crime high crime neighborhood and so one has to wonder what is it it's possible that for all their very real stresses and traumas of poverty that for all those things there is also more face-to-face communal connection in poor neighborhoods than in wealthy neighborhoods or in middle-class neighborhoods and that that communal connection I mean literally meeting people on the landing of your apartment building right meeting people on the door stoop on the street you know what yeah that those kinds of human in Iraq even at even in us in an economically stressed neighborhood that those create enough of a sense of community that people who might otherwise go crazy and turn their guns in this nihilistic way and on people on innocent people that they just don't do it because why would I do that to my own people right that's the and what I fear in this country is that we're losing the sense of what our own people are yeah what are our own people and if you're doing that in the streets of the neighboring town like you know clearly there's been some loss of like some idea of what what we belong to and that's where you know national service or a congressional commission that really calls out rhetoric that that undermines our sense of who we are as a nation like you know it might start at the top changing that might start at the top it might help do you think there's any incentive that these people experience to be someone who creates this big event where everybody has to look at them yeah I mean I I mean I'm guessing but I'm I'm imagining that someone like that feels powerless and insignificant and abused by society and at least they'll be famous in their last acts and their death they're gonna cause a lot of reaction they're gonna you're like oh you messed with me my whole life at least for the last five minutes of my life you you guys are the ones that are gonna be scared you're gonna be begging me for mercy no I begged you for mercy my whole life now you're gonna be begging me for mercy I mean I'm totally guessing right I'm just riffing here but I wouldn't be surprised if there was something of that to it well it's a good guess I mean this this has been a very common conversation lately as to whether or not you discuss these people and even bring up their names I know in some places and some even media outlets they don't want to report on the person the individual is creating this chaos well you know one of the things I think is the problem is that if you love this country there is a certain pressure to think it's the best possible country ever right yeah and I think it's very painful for Americans to actually look at the actual statistics and say you know for example with mass shootings we're the only country that does this to ourselves the only one there's not on another country that's actually not at the rate that we do right I mean they're in China they're you know there's a rash of knife attacks right I mean I mean it's nothing that doesn't happen at all but if you really look over the last like 20 years since they don't know more than that since the 80s when this started like we're the only country that does this regularly to ourselves then regularly to the point where it's like every month practically right right so it's it's a sign I mean if your child was acting out in a violent way and punching kids in the playground you'd think okay he's in pain right he's acting out like what's wrong with this kid like he's clearly in pain in some kind of pain and he's lashing out well the society is in some kind of pain like what is it you know and you know you you know you can just miss me as a like bleeding-heart liberal you know whatever I don't mean you but one could dismiss me as a bleeding-heart like okay well then what's your it's what's your question that my question is what what why are we in so much pain right that's the question I think might begin to lead to an answer of why there's such high suicide rates in such a wealthy society why there's mass killing you know that would begin to answer those questions if you don't like that question what's your question to answer those terrible tragedies what's your question well what you're saying is very compelling and it's it's an aspect of this that I don't think it's being considered and I think your book is very important when it comes to that I think the questions that you raised and the all the the various examples that you give there it's it's really food for thought and I don't think it's being discussed in very many other circles it's everyone's looking at the psychiatric drugs everyone's looking at the white men with guns and the gun problem the NRA and all these various aspects they're not looking at the root cause of this depression anxiety and this detachment that we have from our neighbors in our community look I mean Somalia has got a lot more guns than we do right and there's plenty of violence in Somalia but no one's walking down the streets of their own neighborhood massacring their own people only we do that and what is you know in a sense it's a call to a cry for help by our society like not by that person I'm saying generally the phenomenon within our society is a kind of cry for help like we are something is wrong psychically spiritually wrong Christians will say we're not a Christian enough country but I you know like that's that's that's that's a that's not true that's not the problem right there there are peaceful Muslim societies and very violent Christian ones you can't correlate it with Christianity I think the one thing you can they're a democracy are your oppressive societies or very low violence and they're full democracies like us with lots of violence so it's not the democratic system right what is it and my guest and it's only a guess my guess that is that a certain amount of the high suicide rates the high depression anxiety drug addiction porn addiction child abuse mass shootings shootings in the streets my guess is that the common denominator and all those things is the true catastrophic lack of communal connection that many Americans experience well it's it's a very compelling argument it's a very compelling point that again I don't see being discussed in very many other areas and I really appreciate it man I really appreciate your book I think it's great and i really suggest anybody's interested in this subject please go read it
