the jello can experience all you here's what you have to do this is my new theory identify the vampire in your life mmm find the vampire identify the parasite well it doesn't have to be that you have parasites in life it is possible that you could have gotten lucky and there's no parasite and you get off groovy sure no I'm not lying everyone's got one but if you got one if you're walking around with those fucking vampire blues you've got the fucking heavy heart and you can't feel happy and you feel bad it there may be an action that you need to take that you're afraid to take that's the vampire and you've got a fucking not even a person oh no I mean it's a situation a I see what you saying yeah it's vampire in your life yeah find a life sucking situation that you're afraid to kill and the reason I say vampires because vampires only go where they're invited and generally the situation that you're in you invited it in you invited this thing into your life and now it's sucking your life energy in your blood and your happiness away don't it's in a lot of times yeah you'll try to believe you'll try to convince yourself that this thing is not a vampire but in your heart you know you're a servant to a fucking bloodsucker you are Renfield this thing is like sucking your life essence away sometimes it's doing it with a trade quite often they'll be a bad trade you'll be you know whatever the situation you're in the ole you little bit you'll feel like you're in this situation you know it's worth it it's kind of but it's really worth it this happens with jobs quite often you know or you're like well you know but it's good enough that's the vampire you gotta take a fucking stake and drive it into its heart - how do you kill a vampire two ways direct action you don't kill a vampire by like making up with a vampire you don't kill a vampire by like having a sit-down talk with a vampire you're not gonna be able to like you know make friends with the vampire there's two ways to kill a vampire one you fuckin you know put a stake in its heart the other one is light sunlight truth light that's it's the greatest metaphor of all time you shine the light of truth onto the situation fearlessly analyze it and then you'll destroy it you know if you really allow yourself if you can act you gotta add the real problem with people is not recognizing the enemy it's acting on that enemy yeah that's the real problem and that enemy being you know personal your personal demons your your personal jihad it's a personal issue you gotta fight the beast and it's in the end you know what I mean it's like everybody's beast is different chapter 2 of the bhagavad-gita Arjuna's dejection Arjuna is drawn between these two forces he does not want to fight he drops his bow and God says to him you've got rise to the fight fight you're a warrior this is what you're here for fight fight it's but it's better to die it's better to die in a righteous battle and go skulking off into the fucking woods and be a beggar it's better to fucking do what you do and you're a warrior you gotta fucking do it man it fucking sucks when when you're drunk and you want to throw up and you try to not make yourself throw up just throw up you'll feel better you'll feel better in the end when you're puking it's gonna suck because you're helpless and you can't breathe go through it man fucking jab a fucking knife into the foot not literally of course but yeah you got to act and you got to make the big fucking decision sometimes and it's scary if it wasn't scary it wouldn't be worth anything yeah for some people it's almost like they don't know how to start they know that there's action they need to take in their life but they're paralyzed trying to think about it trying to figure out how star and they can never gather up the courage to get away it's like that's a lot a lot of people stay in abusive relationships they don't they don't have the courage to leave exactly because it's scary and it seems like it's you know there's so many things that people will like who ideas people will create they'll keep you trapped in whatever prison you're it's very similar to and not I mean what you're talking about in the UFC with these fucking fighters this is a visual representation of what anyone can do in their life but you know you're not good maybe not all of us are gonna get obviously be world-class fighters they get in a ring in front of the entire planet and fucking knock someone out but you have in your life right now if you haven't already done this there's you have the chance to be heroic you have the ability right now to make a heroic act they could kill you that's the thing these actions it's not always guaranteed that because you do the right thing you're gonna end up in a great place you might end up fucked you might end up you might end up temporarily in a homeless or you might end up temporarily jobless if there wasn't risk associated with it you would have already done it that's the point you know if there wasn't risk associated with it wouldn't be worth anything you know if Mount fucking you know if the Himalayas were you know a little Greek grass covered hill and apart nobody take pictures of them at the top putting a flag into it it's a danger makes it heroic you know so sometimes you just have to fucking it's not like Tony Robbins take the leap kill the vampire in your life kill the vampire you life is a brilliant speech dude oh shit iTunes recording to servers get the fuck out of here server
