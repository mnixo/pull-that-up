boom did you go in in a motorcycle I did you're a fucking animal in this day and age in LA traffic but there's a there's a bit of a Zen thing happening because if you don't pay attention you could die you know all right you know and I find myself trying to have this field of view and plus you can't be on the phone right because I think sometimes when you drive a car you forget to take the moment to do nothing we're just sort of be for a second yeah and you can listen to tunes and it makes all the songs better like I I don't know if I fully appreciate a Judas Priest until I wrote a motorcycle and could listen to music like so you listen like in your head like you have it enough you're that one has the luxury of having a couple of them and but that one's almost like the grandpa bike for going to the movies but is it its speakers or is it in the helmet its speakers I don't do the helmet cuz there's so much of that in my life anyway it's like point-blank range yeah and so it's it's almost like you kind of end up rocking your head like that and you're like breaking the law it's it's sort of like flips your Bevis switch and and it feels wonderful like the divin'd in your hair yeah and getting here took why don't know where you came from but I I beat you here and I left but after you did would you drive from like I can't I was sort of over by Runyon Canyon okay yeah if you live in like Orange County I get it cuz that's really like the only way you're gonna get here and not lose your fucking mind well it's something that's 21 miles away is 25 minutes away legitimately yeah yeah I mean there's a little bit of like should I go stop here and also you're always going to the front of traffic which really is the safest place to be at the very front sure does everyone on each butt cheek sort of you know the thing that freaks me out there was the lane splitting like so some people are just not paying attention and some people some people are going there last yeah that some people work out there they're kinky anger on you Oh on the bike you mean or the collects like no way if I'm stuck in this you're stuck at this that is fucking weird man that thing's weird what kind of anger against motorcycles like that they can they can get ahead and you can't just it's it's beyond motorcycles you know it's that angriness of like their their emotional bank accounts are low in that moment and they're like how about you yeah you can have that too it's like oh sharing the wrong shit yeah that's I think it's people that don't feel like there's a way out of the life they're into there's no there's no light in the top you have the Missouri loves company where it's just like welcome to the Missouri loves company sit down and they're just like it's just I don't know I've so much has have been happening for me lately and I just you have those things when they click and you and then you can't unknown once you've learned something yeah and it's like I see how that is just really attempting to elevate your own situation by bringing someone down yes which is impossible and it's so in that moment that that's almost them doing the best they can I know they're trying to kill you but but it they're trying to cope with something that's it just um maybe the wrong way it's definitely the wrong way nope that's one of the weird things about being a kid right like nobody really tells you how to think nobody really teaches you how to approach situations in life and what's gonna help you and what's not gonna help you at all no but you learn some funky stuff instead yeah you know what I mean and even when you're learning the history of someone it seems like they don't tell you how they've wrestled with our motion to do the right thing or or find a way to just accept something right like how did they get to accept that this was their decision that they had to make right I don't know there's not there's not much there's not many guideposts for how to treat yourself and other people but there's like there's there's all sorts of math and stuff like that yeah but even history right there's a lot of facts this happened then that happened this is the date that this took place but the actual accounts from the human beings and even if you read it it's like I want to see the person say it you know I almost that's what the Ken Burns version of all that the one guy that Ken Burns a civil war one who's kind of like was probably alive then too it like just it seems like he's so passionate about it and he's such a good storyteller and so he's he's adding the emotions of like you know when when robert e lee was or up sorry uh the other that the union guy uh this delicious grant grant grant but had a drinking problem but then was like ah and he probably had from PTSD you know and he's he's just telling that story was such kind of emotional depth of it's cool it's nice to watch that instead of read it sometimes yeah I don't think any of us are ever gonna be able to truly understand what it was like to live without television without radio without cell phones and war like what and then war inside the same continent with other people that are supposed to be just like you that speak the same language yeah that you run the risk of own hey get hey Gary yeah if you live in like fucking Virginia somewhere on the border you could know the person who's acing you sure and be like best of luck to Gary I yeah I hope I do and don't get you I don't know what the thing I was reading this article too about how many murders took place after the war was settled where you know like for people like hey you know we're not done bro yeah you killed my whole fucking family yeah they're like cool Lincoln we're good yeah we're not good but after after what would seem like a lifetime of that sort of witnessing that and doing that and watching things that you recognize as injustice the idea of someone getting stuck in the blame and and as a vendetta and that I can I can see that I but you see how that's really it's probably why we're still having problems now it's definitely some part of it right yeah it's like my great great great great told me yeah you know when people are sort of like dipped in that kool-aid of because it my great great great great great felt this way mmm-hmm I'm supposed to to because yeah we're related so dude I'm almost done with this book I'm listen audiobook Empire the summer moon it is fucking insane it's all of us at the war Jamie Gary fucking Gary's fucking Gary that's lucky SC Gwyn gwy and n E and part of summer moon it's all about the war with the Plains tribes the Plains Plains Indians versus the settlers is fucking insane man it's insane it's like I all one knows that there was European settlers and they had conflict with Indians and there was a lot of things that happened but until you read like the accounts of all the different battles and all the things that happened and all the slaughters and all the chaos and the children and and and the message is sent by more violent like oh dude and and you think you're sending one message but you're really giving the net the wrong yeah I I can't I can't imagine and it's so far away for maybe you and I yeah that reading that is like it's like when you don't think about it it's sort of like it's just an app I don't use or something in this day and age see if they have a photo of Cynthia Ann Parker there's a couple photos of this woman who was a she was kidnapped by the by the Comanches when she was nine and her mother II one in her family was brutally murdered there was a raid on her town but they kidnapped her and she became a part of the Comanches and she married a chief and had babies with them and then they they've captured her again when with when these settlers this is a photo this lady this lady became a Comanche and then fucking hated coming back to civilization oh she was the Comanche finally lost and that's what was she was not forced to do is we kidnapped see that's a famous photo ver the one that you just had Jamie in the left hand side because she's breastfeeding and she has a bear breast and she's doing this and they used it for some sort of newspaper or story and they never did that with with like like a regular white woman they did it with her because they wanted to show that even though this woman was raised you know until she was nine years by white people she became a savage and that's why they have her there breastfeeding her half Indian baby it's it's so sad man the story about her is so sad because she didn't want to go back well what you trying to escape what what do you think the you know everyone does something with some intention and I think mostly people think they're it's a good intention whether that works out or not mm-hmm but what do you think that the thought process was behind being Comanche slaughtering everyone else and saying we're gonna keep this this gal and and and then kind of take her into the fold that sounds like a lovingly lovingly taken in the fold there's some more pragmatic apparently according to this book they they didn't have a high birthrate because women would miscarry a lot because they were on horses all the time yeah cuz they rode horses they were they were a wild fucking tribe man it was really amazing reading the accounts of rough what their life Comanche so rough but they didn't have like pottery and bats Caroline but they're rough yeah I mean they remember war like they're all bad war that was their whole thing and war with other tribes yeah just pretty much previous oh yeah where the Europeans came they were fucking everybody up they fucked everybody up the Comanches were just ruthless man yeah they did was kill Buffalo and eat buffalo meat they were just eating meat and just riding horses and fucking people up okay that part sounded delicious amazing right buffalo meat open fire I mean there's something incredible with your family you know just with a it's one of the things about Native Americans versus the Western settlers or the the people that settled is that no one ever liked Native Americans never wanted to join European civilization it was not their thing well yeah but Europeans did join these try not just as Cynthia Ann Parker lady but a bunch a bunch of people just made friends with the Indians learn the language it became a part of their culture and they were like fuck you and your yeah you can stores and all your bullshit you want to have tea in the middle of the day here dressed like that it's sort of like settlers come in and what there's what they're settling for is that they're gonna try to make the rest of the world look like what they are and they won't be able to so we'll settle for whatever we get and then there's these other people that are just sort of living a good downstream it seems like the settlers are fighting upstream Oh ISM and the Indians are just living downstream they're going with what's there yeah they're with what they're becoming part of the land instead of we should really force this thing in to make it sit they were so vacant ruthless though man so ruthless it's crazy to read all the depictions all the things that they did but it just the there's something so insanely romantic about their like they were talking about Cynthia and Parkers but when they brought her back in her thirties they brought her back to civilization how difficult it was for her to sort of reintegrate and that like the world of the Comanche was like a world of magic like in that everything was regard there was wind gods and fire gods and the trees were gods there was like thousands of God now all sudden she had to believe in one God well are just like we're you're deliberately blocking all those God's purposes right every turn right yeah because if you I mean who's to say that that like really engaging with the gods of the wind and all that mmm doesn't open this thing for you for somebody because there wasn't tons of people like you said trying to be in the white world no it was that but there was a shit ton of people a metric fuck ton trying to be Comanche and yeah Paiute and a met you know I mean there must be something really wonderful to it just maybe lacking the defense to stop us well it didn't you know it didn't work like their magic didn't protect them from the white settlers but there was something about the belief in that magic well only the last group of them yeah it did everyone else before all things must come to an end the cycle out of thing well what really got him was disease they said that disease killed somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 percent of the Native Americans which is just incredible and that's also the Aztecs it's a lot of civilizations that encounter these dirty Europeans yeah have you fucking have you ever been to Teotihuacan no I've never been there I heard it's amazing though something really interesting happened to me there now when I that not only is this square that we went to and stand on this earth mound and this guy whose nickname was gorilla giving us this wonderful tour I just have spot the most romantic tour ever of this place for such a rough place and he goes wait right here and we're in this giant square and he runs down this dirt mound about I don't know say hundred and fifty feet away 200 feet away and he goes can you hear me it was like oh my god I could hear him he goes this square was built with these mounds here to be able to speak at this voice to 250,000 people whoa and I was like what and then we walk and yeah I there is that it up there yes well it's okay it's that way and then go left and you could look this way so you have to look backwards yeah so so if we were to see that square if we were to go straight around that pyramid and make a left that's where those mountains are and and the other thing is in these that's the same shot from a different angle that's near were these hype these shaman lifts this shaman had quarters like an area of this place and there was this there's these sort of things and I said what are these to me he said their reflection ponds I said Oh like for like reflecting and goes no for reflecting and I'd never considered that you don't look at the stars by going yeah but that really you've hooked down and you mark so in seven years when it comes around again you're like oh pattern as I'm always like how do you look up and learn a pattern of that right right right but by looking down oh that's crazy so they had ponds just to look at the reflection of the stars and and map them out yeah the shaman did that was like in their neighborhood and if you the way we were shaman is if you had a birthmark on your head when you were born they immediate were like two boards broke and just put two ports and roped you and began a lifetime of of like so you're a shaman which if you had a lifetime of that you'd be like hi shaman shop hey shaman I mean it sounds like being born a Roy always the shaman don't squeeze the show even weird right because you don't have a history or a bloodline of it it's just it's the study of what we are and that that is significant mm-hmm because I thought it felt to me immediate like well everyone can't do that we need you know you don't have a thing on you so you yeah the birthmark yeah I mean that's a really good good like entry you know get the gate you know that's the case with the Dalai Lama to I think they found him when he was I thought once he was nine how old was the dalai lama when they found him but they just decided oh you're a reincarnated holy man and so you don't have to work ever again I know but can you imagine being nine and you're just like have two toys I'm like huh you don't have to work but no pussy ever what are you talking about I'd be like mom these they say I'm you don't know what you're missing yet yes before you know it's just a weird choice that and then people look to him like there's something incredibly special about him right he's the Dalai Lama but it's not like he went through this long sort of apprenticeship period where he meditated and then became the Dalai Lama or yeah a lot of 20 meditators or like you were the quietest yeah you're the best bro you the way you focus no he's fucking hey focus on me for a sec gotta get out of it you know how old was it does it say I think he might have been almost I think he's a little bit over 15 really see that seems like a rough one yeah I'm trying to read on it it says it took him four years before you actually have like we took the power of the Dalai Lama oh he was so young he kept dropping it like Gary get over here either way he was this oh do you know who else is a reincarnated holy person Stephen Segal well duh they read they they've decided one day oh you you must be some spiritual creature from another life well that actually sounds a right that's a fairly good description of him you're a creature your physical creature from another life but that's yeah there it is in 1997 Lamar penor rinpoche from Pay Pal Yul monastery announced that Seagal was a Tulku and specifically the reincarnation of chun-li drag dorje a seventeenth-century Turton thats not as a treasure revealer that sounded like me reading in the 5th grade seems like it lumpur pimp achieve from pally pally how many times you think I got him laid twice three at least raised well no he's got one in each hand this gotta be someone that had sex with him because they really thought that he was a reincarnated holy man maybe like someone from another country didn't understand him well maybe it was llama pen or Rinpoche from the Palio monastery the only way to pass this on to you I mean someone is anal he tricked somebody that's incredible III wonder how many people that works as an expression for versus the amount of people they're like what do you want on your sandwich you know like he's like well I'm a magical being and it's like would you just order your food when you went to that to the Aztec temple as a musician when you're sitting there did you like did it make sense like the acoustics like the way it's set up does oh the the way the sound works does it make sense to you like I really contracted it it it left a very lasting feeling of that we're supposed to be here and that you know it just it really restored a lot of faith in humanity III didn't focus on the ritualistic murder that was going on there it was just the crew that's the one set of people the other set of people built this and they might and they knew and you know much like the great pyramids that are really you know in the shape of Orion's belt exactly that same concept of like what's going on here matters mm-hm and if that is your focus think of how wonderful it can be you know like how did those people know how to make that with know you without the you know they say without the wheel that would be like really Amara seems the same yeah the Aztecs didn't have the wheel right exactly yeah how the fuck did they do all that well at least the way they did it physically you can kind of like that we know that they've they murdered eighty thousand slaves in a period of just a few days after the construction of that temple yeah so that was like don't tell me actually don't worry about it I'll take care of it I think they say that they were gonna be slaughtered I think it was kind of like part of the gig yeah well maybe they know that I might be wrong about that well III it doesn't with that many people it wouldn't sound surprising that you'd have some cooperation I mean it's hard to imagine 80,000 people at once going sorry what and not being like well fuck this man yeah that sounds like a cooperative event to me somehow unless they were somehow another locked up and they brought him out one by one that's an awfully big cage of günther yeah it isn't yeah eighty thousand that's quite an arena yeah yeah they could have to build an extra one of those just to hold them yeah that's like a giant football arena if it'll it's that big yeah it's that big and and that what struck me as just because I play music as I thought okay that means these acoustics are so perfect like who do you discover that are you in a canyon and while this sounds can you hear me over there and and then you sort of triangulate and start doing the geometry for how that works and like oh quick someone invents yeah but geometry first though cuz I don't know it's I mean how does that you know how manifest itself that understanding yeah how many thousands of years did it take before they figured out how to construct something yeah we're someone on their deathbed is like wait one last thing I kind of thought acoustic sound kind of bounces off shit you've got to be shaped like this yeah but the Pythagorean theorem I you know I've never been to any of the Aztec temples but I went to Chichen itzá it's awesome the Mayan temples and it just there that whenever you ran out of place like that that's just magical that's so fucking old and so amazingly constructed you just think what the fuck was it like to live back there like do we have terrible idea of what they were like of course yeah we don't know well but it sort of dawned on me at some point that was like oh you mean the people that wrote our history was wrote it as from the perspective of by the way we're way better way better but okay here's the story of these other people Yeah right like by some kind of dickhead winner right right right dickhead winner with guns yeah like before we get started I'm better than the person I'm gonna tell you about yeah we can't even though we can't do what they did because what is the emotion when you when you're in that space I'm trying I'm trying to think of the right word to describe how I felt there right and I guess oh right yeah it's it really is it is ah but also there's a there's almost yeah reverence and there's almost like some strange gratitude yeah like were you like thank you for I'm so thankful to be part of this even just by living in a time just to appreciate this yeah yeah it there feels it soaks it feels like knowledge expanding that I I don't have so I just feel like oh if I could have a piece of that if I could understand a piece of that but just standing there is sort of understanding it right we have such an egotistical perspective when it comes to our personal civilization that we that like this with the internet and with cars and with planes and all that this is the best way there's a word for it I can't what art can you try to find such a thing please what is the word I I know there's a word for the word definition is to believe that the era you were in is the finest of them all yeah up to this point I think yeah I've heard that word I know where you're saying that is it's some kind of dickhead syndrome at exactly certainly was created by a man there's some guy was like good yeah yeah I don't think it was a girl if it was he was like one of them all right Phil man don't you wish that there was like a supportive mother was like yes sure honey you are the best - this is the best yeah number was Li don't worry about him it's you don't worry about him guys he's fine you are the best yeah it's like the same thing with the Native Americans and the settlers that the settlers were imposing their lifestyle but the people that experienced the Native American lifestyle they wanted to stay living like that for sure well III think because it omitted some of the so many of the things that the European culture was bringing yes and and and I you can it seems less like a distinct possibility that the European perspective like when Pizarro and all that you know was a 12 of them conquistadors killed like a thousand natives in and a-come matter of hours when you know when they land mm-hmm they're looking for gold everywhere I'm right at first they have this this belief that something big will come across the water and be their God and here comes a ship with a bunch of dirty assholes that literally factually dirty assholes have written across a boat and and you know I think about that perspective where they obviously were like these people are nice but I've had enough of this well they should have invented ships we're better so let's kill everyone here yeah well that's what I mean Cortez yeah Cortez that's what it is yeah yeah they didn't know what was going on because I don't think the previous to that time they'd ever seen anyone on a horse before no and and they come across you imagine a big boat and then a few horses where they're like what the fuck is yeah Gary come over and look at this it's just it's impossible to fathom a man riding a beast they're probably in the fucking with like rusty armor from being on a fucking boat for months yeah like looking like shit being desperately like turns like that I imagine their relief when they come up on these horses with this armor and all this stuff and they're like they're cool this is gonna be easy you know I mean at first they they must have thought maybe we could do this with some goodwill but quickly it's like you guys are too primitive we're just gonna take over here I doubt they even thought they were gonna do it with goodwill I don't think there was any goodwill back then I think people were just murdering you think that there's perhaps that more people took more lives in a way like for per capita or something I think it was a more brutal way of taking lives sure people take more lives today in war but I think back then it was just it was hands-on right but it seems like more percentage of the people that are alive had an opportunity or the possibility to kill someone yeah today yeah - so it's like if you if you are with 150 people all of which I've killed at least three people right that's an interesting group and then you land on a boat and you've been there for months you're like maybe maybe you are like we got to kill somebody and rape something and take something as quick as well you know I've no idea what the fuck they're saying because you can't speak to the language so it's easy to just and they're being nice so you're like they're gonna fuck these people up in five four three big silent enough it's bizarre well that's the history of mankind is men showing up in boats and killing everybody that they met and then kind of doing their own version of a selfie on the dead but yeah right getting the sides yeah yeah yeah have draw me I would imagine what it would be like if you could be a fly on the wall when Montezuma met Cortez just to be there and see what that was like when these people who had never encountered Spaniards before and these guys show up in these boats with two absolutely different beliefs and perspectives of what's about to go down which craziest that is why Mexico speaks Spanish because people don't get that in their head like Oh max it's why all of South America except for Brazil Brazil is Portuguese yeah maybe we don't get it in our head like Mexico speaks Spanish why are they sent ass horses mean yeah Spain's way the fuck over there how how is will they speak Spanish yeah like it's it makes no fucking sense but then you realize like oh my god they were conquered by the Spaniards whoa yes in a long long time about in time ago long fuck because I I because of having a my music teacher as a as a young boy drill the song in 1492 from Spain through wind and storm and the Nina the Pinta the scent that 1492 1492 which is which by my watch is a long time ago it is it is but it's not you know like I had a joke my act about the United States being founded in 1776 people live to be a hundred that's three people ago that's real I know it sounds fucked up when you hear a funny yeah when you hear it it sounds like you see right well it's not right well what's funny that is totally true yeah it is right I mean that's yeah yeah that's right yeah the thing is anything that happens before you were born seems like a million years ago of course I know but also 1776 seems like yesterday to me I've listened alive and I'm ready to admit that but I get that seems like oh that is just very fucking super recent yeah yeah I mean do you think it's possible that a new nation gets started is it too late because like the reason why the United States got started cuz everybody hated how suppressive European civilization was so like wait wait you see how we do it yeah we're gonna fix this this isn't over here yeah in some ways we have right it's better in some ways than in some ways in some ways we did more freedom this is some ways in some way we didn't yeah yeah it's like what humans do we no one ever nails anything it's just everything's messy it's always complicated especially more people yeah because anyone that's been to a family family reunion is like has said fuckin Gary really yeah you know then also like did the different environments that people live in sort of dictate their personnel like you're a desert guy right yeah you're from the desert yeah what is that scorpion I'm I'm one of the few people I know that's been bit by one have you really yeah and as I I was going up to Joshua Tree to this studio that's really just a house and was that the one that you guys showed in the thing you did with Bourdain yeah yeah uh-huh Rancho de la Luna yeah and um but it's magic is what's missing and I mean everywhere I mean but and all that's left is like what if you just when the tide receded it was just the idiosyncratic and the previously thrown away like all in reborn and you know it's just got that sort of feeling to it right and so I was driving up there and I know I'm a desert boy I know that you're not supposed to at night times when everything comes out right because in the day everyone is like oh really I mean everything that walks or crawls is like and so at night everyone everything that walks or crawls goes right let's go right and so you wear shoes if you do not wear shoes you're it's you you have made a mistake for sure and as soon as we pull up to the Rancho in the dirt parking lot I open up I open up the door and I'm on the passenger side and I step out and I'm going to reach for a 12-pack of beer and something hit me on the foot and I was like and I lift my foot and there's this black or dark brownish like a rootbeer Ebron scorpion hanging from my foot going hey hey hey hey hey and I was like I I think it was like like a really butch girl who's been terrified for the first time like Wyatt and I slapped it oh and I slap it off my foot because that's my knee-jerk reaction and I as I did that that's when I screamed and jumped like you know like a mouse or something right in the car and in the door light of this in the door light this scorpion hit the ground like shuffled itself turned and came right at me Wow and was sort of like fuck you wait you I it's scared it's back at you you imagine being that little wanting to fuck up something as big as you who you'd have to right you'd have it wouldn't be there would be no bravado at all would be like yeah it would be it would be a true believer right that in that moment I'm like fuck this thing and it is a hundred percent sure it's gonna fuck me up and it was right because what am I gonna do like I'm gonna hit the stinger with my hands writhes know what was the pain light well I that time my understanding of scorpions was in our desert Mojave there's two types and one which is like two you know 24 hours of central nervous system shutdown so they can't even give you anything for the pain because the thing that's that regulates that gets like turn turned off or and so you're just like from 24 hours you're in pain that's that was my knowledge at that time and the other one is akin to a bee sting so when did you get well I had to like track back this was before the internet and so I go inside and the remedy at that time as Fred Drake who rest in peace told me was to drink Jack Daniels and put your foot in a bucket a hot like burning hot water which is is a little bit like having a horse on each leg and they take off a different direction because they get the hottest water you can take and continue the pain like it's that it's such a wives tale it's almost like the divorcees tale or something like so I did that and waited because I didn't know which one it was turns out that the 24 hours one is lives in another desert in Moore Otto's to Arizona and that it's not quite as as I've described I'm just telling you what I thought oh right right and and it was much like a bee sting but by the time I realized that and it swallow up it swell up immediate and looked like it was gonna keep going because it got to this golf ball so fast mm-hmm that it was like when will this stop right right but it was like a bee sting but by the time I've discovered that I was so drunk that bee stings me sting you know so he's just sitting there with your foot in a bucket of hot water gills scalding holding liquor like it was like it said the hotter it is the better and I was like ah don't dump it imagine that fucking real injury was you got third-degree burns and your foot water there was nothing wrong with it how mad would you be my friend said you see the real remedy is you grab a shark and you and you totally forget about body mine was in South America and he got bit by a bullet ant he got hit by a bullet down on his heel and he said it was he said the pain was so bad but it was so bewildering that after the pain was over he couldn't figure out which foot got bit weight because your brains going like static he said you're it's so confusing the pain so confusing it's four hours do you think that because anytime I've seen that online where it's like you know you know I'm dingo piles and I'm at a bullet and you're like Jesus man you don't hang out with this person know what to say love ya like a handful they pull that yeah it's like a ritual that young men have to do to reach the bride coming oh that's right yeah that's like jumping off on how Bungie was invented with no Bunge oh no boying no just no funk to be a man you jump up this thing and it's like I'm starting to identify as a yeah I I wonder what the bullet ant thinks of all this if it's like mom I can never make any friends what the fuck I think they're just violence in insect form don't you see don't you think that that's if there ever was an alien that would be it would be easy to assume this little bullet ant in space that's just like it yeah and then pushes so hard that there's two of them will really be fucked up as bugs were big and intelligent if bugs behaved the way settlers behaved when they encountered the Native Americans I I must say I'm happy to hear you say that something I say to my kids and I've said to myself for many many many years is what I'm having a rough morning I say thank God praying mantis aren't five feet fuck yeah dude because getting to your car would be a nightmare yeah and and you'd never they just be like you know that yeah I was just watching a video of a praying man it's fucking up a mouse they're so powerful man it's crazy it's just to like start the morning it was just sitting just sitting there as a mouse got close to grab the hold of all is not is that a normal way to start the morning is neat yeah fortunately yeah there was one with a squirrel - it was the praying mantis was eating a squirrel it's like holding on to this little squirrels head and slowly pulling it apart oh there's another one with a lizard the lizard one was pretty fucked look at this Mouse you think well there's no way look that melon it's just like oh well just going over here just gonna look over here bro they're so ruthless these goddamn things and they're so fucking Stu septa least wrong for their size you look at how big they are I mean look at that dude if that was five feet tall we'd be fucked yeah I wouldn't I honestly I would stay home and a lot more I would be armed to the dick I said just fucking everywhere I go multiple guns Kevlar suits here he goes bitch and the way they get some is so fucking fast well it is a kind of a cool thing that we don't have to like die watching something to eat us it's crazy though that there's no it's not a contest it's look at that in the ear though that's by diem what our first what I'd like to move is that that's not that's uncalled for it's rude yeah you know see diem ear first if I'm hit by something that's gonna eat me I'm like don't start the fucking here man they don't you will fuck well it really that is what you gotta hear the mouse did you make it any louder fuck and then you just feel the sound at that point but yeah like boulders underwater looks like pink it's just crazy when you look at how big the mouse is and how small the insect is like for mass of body weight that it's not even a contest that the praying mantis just gets it a hundred percent like it's not like maybe the mouse can get away like no it's over bit it's a bit like that Orca eats the great whites liver thing right right we're for for for like a thousand nautical miles in every direction every single tagged white shark as soon as that happens the radius is like a thousand nautical miles every great white shark was like so anyways this time I'm out of here and then takes off really yeah so they felt it like they knew yeah something about the smell of their own data of that or whatever that yeah you know what is it the OP you live a little orange any that that's sixth sense they have oh right some something about that frequency for them is sort of like call you back and they just bail well that's like the bully getting bullied right like they're the meanest motherfuckers in the ocean except for the orcas right I think at this point in my life I'm like they don't have hands so they're like sorry I gotta try it what's going on here no hands gonna use this sorry because when you when you have no predators most of your time like that what's up Junior yet did we mention this before they only go after the liver oh yeah creepy well they do for some years some father what fava beans with it so that's cool probably very nutritious but they are you kidding or cuz of the booty do that with your mouth I think orcas are probably the biggest dick of all because they're just like should go fuck with that guy and grab liver or what do you want to do well they fuck up dolphins - we know dolphins are kind of cute Walmer big dolphins well the the permanent smile right that's I don't sir cute they're just thinking hey cuz it could be like fuck you well even dolphin have dolphins commit infanticide they kill babies they do it on purpose yeah well they killed their own two kinds babies to try to force the female in the estrus and so as a consequence what email Bo writes to get them back utility because female dolphins when they breed apparently once they have a baby they they have to raise that baby for like six years so they won't have sex for like six years so what male dolphins do is they will kill the baby so the force to female to breed again so what females do is they become hoes so they fuck everybody and anybody they can so that if a dolphin runs in door to go maybe that's my kid alright says yeah so they're not sure if it's their kid they don't even obviously there's no 23 plausible deniability yeah so they know that they fucked are the seven great oceans in me or something well they're really intelligent right I mean they have a sorrel cortex is 40% larger than human beings what when when there was that one shot and maybe it's black fish or something like that uh where they put a mirror up and the dolphins are like going looking at them there's some where the like the minute uh that was an amazing moment to watch like a dolphin go oh yeah like with a shower with a hairbrush singing in the mirror sort of well they can it's like the way we looked at other cultures we we think we're better but when we look at orcas and dolphins just because they can't affect their environment the way we can like they can't build houses and you know and create things yeah we assume they're not as intelligent well create things that we we would determine to have any value right right physical objects that's it but but the way they have culture and communication and knowledge ins yeah that to have the sonar and all that stuff they're they're operating with tools that were like what yeah we don't even understand what you having oh you mean Bing I got that over here Bing it's like they're using sonar finding objects in the water and also as a musician at one point I went through this pirate phase of reading where you just read about because all the logs are so accurate they had to be to survive the Pirates logs yeah like well um the historical version of why did someone why does someone turn into a privateer you know charged by the king of Spain to take anything English into the English it's a pirate and that like how does that and it was from war slowing down and all these sailors having like what do we do oh you know and the logs are so accurate and and in a very fact like this is what happened it's marked in the log that is just great accurate history of the Caribbean well there's one of the ways we know about what happened with Columbus right one of the one of the more fucked up things about Columbus is I believe it was a missionaries that traveled with him that ratted him out about how ruthless they were yeah they were cutting people's arms off they get him didn't give him enough gold and - and babies has them but then you wouldn't be able to get any more gold from that person certainly just everybody else but if you didn't bring enough as a practical thing like go get me more gold you know cut its arm up now I can't even bring more anyways I think the idea was nobody wants their arm cut off so there's plenty of them yeah look just kill this one guy and the people that do want to only have one arm they probably have already done that yeah propose oh fuck that oh the reason for the the logs is the they would talk about how whales and dolphins you could hear them singing because there's no engines on the ocean so it's just just the silence of the planet right right it's just they're just using sales yeah and and and sometimes there isn't any wind and this night where everything comes out to do its thing and you'd hear this communication this vast whale song that you could hear around the world Wow because the whales are so big and that there's this communication and that there and how extrapolating that there's a communication breakdown now because of the noise pollution of it all oh sure noise pollution and regular pollution right right yeah the constant drone of success you know I mean that's that's where the real horrific death has occurred right in the ocean imagine what the ocean was like in terms of like teeming with life in 1492 yeah I mean yeah because they talk about that trash thing that really was a it was nutrients before that's why they animals came there you know you know but they you know there's a trash pile in the size of Texas yeah yeah but it all gathers there because of the currents mm-hmm and previously it wasn't an island of plastic but in fact an island of nutrients that brought everything in and so it was like Hometown Buffet for fish things and right right now they're showing up and they're like right you know what I mean yeah how's the six-pack ring look on me yeah bummer it's a fucking bummer yeah yeah what's up Joe did you see what you know Colin Oh Brady who was on the podcast a few moments ago now yeah he's got a row across Antarctica Drake's passage I guess is what it's called in this little teeny rowboat oh Jesus that's crazy couple other guys he's gonna do it with but they're gonna he walked across Antarctica yeah story how do they really I can't imagine it not being fraught at every other's footstep I bet you do that though for like however long it takes him a summer rowing you come out ripped that you can develop serious back muscles yeah yeah you know that is a really positive way to look at it that's a great work so that you watch to do stage you want bigger back when you back to the beautiful crew bus 24 hours a day rotating around the clock with little to no sleep what yeah there's live streaming this whole thing with just swells can tower up to 50 feet high what the fuck imagine it's so great it's I'm so fuckin crazy whoa imagine its to like 27 in the morning yeah and everyone's asleep and you're in charge of rowing over 50 foot swells and how much can you sleep if everybody has to work 24 hours a day what do you get like an hour sleep a day well you get a tons of fake sleep there's the because it's tired of rowing you're in the zone look at this fucking boat - it's a shitty little boat can you imagine being the cameraman that's the most boring thing ever on that did you see that cameraman on the back oh that's ridiculous he's got a row too though there's no one who's just a cameraman six athletes it says one boat no chance no motor they're fucked yeah yeah no sale oh god why do people have to do things like this no turning back I love talking to them when they come back but why do they have to do that it just seems so ridiculous it look the impossible bro following I wonder how you sell that idea to like the other rower many girls - bunch of crazy assholes you get together I was thinking about running a thousand miles well hey before you do that I got a project yeah it doesn't start with like hear me out just hear me out let me finish the the pitch and then like do you have to try to assess that like that yeah you just gently try to I think those kind of plateaus yeah certainly they're there near the or store or whatever the fuck there are some people out there that just can't push themselves hard enough you know no matter what happens they're like like my friend David Goggins he ran this Moab 240 it's a 40 mile race through the DES he developed pulmonary edema which I guess you get at high altitudes when you're exerting yourself yeah that Everest like crazy shit right so he goes to the hospital they treat him he gets back and finishes the race so he ran another 80 miles after he ran a hundred and eighty plus with fucking pulmonary edema like what what does that mean that when you get done that you're like good whoo okay no he didn't give mean it's not really there's no end with that car that that it's that there's no destination at all there's no finish line yeah yeah yeah it's just like break to take a leak I suppose the thing is they know they all know there's other people like them out there so the same race yeah not even just that it's just that they're all connected but from the internet you know they're all connected through these circles that they travel in they're connected through just but they follow other people like them on TV but do you think that a drive like that is more an internal one or do you think that the competition I'm seeing what someone else did is as what kind of factor do you think that I think that they're both play a factor it's it's other people that are pushing on they make you realize that it's possible and then it's other it's you you all men you sort of insane internal furnace yeah well they're I believe when they did some brain testing on that climber fella that did the Alex Honnold yeah yeah yeah that he just didn't trip out as a it took a lot more to freak him out oh yeah I'm sure that the his brainwaves were like yeah no I'm cool like when you're hanging by one toenail upside down do you even talk about him makes me nervous i I've had him on twice shots yeah oh my god III sit in someone else's pants a great on you let me try them on and then like here you go dude sometimes it's not even down sometimes it's an angle back yeah like yeah like 15 degrees back the wrong direction like what I do just watch that and get vertigo where your balls are sort of like I look at this yes I grow dad that's way more than 15 degrees how many degrees is that if you had to guess 45 that's like 45 degrees right yeah so does definitely Enys 45 degrees fucking thousand feet up in the sky but do you have to add my palms are sweaty yeah you sweat like crazy do you have yeah tell us yours or mine that's crazy like instantaneous palm sweat we need to drink Purell now the same bucket of water use of this court but you know right and Ryder motorcycle like I try to stay focused and very now right in the moment yeah because it's a requirement like when you're sort of like did I leave the iron on that's whenever I've gotten in like a little fender bender or right well of course you know and but in that there is no you do you have to stay so in it that there is no out or I think so and you let yourself drift and it like almost like a meditative state and just be like hands I don't think you can I think if you drift you're fucked I mean I think first of all so how do you stop things well then how do you stop things like you know guess who's hungry hands up oh shit you know I mean I think he does it so often than he knows how to get into that state but you know there's also like look at that little thing go that back I just believe look at that little thing he's holding on with his left hand what's this a that doesn't chip loose what's this a what's this thing I mean some of these rocks they're talking about manifesting that you do it talk about saying guess you know it's already done you'd have to say it's already done I don't know why I think you just got a go left foot right foot right hand left hand and then you also have done it many times with ropes but also on when you're on the ground you're like want to hang out and he's like no bro that looks like 60 that's insane he's like basically hanging upside down climbing was so far above the fucking trees on a burglary on purpose like like it's Tuesday there you know what I mean most people you and me included would be dead we wouldn't be able to do what he's doing uh I'd be dead of a heart attack on the path from realizing I was gonna try he's such a mellow guy - that's what's really interesting yeah like look at that smile that's that's it's like he also just started recently getting injured right I saw that thing yeah at the movie I tell you what though I will read or watch anything about Everest or climbing or I don't know that there's something because I'm always like well I'm gonna go for that metaphorically that you know metaphorically yeah like I'm gonna take that metaphor that energy and put it into the guitar and put it into something else like yeah I don't know pass those chips over here like I the way I eat yeah I eat the way those climbers risk their lives see that sundae over there I'm gonna climb that thing it's just knowing that someone like that is out there though it changes what our our expectations are like what we think of as the boundaries of human performance and what someone's capable of doing well it's certain it's certainly there's a weird epiphany when you're watching someone do that yeah cuz you're sort of like I'm doing the exact opposite of this person that I'm watching yeah you're just sitting yet you're like not risking anything yeah you're just sort of like thank you for doing this for my pleasure I'd say there's a there's a moment of disconnect for me when I what I'm like I'm going on a hike I can't finish this movie anymore you know I'm not supposed to finish this movie well it's it's interesting because what he's doing is essentially a spectator sport but there's no audience until after it's done right so it so it ultimately for the for the climb must be singularly about you I mean it must be the I don't know how you how you include someone else during that no thing I think it's just all about the moment I think he's just like I said I think he's thinking left foot right foot right hand left hand and he just you just keep going and you know the people then that would be akin to you know from the greatest meditative minds that's I've ever existed yeah because it's one thing to meditate in position and and kind of go deeply within and keep going into the depths which are vast right but but it's different if you said now you get up and climb this thing please yeah there there would be a certain amount of no no I'm still messing fuckin right where you might be like no I'm doing this this so I don't have to do that right to maintain that mindset through action that's a different kind of meditation because the consequences are so grave like if you're just sitting there meditating and your brain drifts nothing happens but if you're up there and you're achieving that state and then your brain drifts and you're like oh Jesus what the fuck am i doing oh my god I've been reading about this I've been watching and reading this woman Esther Hicks oh yeah okay this had lady that channels yeah but yeah but putting that aside to not um precondition anyone her her discussions on manifestation and her explanation of that that the physical body that you have thoughts and thoughts are bigger than your body is simply a bag that holds your protects your thoughts so they can occur yeah and that when you think something you you begin to bring it into idea which is on the process to bring it into the world yeah and so when you say I can't you certainly cannot right and and that it's okay when coming from a position of I can and it's already happened and I'm just meeting up with what's already occurred yeah that there's something beautiful there especially when it's not really being wrapped in a selfish but manifesting happiness and and things you love and that that attracts other that's what's contagious you know and so I wonder when I see a photo like that about the connection out and her point being is that she's like all day long you're thinking thoughts and acting on them because the that mind and body are one they're executing the same process together you know dependently and like that is the embodiment of thought and body yeah action together and being ultimately in that vortex of being aware that Esther Hicks lady is very strange I'm very torn on that because I listened to the actual words and the things that she says when she's channeling that what is it like Abraham is he like a dead guy or an alien what is he I forget what he is I see I distant channels an alien right but I think there's multiple people but see the thing is is I've kind of like was listening stumbled on that while I was driving mm-hmm and and investigating or reconnecting with the law like the law of attraction yeah and and how do like it's like and when you get your motorcycle lesson they tell you to look through the turn because you you tend to go where you're looking mm-hmm you know not a lot of people are walking backwards and talking to you as they go forwards right and and so that it sort of dawned on me the connection between just looking for something you love and not bonding or focusing on all the shit you don't like as a as a manner of walking towards what what you desire you know and and this kind of reawakening with that concept is very it's just mere woo you know three four weeks old for me really um well returning to that idea because I had this idea this this concept before of like someone's got to make it why shouldn't it be why it's why couldn't it be you mm-hmm let's let's let's let's go for it and really go for it the only way to make it it's really honestly go let's say you're talking about with your band before you guys made it no I'm talking about a way of acting regarding anything okay I love music and and music has always been my way of of being the utmost honest I can be and I think because of that it's that's what's helped gravitate people that have stayed so long in that however also I've realized that I put so much of who I really am in total into the music that there are times that I should have done that in and relationships with friends or people it's like and family and and that it's really it's important to do that in life too mmm you know to be engaged yeah and also show your real self that kind of where the vulnerability of all that is really powerful instead of weakness it's the opposite of weakness you know and and so I think I think pursuing music that way is great but not if it's keeping you from doing that in life and so it's not just that I would think that way so my band would do well it's that I would think that way so that I could I could do well and I could be well you know right and uh and so that that's why I started listening to her not seeing any of the opening gambit of of her transforming into Abraham Abraham and not caring and not understanding what that means just going like I've just listened to what you're saying while I'm driving right and hearing that and the way she speaks regarding those things is really fascinating I choose to detach myself from judgment yeah because yeah because I know one thing nothing well it's it's it's weird because she's saying very wise things right and but it would be ashamed to get just because I don't that's not the rapper I would pick that I don't like the candy inside right yeah the channeling part of it well yeah so it's not a oh you mean it's not exactly how I would do it well fuck this then well it's not just that it's like you're listening to wisdom but are you listening to wisdom from someone who's made up a fairy tale that's where it gets confusing it's well she's channeling well but I you channeling was she doing I also think that to be able to learn something this this again this awakening and me is so new like it it's in all honesty it's it's like a month and a half old but it feels really good what happened so uh it's just that um you know I think that engagement in life you know and also you know feeling a bit lost and and not knowing how to ask for how to ask for help sometimes you know what I mean and and and not really knowing something exists at all you have feelings that's a little too vague but I point being that like all of a sudden engaging in something engaging in something that you're that you really love not focusing on the negative part of it mm-hm but really chasing after that thing which makes you feel good so you've changed your perspective yeah the way you focus on it absolutely and in fact and in fact that I've realized like what sort of you know it's fine it's fine to be afraid of shit you know yeah it's fine it's not fine to go like nope that's not not that's not over there right right to deny it yeah how can you get stronger unless you've turned them really really look into it you know right you don't want to be paralyzed by fear but there's nothing wrong with being aware that something scares you yeah yeah yeah I mean I really nine times out of ten you didn't need to be afraid of it and that one time you do you know it's true and you know what it is right and and that seems like a successful and in dealing with that too you get the chance to say I I can do this is how ladies still alive as Esther hood still alive I have no idea me maybe get her in go wonky III think I think it would be interesting because you'd have to separate the things that don't fit right right but once a husband has to be there with everything to Jerry he died as I listened see without having no preconceived notion and just hearing this as I Drive that when the next YouTube's things started play and I was like who is this who's Abraham there's no there was no context for me Rob just listen to the words right and I was like wow this fucking great yeah you know this is great and and kept listening I was driving to the desert and doing this other stuff for him and you know what's interesting about it it's remarkably consistent alright it she doesn't say anything that's really foolish and she never changes her tune right about look um and and I started to dig that she was saying we because until I understood that she was like channeling something I thought it was just a really beautiful way of saying we what we want to tell you is like as if you were already there and and really what she was talking about is already being there anyways like you will have an idea you will form a habit of one type or another which one would you like it to be mmm and and um and no this if all you can focus is on what sucks but is yet to be just wait a sec it's coming and and what where conversely if you were like I can worry about that because I like as much time without it as possible let's focus on something I do like until shit gets here yeah that you naturally look through the turn and as long as you're not trying to turn into a wall or a cavalcade of shit right but if you're trying to turn into something you love you actually will turn into something you love in that case you should probably embrace challenges right you should probably welcome them because when they happen they will test you and then you can figure out whether or not this philosophy is actually well I mean I have been I have been I have been testing because you know I always like dealt with difficulty by shielding it putting it into the music or putting it into some dark closet somewhere you know what I mean right cuz that's just you're taught to do that right yeah like natural teeth and and grin and bear ignore it ignore it yeah like that's what the rug is for sweeping stuff under where you like oh really and but that feels like building a dam or something hmm - when really you're supposed to let that river of fear or whatever go with it go downstream with it stop fighting it yeah cuz you dam all that shit up put it in the corner bury it behind and really one day it just like gives you a massive bath of you're fucked that damn bird hole law of attraction thing is very strange to me because I feel like everybody's trying to describe something that there's some element of truth to but that it's really complicated and it's not as simple as think it and manifest it there's a lot of discipline involved in that there's a lot of hard work and concentration and thought and doubts and hopes and dreams and there's a lot of other things and then also fortune well it's a lot of people I feel like when those when it never drink I would never use that for fortune for me the fortune would be like that your relationships and emotional connections get deeper yeah I don't mean fortune I mean being fortunate yeah I mean being lucky like we're we're lucky we're here well we're blessed we're here but it's not really lucky and I think that's one of the main things right there is understanding the difference in thought because ultimately what you're saying what one is that hard work that you're talking about and all those things are sort of getting out of your own way and unlearning how to say how to be so doubtful about it all and just say I'll take I'll take something I like and I'll just think about that for a bit mmm and and let that be the first step and then go what do I keep going down that river downstream of that idea getting closer and closer to something you really love because saying you know saying I don't like this water bottle sucks but but saying but at least I don't have to drink it is one step away from that and if you just keep taking those steps away and going down that river that's the right direction to be going because focusing on this it's like how's that gonna help you god it's got this blue binding in this well it's certainly not gonna help you to to think about how fortunate you are yeah is it I mean I guess it kinda is it's blocking you well it's blocking you from feeling fortunate but saying at least I don't have to drink them every day is turning the right direction and heading towards how fortunate you are mm-hmm and if you keep taking those little direct that those steps then soon you get to like I feel fortunate to be here right I feel fortunate I don't have to think about this bottle of water all the time this coyness genuine gratitude also it clears your mind if you do have if you're thinking about positive things and working towards those things it clears your mind of a lot of the just the natural traps that we set for each other yeah dumb nuts baggage just those hurdles we make are tailor-made because they're made by you for you right right how can they not work yeah they highlight your actual real insecurities and fears that you know you have that absolutely and you go sure to trap someone cuz look loud and then you're in it yeah cuz you made it for you it's like yet meets trap me and and I think what I like about what I heard her saying is that because it came from no context whatsoever and I just heard the words it said can you get out of your own way yeah that's what I'm would like you to think about first what is that there's an ancient tale a tale of two wolves meaning how to live your life that like yeah I know one wolf is filled with fear and how does that go my mother just gave just gave it to my kids really their house it go it's paraphrasing you know she could bought this frame thing like you know um there are two wolves and one is anger and one is like love and mm-hmm and and they both exist but ultimately it's like which one you're gonna feed yeah that it's it's really the I I think I'm correct in saying there's something are you paraphrasing but it's something like that's the one the one that survives and succeeds is the one you feel although I think the younger you know Native American says well how do i how do I know which one how do I not let one take over and he's like well which one are you gonna feed ultimately right you know you know well the more you concentrate on positive things and the less you concentrate on negative thing for sure you're freeing your mind up and you're you you gain the momentum of positive thought and the momentum of of living your life with positive thought it becomes easier to do right and the rewards to do I think but I think it's also necessary to say I'm not talking about walking around and collapse you like gonna haha it's just like smile smile yeah you know what I mean nice and in action you're talking about this you're not talking about this like an some sort of a random well it starts with a thought and it works into an idea and then manifests itself into like a smile or just it's nice to do something nice and also understand that I'm not talking about walking around like hi-yah you know like I'm not talking about being some goofed it's dumb nuts motherfucker that's what I'm saying is uh do something do something nice and start that way you know and leave it at that and I think there's something to when you're when your thoughts are filled with this there's just frankly less room for me to think about this water which I dislike right just there's just frankly is less real estate right you can you real estate I'm positive things yeah and and because the contagion of enjoying it of because things that are positive are essentially what things I like yeah I'm enjoying being here so this water doesn't really I don't have real estate for that right I've got too much enjoyment and to be here you know Anna and that'll do now this Esther Hicks thing how did you get into this completely by accident or not meaning meaning you know I that just sometimes things just slam down on the table and say you've got to be engaged this at the moment to do do it or not right and nothing incites a change like that that's it's sort of a gift actually it's saying it's struggled now but if you struggle through this it's gonna get better you know and and I love I and I'm actually really thankful and appreciative of that sort of moment I don't mind the risk of all that that's what it's all about how did you stumble upon it though I just was like looking for like looking for through the law of attraction and and and finding a way to change my thoughts to some to things I loved and I listened to a couple I was driving and had just clicked onto her as it Auto played and there was and as I said without any sort of judgment and I'm the last person that's kind of a joiner or would be accused of being hippie dippie or whatever like kind of like someone who is scared would say you know did he so it just made sense to me almost the calculus of it all it's a complex problem but get out of your own way keep it simple listen but she goes further than that right she actually talks about your your thoughts manifesting reality and she talks about how what you're doing with your thoughts and the way you think in the way you sort of interface with reality is you're creating reality with your mind right right and and I'm choosing how I want to take that and then have that means something to me so you're finding an application for that in your life and also I'm within the within the spectrum of all the things she's talking about I simply am looking for ways to in my immediate life with the people that are close to me how to be more engaged and how to be more engaging myself because I as I said I've had a lot of troubled times in the last few years because of just feeling lost and not knowing how to deal with that and you always put that in your music but maybe I should be putting it into more than just that - mm-hm it doesn't negate wanting to your music to be truth right that's what it's for but also it should be inspiring to do point that in other directions - are you bringing this to the band like you've you hey guys this channel a lady no no no because I mean I'm surprised I'm sort of revealing it here it's a because I'm not a disciple of anything yeah but listen I don't think he's anything wrong with it honestly because well I mean I've listened to it - buddy mine was really into it and he turned me on to it and I listened to and I said okay there's a lot of wacky shit going on you there's like I think she's channeling a thousand year old person something like that yeah Gary but whatever Abraham write isn't that like I think she's supposedly channeling some ancient illusion yeah but forget all that the words she's saying resonate and they're also sort of like consistent across this yeah and as I said before I'm I'm mining in a specific vein of like okay the people I care about most how do we how do we all grow right out each other and and how do we do that right because that is the goal the goal isn't to to be alone and it's also but whether it's wacky or not look at there's a lot of wacky shit and religion but I always say a lot of people find some great meaning in it you can this I don't know how much the world is weird and complicated yeah absolutely you can get real wisdom from shit that sounds like nonsense well if you reserve the right to be surprised by life yeah if you really if you to have an open mind you certainly have to unlock the door and open that fucker that's a great way of looking at it reserve the right to be surprised by life that that is my goal in general and life and also now it's my it's my mission because it's a bit like when I used to like mess around with you know illegals like the legal sub things that like that you know yeah oh I suppose those are in there too yeah what do you mean though I meant I meant that wrapped in other stuff so I didn't have to just say it say that oh oh but then I think I just gave that away okay no those things those things are sort of like I tried all that Perl too long mm-hmm and that didn't really go anywhere so what else is there what else is going on right so you tried drugs and then you're like what there's got to be something else that's gonna fill this void or give me some peace or yeah or like hum I certainly can't stand here you're either growing or dying right since I'm less interested in dying I'm like what else what else we got I mean I think for a while was you know my next thing is is well it doesn't matter that I I think what's important is when you said are you bringing this to the guys in the band I was just about to say yes until you said are you telling her about this lady because to me the lessons that you learn yeah I'm like oh my god because I think I've always looked at music this way where it's like locks there have these concentric circles and that's at one point they all line up and you can see through the door to the other side mmm and once you've seen it you can't unsee that if I if I have a song and we have two and you those concentric circles line up it almost feels painful or criminal not to go to the other side when you know it gets so much better there right and and I feel like but I've been kind of learning is I also should apply the same understanding to the people I care about you know like if there's a way for us to have something more meaningful that's all that being meaningful is like money is green paper you know these are like it's fun to have collect things but who cares it's that it's the relationships you have and you know when you have kids and stuff it's like having enjoying that shit even when it's rough that's that's the thing to kick good hat mm-hmm you know what I mean you'll have plenty of time to dial alone as you worry you know later yeah you know time and uh so I feel like that's what I'm kind of getting from that from what she's saying mm-hmm and so it's that works just fine yeah well if it works if it works use it right it's not it's not exclusively that either you know it's just like it's a tool yeah it's one of the tools that I would use in every situation is situational and so I I feel like what's great is to have a bunch of tools and not pretend to know I always wanted I mean I try to ask this to as many musicians as possible but how do you guys create music do you do write stuff out and then come to the band to some of the guys bring their own ideas for for a beat or for a concept or well you know I like the randomness of it all and and again I love collaboration I've never done anything just me all by myself that doesn't there are times when I make you make a request of people who play with real like I hear all of this can we just try that first because and I like to do that when someone says that in return if they if they're like sometimes you hear everything all at once and that's how that is a gift and you kind of don't want to mess with that you want to at least start from that point because if someone does have an idea at least they're starting from understanding where this how this is and their other idea if they have one is rooted in this instead of being kind of arbitrary you know does that make sense mm-hmm and then so but it's great to hear that and also be asked to kind of be a soldier sometimes sure I'll play because I'd love to hear that all these puzzle pieces together right right but I also respect their their idea their vision whatever it is you're just trying to help them realize it yeah sometimes sometimes it's like that and sometimes I'm requesting that and there's a way to communicate that that sounds exciting yeah and you should because it's a shame to be misunderstood in that moment when really what you're saying is oh my god I have this idea can we try it just like this for a start and once you're emerged in this understanding your ideas to better it will be based in understanding this you guys are very unique and that you don't sound like anybody else but that's the point it is the point that that in fact in fact I always look at that like well that's the minimum obligation right as to none it's to not you know not sound like other folks yeah the men without hats - what's the point you already have everyone do I love that song yeah it's great because it's sort of a challenge yeah you can leave your friends behind yeah you're like what the fuck what why would it if they don't dance they're no friends yeah like sort of like drawing a dance line in the sand you know it's a great song yes but I but also there's there's that those are the kind of two ends of the spectrum right mm-hmm hearing hearing someone's honestly and do an explaining yours honestly and asking for help to just to do that well your your stuff is not just unique it's unique in itself like your songs are different each song is different than the other side is like you don't there's not like a Queens of the Stone Age sound well I think there's a band called weand that I love so much and early on my first band Caius that was trying to sound like itself itself but singularly mm-hmm and I was feeling painted in a corner a little bit by the fact that it had to be in this mode and we toured with this band ween because who would play anything do you you know they aren't sure yeah I know they're so brilliant and they play us mister would you please help my pony and we were like what the fuck is that about and then they'd play riders on the storm for 28 minutes when it was fucking incredible they'd never sound checked it you're like you just know and and what they were was free mmm they set and then they did a country record with all these professional hired gun country you know and it sounded incredible because they were like cuz we can do that why can't we yeah that manifesting what you love period and so I just from being around them and seeing things like that and then starting this desert sessions project which is what I just put out recently where it's just collaboration and it could be anything because it's not all you you know but yet it's you and so it was that's how Queens started was like what if you just played anything you thought was good no matter what it was and you let every song I had a friend of mine once say to me you know not every song can be your best and I and I just looked at him and it was like why why what is that why is that I don't even know why that has to be a possibility why not yeah what if you if you see through to those spinning locks through to the other side and a song could go there you should take it there right I mean that's what we're supposed to do yeah and it's a weird pessimistic attitude isn't it like not every song can be your best and it was like oh I see you're talking about are you talking about hearing about yours yeah I see you mr. Howe went before the internet like there was a lot of bands that would put out like a few hits on an album but then the rest the album would almost feel like filler III again that's another thing right it seemed to me at one point in the my hope was that okay in the spirit of trying to do something different I call it on supply on demand you know it's out there cuz it's out there mmm-hmm what's not out there that would be interesting to hear it tell me what what you don't think we need and let's start there right for for just trying to fill in the gaps and beautifully fill in the gaps of what's not represented and and thereby having this limitless ability to play whatever you thought was right in the moment as long as it was honest then you'd be fine you know and uh and so that's always been I just I feel like it would be fun to try that so that's why it's so jumps around stylistically but I do think people listen to whatever they think is good and they don't care about genre what unless you're a teenager when that's important to you or that certainly was to me um why is Jean R important that seems like if you work at a record store it's important because you're filing these under like you know nose flute and the key of yeah I don't give a fuck about genre I give a fuck about good I mean I listen to car you have a taste a metal yeah something runs over it with its truck tire you go hey fuck I'm good yeah I'd love to lick that again well I just it's you know I like a song where you can tell the band made something that they like yeah you know I mean well this this is another thing early on when we left the desert and my first band Caius and we were so proud like we knew we sounded different we thought this is cool and so you make records you love and you listen to them all the time because because it's like you're supposed to make your favorite music I mean I was 15 years old what else was I supposed to make I can't wait to make the music I hate the most it doesn't make sense right I just want to do wedding so you meet you tour with these bands you're like do you guys listen your records cuz we would be in the car on tour listening to our records and then play our records and and they'd be like fucking hate that thing and I'd be like no I said do you listen to your own music like I couldn't understand right what's wrong with playing your favorite thing you always wanted to play but it's not out there so you create it that's all right it seems like that's the job actually yeah and how can you look how can you love my stuff if I don't right right what what are the fucking chances like 0.0 us well BIA is such a prison imagine if you created a genre that was super popular and people really loved it but you fucking hated it I did my first band there's this really wonderful thing happened the fans took over and they owned it because we stopped and so they took it over the fans kept it alive and some people gave it a name stoner rock what to me stoner rock was like Ozzy when I was a kid like naazy baseball shirts I'm sure I wanted to be a punk rocker and it's like don't stoners over there you know and so stone rock I was like no no and plus I don't want to wear that I can appreciate anything that I like so we don't need to call it anything mm-hmm because I'll just like whatever I like I know you could call it jazz rabbit that's the style of music gonna be like fucking fantastic but I just like what I like in that anyways yeah it's just a noise you're making to do with your face yeah it's Charlie Brown's teacher yeah I love that style actually it's like exactly who care right like I like what I like and um and you know you get it flack for that stuff for not like no sit here wear this and I understand too because it's good to feel part of something how many get flack for it how much do you pay attention to criticism zero good for you III don't I haven't read about myself in over a decade that's amazing way to go well be the first time I did I remember when I got a computer and I was like oh you mean they you can sometimes I feel like such a like a dumb nuts like I'm like oh you can talk to someone like who's like into your toes it's like I and I did and you know sometimes people like to bond over what they don't like and like and also they like to pretend it makes them feel better to pretend they have intimate knowledge of you Joe Rogan mm-hmm well thing about Joe is you see yeah and it's got to be negative so always oh because it suggests that we're close enough to I know the secrets you know it puts on good face for you but I know his fucking Joe secrets man so thing about Joe is and it's it's a it's but that's kind of an insecurity and so when I went on it was like I don't know actually I'm doing this and they said you're not the real thought and I just let it be known yes I fucking am and and then all of a sudden was like hey Josh I thought oh my god this is what am I going to do go door to door and correct people's perception mmm ma'am actually what happened in 1742 it's that it's a waste of my see some people who don't have like a wise sort of perspective on the internet getting wrapped up and doing just that because they them responding to criticism and going after people and you know what it's because um they they don't want to be blamed they don't want to be misunderstood where I totally understand I understand my wife has been one of my biggest inspirations ever and like that that thing that I've really learned from her is like the you can't blame when you blame someone it's like saying to them when you point the finger it's like saying you're guilty before you even have a chance to talk and say your perspective mm-hmm what that's nobody likes that you know what I mean nobody wants to like start by being blamed for something makes you shut off it immediately and now you have these disengaged people blaming each other and being mean to each other and again if we're talking about doing what you like I don't like that and I also have friends I really love that engage in that quite a bit and it's a trouble spot for them mm-hm and so instead of doing it myself I try to like look at that and say ooh I don't I don't want that I don't I love my music and I try to make it as real as I can and I try to make a difference I can and then I accept if you don't like it but if you have a vinyl or if you have a CD still I love it if you don't it's still a hell of a coaster right it's not bad you know I mean could be worst coaster the art looks cool you know I I need to be okay with that mm-hmm and accept that shit because otherwise what I'm please like it well you're also you're not looking at that review right that reviewer is wrong yeah it's unmanageable numbers to write because you'd be interacting with literally thousands of people every day and trying to correct them and then once people find out that all they have to do to get your attention is to be negative and I've had moments of that before because I really have always cared about fairness and justice but especially in the last bunch of years you know it's like I have to be okay with what I did for me and people don't really know what the fuck they're talking about and what really goes on but if my expectation is that I'm gonna get take everyone to a spot where like this is what actually happens right I'll be sad and you're also engaging people that don't want you to be a good guy so they want to go fuck you you just want us to think that of course yeah of course and then um and I'm actually kind of investing time and energy into like no but yeah but no right I mean you're investing time and energy also into your persona or your public perceptible perception of you I don't have a persona I've had many times where because of being like like feeling strange about things or angry about things or this I take them out on the stage some some times because I grew up watching bands like and Iggy and all the stuff were sometimes you go see a banner that's scary and that's wonderful to be scared by it this music is like whoa and everything that comes with it it's so fucking real look out it can actually drive you backwards that's exhilarating and also on stage that's the place for that yeah out in real life doing that like while you're at the ATM not so much you know yeah but to to cut your tethers loose and go I don't know what I'm gonna do tonight which I have done many times and walk out there but I will embody the emotion that I'm feeling right now and and you can go ahead and take that shit to the ATM and deposit that because that's what's gonna happen the problem is is if you're not doing well then that's how that yeah but you're gonna feel that when you get out there but it is supposed to well I'm willing to do anything up there and I don't know why because I feel like that's the place and that's why because that's the place for it it's that's the art of it well it's also what you said that you enjoy the randomness of it yeah I mean I think that you're talking about manifesting if you go up there with that spirit that enjoying the randomness of then this sometimes the spirit will move you in a direction that you didn't even expect well yeah yeah because um you feel one with your actions so in the now you have no choice right and no preparation I'll it's too late it's it's already done the the preparation is over it's like a fight yeah that like you're not gonna learn anything extra till it's over right now you have to be in the moment there and I enjoy that because I enjoy that it's too late I love insurmountable odds that's all I need to do something is tell me like there's no way you're gonna make it I'll be like that sounds great yeah well why do we have to worry we're not gonna make it you know in it I mean there's something to that and but I also realized like how I guess the manifestation aspect of this has gotten important to me again because it's what I did in the beginning and as I you know have these moments of being lost and feeling like I don't understand what's going on and wondering why when really it's because of me you know yeah that that the best thing I can do that's why the records have gotten so dark because that's all I'm seeing and it has to be real so it is real dark you know but there's a beauty in that too but I don't want to make shit my new normal my dad's always like don't get accustomed to shit you know cuz it's like once you get used to that you're like this this is life this is normal right is everyone cool and and people end up people you love end up going no it's not you know and and you go wait a minute but I'm so used to it wow I thought you were gonna hop in this jacuzzi with me the temp was great it's shit shit water and and I so I'm I'm really like I'm so thankful to have like a great group of a family of artists that I get to collaborate with and like my some great kids I got three of them every time I go in a room there's another one of them in there you know there's so many fucking kids in and my wife who like really has the courage to help has had the courage her whole life to like go that's it's time to to go you know it's time to do this like you know someone that has really inspired me to have a partnership like that is fuckin rad yeah you know I mean talking about someone that has had a really rough beginning but never blamed doesn't spend pointing the finger and blaming because they shit goes nowhere some of the most interesting people in the world the ones who had a rough beginning yeah because of their hope coping mechanisms then pinballing off off and are getting to water strength yeah well and that's the other thing is the strength mmm the strength to to go right now and and that that strength for is so inspiring for me it gives me strength through her you know yeah like that's beautiful what one things I always like to talk to people that are famous about is it's that this that word you're famous no no no if you know you're famous it's a weird thing right being famous is a strange thing like no one teaches you how to handle that no one teaches you what to do I know advice will help no advice no because your experience is so unique yeah yeah and there's a it's it's a very difficult waters oh yeah do you and do you enjoy that notoriety part of it at all Hawking weird that's weird I find it I find it very difficult hard to swim yeah hard to stay it's in Elaine you and you know I think of the king of comedy I was like mmm you know that movie Janeiro yeah yeah where it's like Jerry Lewis is walking and my son loves you can I get an autograph and he says I'm and I'm a hurry because I hope you get cancer yeah it's it's unusual to deal with that twist yes yes and also um so much of the way I was raised to be private and things like that are looked at I was like a dis now mm-hm or like if someone says something bad about you if you don't say something back you're a pussy yeah well or that like when you don't people buy not your you're not you don't score any points by not defending yourself to the hilt in front of everybody yeah but I just wasn't raised that way I was raised to be like that's what I mean well there's also an issue in this day and age like if you defend yourself against every single piece of criticism you'll be lost you will not ever have a life you do there's numbers again unmanage when they know that you'll engage yes you manifest them to come back for more I don't know this is the epitome of of what we're talking about here and and being able to recognize that just that have that understanding of where it clicks and you go I can't focus on those things right like I have a beautiful daughter and two boys I have a strong lovely wife who's an incredible artist I have this family of people how about them and not fucking Gary who lives in Gary and you know what I mean it's just Gary on Gary crime out there you know yeah yeah it's um it's it's a weird lesson to learn to that in this day and age this world is very different than it was twenty thirty years ago the access that people have to you though did you just grow up riding your bike around and like he's down at dinner it's like when the Sun Goes Down right yeah you're like oh you mean in forever yeah it seemed like the Sun you know the days were so long and now these kids are like I know the kids that would prefer to play a basketball game then go outside and play a basketball game mm-hmm and I was think I was think I I think you fucked up I think it that's fucked up it's supposed to be the other way around the video games supposed to be not as interesting as you look at like the commercial like we're bringing people together synergy you know and like all the shit were like fuck you face they're trying to sell bringing people together but yeah exactly I think it's the entire world took one net I have three kids as well and it's insanely hard I think to be a child today I think to be a young adult today too I mean the pressures that people have is a book Jonathan hate wrote called the coddling of the American mind that discusses the issue that kids are having today with cell phones and depression and because of social media use and that especially girls so many girls are cutting themselves and self-harm suicides way up dude then there's a direct correlation between the invention of the smartphone and social media and all these things to such a dick move to call it a smartphone to because it's it's presupposing if you disagree like well I'm sorry tell me why you don't like a smartphone right it's well yeah well I know are smart people that have switched notice you have this shit in here I said oh yeah fuck is that okay yeah because I'm sorry yeah well Nick fit it don't worries man we got a little filtration system we can kick in I went to school of filtration nice guy and he tried to at all to kick those things I did but every time I have like some cut type terrible event I got I guess I got my Excuse back right yeah it gives you something come on I'm always your friends well it's yeah it's yeah come get a huh I'm the only thing that will hurt you later later who's not even real man taking two minutes off your life those are the end ones those ones suck well and also I blows my mind that someone goes to work at Philip Morris and has a good parking spot and like it's the birds are singing and they're like oh hey Sheila hey Gary and they and they go in there like want to talk to you about this high school campaign in Burma like yeah are you fuckin it's sort of it's sort of akin to like like one day I had this thought which many people have had before me and many after but realizing myself that there's these brilliant minds that make these machines and craft the whole thing and put a button that and moron can touch yes who's this who's the moron now right you you made all that shit and then you made it easy for this mouth-breather to but it should have been complex calculus and revved and pressing them certainly the Macarena would have to be like face activated to like so that you kind of look like a dick right if you want it sure if you want to blow this thing up you got to kind of embarrass yourself actually a very good idea well if a friend of mine sold a really killer house recently she's a real estate agent she sold this really killer killer house this guy who's in the tobacco industry and we were talking about I was like wow guys fucking margarine people I mean I just like see you kids later buying a badass house and slowly taking away people's health but I'm in favor of people being able to do it I mean in both sides sell it and buy it that's what's so strange is is that I somehow there's something inside me that hates rules so much because before we wrote rules down there was the sort of organic rules of like you know living with people once there's more than a few huts people are like all right no yelling after 2:00 in the morning do we all want that and no one fucks Gary he's 8 I know what I mean don't fuck Gary yeah and and then as more people come those are rules organically change in the old ones fade away hmm but for me today it's like don't walk on the grass it's like really the best part of this area what do you think grass is for Gary you don't walk in the grass is one of the dumbest things you could say or yeah it's like talking about me like I don't get it yeah also you don't care you know I so many times you see somebody and they're there guarding a doorway no one will ever go in or out of anyways they're just sitting there and and that's when I'm like do you want to water do you want like a do you want a dr. pepper that sure that's great do what do you want and because I think you don't care about this door I don't either you know what's the who somebody does and it's worth $10 an hour right someone does that's never there that's why they care about it because they don't know shit about that door sometimes you know and so I I abhor things that make no sense like that I tie I'll tell you an example of many times you know you record late into the night and you come to a 3 in the morning you in the streets of the valley you come to a stoplight and there's nobody coming in any direction and then you're looking at the light red there's no one I just go after I know it's safe because the function for this thing is now gone right what am I supposed to listen I'm born to listen to the color Reds come now but then there might be like some fucking cop hiding in their house vibes all over for it for four times really yeah what do you say well I said the same thing we're just two guys in the middle of the night who want to go home it was safe to go I shouldn't have went and I won't do it again the cop let you go every time and plus he had to go through it to catch to even catch up to me right you know what I mean what are we doing here you know you don't care I don't care I just was trying to go I just want to go home right and and I won't I'm sorry you're aligned Stepford Josh smoking cigarettes you're a rebel you gold tooth fucking tattoos and your knuckles your goddamn line stepper you should talk to no one sir I understand but I also I also understand that we can coexist and be really wonderful to each other and omit something that we both agrees if we both say it's stupid yeah and we still do it what what do we do the line is better right exactly aren't you a sort of in a minimum style obliged to even consider stepping out yeah we need less rules what if it wasn't a line at all and it just like a piece of wood was laying there and then someone picked it up and someone was like is that a line what if you're accidentally in a line that has no business being formed you know it's like I don't I think you owe it to yourself to at least take the minute and check that out if they came out with cancerous cigarettes that were real similar they were just like right next to a Selleck almost indistinct like that meatless burger I haven't so you have one I was jamming holy shit man maybe I want tacos yeah you haven't had an impossible no how is it it's it's probable it's so good really oh my fucking god it's so good so it tastes like a burger who cares it tastes real good you know whatever it is it's good like yeah like I always thought the dumbest thing is fake bacon cuz you're like there's no you have no chance and you should just call it like yeah lakyn or like or Lincoln or something else like away from bacon like it can just be its own thing right you don't have to be like it's fake bake bake heard that no you're not I you know they haven't figured that out yet but now I have figures yes that impossible sausage I just hork that down like it's that yeah I've what about it justjust I never even bite it I just hi what can they have an impossible cigarette if they did though my thought was people would still like if they were really stressed out they would want the real thing because part of what they want is that fuck you I'm just gonna fucking smoke a cigarette you know that's what of it it's kind of like the cha it's like chocolate in its own way it's like a grosser chocolate I suppose it's but it's that the thing you're doing you know is bad but you're doing it and part are you doing it's like there's an acceptance well I blame Matt Dillon for my case yeah over the edge you know the outsiders rumble fish stay gold Ponyboy it's like like young toughs yeah you know like whatever happened to that guy Matt Dillon he's still there's all kinds of shit I haven't seen him in anything you're not looking I'm not there he is look at him looks like fucking cool dude you don't know if I can do that shit when you're like I was I was like a 12 years old 11 years hanging out of his mouth looks so cool I'm 11 and I'm like what school that well that shit is pretty cool pretty fucking cool yeah look at him cigarette motorcycle jacket big smile beautiful face whoa oh oh I thought you're talking about Matt Taylor me a both you know but him on the screen you right here I'm just yeah I mean it's um no cigarettes are a weird one though right it's cuz they're there but they should be I think they should be available a hundred percent but it's like I think whisky should be available just like I think it should pot shit I mean I put a post on Instagram today because Joe Biden once he thinks that pots a gateway drug and he wants to keep it illegal spoken like someone that doesn't ever smoke pot yeah and also a gateway to ask it's a gateway to like Doritos dust on your chest yeah with his people that say it's a gateway for them but I get if you or the person who does meth because you smoke pot you were probably gonna do meth anyway you probably needed meth in your life well I certainly think that that at the end of the day if they took that money and then put it into less fearful things that work like talking about what drugs do and like or what you might be masking by taking them yes having an honest dialogue yeah everything seems like a dishonest dialogue we're gonna go to we're gonna have a war on terror we're gonna have a war on drugs we're gonna have a war on this yeah it's like can we start with a talk about it first no I have to go right the war you ever listen to Gabor Monta I mean that's how you say his name he's a doctor who speaks about drugs and addiction and his take on it is at all addiction almost all of it the the origin of his trauma for sure yeah childhood trauma abuse things that have happened to you that we're terrible yeah that led to you trying to let some same blockage and making a dam yeah because you think that'll stop whatever the river of pain that you should just be walking along as it's a trickle you're walking through and this is the current state of the art when you know or the state of the science of in the studies and terms in terms of like psychologists and people that do counselling they understand human beings that have addiction problems so that's one of the more offensive things about someone like Joe Biden running for president saying that it's like no you haven't done the work that's a photo like yeah and in fact because I've had so much experience with various things I got more knowledge about it than he does of course cuz I've been through it yeah and and I understand what why I would do those things and I understand how essentially it's just it's a band-aid over an amputee wound yeah and what's really more important is to like be vulnerable enough to engage somebody you know that word vulnerable is reading this book it's called daring greatly by Brunei brahmer something like it's really wonderful and it even went in the etymology of vulnerable the word vulnerable which is a place that's lacking armor and identifying that um is a strength because you know where the that spot is mm-hmm and that weakness is is identifying that spot and doing nothing right so they're almost this this each a lens of the same situation but just going in opposite directions vulnerabilities the opposite of weakness hmm and and uh and I think you have to take a chance on people and you have to take a chance on yourself and not just be like they're bad as if they themselves it's sort of like I blame the devil for the things I do mmm it wasn't me it was that it's the job you know right how can how can you stand over a mushroom on the ground and be like you're illegal what's that there's worth it yeah if you say you say you saw me do that alone and pointed a mushroom and you were like 40 feet away like you would go the fuck it's going on over there you're illegal yeah I want these picked and taken to my house immediately well what's crazy is Paul Stamets who's was on my podcast last week he's a mycologist he's a mushroom specialist and one of the things that he talked about was this one particular area in the Pacific Northwest where psilocybin mushrooms grow and cops literally wait there people go to pick them and then they what assert is W and Pat them down and take the mushrooms from them and arrest them what a dumb name plucked something out of the ground think look at our numbers yeah like what a weird service so fucking stupid go for mushrooms we'll take you to jail for free it's like hilarious is calling yourself an officer of the peace and doing that piece of what piece of the action there's so much peace growing out of the ground there what you're actually arresting people for seeking peace I I find that I don't want to ever get swept away and in order to make my point I have to run something up the flagpole of extreme because everything but the the modern word I actually like is spectrum because it feels like a gas tank of a gas knee like there's a blend here right that we're looking for and so on this on the subject of drugs and things like that everything gets run up the flagpole of extreme and put into the same category everything goes to full yeah yeah you know what that is it's all of this is bad right right and even down to like be good girls and boys we're like what the fuck does that mean do what ever you say that's bizarre yeah that's not good well and why you're older than me your parents fucked before mine did that's okay that's a great that's a great methodology for listening to somebody yeah you know I'm older and it's like and supposed to know more well we're also imprisoned by our language to a certain extent especially with the word drug you know because I had the whole time we've been talking I'm on a drug I'm drinking this coffee right so this is caffeine and you know you've got your drug there you smoking cigarettes that's naked too you know I don't it's not even a truck man let it go yeah but I mean the the concept of drugs like if someone sees you with a Starbucks cop they don't say oh my God look at that drug user but that's clearly a drug I mean caffeine affects you there's a reason why they sell venti cuz people didn't get jacked up enough on at all a drop yeah I remember that shit oh yeah it's still here remember redline remember that stuff no that's redline was a thing that people would was like a workout drink but people were dropping dead of it like its name though it was a grandma and yeah well you were fucking really 8000rpm but it's it's I think it's more than one serving one of those little fucking cans too and nobody reads that shit it's not four servings per can you like what am I taking a sip and passing around at my friend's I love that fuck out of here I love that that would be a necessity for a good workout though oh well it'll help yeah yeah there was some shit used to be able to buy I don't think he could buy anymore called Ripped Fuel I remember one time yeah it and went to jiu-jitsu class and I almost had a fucking heart attack I had to pull over to the side I had to sit in the side of the mat like dude my heart is pounded on my fucking chest right now you know Iram it's funny because those types of supplements you know people keep getting caught with tainted things and you go how really is who's making these yeah you know is that mean there's also like yak hair in there too on accident or what well what it is is a lot of is coming out of places like China where we had an issue with that with my company on it where we were selling we sell this thing called alpha brain which is a cognitive enhancing nootropic it's bunch of vitamins and nutrients that enhance the way your memory functions and we got it tested by a third party and found a bunch of stuff that was in there's not supposed to be in there because and this is what the lights just ran a blunt next no extra vitamins and shit but what it is is these companies that create these vats what you say if you have a supplement company so they're all in the same bowl yeah that's exactly they don't clean the bowl yeah that's really what it is so that's where a lot of these athletes get caught with like trace amounts of steroids and it's just from a tainted supplement you really got to clean your bowls you gotta clean those balls I mean I don't know how it works I don't know how they clean them but but it happen early no yeah in some countries in some companies some shitty companies that sell a lot of you know they'll have steroids in in a viagra and or a bunch of other stuff yeah and you buy in vitamins you get both how are they cleaning that I was like they just have paid two guys to just blow into the thing or yeah I don't know when it's empty it's empty sometimes maybe they don't clean it at all they just dump it out dump out what's in there and then pour the next thing and they don't give a fuck well I think you know really this whole conversation is very connected it's about the intention and engaging and realizing there are no corners to cut that you know every mountain has a valley next to it that's the way it was formed that's doing is your deficiency wherever that is is it almost like a flag your talent it's right next to it and perhaps that's a really good way to put it for kids do well for a kid that can't pay attention in school I want to be a one I want to be a wonderfully get engaged father I it's something I love and it's something that as they traverse the ages and you have to keep adapting the stuff that worked when they're five don't work no more right when they're seven or six yeah when you've only had you know you know like 50 months two or three months is that's a big chunk of those months yeah I I think what I love about my wife - and is that we're both like how do we do this mmm engaged in that like that you're learning as they're learning and that that um that's can be fun too right because you know how many times you catch yourself saying like getting upset about the perspective of a three-year-old right we're like oh but I'm not three right oh I see why you're upset I cuz you're three and so you think the closet actually has a Hamas Hamas on it oh that's cool cuz I can get my head around that yeah let's talk to it yeah it's interesting talking to a three-year-old like my kids aren't 3 anymore but the youngest ones are 9 and 11 and I remember when they were three you'd have these really weird conversations like monsters are real right and I'm like well monsters aren't real in terms of like the monsters you think but there's things that are just as scariest monsters that aren't like a crocodile crocodile is a real thing and then we would go to the internet and show crocodiles like killing a zebra and that which is probably not a smart thing for a fucking adult to try three-year-old but I'm feels like you can teach the abstract to someone that's not like if you were I love The Apprentice the guild system so much not the show The Apprentice I love the actual get like Cooper's barrels and stuff those are things where you start by sweeping the floor mm-hmm and you start by grabbing those rings over here all you're equipped to do is touch them right now Wray Wray Wray and slowly work your way up to be able to put the way to the barrel I'm sick of touching them and then you think to yourself oh cool only three more weeks of that and you should be so ready to do something else that you'll pay attention to what I have to say yeah you start with nothing and you get a little bit until you declare I'm sick of handling this cuz I fucking got it you know and then you go okay well if you're that if you're that big for your britches why don't I add one more thing that's one of the dangers of our instant access on-demand Google this instant answers being able stream this press at any time you want this societies that people don't understand the value of wanting something pursuing it and having a long road to accomplishing it the gift of nothing yeah like where I'm feel really blessed to be from death's because there wasn't a thing to do and when you tried to do some the police the local police because they had nothing to do we're like probably gonna drive over your skateboard and you'd be like why he'd do that why what the fuck yeah so you you you plunge yourself into more esoteric locations and hobbies because of sheer fucking boredom mmm and boredom is good fucking amazing it's really good anyway so it's so important and four to five minutes you know know it that like that's why I do that's why I don't play basketball because I'm playing a basketball game it's already going on mmm that's like shootings hard to get sweaty well it's it's also it's like you're doing something with your body and your mind or as you're sitting there just with the video game just moving your thumbs around engaging with something you're not going anywhere you're not getting out well there's something about the way those waves are which says you're in high anxiety or in conflict here in this year you're you're doing it all the think your brain is alive your brain is doing everything that that is associated with moving and getting in there in competition and your body it's got Doritos dust on your chest and inside your belly button yeah so it's the the absence of connection between body and mind which which when you're at your best when you're at your best isn't your body and mine one like a picture of this man who's climbing this moon this giant majiggy that we'll all like this is the this is the moment to be engaged and both body of mine because that feels good yeah you know III reckon you just get depressed doing that plane that all the time some some people do so and some people love it but some people become drone pilots yeah that's true too and and and and and one day it dawns on them what has occurred well they say that that's a severe source of PTSD that a lot of those drone pilots even though they're not physically there a lot of them have pretty severe pt.1 day that dam breaks mm-hmm and and and you feel yourself drowning and they understand the connection between their actions and and your fur and the PTSD is that you are forced to go downstream and realize like the old way of me must be gone it must it must I'll must let that drowned you know otherwise you're stuck in their loop of of that realization that you that you wasted time building a dam as if that were the coolest thing ever yeah instead of walking along the river and going downstream and dealing with the trickle as as it should be you know hey let me ask you this about cigarettes have you ever tried vaping I tried for a sec but it looks stupid like do me a say would you bring up that picture of Jimi Hendrix when he's vaping thank god you can't can you imagine Jimi had you one of those lunchbox ones those big old fat ones with a robot dick in the end of it yeah not Jimmy know me well it looks like a pump for like you know like for pumping water out of a pool yeah yeah what is that why are they getting those big ones what is the what's the benefit of those giant batteries I think it's just going all in and saying oh that like I'm doing this so I'm doing the whole thing I'm doing the most you know it's it's like what I see those those motorcycle cars which are two wheels up front and one in the back right and I think like it's a bit like the Segway and taking it to the lamest thing you could all the way there's always something the Segway is those things handled better than a motorcycle I can't handle them no well certainly they're more stable because the details are upfront but right I'm not riding a motorcycle for stability you're not but some people are right some people the guys who write those Hayabusas and shit like that well to each his own I don't ever want to stand in the way of my own joy let alone someone else's but you like cruisers right I got out there's not a Harley that's that's my grandpa bike so like take my gal the movies or dinner or something and just enjoy her arms around my waist you know what I mean and to go slow and and listen to NPR on 20 or listen to do you ever just drive with no music of course yeah of course I have a Corvette 1965 Corvette no it's got no radio in it it's one things I love about it yeah when I Drive that thing I just drive that's why that's why I like to drive back home to the devs because you know me just being me and experiencing what's going on yeah it is fine yeah the sensations it's like it's to me it's it's almost like a form of meditation as well because you you have to pay attention like you're saying I mean mine doesn't have a roof it's a convertible so I'm feeling the air I see the stars and you have to look at everything around you and those cars you really feel the road oh so if you run over a P like you definitely get princess out a 67 Camaro I've had some great it was my first car oh that's amazing you have your first car yeah fuck yeah god damn and there's been times when I've I haven't done well or something I've had to sleep in it and all these things so we have this long relationship and it never breaks down it's always just wonderful - we're wonderful to each other and uh and you feel the road when you hit something you're like hey right and so you're attached to it and I I love riding in a caddy or something like that to where it's like you could run over multiple bodies and and feel nothing right but but but I enjoy the drive one when I'm on the road sitting on a seat with five wheels one of my hand and four on the road it's a great experience my old man for a brief second has 65 Corvette Stingray Derek amazing cars they're just the way that thing looks like they just nailed it it's very organic yeah they nail it's definitely taken off of a stingray like sometimes like well it's I don't know I mean it doesn't really look like a stingray to me but what it looks like it's that front like yeah it's there's that bit of that shaping that inspiration on the shape up to me I guess yeah and I think III I'm so always that last one it's like if you could make something and you're gonna ask everyone to help you and we're gonna grab all this shit from wherever we're gonna grab it from can we make it look cool or no like what is your aversion to not everything has to look like an egg or a drop of water right and if it does can we do that like it's cool-looking as possible if you're never late it should look great because that don't you feel good in that car oh yeah yeah it looks great yeah look and it's it's also to me it's like you're rolling around in a piece of history so yeah 1965 you know it's like that that thing was created in you know the early 60s someone figured it out and put it together and then made a production line and did the most important thing ever they said this is where we stop yep we're good yeah and they were like this is what it looks like when it's finished mm-hmm a completed thought yeah and and and other people like fuckin good idea man and and I just I have a 67 you have a 65 like that doesn't mean there aren't things made today it just means like I'm down with that idea and it's also it's it captures a very specific time in American history where they made these cars that were worthwhile because when you go to 77 nobody gives a fuck about a 77 anything yeah you know you know I mean like who's buying a 77 Mustang get the fucking thing away from me you know there's a lot of people selling them well I also think to this this guy pulled up on me and Prius that was quite new and he rolled down the window and just looked at me and waved his hand over his nose like and he goes stinky no way really yeah I'm Fairfax kind of by the Whole Foods there at Santa Santa Monica and uh and I just thought this is my first car I haven't got another one so you've probably gotten multiple new cars that's the only car you've had I had a Bronco and we have a family car your whole life that's it I had a Magnum for a sec but I never sold this car what Magnum I can't believe you never said that is so cool you never sold your first car and it was a 67 Camaro like I've had a lot of experiences in there that were that were wonderful and some of they were challenging and they're all it's it's incredible to have locked into that car yeah I mean but it's the shape to that's like one of the great all-time iconic shapes in automotive history that first one was like an attempt to be like Mustangs Mustang yeah and and they really hit it out of the park because c7 68 and 69 you can almost hear the Mustang going like well yeah you know because the it's it's it's beautiful yeah and but I was thinking this guy like I see what he was trying to say but uh he's probably can he's probably bought a shit ton of cars which is way worse for the footprint just off thing plus batteries are made on three common what is he's gonna do fix you by going stinky he's just being a twat he's trying to build himself up again by breaking me down but like my grandpa has said he didn't swear very much but he one of the things he was like I'd have to give a shit for it's a matter and I just kind of chuckled because I was like thank God I ain't riding there in the car with him you know yeah because certainly he's going up to the next like Monte Carlo and it's like stinky yeah it's not like a stinky parade driving around his car that gets 50 miles to the gallon just mocking everything with a v8 yeah but also like on a stinky parade and that's that's a that's a something I don't want to float on it's a lot of negativity pumping out there yeah but it's just weird to roll down your window do that debate like well certainly that's too much free time in my book you know what says too much self-righteousness yeah stinky stink there it is look at that one done up whoo look at that bad boy oh well god damned if I could turn on my do you mind if I turn this on I'll show you pictures that yours that my look is says it's yours is it not yours I don't think that's his isn't yours black or is your silver yeah it's silver is it like that it looks a lot like that except I don't have those actually I used to have I that's real close but that's not it fuck you Internet but it's it's strikingly close for example this has no door handles and no mirrors on yours and mine does it also has a hood scoop from what seems to be a Corvette actually which mine does not have and those rims are much like the ones I had on my Magnum but not what I have them I think that's the hood from 69 4 to 7 I think the SS and the better that's it right there it is that's beautiful man yeah and I'll show you what it looks like right now because I ended up dropping a crate engine because in there which is a GM which one it's a Dino blueprinted 350 well with aluminum heads so where's again our pounds left and it sounds like you're stepping on glass like an endless Mazel Tov parade yeah because like yeah like you know with like a glass and a hank yeah well they're like ma like glass pack mufflers well I in truth I tried to calm that down because as you crest a hundred miles an hour it with the mufflers too loud it's like what yes it like scheana in a b-52 bomber for no reason like you know and uh let's see my rides I'll show it if you if you don't mind now because uh it's pretty it's lovely when did you put those the crate engine into it about five years ago and what a great idea that was oh yeah change the balance of the car right oh yeah it's got a new front rear under it and so so it's on Rails like you know you couldn't roll that thing if you if you like lubed up the freeway like yes and I got these hopster oh yeah hopster rims on it oh god that looks good you know you know what's amazing about it is um I get in that car and I take the kids to school or something and it's the its contagious because what happens is you feel really good as you know you get in your it's 65 and you feel really good and you pull up with a smile on your face and go hey and it's a daily driver of this thing yeah it's my daily driver and so that's a perfect Rockstar daily driver by the way well it's a 67 Camaro it's it's the what it is is something that makes me feel really good that is not part of a crisis yeah you're not midlife now yeah not pre life not polite it's just it's just mine and and I feel like myself in there the kids get in there I have five point seatbelts so you don't need a car seat because I have a seat belt that's it makes a car seat look like you're doing okay right it's it's a harness with Springs that like slip mm-hmm anyways so they can be in the car as as it is and take them to school and and kid kids go like whoa and they get to get out in that yeah that's how they start their day right right right and it's a little adventure that shit is tight yeah it's tight man like even being in traffic like people are really nice to you too they they pull up and they go yeah most of them yeah well some go stinky but you know behind it find the ass of something cool is stinking yeah it's like check out my ass as I as I take a crate engine it's got to do much better in terms of emissions oh who cares you know the fact of the matter is is that as that the responsibility should be on these plastic companies and these oil companies that have negated their responsibility to like you should be allowed to just like shit into the air or the environment at a record pace just so you can make dough at the expense of everybody well they had a different thing that you just did recently where they did a satellite image of all the methane in Los Angeles and they were thinking well we're gonna we're gonna find out where all these toxic greenhouse gases are coming from and an exorbitant number of them were coming from landfills you know just like steaming piles of steaming piles his releasing terrible terrible gas into into the air I can't I can't help I can't help but think that you couldn't take that mulch it and turn it into something that would power something yeah I think they're eventually going to be able to figure that out you know you're talking about the garbage patch there's a guy named boy onslaught I love them yeah he's coming back I had just emailed the dutchman the young yeah he's got a new one that he just installed in rivers so he's cleaning up these rivers in these third-world countries that are you know extremely polluted and the they're figuring out technologies to extract all these pollutants and then you could actually make a commodity out of the stuff that they pull so like the plastic that he's gonna pull from the ocean is gonna be valuable it's gonna be worth can be read yeah reuse I think it would be a wonderful thing if we could agree that this probably enough plastic already and to keep remaking more new what probably is unnecessary well what's really unnecessary is using fossil fuel plastic because there's biodegradable plastic they can make from hemp this has been well head on this parent of the wonder drug for so long yeah really I mean the Constitution's written on hemp paper and and and you tell someone that they're like well well I think is the Declaration of Independence but yeah I mean in also Declaration of Kota yeah and codependence one of the drafts of the Declaration of Independence written on hemp but also like the sales of the fuzz so all the ships every every ship that crossed the ocean every great work of art is written on canvas that was made with hemp this helped to close that and doesn't fuck with the soil and now but I once saw you standing over that plant screaming illegal illegal hey dude I gotta wrap this up man a pleasure to talk to you I've been a big fan for a long time so I'm a big fan of yours as well and I loved your last special bits between cats and dogs it it was so true it was hard for me to watch well thank you thank you and your this desert
