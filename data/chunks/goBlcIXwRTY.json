the gyro can experience sometimes I feel like all these problems are put there for a reason than anything come on oh you're so cute I know it's all for a reason no no just anything is anything solvable including that happens happens for it's annoying but then it's not right well I'm with you I believe I believe it's a lie I mean anything any child human beings do incredible things man yeah oh yeah you ever hear the story about Moore's a guy who created Morse code like that was the most revolutionary turning point in history right Morse Morse because if you think about it it was 1820 when it was invented I think when the first time they actually I think was 1899 when the first time they actually had a 10-mile stretch of wire and the guy was able to send a message and before that think about this before that the the guy the guy beats for Dan 18 whatever 1815 he had to send a message the same exact way Alexander the Great did either on horseback either on foot or either by boat okay and when Morse code came up and Morse was a guy who was a really really successful painter okay and he had nothing to do with electrochromatic magnetic fields Rennie was a really successful painter his wife he gets what we get to a letter that his wife is very sick he loved his wife in Connecticut by the time he gets there she's not only dead she's been buried and he said there's got to be a way I can get information faster because it killed him it was this tragedy seven years later he's on a boat he meets this electromagnetic engineer he starts talking to him he gets fascinated with the idea that maybe I can come up with a way to use electromagnetic fields to send a message about ten years after that he invented something called Morse code this painter because he was so bro heartbroken over his wife and and and bye though and the world has never been the same that was a bigger communication leap actually than the internet because it was the first time we were able to send instantaneous messages and then I think five years later we finally had a wire from New York to New Orleans which was so much faster and you could get instantaneous communication the world was never and of course we built on that but there's the history so full of individuals that were trying to solve a problem that seemed insurmountable and oftentimes it was because they basically like Alexander Fleming had a cold mm-hmm he his snot fell into he had all these petri dishes working on different spores and stuff and he decided to clean stuff out himself he never used to clean his own petri dishes he had a cold as snot fell into one of the moldy dishes and he realized that the bacteria under the microscope the mold had killed all the bacteria and he went wait a minute that's how he invented a little something called penicillin song which then became antibiotics which is why people are alive it's crazy so many so many these things that are happening through accident with individuals or people were trying to solve a problem yeah there's a that's one of the things about life is that you need struggle it seems like you shouldn't have it but you need it I'm reading this book by Jon Krakauer called under the banner of heaven which is about fundamentalist Mormons do you know about this no whoa holy shit does that like the jeffries guy yeah there's I think so the Jeffrey's which was the Jeffrey's gaffers guy was the guy that guys just got arrested he was the polygamist yes yes yes yeah yes so here's the way it works there is in this book it talks like a member the town but there is an area that is run completely by a guy named uncle Rulon or was run by this guy named uncle Rulon who is a Mormon fundamentalist this these are these people are rejected by the mainstream Mormons because the government came in at one point said you guys can't be polygamists it's illegal and so they had to renounce polygamy and this was something that according to this book Joseph Smith said was the essence of Mormonism it's still one of the most deepest most important parts of Mormonism is that you have multiple or what they call a plurality of wives morality okay so and here's the thing this is why you need a bunch of wives if you are a fundamentalist Mormon you are only supposed to have sex with your wife when she's ovulating which means if you only have one why you're not only gonna have sex a few times a month once a month I don't know when women ovulate once a month if you have 15 wives you can fuck every night so it's very important to have as many wives as possible because then you could have sex with them all the time and they're always humping and a lot of these guys have so many children that one of the I can't remember which one it was I might have an uncle Rulon I can't remember which one had so many children that they named them according to the year so if you were born in like 1979 your name would have an A so it'd be like Anabel Angus Ari and then you would know what year your kid was born in by the first letter of his name Wow that's how many kids are having so then you have girls and your girls get to be the age of 14 and you've got a pal like vite a 14 year old kid and I was a fundamentalist Mormon I'd be like Joe why don't you marry my daughter Laurie she just started bleeding and then I would give her to you and you would immediately start fucking her and so that's what they're doing out there is like it's just like just herds and packs of pregnant teenagers that have been impregnated by these older dudes who have so many wives and this shit is I think it's still going on today man there's whole communities dedicated to this polygamist lifestyle which is a lifestyle that Joseph Smith said was one of the most important aspects of Mormonism according to this book Wow the other thing about Joseph Smith do you know what he did before he found he founded Mormonism what he was what was called like a treasure seeker and so you would use magic stones to peer through - that would show you where secret treasure was buried and he there was a huge lawsuit against him because he convinced all these people that he could find that was also what he said about the golden tablets yeah that was it he could use a seer stone and see it through a magic rock that's how he could read the golden tablets before he was doing the seer stone and the angel Moroni before he's using the seer stone and angel Moroni came to him he was actually getting work convincing people like hey look I've got a magic Rock and there and I can find your silver for you because there was like a guy who hired him because he knew that there was a some silver hidden up in the hills somewhere and Joseph Smith went around with like warts looking through the courts and finally after like three months of hiring him by the month they took him to court now like hey this guy can't really find treasure with that rock well he's out there looking every day wouldn't you have loved to seen like a video of him talking of Joseph Smith like talking and explaining his strategies and what he does and you know what Mormonism is all about yeah man I mean exactly that idea of like that here's a man who was look come on let's just admit it here's a man who's like just basically like a classic con artist yeah come on man you're really telling people you can find treasure with a rock no one's ever found treasure that's something like when I was in the third grade that I would lie about to a kiddin in the playground or something but this guy was making money off of it it's just very interesting to see something grow roots and and flourish in the way that that Mormonism has went when just with a very simple investigation and to the you've got lawsuits there's written records against Joseph Smith yeah because he was taken to court for lying in a car [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh shit iTunes recording to servers get
