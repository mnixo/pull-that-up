hello freak bitches I mean obviously the Western world has plenty of problems but one thing the Western world has pretty clearly is the even exchange of information and ideas you might not agree with these ideas and you might mean it then that's it there's a problem with that as well but but you have access to them you have access to them and this access is like well does one of the things going on with Twitter and I don't know if you know about this but Milo Union apple√≠s you know it is yeah they got banned from Twitter for writing a bad review about Ghostbusters which essentially confirms what he said about the regressive left is that they're trying to stifle ideas like well and then they're saying that he's responsible for the harassment of Leslie Jones right which is horrible you know what people did she's a fucking comedian she's awesome great she's great she's funny as shit man um but also this is just trolls all right you're always gonna have trolls but he didn't do that he didn't he's not responsible for he didn't like standing that he wasn't the catalyst to the yeah but what he did was make an incredible amount of sense when he was describing that you cannot make fun of this movie you cannot criticize this movie if you do you're labeled a misogynist and he talked about how preposterous this movie is that these women are all out kicking ass and every man the movies a buffoon and the women don't have any negative traits or qualities at all they're they're super powerful and super awesome and hilarious and the humor is non-existent because they put them in this restrictive box he had from Twitter for that band for Twitter for this you you what they were blaming him on the harassment that Leslie experienced the inside of these well they didn't excited inside anything he made a provocative article about a piece of art that's what that movie is a piece of art so they are stay are guilty of censorship in the in the worst way well what they're doing is they're stifling ideas they don't agree with and they've they've decided that Twitter established some weird fucking thing called the trust and security council or something like that and they brought out how these social dressed justice words Jamie looked that up what the fuck like that all that they tried to do but they brought on all these people for the like Mao's China what Jesus Christ very very bizarre it is thought dr. elantra well look I'm against harassment if you can stop people from being shitty to people and you say well here's someone who's using Twitter and they're going after people in a very shitty way but the problem with that is look at how many fucking people have made shitty horrible evil comments about police officers all police officers trust and Safety Council when it comes to safety everyone plays a role please make that larger so I can read it which are ours Twitter empowers every voice to shape the world but you can't do that unless you feel safe and confident enough to express yourself freely and connect with the world around you to help give your voice more power Twitter does not tolerate behavior intended to harass intimidate or use fear to silence another users voice very general by the way listen gentleness now you have a council that is deciding whether or not you're good enough for Twitter that's well you know what the first thing they did with him they couldn't figure out what to do with him they took away his verification Wow what what does that have to do with wow what is that he's not verified anymore they took away his little blue chatter it's very dangerous it's a very dangerous slippery slope but we see this when our universities till when they do exactly the same thing when they did that he gained 20,000 new followers immediately because there was a massive backlash so now they're in a place where there is even more backlash because if you look at the actual words that he typed versus what they're accusing him of and it just doesn't stack up it's clear that they don't like him because he's a Republican he's a trump supporter he and he is a fucking troll I love him I think he's hilarious he's a troll but in the marketplace of ideas you should be able to combat his trolling behavior that we have a gag without gag s without ya chewing and engage him engage him in a debate that's a vigorous spirit exactly vomit gag the guy right if you really feel like he has done something egregious you he's done something that can be criticized criticize it that's right and if he's actually harassing people if he's actually saying hey go find Liz League Jones and and throw dogshit at or do something horrible to her or slash her tires something that he's actually doing something that yeah yeah then you know that he's doing that's that's where that's where the that you don't get up in a crowded movie theater and scream fire because you'll create a stampede yeah right exactly you know my Angela talked about that when she said where the Ku Klux Klan was saying we have a freedom speech and my Angela said your freedom ends your freedom of speech can end when you're literally telling people to hang me yes you know and you're telling a mob and I'm standing right there that that inciting them that's that's probably where you know we should take a look at things I mean we all know we all know the line what we don't know I'm saying I'm saying that that there is something called common decency and you know people like to jump to these extremes but it's not it doesn't inform the debate I think what you're saying is so important and then the idea that you've got to create safe haven for those that you agree with and disagree with and I disagree with Milo all the time I mean he and I are friends and I've had him on the podcast twice and when we talk i'm mahkum when we have fun i mean but he's a good guy but he's just really right-wing I also think his trolling is so fucking sophisticated and he's one of the ones that was saying that he believes that Melania had he's here named Trump Melania is that her name yeah he thinks that they did it on purpose he thinks Trump is a master troll and he thinks that the plagiarism was on purpose because now more people are talking about it and more people are I don't know if that's true but I think it's hilarious that did you know that his tweet Trump's tweet that he put out to congratulate his wife for speaking is exactly verbatim the same tweet that Obama put out to congratulate his wife for speaking interesting exactly every single word in the exact same order Wow yes that's that's pretty calculated I don't know I don't think he writes his own tweets that apparently wasn't true is it fake like that was like photoshopped oh this mother they got me so that was the other thing they did I'm sorry about that folks that's another thing too they did with Leslie Jones which she was really upset is that trolls were taking words um and putting them like they were taking a Photoshop and making her like her name like what she had you know hurt her Twitter name and then writing horrible shit about gay people and then putting it in there Jesus but Leslie Jones and again I love her I think she's really funny she said some kind of fucked up things on on Twitter herself and you know things like be construed as racist one of the things she said about white people being shit fuck white people shit like something like that it was an Breitbart see if you could you find the actual things that they were they were saying that like how could Leslie Jones get away with saying this but Milo gets banned for writing an article and I'm not a man but I think what Leslie said like white people shit it could have been that she was saying like someone did something and can't damn white people this is some white people shit yeah you know like she's funny like when people climb into a zoo and try to fucking hug a tiger yeah that's why people yeah that's why people yes shit that's funny though and let's say anybody who knows Lydia knows she's Lord how great she's just a fucking doll lord have mercy why people shit what does that mean though it's white people shit like they did already stole I mean what does that mean like why did she say that like what is that about who imagine a white yes I believe this imagine a white person saying that about black people understand but I think you know we've heard this before we it's fine Leslie Jones is not a racist Leslie Jones's never been anything but really kind of people around her okay but hold on a second because sometimes people say things at a racist and they're not racist they're just trying to be funny yes like you know I mean who have too sensitive sometimes Jeff Ross is hilarious and he says a lot of racial stuff when he's our silver medal Sarah Silverman well Jeff Ross in particular because he's really good at roasting people and a lot of stuff that he says like you know he crosses what some people would say is a line but what is he doing he's being funny there is there is a difference so a lot of times if you're Hispanic if you're you know you're from a marginalized group you get away with you can get away with it because you you all share in a common experience of repression right like gay people can mock straight people go ahead mock me for like a pussy who cares that's what I mean right we don't we've never had to pay a price for that kind of oppression we haven't not physically and not not economically that's not true because we've been oppressed for being straight forever it's it's a constant thing people are just so mad that we're such a breeder fuckin breeder and ya out there making babies [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
