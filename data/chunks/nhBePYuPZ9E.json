boom-boom-boom what's happening brother hey dudeman let's crack it's good to be back good to be back good it's always amazing it's like it's it's like a little it's it's a bit of an amusement park almost now with stuff to see and the gym equipment and everything I keep thinking I should just bring my gear over and work out before the show or after the show but get loose I don't want to embarrass myself so I'm not gonna watch watch you're working out he would change that kind of guy yeah I've seen him give me side eye he would give you side but yeah it's all good everything's everything's good I've been travelling a lot haven't we just talked before we started about Idaho haven't had a chance to get back there but yeah all good all good so you're around for a television show is that what you're doing yeah this is this is there's several meetings going on here but we just finished filming a show reality show for can I say the network I'm okay they're kind of hinky on until we get closer to the air day which is October but it's for the Discovery Network and it's gonna be it's gonna be a great show that I did well you know what that's what I always said I always thought free publicity is a good thing but they're very tight on the marketing protocols and so they want to make sure they've got it all but no but I get that right they spend you know a lot of money on these things and fucking so freaks yeah and so anyway it's but it's gonna be a great a great show we spent the past three or four months filming it around the country a really good production team and the stories are fantastic it's basically looking at I guess I'm talking about it I'm not supposed to but we're looking at military government organisations that are typically in the shadows right we're not releasing any sources and methods right disclosing and classified secrets but we're talking about elements and units operational activity events that before now I've pretty much been in the shadows and some incredible people that's one of the best parts about this thing it's been going out there and meeting some of these guys that are doing some of this high speed shit and it's it's pretty amazing and when when they do release things like long long after it I was reading something I forget what the case was about but it was something about how the the files won't be released under the Freedom of Information Act until 2080 mm-hmm how do you yeah I know what do they make that distinct and assassination right and sometimes they roll it over and it's not even then right so sometimes they extend that other times they don't and and so some information comes to light periodically and so this does look at the show be looking at some historic but a lot of current things that are going on and where the money goes right what are we spending our money on when it comes to this high-speed operations that the Special Forces and others are involved in so it'll be it'll be very good I was I was lucky to be able to work with again you know some really great people on the production side but just also going out there and meeting some of these cats they're just the the shit that they do is it's even after being around a while so I have it just amazes me well it's got to be constantly accelerating too right they're constantly coming up with new and spectacular things that nobody knows about ya know they employ them right exact and sometimes that shit stays on the Shelf right you know you it was like the the running joke at the agency at the CIA was you know they we have a fantastic S&T group science and technology group and they're the ones responsible IQ from from bonds right they're the ones responsible for developing all the gear responding to specific operational requirements how are we going to do this particular thing well let's develop a piece of kit that's going to allow us to do it but the running joke is always that you know they'll develop it they'll show it to you before it operation but then they'll put it back on the shelf because they don't want that shit getting out there right and people finding out that they've got it so they'll give you like a 20 year old piece of kit to use instead and you'll be walking around with like a phone the size of a brick knowing that they've got something high-speed on the shelf well that's what everybody always thinks like when you talk to the average Joe on the street about technology in the government there was like dude the stuff they have they probably don't tell us about how much of that is real yeah it's it's pretty real have you seen some stuff that made you go holy shit yeah you can do that yes really yeah and how much can you tell us well you know what one thing that they're doing and and there's a this is actually something I wanted to talk about today because it's gonna affect everybody it's not just something that it's gonna affect people in the military or else in the intelligence community but one of the things that they've been working on is imagine you've got it you got a rock up on it on a target and your but your before you do that before you you get the customers on site and you're gonna you know hopefully obtain some high-value targets there at that location before you do you gotta you talking like euphemisms oh I'm sorry to another dimension but sometimes you know okay actually I was gonna say sometimes you want to actually capture them and get their intelligence we've gone past that right because the years where we were getting our ass kicked for holding on to people in detention facilities you know what that did that that pretty much convinced everybody that was involved in this to just just whack them right because then you don't have to deal with the aftermath you don't have to worry about are you gonna get in trouble for interrogating somebody right exactly so so that actually increased lethality of operations you started painting targets and just blowing the shit out of there rather than trying to grab the target and get their Intel that's a problem because then the pipeline dries up for the Intel but anyway so imagine you got this you got this site the first thing you got do is determine if your targets there right and it's not like that you know the Tom Clancy movies where you know you're looking through walls and all this shit it's you know that that technology night-vision devices and and and that ability and low-light conditions to to monitor and to identify specific individuals has always been a problem they've made great strides on it to the point now where in no light conditions right with the with the right stack database with the right information and that database meaning the right amount of information about individuals right you just constantly populating this database with new faces or with new photographs of individuals that you're going after with enough for that to sift through they're getting to the point now with no like conditions that they can identify positively the targets in that room or the targets in that facility or in that building whatever it might be and that's pretty incredible I rather they can identify people by their heart rate mm-hmm with well not just their heart right but I mean other other bio data right I mean other but they and literally with video somehow or another they can zoom in on you with some scanner and recognize that this is a particular individual because their heart rate yeah this is there was an article that was written about it and I know that there's a company do you know what hex is HECS it's some company that's been used pretty extensively by scuba diving community and now by the hunting community as well because it blocks the electrical signal hecs it blocks the electrical signal that your body gives off okay yeah that makes sense and I think they're doing work with the military as well to develop suits that will somehow another stop someone from being able to recognize your particular heart rate right they're just a lot of work on what they call this or the universe there's older depending on is the leis that I got identified people from a distance yeah it comes easier it helps if you have other data points right if you but this is all part of it to some degree what you know they refer to as a universal soldier right the the the fighter of tomorrow and on Claude Van Damme yeah but they got shit that's right yeah who doesn't remember Jean although he's all in one room he's doing like chip commercials now I'm sure you haven't seen him in days or whatever dude seven is true oh the splits yeah yeah I don't know when that becomes useful though really the splits I mean I've never actually you know felt with that was something I needed to accomplish in any given moment from an operation Ronnie movies where you have to do this man but so the Universal Soldier thing where you you you're you know its exoskeleton it's a soft suit it's all that data that you can acquire for that warfighter how do you create the perfect environment on that individual as he's moving through an environment to you know be a more efficient effective lethal fighter and you know things like that identifying target whether it's with a laser whether it's with low light or no light conditions where you can you as you're rocking up on the target you can do that all these things you know the ability to to carry more gear humph it another extra you know ten kilometers whatever it might be it's it's pretty incredible what they're doing and it's it's a joint it's not just the military they're working with you know companies like hax or they're working with with the commercial sector and academics too but anyway and I disappear down a rabbit hole the these like the the idea of like this Universal Soldier thing if you've been paying attention to this Elon Musk neural link thing that he's coming out with you know they're gonna somehow or another insert fibers into your brain and then have a Bluetooth enabled device that you wear that it's gonna allow you to somehow or another interface with data at a much higher bandwidth I don't know what any of those words mean I just said but that was good though it was good it sounded like you understood it that's my trick and repeat words yeah I you know there comes up warrant if you're talking about I mean well that's that's going into a different area that's going into civilian applications and probably the military application would be great for that too everyone could synchronize data you could give them navigation in their head like if there's some sort of augmented reality we could literally see the targets in front of you like they if you had a map say like that if the Pentagon really does have this laser beam they could identify specific individuals and you have a map of a building that's in your head and they can identify the very location absolute perfect location of each individual person in that room and you could see that as you're running into this building you're seeing like a 3d grid in front of you and I know I mean you could shoot them right through a fucking wall right and there's but there does become a problem then that becomes a problem of information overload and when you get into that situation right everything starts to close down a little bit right and and or and so you've got to start pushing some of that away and and now what you end up doing is you get the off-site you know command center relaying some of that information as needed but that guy that's about to breach that door you know he doesn't want a lot of data points anymore now having said that knowing where you know knowing where the hostiles are the other side of that door that is key information that's not rocket science but so there's a lot that's going on there's also the ability to monitor of the individual you know soldiers are out there through the the gear that they would then be wearing it's it's an it's an incredible effort that has been going on and so they answer your point a long rambling answer yeah I've seen some things that are pretty amazing you can't talk about though no no some of this some of this shit actually we'll get into with the new show that's coming up sometime in fall I don't have a release date and again I'm prescribed from talking about so I won't do that because so some I pay attention some of the things that you saw you'll be able to talk about yes so how does the government do that they just decide well listen it's not a bad thing if you tell people about this sometimes raised yeah I mean well I think this there's an element of some of it's not what you would refer to as classified it's just not readily available public information and it's not out there in the domain because people aren't aware of it are searching for it some of it does I think you're right some of it is look the military wants to say at times look what we're able to do we're doing this and oftentimes it's because it's in a sort of a private public cooperation and and so that encourages other companies with innovative technologies to step forward and get involved in some of this and I guess that opens up all sorts of other you know some people are out there saying well they shouldn't be working with the military well you know well that's a question that I had the this is brings me to a point that I think is kind of important where people always talk about the military budget and how high the military budget is and you know we need to take some of that money and put it in other places and you know maybe some of that military money is not being used to the best for the best good of the human race or maybe maybe some of it but in order to be able to develop stuff that keeps people safer in order to develop all the stuff that you're talking about that could potentially save the lives of soldiers and and even innocent civilians because you're gonna be able to target the correct people all this stuff seems pretty critical right right and it's also there's a you know there's an upside if you want to get you know moralistic about the whole thing to developing advanced technology so you can be more surgical right the drone capability as an example gives you a much better understanding of your target you can avoid the collateral damage you know the deaths of civilians on-site through the use of proper technology and that creates that environment and so it's a good thing and again I mean look let CIA their S&T group over the years the shit that they've developed for operational purposes that then made its way into the commercial sector and planted fitted people what battery technology anybody walking around with a pacemaker or a defibrillator you know in part can thank the the agency because what were they doing they were they were working they continue to work on battery technology shrinking those batteries as a power source what Ischl e operational purposes so you could you know they put a transmitter out some site you know and and you know so what are you doing you're eavesdropping on a hostile target or you know gathering intelligence but then that that effort all that work that was done then that later on benefits the general public a drone technology same thing right I mean the agency was front and center on developing drone capability now what are you doing you're doing that - you know for environmental concerns you know for mining it's so it's I'm a little concerned about drone technology my old house that I used to live at this motherfucker that lived down the street from me to hover a drone over my house and film he's like like I know he's like looking at me like what do you do me swimming you fucking weirdo did you ever go over and talk to him no no should have some drone over his house yeah I was thinking of shooting it down but it's hard to aim up you know you can nowadays bow and arrow yeah you have a good bow like see the way the way you calculate accuracy with archery is you you have a range finder and that range finder has a built-in adjustments for angle this angle compensation for up or for down but I don't know if it has it for straight up in the air like because you got to think the way you you're judging how much an arrow is gonna drop over the course of the flight right right same as a bonus - yeah yeah yeah right yeah but with a bullet obviously it's this less compensation because it's pretty much faster but there's a video that's hilarious of this guy I got tired of this block party in Brazil so he loaded up a drone filled with fireworks and he hovered it over the block party and started launching bottle rockets down on these guys that are making too much noise oh that's excellent though I mean if you think but that sounds like something one of my boys would do and and I'm sure they'll be listening to us at some point so that I'm did they they're going to do this yeah scooter Sluggo and Mugsy butts when you name Sluggo or Mugsy or scooter guaranteed they're gonna do they're gonna do something like that yeah yeah dude it was that when your kid I didn't know it didn't occur to me it didn't occur to me although I wanted to get Moo gene or something I want to give gene I wanted to give him flat tops right every summer I wanna have the same discussion with with with my wife who's the world's greatest person I wanted to give them flat tops and she always says look with names like scooter slugger Mugsy you give him a flat top as well then that's it exactly they're going somewhere but it's you know the best way to take down a drone is is just blanket it jam it and drop it up well you it's like you know it's like the old days of jamming a radio signal basically right well you're interrupting your blanketing and you're interrupting the the data communication from the controller right through the drone and like the drone that was taken down in the Iranian drone that we took down the other you see USS boxer was involved in that out there in the the Strait that's how they do it they don't fire missile at it anymore you know it's just it's much more effective something at it that disrupts the signal right yeah it's just it's essentially again not oversimplified just jamming but is that jamming technology available to civilians to really really smart civilians I guess it could it could be yeah really smart civilians would probably be able to figure that stuff out Jamin yeah anybody let's work on that so yes technology scooters just out at West Point he wants to go to West Point when he's when he's old enough and so he went out there for lacrosse program and I had forgotten have you been to West Point no you got you gotta go it's um it's I know it's a ways away from here it's not a day trip but it's this it's a beautiful campus and I'd forgot about that obviously it's got it is that what Jodie Foster wills in Silence of the Lambs was she in West Point no no it didn't sound right I don't think so the drone kill gun Wow that's Kramer three lightweight compact drone countermeasure drone gun 3000 Jamie ordered me one of those immediately Amazon please yeah that was taken that would have taken you know with care of this guy yeah but the problem is it's not as satisfying as a bow and arrow yes that's a good point that's a good point so one of the things I want I don't know how it's not a smooth segue but we were talking a bit about technology technology is particularly the 2020 election coming up is this idea of deep fakes yes fantastic stuff and the technology to create this nowadays to create a deep fake of which essentially just means you're doctoring a photo or video and making it do what you want it to do to try to convince people of whatever it is technology is advancing and it's stunning what's going on Kyle Dunnigan is Kyle Dunnigan I should know I shouldn't hilarious stand-up comedian but he shines in doing deep fakes and he's working with this other guy I think the guys called dr fakin Stein for the faking yeah yeah yeah one of those guys but go to go to his Instagram and see the new one that he did with Elon Musk he was doing him really kind of crudely with like face with you know face swap or face yeah it's like a little filter that you get from snapchat or something that or Instagram but now he's moved from that to doing this really high-end stuff go to the Elan last one look at this play this after faking stand at this yeah okay labs which is pretty cool it's pretty cool but but but we had a little snafu and it looks like time is slowing down and will eventually start going backwards at increasing rate so pretty soon you will become a baby again and be sucked back into your mother's vagina okay now pause now go to another Kyle Dunnigan video so he can tell what Kyle really looks like that's him to the right of that this is what he really looks like which is fucking madness yeah the guy's hilarious by the way he's awesome guy too and he's got a great Instagram page but his Instagram page is mostly him like the Goldblum so the Goldblum was click on that because that's a normal one this is one he did with the filters without doctor fake it Stein look at that see how it's kind of creepy yeah yeah yeah but play that so Ellen DeGeneres seems friendly blackton but but yeah don't get too close to her she'll bite your fuckin head off just ask the Raptor Liotta ray Liotta's always smokin yeah although he gave it up put it in the videos he's always gonna miss look it's it's bad enough that it's extra hilarious cuz it's bad but the new one that he did with Elon Musk is not bad it's it's not bad like Caitlyn Jenner one go to that Caitlyn Jenner one on the far right that's fucking genius click on this one I have something serious to tell you when you had your surgery years ago I buried your old face in a pet cemetery by accident and I'm sorry to say it's back yeah [Laughter] those are my favorites he has the Kardashians the only that's the only way they talked they just say yum yum and then he knows what they're saying sort of like Groot in guardians of the galaxy I miss these things I well I'm watching the wrong shit on the internet well you're a former CIA guy I should know that you're an important thing I have time for college oh yeah well but this but what you just shown I mean people look at that and I go okay and but that you're right the Elon Musk thing is getting closer to creepy that's a real guy but you could have someone like that say give me a million dollars or I'll blow your house up or just come on yeah and imagine if he gave you know some off-the-cuff financial data on on Tesla know talked about as if he just come out of a shareholder call and now he was releasing some information I mean think about what that means to the all of a sudden the stock price of a company if that happens but the quality is is so far beyond even that now that can be done by and we're talking mostly state actors like like Russia and so the the problem we're facing now is it's not just everybody's kind of kind of aware of you know the the sort of the tweeter verse or whatever Twitter and the trolls that exist on there and the bots and all of that but it's the video the ability to do the video they released one one was done not too long ago with Nancy Pelosi and it all it did was slowed down her speech just slightly but just enough to make it sound as if she was slurring her words maybe she'd had a couple of drinks and that thing was blasted all over social media and people to this day still think and they still talk about it like you know she's kind of losing it a little bit and right and that like her more by the way if she did that yeah just make a little more sense get a little lighten up late yeah we're a hundred million dollars and no one knows why you should have be half their partying I'm sure it was all oh so legit yeah she earned that hundred million dollars mmm for sure there's definitely no shenanigans no no shenanigans no there's nothing like that happening up on Capitol Hill but it's so this this is a it's something that people should watch it's something that people should you know read up on a little bit look at it because the technology is advancing so quickly that the effort to combat it the effort to detect it and there's some companies out there and and certainly the the government is working to do that DARPA and some others are working but the effort to try to identify doctored videos right particularly when you're talking about elections campaigns is is it's going to be an increasing problem that we're not really discussing that much in Congress is paying a little bit of attention to it right now but it's it's really problematic and there's there's things that that you used to be able to look for right lighting and and and noise and just sort of the movements of the face what they call micro heartbeats and and and all the little things is the subject in the video blinking for instance when you doctor it sometimes it the the blinking wouldn't be there now was a tell but the the people involved in all of this in creating these deep fakes are working you know at such a pace that they're getting ahead of that so it's I mean it's fascinating they're coming up with ways to try to counter it but I guess the the biggest point is it sounds like a public service announcement as people need to be aware of it and they need to be smart about course they won't be everybody goes to the internet and they lose their minds and they believe whatever it is that they read that agrees with their opinion sure and there's no bothering of checking you know whether anything is actually legit anymore or not but if that would be my one piece of advice going into 2020 starting now pay attention don't believe anything you see until you prove it and that's part of the problem too right see now if we stop believing anything we see right but if I was a skeptical person right if I was a conspiracy minded individual I'd say but you're not this guy who used to work for the CIA is telling us not to believe the news wait I see what you're saying what I'm saying is setting us up okay well it's time for me to go yeah normal skeptical person want a thing like why is he I guess I guess I'm saying I'm saying it wrong because you're right I don't mean to say I don't mean to imply I guess what I'm saying is trust but verify right when when when you're looking at a video of a candidate or you're looking at anything real shit on the internet now just be aware of the capabilities maybe that's a better way of putting all of this because you're right you don't want that part of the problem and one of the things that Russia does and and others who were involved in this whole propaganda effort one of the things they do want to do is undermine our confidence obviously in media so you know by me saying don't believe what you see I'm kind of feeding into that so you're right I shouldn't I shouldn't go that route be aware of what the capabilities are pay attention everybody should just be a little bit smarter about what they're doing that's all I'm saying so and also what we're looking at now is so much more powerful than what we had three or four years ago three or four years ago this technology was not available for the consumer but now it is well there was I mean you think about it if you not to get too deep but if you think about the photography how long is photography been around there have been efforts to manipulate photography right so so altering photographs has been around almost as long as the the medium itself go to Photoshop that kind of put it all in the hands of the consumer you know what you were talking about Face Swap the new face app to age people yeah all these things make it easier for whoever's got a smartphone to try to do this but what you really and that's a problem as well but one of the things that you really have to worry about is again sort of the state actors like a Russia I mean Russia was behind the faces swamp thing well yeah and that's a good thing right there are Russian companies that are pushing this technology out there and what are they doing you know you every time you do that it's recording data about you well not only that you have to give your name and your email right to get that application and then they have a photo of your face that correlates with your name and your email so what they've done is they've gathered up more than 150 million emails and faces and they have data on people yeah that is that's pretty powerful stuff like if you think about what Facebook is done right what Facebook has made billions and billions of dollars by essentially mining data right that's what they're about Google is the same thing they're mining data well Russia managed to do that with a hundred and fifty million people in a very very short amount of time just by making something cute oh let's see what it looked like what I'm a hundred right now what do you think they're doing with that data they're slicing and dicing this trying to understand the American electorate oh yeah they're gonna they're not gonna stop doing what they did and they've been doing this forever we talked about this before they've been doing this since 1940s right busy trying to keep the u.s. out of World War two before they broke up with the Nazis it was a it was a serious breakup but when they were still aligned they were busy paying off journalists and buying trade unions and all the rest of it so they're never gonna stop what they do because it's worked for them and it's just kind of in their DNA why but it's not also what the United States does as well there's got to be some sort of counterintelligence stuff that we do that is sort of shading well yeah yeah justify appreciate how about that I like that okay that's a good term yeah of course there is and people always do that people you know what I'm talking about if I'm giving a talk about Chinese government's constant theft of intellectual property somebody inevitably will come up afterwards and they will kind of roll their eyes and go well we do it it's not like it's just them the u.s. is guilty of it too well you damn well better hope we are right because if we backed off and said you know what just you know for the sake of being of righteous individual we're not going to do any of this shit you you would have to be with willfully ignorant and naive or just fucking stupid to think that Russia China these other actors out there are gonna stop also right we're all gonna hold hands and unicorns get them flying out of our ass it's not gonna happen so yeah I mean I guess the answer to that is always the same which is yeah you better hope we do it and we better hope we do it well yeah but people are nervous about that right like this is my point about the military budget like if you just caught the military entirely well we're are gonna start speaking Chinese because some shits gonna go down like you can't just cut the military budget you just you can't I mean just cut it out one no no military at all we're gonna focus on ourselves yeah yeah fucking luck with that that doesn't work so the question is like how much money should you spend on the military how much money should you spend on counterintelligence how much money should you spend on propaganda I mean there should be some money spent on propaganda overseas right right because we're trying to manipulate them the way they're trying to manipulate us the idea though is that where America we're nice we're the good guys we're doing it the right way supposedly yeah well there is that right there is that and there's and you know what honestly I'll be honest with you i I've always you know like maybe I'm naive or whatever but that was always my thought process and it's you know when we're out there in the operational world and you think you know what ok she's doing this but we're doing it for the right reason and people laugh at that or whatever but you know this is my phone so you go look at that see that wave that's how I when I open up my phone the flag waves at me yeah I got a flag behind me I'm a half-percent pro-america I got my phone we like this you know what I got I get I got nothing i got nothing i got idea phone - that's some sort of like hack free you phone from the SDS actually a wind-up phone it's a surprise over phone yeah I do have a flip for government yeah and you know I've got a I've got a collection of phones going all the way back to that the cinderblock phone remember that one update you guys fantastic Saudi Arabian numbers on letters I assumed everybody does oh boy yeah that it yeah I think this is you phones that like Erlich hack-proof I know you this phone so you can't use well yeah you certainly know that you know from an operational perspective you know phones are not a good idea now the problem is they're ubiquitous and everybody uses them and it's you know it's made life very easy well it's also made life a little bit less secure obviously I know a guy that is a let's just say done some very unusual journalism and he still has a phone that you could take the batteries out yes he said there's some places where you go well they will not let you in the room if you have a phone and so the the workaround is he has an older samsung phone where he could pop the back off and remove the battery hmm that's the only way yeah I mean that's you know I'd I would still argue there's there's workarounds on that one so yeah but yeah when you go into a government facility you know they don't ask if you know you got to leave your phones outside yeah yeah right so you don't you don't carry your phones and you know unless you're what was her name it was doing that walking into oh the fucking chick from The Apprentice yeah that's tomorrow so that's hilarious is that by the way I know her I did fear factor with her yeah okay she was on fear fact she told me I was drunk cuz I was making fun of her it's like you're drunk like gamma I'm just making fun of you yeah why wouldn't you but she's a she's a unusual person the fact that she thought it was okay to do what is a basically treasonous she was recording these conversations inside the White House and then releasing them to the press how is she not in jail how does that work yeah I'm not quite sure I didn't quite understand how you how you get around that right because you've got obligations you signed pay work you do all these things that say I'm gonna do the right thing and if you run foul of that then you're supposed to suffer the consequences and occasionally it seems like people aren't I don't know what I think what I think she saw some shit and they pulled her aside and they said listen Amuro so I know that you're some sort of a social climber or whatever you're trying to do here but listen what you did will literally get you locked in jail for the rest of your life so how about this how about you just shut your piehole and we'll just let this lock yeah I don't know that she's I don't think anybody would I mean from intelligence perspective she'd be one of the last people you would trust to actually keep her mouth shut already period of time so yeah it's it that's that's a tough one but that was that's it that's also part of the the the issue of leaks as an example right I mean it's the issue of choices that you make for your cabinet as well right well that's true yeah it's good that the close circle around you and that's you know again you can argue I mean we I don't want to get into a political discussion Trump is an unusual character and you know they certainly they tell you I know Wow well that's gonna be there that'll be headlines how about that fella that's from England that looks like the boys yeah I was just there last week when when he went over to Buckingham Palace and you know was asked by the Queen to form the new government he accepted and so you know he's he's an interesting character he went to Eton he went to Oxford he's he's proven himself to be extremely adept at getting getting elected and most importantly he looks like Trump's baby brother yeah yeah you know what I said he's fucked up like Trump's dad went over to England and bang some waitress and bam next thing you know look at the two of them together get the fuck out of here this is my this I got everybody might sent me this one it's a South Park one it's him with a bike helmet on that's the best side better oh yeah I mean literally looks like a young Trump cousin or a brother or something but he's promised you know he's promised they're they're out as far as brexit goes by you know Halloween by 31 October they're done and so the with the whole European Union yeah well that's what that's what they're saying and basically now that what they're concerned about of course is that it's a hard hard exit right no deal but he's saying doesn't matter if that's the case then that's what we've got to do and there's a lot of people it's it's it's interesting the dynamic is a little bit like here in the u.s. right if you're in the Northeast Corridor in Washington New York whatever Boston or you're out here on the west coast and you you you tend to view the world differently than everything else the rest of the mass of the country right which is why people lost their minds and they thought you know how could Trump possibly get elected mm-hmm the UK is a little bit like that that brexit vote came around and everybody in London was convinced that were you know it's giving ninety five percent you know we're not leaving and so when it came time and they devoted to leave in 2001 it was 16 the people in London lost their minds they couldn't believe it and they still to this day I think everybody else is just an idiot right so there's there's a similarities there which is I think why in part Trump Mele feels sort of that this kinship with Boris Johnson hmm but yeah so he's Boris Johnson has said that's it we're out of here you know maybe we can get a deal if we can't doesn't matter we're still leaving and it'll be interesting to see what happens but you know he's not he's not unpopular what's the argument for them leaving what's the pro brexit argument do you really want to have your country your sovereign nation run by a bunch of faceless technocrats living in Brussels who have really zero interest in your sovereign nation right that's at the heart of it it's not an economic decision people always make that that problem with brexit they always say well from an economic perspective this is not a good thing well the deal at heart isn't an economic concern it's it's the issue of sovereignty it's the issue of being run again by Brussels and and and sort of the morass of of regulations that they've imposed the inability for the UK to make their own decisions about trade and so there's a you know there's a good argument in that regard is it going to be a financial problem for them it's not going to be a disaster like some people you know throw out there and say oh my god this is going to you know the UK is going down the toilet fast that won't happen but it'll be there'll be an upheaval if they if they you know leave without a deal but they'll adjust cuz everybody you know people want to do deals right they want to do trade it's not like Germany and in France which are the only two partners in the EU that really matter from you know how dare you yeah I know I can't believe I just so what's the what's the staying in the European Union argument show everybody not racist yeah global globalism you know it's we're all working together and isn't this a wonderful thing and look at you know all the benefits of it free movement and you know that free movement you know didn't really work that well from from France and Germany's perspective you know they don't like to talk about that anymore Fryman is basically what we enjoy in the United States though isn't it I mean if you look at the United States and relative size in comparison to Europe we're basically commensurate right yeah in terms of the contiguous United States exhibit yeah yeah and we all speak the same language but I'm talking about I'm talking about immigration policies I'm not talking about within the EU no no I understand but I mean even in immigration right like the size of these countries in comparison to the size of states like Texas is basically bigger than a lot of fucking right European nations right yeah yeah it's it is that argument sort of the immigration argument much like some of the other arguments comes down from the UK's perspective on don't tell us what to do right and you know maybe there's still an element of look we you know we were an empire that controlled most of the planet for a while you know we'd like to you know have a little bit more say in what we're doing so there's an independent streak the problem is from a use perspective is if they do leave and it's not a disaster then other countries are gonna line up right and and Italy maybe would be the next one so it'll be interesting to see what happens but yeah Bojo as they call them is an interesting cat not unlike our president well it's in this country we don't pay attention to other countries so we see that we see that guy like who's that guy this new guy where do you come from like is this real it's like a new character on a show that you don't watch right right you know what season did he come in better call Saul season four like who the fuck is that guy oh that's the new bad guy didn't watch have been watching I just finished watching I do that I said new shows I end up watching shows that I really liked and I've watched before and it's been a while so every what's the first season of Breaking Bad again that was yeah and then just that first season if that's all people watching they haven't seen it before it's so good yeah but yeah and then I just I just binge watch the first season of The Sopranos again that's a great show that was the first show that really in my mind it created the first real antihero that everybody actually appreciated on television yeah everybody loved Tony Soprano he's a fucking murderer constantly cheated on his wife strangled his best friend he's like I'd like him yeah he's he's an interesting cat yeah well it was that dynamic with his mother right and that was that's what the hook was and then certainly that first season was just that that was fascinating the people and still you know still is speaking of deep fakes remember when they tried to bring the mom back after she died no he liked the shitty CGI yeah that's that's what shows you like the 2005 CGI was goddamn terrible yeah well if you think about when Photoshop Photoshop was out in what the early 90s I guess ladies early 90s you think about where we've come since then not again not to go back into the sort of the this whole thing with deep fakes but it is when people talk about Russia collusion and they talk about we kind of lost our way right and you know everybody's kind of guilty of it whether it's Muller and his investigative team or whether it's Congress or whether it's just the general public we all kind of lost away over the past couple of years imagining somehow that the big story here was Trump's collusion right well that was a political dodge right that was a shell game that was being played on us it was the big story is what did Russia specifically do right what exactly did they do how did they do it how successful were they show us some case studies of specific examples that's what an investigative team should have been doing for two years and then deliver that information and keep throwing it out at the public and keep talking to the public about it I guarantee you the the the GRU and and and others the FSU at the in the Intel services in the in Russia they're happy that we didn't do that right because again they've been in dancing they've been improving their their capabilities they're gonna do it again so I guess that's why I keep beating on this is that I don't think we really focused our attention where we need it to because we all get lost in this political bullshit and wife is yeah I feel like this is the most easily manipulated we've ever been as a as a culture like I think it's so easy to spin these narratives and to get people upset about anything right and there I think I feel like a lot of these are test cases like they're trying to see like what happens when we spin up this story how how outraged do they get at that story yeah well look at and look at this the issue of racism look at look at I mean that that thing gets thrown out there now to the point words it's you know yeah I hate to say it but it's almost losing its its meaning in a sense right they just keep hammering away any anybody they disagree with and I'm talking about the the hard left progressives you're a racist right it's not possible you could possibly disagree on policy like that whatever that's a squad you know AOC and and her compadres I don't give a shit about you know where they're from I care about the fact that their policies from my perspective other people aren't sure love them you know I screwed up and what screwed up about their policies well I'm not a Democratic Socialist right so I I have a problem with everything from you look at the the green new deal right and this idea that we're gonna roll this out and fuck the economic impact we know or I I don't not about the economic impact I think what they're doing is they're just they're playing to a base and they're doing it successfully and people hear about it everybody wants to be righteous everybody wants to think sure if I got care about the environment yeah let's get rid of emissions that'll be a great idea and whether it's that or open borders and the idea that somehow or you know do I think we're running concentration camps down south no I don't think that's fucked up that we would that's the terminology that we would have right for detainment for detainment centers and you know what you want to do what you want to make it better well great let's let's actually do what your job is let's make some changes the to the to the immigration rules and to let's put some more money down there and make conditions a little bit better there's things that we could in terms of concrete steps but we don't we don't seem to want to do that we seem to want to just throw shit around at each other and and III but the open border saying is is is is is worrisome there's a guy named John Norris it was just on my friend Stephen Ellen's podcast it's called the mediator podcast and he's a warden he's a game warden and one of the things that they had to deal with somewhere along the line was they had to become enforcers for illegal drug drug drug marijuana growing these establishments in public lands in national parks so these guys that were supposed to be just catching people with too many trout on their stringer are now being forced to stop illegal grow ops and it's all cartel members and what he's saying is that eighty to ninety percent of all of the marijuana that gets sold illegally in this country in the Midwest and all these different places where it's illegal is coming out of these grow-ops and a lot of it is tainted with dangerous pesticides because these guys are trying to they're actually using poisons to keep animals from eating the marijuana so these kids that are but don't have the fuck is buying it they're buying this pot from these illegal places no one's testing this stuff you don't know what the fuck you're getting in you very well could be smoking pot that's poisoning you yeah this a guy that I know a really good guys is a huge landowner here in California to the point where you can spend all day on an ATV and still not you know get to the end of one of his plots of land and if you call it a plot of land and anyway he's had those incidents right he's had where they it's such a massive piece of property that a small element from a cartel will set up a gross spot there and you know they'll camouflage it it's very well done yeah they bring in the piping for the water because it would pot uses a huge amount of water this guy was talking about water that they brought in they had a pipe that went for three miles yeah he's gonna carry it on their back yeah that's what that's what these guys do and then and then eventually you know you got to go in there and busted up but it's people that stumble across it that you know it's just out there doing their regular ranching job and and it's it's it is fascinating I look I I feel like we should take those guys and reprogram them you get a guy who's willing to carry a hundred pounds of piping on his back and walk eight miles into the backwoods that's a fucking industrious individual you got a you got a lure him away from the cartel with a better deal yeah that guy worked for a competing corporation he'd be like look I like the way you do business right give a job on the ranch on this guy and he's working for Verizon they'd be like hey come on the time three miles of hose on his back that's work that's that's what we call world yeah yeah so use that you use your power for good not evil that's what I tell my boys it's hard though because evils fun I think it's way in the short term it could be more lucrative yeah from their perspective there is that and the record all right so maybe we're not talking about someone you're gonna hire as a landscaper they're your home but but your point is open is you're not a good I open borders not a good idea a lot of bad people that are getting in already and it's not it's not a stretch this is not if anybody imagines this to be a stretcher or it's gonna take offense at this every nation maintains borders every nation maintains some element of immigration controls and and borders protection the idea that we shouldn't have that we should somehow feel exceptionally bad about it is I don't quite understand that mentality we should feel bad when we see someone who's just a poor mother who's trying to come over to America to get a better job because she's stuck in Guatemala and it sucks over there and there's no opportunity whatsoever for her to excel right that's a different animal than someone who is a member of some fucking terrible cartel gang that comes over the question is how do we differentiate and how do we make it so that that woman who's a mom can come over here right how do we make it so it's legal that's the real questions well that's when I wish that but that's not what they're addressing right you know how many decades now have we you know heard about immigration controls an immigration process and regulations and policy and then nothing ever gets done and so it may and again I think one of the things that's interesting about Trump is as strange as as it is the environment I mean maybe the fact that he is disruptive and sometimes doesn't seem to give a shit maybe that's a good thing cuz it gets us talking and gets us talking in areas that we haven't before and in ways that we haven't before so maybe that results in something maybe like the Chinese the public's just gonna wait for him to go and then it will get back to business as usual that may have even business as usual the concern is like if how do you differentiate between someone who's coming in illegally because they want a better life versus someone who's coming in illegally because they're literally going to commit murder and sell fentanyl and deal you know right incredible harm to whatever community they wind up in and they're a member of ms-13 and they're gonna there's both things that are going on at the same time and you're a heartless person if you don't want that lady with a child from Guatemala to come over here and do better and she's probably gonna work as hard if not harder than any good old-fashioned red-blooded American that's over here trying to make their way through this world and why should we be able to have this opportunity when they can't yeah one of the beautiful things about America right it's like if you a poor person and you live in Baltimore you can get your shit together and get out and you can move to maybe Silicon Valley or you can move somewhere where there's more prosperity there's more opportunity and you can get are there poor people in Baltimore I heard there are okay I heard there's um pay attention some sort of uh there's a word what is the word he used infestation infestation of rats infestation yeah you can't use infestation when you're talking about certain neighborhoods people get mad even though he said infested with crime and rats you still you're racist doesn't matter the key here is and it's a democratic talking point right I mean this is a this is a strategy and that's fine both parties use different strategies you know but the the Dems have obviously decided in this period of time because it's so intense there was clearly discussions within wherever the the DNC or elsewhere that this is our policy we are going to push this and we're just you just keep hammering that word racist racist racist no matter what and and it's gonna stick and it and it does yes because you just you you get hit by that hammer and you kind of you're staring into the light you don't know how response sure right so and you think oh my god I'm not a racist but then you know you know you're like senator you're still beating your wife and so it's one of those things you can't you can't answer but I think it's bullshit because it's like calling everybody a Nazi it's you know it loses its its its importance in its in its meaning and and you know anyway it's it's a it's a strange strange time but I think you can do both you can you can take care of that that woman with the kyoto kids and and you can also you know look at the issue of border security right and enhance your ability to understand who's coming across the border right it cost money in it and it requires effort but you can do you can do both I don't I think you can do both but I think the real big picture the real big picture like if you had a look at the solution objectively the real problem is Mexico has a real economic situations that we don't have here in America they're they're far worse off in a lot of the areas and as is Guatemala as is a neighbor El Salvador or neighboring countries are economically devastated until they are not until they come up and until they experienced prosperity you're always gonna have people that are committing crime because they want to try to get by and you're always going to have people that are want to don't want to try to get to America because it's a place where there's more opportunity yeah the real issue the real issue is that it's so much better over here right and that's and that makes sense and you get the same thing with immigration and and movement of people over in Europe coming in from from wherever which is the maximum right which is the brexit argument in part I mean it's not just based on immigration but it's more control of your own nation's security and destiny etc but I think that that's you could argue that national security from a u.s. perspective would warrant improving your ability to impact nations like Guatemala El Salvador wherever in working with Mexico to not just improve sort of the security the liaison that goes on and improving that but you're right I mean working conditions criminal you know our crime and instability that's in our national security I know people get you know they get very upset I said why should we give countries money right well in part you're right I mean sometimes you give them money and goes down some shithole and it doesn't you know and I don't mean I'm not talk about the country I'm just talking literally it goes into a hole and a person gets in corruption right and they absorb it and at the highest levels of government yeah and so there's no there's no controls over how that money is spent there's no there's no metrics to say whether it's spent wisely at the end of the day so you can you but I would argue that yeah I agree I mean it's in our national security interest when we're talking about border security immigration to view that as sort of the top-line issue mm-hmm why are they why are they on the move right well like you said they're on the move because they want a better life because where they're at and good yes how do you work with them and that's you know that's I think people sometimes look at that and think well that's pushing a rock up a hill it's never gonna happen and so maybe they just stop right but we've ignored Latin America Central America South America for decades which is how we ended up in part with with Chavez and you know Maduro have to follow and and some of the horseshit that went on down there because we we ignored it we didn't give it the resources we didn't give it the attention we didn't treat it seriously as a national security concern we were all focused on wherever improving relations on South East Asia or elsewhere so yeah we need to refocus and I think ultimately do we see it immediately no but I think you're right so anyway that's you know I think for people that are just like the foreign policy it is yeah with at least one dude who doesn't know jack shit about foreign policy that would be a good show though but I yeah but I really think in the interest of national security legalizing marijuana federally would stop the profitability of these gang members because you'd be able to have legal marijuana you wouldn't have to be able to you wouldn't need to buy it in these other places you'd be able to grow it yourself and the price would drop through the fucking floor and it would be not profitable for these guys to haul three miles of pipe on their back and into the back country and use someone else's land to make these grow ops and one of the reasons why they're doing this particularly in California I found out is that when marijuana became legal in California these illegal grow ops became a misdemeanor rather than a felony so they they do them over here instead of doing it in Ohio or somewhere else where it's illegal they do and also it's you know you could basically grow year round here I was gonna say from a logistical point of you because if they just made it legal federally this cut the shit we're all grown-ups yeah and there's a tremendous number of issues related to the fact that you know the state and the federal laws don't match up right right and from a law enforcement perspective it's a nightmare and so nightmare yeah I I agree you know what I you know what will happen is I don't imagine that it makes the cartel activity any different that sucking sound that is the revenues from from weed leaving their their accounts will be replaced by something else for sure get in the weed business yeah yeah well yeah I mean although these pharmaceutical companies that are fighting against it as well as these prison guard unions which is really crazy that's the darkest one to me it's not the pharmaceutical companies look I get it they're just creeps that are looking at their bottom line that every business wants to constantly have new growth every year they want to constantly be making more money I get it it's like this universal eternal growth model that they operate under but the prison guard unions when you find out the day lobby against the legalization of marijuana is so insane what does that I didn't know they just want more people in jail yeah so they have jobs that's the idea behind it it's it's the most unamerican thing possible you want more people in jail so that you could have a job looking over those people you basically it's it's sickening yeah that's that's a new one to me I had no idea they guard unions yeah yeah in a nutshell god fucking christ yeah private prisons is is something that you know and there have been I mean again I'm with this current administration you know there's been some prison reform issues that have been making their way through right they've been actually focused on it to some degree maybe the Kim Kardashian champion of people that are wrongly incarcerated really is I want to show you something I'm like dr. Kim K I'm like one of the I'm like a crazy crazy grandfather clips newspaper articles out but in preparation for the show I know most people think I do no preparation whatsoever I know rhinos guys I still do too I love the newspaper I do as well thank you look at this colleges offer degree in courses in the pot business good move yeah yeah so this is probably two now did you know that pot is a teaching podcast I know two people that have gone back to school for that no no four oh yeah yeah it's crazy University of Maryland and Cornell that's the two that this article talks about well the biggest sponsorship that the UFC is ever gotten ever is this Aurora company in Canada that grows wheat CBD and marijuana they have football fields fill with Mead and you know the highest possible standards the best quality no pesticides herbicides no bullshit yeah super pure and the CBD which is fantastic for everybody's health and I just I'm back when I first started working for the UFC there were people that work for the organized organizations that didn't like it that I spoke pot they like what is he doing yeah well I mean it's I will tell you this as a rapport of nothing I gotten calls a couple of calls from people in the industry who are saying and the only reason they're calling me is they're saying can you hook me up with Joe it's like we hang out together all the time of course writing because we're always always hanging out in the pool together Joe and I but so I said don't look dude that's not my it's not my job but they want you know what they want from me you know what I think they just want to pitch you on business you want to bring some spooks in here and fucking case the joint yes spooks you gotta be careful using that word though cuz people think you're racist yeah that was a racist term in the 70s well we did a black folks I worked on a show for in the UK an espionage drama show that ran ran for eight or nine C seasons and it was called in the UK was called spooks it was about their Intel operation and it ran for a long time but then they sold they brought it over here to the states and I think it was on some channel and but they had to change the name it changed the mi5 which is the name for the domestic security service because they were worried about the term exactly but a CIA spooks has always been mean it's always been around the idea is that the sneaky people right are doing creepy shit there is no there is no creepy shit I hear being done you say what I mean I'm here to tell you right now and you can write this down I'm gonna write it down right down there is no reaping no creepy shit do not be what's going on with Iran caught a bunch of people that they are claiming our CIA informants and they may execute them yeah yeah they've done this before they've made this claim before and look Iran is a that a couple of parts of this that's one of the heaviest lips in the business has been Intel collection on Iran over the years I'm not talking about just recently but over the years it's been it's been very difficult they are extremely buttoned up over there and they have an incredible level of control over their population and then which is you know at some point you would think well maybe the population is going to object to this but you know it hasn't happened yet and so part of it is they came out with this having 17 individuals that they claimed were cooperating with the CIA in some fashion or another and they you know they claim that they were fairly high level individuals the IFA I don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths I don't believe them at all I think they've they've they've got a long long track record of lying about a variety of things and so you know why would they come out with this you know perhaps they're cracking down and it doesn't hurt to come out and if you're going after some of these individuals anyway why not put them put the paint brush on them that they're working for the CIA and and that will appease some of the population there um so I don't know I I'm again I'm not buying it it has been a difficult Intel task and and collecting intelligence on on their efforts with with their ballistic missiles their nuke program as well has always been has always been problematic but again they've done this before where they've talked about how we've wrapped up CIA spying Network and it's it's kind of war shit it's just their propaganda i well yeah i mean i you know i yeah i that would be my take on it I don't know what I mean I'm not I'm not internal I'm not inside and and so you know is it possible sure we've had we've had networks wrapped up before by other countries Cuba the Cuban Intel service years ago right which was completely built by the Russians by the way by the old KGB they owned an operated the Cuban Intel service for a long time still do they at one point wrapped up pretty much everybody we had on island mhm and and other people did we have over there three no we had you know I don't I don't remember the numbers but it was it was a few yeah let's just say it was it was it was not good and they they had done a very good it was from a from a counterintelligence perspective it was a pretty impressive effort so it's happened Rush's you know done the same when we've usually went with Russia usually when we've got a traitor or a mole you know somebody like Robert Hansen Jim Nicholson Howard the Americans oh yeah from what I understand it's a good show it was a show based on the idea that at one point time there was a Russian family that had come over here and infiltrated and became American citizens and seemed like you know Joe and Mary next door right but really they were Russian spies you don't had an aunt and uncle named Joe and Mary it's weird that you would say that I literally had Nana named Joe and Mary got some intel on you buddy yeah there was you know there was a story the reason the Americans was was created was written as do a lot of things do based on some smart writer who sees an opportunity because he reads a newspaper all right years back 2011 I think it was we had a sleeper cell that we wrapped up in Jersey no no it was there yeah that's what just takes place right and there was that one that the hot one remember everybody rushing right and so ring him over and then you look at anything and they've had yeah I mean we could I think she's forgetting what her name was if you're a fat fucker in your lawn and she walked over storge yeah got high heels on yeah wearing nothing but that's all not so much there's something about her look I know there's some better knows the integration ever knows yeah no she's hot yeah you don't think that not there no that's not a good shot one update check and she's never any makeup now that's true that imagine hurry up yeah put a little tartar up East European chess liner on her she'd be a chick catches you with a couple of Jack downs and you got trouble oh my gosh she walks across when you're mowing the lawn and you're right so she and a bunch of other people lived in in Jersey in the suburbs and their whole reason for being with just a spot people right it was it wasn't they were not you know these were not the heads of the the organization right so their job is spot people live there be you know social meet people that might be of interest maybe it turns out that somebody in the PTA where your kids go to school maybe somebody's working for Raytheon er they're working for some you know interesting companies that's what they do so that's their job their job was basically the spot and then you've got other people in that chain of events who are a little bit higher up the food chain who then assess right and we'll look at that person and go yeah there's maybe there's something that this person works for whatever company and and you know that'd be it could be it doesn't matter what the company is by the way could be Qualcomm could be you know think of one that because the application could be Corning could be anything and there's all sorts of companies out there that that have applications that may be of interest from an Intel perspective for it for a hostile state so then you know they do a little assessment and maybe they come away and go yeah yeah that person's interesting job let's develop a little relationship there now maybe one of those individuals will work on that relationship or maybe that somebody else will come in you know within this there's this group and they'll develop a relationship and then you know maybe they'll task the person so maybe you say the guy works at a tech company and you know you're gonna think okay I want to see if this person has any weaknesses you know how you know can i leverage anything here and so what you'll say is you know my kid you know it's doing this school paper it's on you know something and uh okay I can't you know hey they're just not getting in it or they're not doing the research or whatever hey do you have anything you know and you're not asking for anything classified you're just saying look you work in a tech company you know don't you have something that would be of interest you know my kids got to write the stupid paper and and you're not looking for anything of Intel value you're looking to see whether they'll accommodate you will they actually come back and go yeah well you know what we got this and it's kind of interesting and it's this you know research paper that's you know been out in the press for a long time but yeah it's interesting hey you know hands it over you got something right now you got something that you can see that they responded to a little task and then you set the hook a little bit and then you just keep on working on that so in the meantime they're calling back to the KGB and saying we have got who work with Raytheon write notes information just and they say it just like that that very accident they keep jobs and everything so they work to go to work everybody go to work maybe they don't maybe they're a spouse you know stay-at-home spouse well what do they do they hang out with other stay-at-home spouses and create friendships because of kids and the next thing you know you're all having dinners with each other and you know you look you like that Russian broad she's banging everybody right well no you wouldn't do that that would be a very disruptive thing to do in that community right and that's the premise of the Americans I've seen the show yeah I watched one banks people I watched I watched about half an hour of the first episode and the Knights get angry no no I just sit there and I get I'm a very hard person to watch shows like that with and so so my wife was like I just can't no you can't you can't sit because it's like yeah tell me I'm going like but it was good I understand it was good show with the show where people play pool no I really play pool my yeah yeah I was just in the UK and boy I tell you what I turn on the TV and there's a snooker match ah yeah I'm in there snooker I'm in there right I'll just sit and sit and watch snooker in there oh my god but it's also it's one of those things where either you can sit and watch it like golf or you can't and I just happen for some reason I've got some defect that allows me to sit and watch a billiard match have you ever played it's tough it's hard really yeah yeah we have a pool table at home that the boys have become pretty damn good at which is a skill a life skill but yeah billiards is well pool is no heart Nucor is way harder yeah it's way harder they they excel in American pool I don't think any American player has ever gone over there and excelled in snooker I don't believe so yeah yeah maybe something for I know guys I'm tried but I don't think anybody's succeeded but there's been a ton of guys from England yeah that have come over here and they do very well on the American pool tour yeah but you know what we do better on is bowling we do we kick the shit out of them when it comes bowling yeah but that's an American thing well yeah there you go do they Bowl come over here and Bowl no I don't I don't know I don't thinks I don't think of this but there's been that migration just weekly stupid sport yeah and they get really mad when I say that x-man you fuck no I'm not they were all in a ball at these things you have to pick them back up again have you ever bowled sober I don't think I've ever bowled so yeah I bowl with my kids always sober my kids love bowling yeah and they put up the little bumper things so it doesn't go in the gutter so you cheatin yeah so you can just basically whip that fucking thing down there 100 miles my thrill is to hear that what's up for me give them an edge yeah you know don't let them would you let your kids on the floor do you let your kids win yes yeah all the time but I did get a hamstring injury because I didn't let my kid beat me in a race how old she's 11 okay I was rough but I was running out knew something was going on like who cares pushed through she's not winning my fucking hamstrings hurt my my middle boy Sluggo plays basketball that's all he wants to do day and night and he's a bit like the sort of like the Rain Man of basketball too so in terms of facts figures characters yeah he can go back to Jerry West and and and he'll tell you about Bill Russell's career anything but he loves basketball he's you want to play professionally yes he does yes well I'll tell you you know it doesn't look like it but in in a deep fake video I look about 6 foot 10 but what I like 6:1 that's quite six yeah you have to get that kid on growth hormones yeah well but he that's all he does he plays and he just constantly and he just all he wants to do is play and so he's got to the point where you know for a long time I would just we'd go out we got a court at home and I'd play and and I kind of let him and it gets to the point where I can't really beat him I've got an ID on him right right but his handles are extremely good no and so and I'm not the fastest kid on the block anymore and so it's gotten to the point now where he's legitimately beat me a handful of times and it's very embarrassing because he doesn't really have an edit button so he he just rubs that shit right and it's like it's like it's like the lion king when scar wants to take over right he's just like that was pretty good wasn't the lion king a difference it's a good reference yeah so anyway yeah don't let him do that though it's an exercise for you in patience so when he's talking shit that's how I look at it my kids talk shit if they beat me I just go okay go ahead yeah shit yeah and that's like you can't can't let it be personal no no I treat it like almost like an Internet heckler yeah kids are allowed to hit me full blast so Mike my kids take martial arts and I let them not the oldest woman oldest ones 22 she'll fuck me out yeah yeah but the the young ones I let them tee off on me they they're allowed to full blast leg kick me they can hurt me yeah they'll hurt you yeah but I want them to be able to feel what it feels like to actually hit a person yeah cuz when you're sparring in martial arts class you're not allowed to like hit people that whole blast just kind of touch them you know and so I let them just fucking slam shins into my thighs and I teach them how to turn it over and dig the really dig that bone into yeah that's good that's that's actually really good sometimes though but we have the same problem with my boys because they they're fairly competitive and they're they're aggressive and you know I keep telling my said look getting punched in the face isn't good and you know until you actually do well you know they've gotten some in this um I was gonna say 50 cups I don't know if you could say that you okay yes together dying yeah we're continuing to talk over there and he's yeah has a hard time with water but but yeah it's it's hard to teach your kids you know what that's like right and you know at some point you know maybe they they go through that they're the youngest one broke his nose courtesy of the older the old one so Mugsy got his nose broke in a contest with with the older one the oldest one scooter and and he found out that's no fun the thing is though that kid's gonna be the tough one yeah the kid that it's always the youngest ones like you see in the UFC when there's older brothers and younger brothers the older brothers Jenn and generally pick on the younger brothers and the younger brothers once they reach adulthood almost always can fuck up the older brother yeah yeah it's really weird yeah I was I took a lot of beatings when I was younger because I'm the youngest of four boys and so yeah I but it's yeah it's good it's good stuff and I got it's there's this it's constant entertainment all right I mean you know what it's like you know with kids there's always something and I'm sure right now people are going oh my god he's gonna start talking about kids again at length and they got gonna do that yeah cuz the kids names are so cartoonish yeah I know well part of the reason why they get mad yeah as they are but anyway so what we talked about Russians yeah okay it's what it like I like I'm I'm like Uncle Joe here I've cut out some some shit to talk about a deep fakes we talked about that okay okay well uh I wrote down some notes to my god I was prepared for you I've never been prepared for your show before and you know why did you decide to get prepared this time you know why because because you've got you've got some really great guests well no not really but viewers and listeners I mean I was trying to the people that follow this show I find to be really fascinating I get a lot of feedback and I feel like you know I yeah I should pay attention that I should I should prepare a little bit because there's a lot of interest right and some of these things that we talked about and you know so well sometimes I go out and I wing it you know and to be fair on new segments I just make shit up now I don't I don't do that I know you wanted to talk about wah wah wah wah wah way which i think is a really fascinating subject to me and a lot of people that are tech inclined because they are at the tip of the spear when it comes to technological innovation in the cellphone space yeah and I know that they're doing that with in regards to modems and a bunch of other things as well but it appears at least and a lot of companies are exclusively using their 5g modems as 5g rolls out oh yeah yeah but it appears they're they are involved in some serious shenanigans and they have deep roots with the Chinese government they do they claim they don't they claim look were independent we would never do whatever the Chinese authorities say think about that sentence think about a company with the global reach of Huawei of that importance to the Chinese state and think about them saying trying say with a straight face we wouldn't we wouldn't do you know things that the Chinese government might ask us to do a real Chinese company and you said that you meant it they would exactly like you won't yeah you would not be in business for that long or there would be a change in the senior management of the business so and who always been caught out they've been caught out in Europe to the degree where at a certain point you think Germany and others that are deeply involved with Huawei now in terms of the 5g infrastructure where they've just made this decision look it's financially better for us to work with Huawei and we can set aside the security risks they're literally made that decision yeah that was reading an article about that very recently that they've just decided to have some sort of a risk to reward conversation and the risk is worth the reward right right and so you know that's that's their calculation from a u.s. perspective because we are you know because there's two essentially two superpowers now right I mean in China's you know advancing and and we're not the lone superpower on the stage anymore and so we are the number one target and you know our calculation has to be different so we've been going at it and I know everybody I think it's been it's been pretty well covered it didn't used to be covered very well but it's been pretty well covered over the past couple of months and now what's happening is we've been in these trade negotiations with China and I think unfortunately I think the current administration the Trump administration is going to blink and I think there because Huawei is such a huge issue for the Chinese and the idea that we would prevent our companies from selling into or purchasing from or dealing with and that we would have sanctions on other countries that that do they view that as such a threat to their own interests and their own future that Huawei is front and center with any trade deal so they're looking they're not doing any trade deal unless we make concessions on hallway and I have a feeling that Trump administration is going to make those concessions because from a political perspective they want a trade deal right so far they've actually said to Google that Google is gonna stop using the Android operating system for the Chinese phones for huawei's phones at least they're going to not let them license out the so Huawei's actually been at least rumored to be in production of their own operating system which would mean they would have to have their own not just operating system but they did have to have their own eco systems and they'd have to have an app store they'd have to have all that all the jazz that we have today when you if you sign up for you buy an Android phone you have access to the Google Play market which is this huge resource of applications and as soon as you take that away you've got to kind of rebuild that whole thing from scratch right right well I did wai-wait doesn't lack anything in resources you know they'll be fine you know because it's either the state will provide and ensure that they have the resources they need they also you know we're the outlier here right I mean we've been working with New Zealand in the Canada and and you know the UK to some degree but the UK has been you know they've been kind of pushing back a little bit on this idea that we're gonna isolate while we I don't think that's gonna happen so they're using Huawei devices to some degree yes they've been slower to adopt and and and kind of mesh their infrastructure with hallways for people here for people don't know what we're talking about could you please just lay out what's the concern what do they think that Huawei is doing Huawei is essentially what's it did the way to put this would be imagine a communications network that spans the globe and Huawei builds and provides gear and certainly going into 5g they're a leading provider and so and then financially they they can offer countries much better deals than than other providers but they are an intricate part of that communications web so if you imagine that Huawei is a state-sponsored entity and will respond to Chinese authorities requests for information or intelligence that's passing through this communications web around the globe our our business communications our military communications intelligence communications that that all kind of go through at some point this interconnected system that's the problem because they are essentially building backdoors into that system that allow them to suck communications out of that network and use it for their own purposes it's a great intelligence tool right so if you think about it in a way basically that's it's a it's a an advancement on the idea that you are wiretapping somebody or you know you've created a bility to intercept some communications right they link themselves with the EU or what happens we've got military communications right with the EU our military talks to the EU military and and and we've got NATO concerns and everything so if if there's an element in that infrastructure that touches in and has a door that opens to some walkway gear right then the danger here is and they've they've had backdoors discovered in the past and then while we put sands up and go home we didn't know that was there will correct it and then it turns out they don't correct it and then you know oh sorry about that you know they don't did they honestly don't give a shit they I when I say how aggressive they are in terms of sucking up information I can't overstate it right and so this that's why it's a problem for us is because you know if we if we convince Australia and and you know the five eyes nations New Zealanders and you know there's not to work with Wow way and then say Canada you know which is willing to do a deal well we've got seamless communications infrastructure with Canada so all of a sudden the fact that they're doing business in huawei but we're not we're still at risk we're still in jeopardy because that information is still flowing to some degree where it's accessible to hallway and their ability to get it so I you know again I know and I know people listen to that and they go uh why is that of any concern well it's a concern because used to be in the old days it was a you know it was us in the Russians Soviet Union Russia's you know I got that GDP of a small he you nation China is is on March they they they view themselves in a certain fashion that's why they're pushing out in the South China Sea they've been building up their military they've been doing deals all over the the world for rare earth minerals - you know - labor just access to naval ports doesn't matter what it is they've been busy doing that because they view themselves at the top of the food chain now I guess we could say well okay fine maybe it's their turn or something but that's not how I view the world I didn't mean we can either be on top or we can you know be sucking wind and so he goes back to that one of those early questions you asked is how much do we spend on defense how much do we spend on an Intel how much do we spend and whatever it may be and I think the answer is that's where intelligence comes in you have to know what the opposite the hostile nation is doing you have to know what the competitor is doing it's like in business then you have to spend enough to stay ahead of that right even if it's a small amount you got to stay ahead you got ahead and it's it behooves us not to fall behind that's never a good thing I know we don't always do things right but as a nation the world is much better off with us sort of at that and this is gonna sound wrong to a lot of people they're gonna think oh my god that's terrible but with us at the top we're more altruistic maybe they don't know that's the word or not but I think word yeah so anyway so I that's that's my view a lot of people say bullshit but you know everyone's got different experiences you know well is there a way to detect like when they really say if they would release a huawei phone and which is a really really interesting that just a few years ago Huawei was not even a major player by any stretch of the imagination now it's the number two cell phone provider in the world passed Apple which is incredible when you consider the fact that they barely have a foothold in the American market they very few people buy their phones and if they do buy their phones they buy unlocked phones from overseas yeah it's really kind of crazy but is there a way where they could detect whether or not there is a backdoor in these phones I mean or is it something where they could develop it to the point where you really would have no idea no we can we stay pretty well you know that you'd yeah it's a good it's a good question but I would say that as long as we can what we're doing in terms of counterintelligence and and tech advances and efforts in in cyberspace and elsewhere and certainly in communications hardware to stay ahead of potential hostile activity I think we're we're okay we we were good at detecting problems we're good at identifying weaknesses in in these systems the problem is again it's a global community we can't isolate ourselves in terms of communications infrastructure just doesn't work so if you know it's like a chain and a weak link yes I gave that analogy good yeah thank you I made you all the weakest link you are exactly so yeah it's I mean anyway that's why way and I do think that it the interesting part will be what does the administration do in their desire to get a trade deal are they willing to blink on this because they put their foot down right and now because we're so dysfunctional here in the States from a political perspective now you've got people like Chuck Schumer going well you know Trump better not blink on this this is important so suddenly Chuck Schumer is a hawk on protecting us from from you know Chinese espionage right and but simply because you know he sees as a political opening here you know if Trump backtracks on hallway now hey good from the Democratic perspective they can use that to bang on him you know so it's all it all comes down to politics but but this is something that people didn't even understand was an issue like good nationally this is something no one was even aware of until a few months ago and when I started reading about it one of the first things that I was reading about was you know I'm kind of a technology nerd and so I was fascinated by some of their newest phones which were really far advanced to what you're getting offered in the United States yeah and a lot of that ability to create in record time comes from the natural fire electoral property yeah and that's how they over the years again that was a that was a collective decision by the authorities there that this is how we're going to advance right we they looked and they make a calculation that says we can't afford the wait decades while we do our own research and development you know well let's let's just take it and Huawei is not the own only Chinese phone manufacturer ones over there but they're the only one that seems to be banned what's that other ones ami what there's it's quite a few there are but Huawei has been because of their size there and their connection to the government and because of the resources that the government has been willing to to provide to them the advantage that they have and the speed with which they were able to kind of embed themselves into other nations telecommunications infrastructure that's why they're so important right but the general yeah the you know are there other companies we well of course yeah I mean there's a variety of companies we should be worried about from that perspective and it's not look to be fair I spent some time on China because it's just you know the number one state you know sponsored perpetrator of theft of intellectual property but you know there's those other countries involved in it they copy entire cities which is really insane you seem like they have a fake Paris over there yeah yeah I know well you know they've got you go some of these places and looked and in Chinese history culture is fantastic right and I've been over there in times and I'm just like marveled at how you know how interesting the people are how friendly they are I mean they look there's a lot of wonderful things about China but I'm just saying the authorities right the government policy of no rule of law of the no protection when it comes to intellectual property all these things and their aggressiveness and stealing information that's the problem but China as a country is a fascinating place so that was I don't know why I said that that's just my it is a fact yeah it's very very very very very old which is something that we totally understand that was a five varies you think about like when you look at the history of China it's really it's amazing yeah it goes back so far when you look at this country it's a couple of hundred years and that's it I know yeah we come across a house that's hundred years old and someone slaps a historical yeah you can't suddenly can't do anything to it and we face that in the past well I know a guy who's got a house that was built in 20s and they have a historic thing on the 1920s it'll be soon it'll be the architecture of the 60s that we want to protect you yeah probably plastic over couches yeah oh that was that was a good thing right you know and nobody wanted to sit on those in the summer but what do you think is going to happen you really think the government's going to cave and they're gonna give in - yeah I think so because I think they really they they definitely want a trade deal in some capacity and China's not going to blink on this right they'll they'll figure out how to how to kind of bear the burden of the tariffs and and make things work on you know for them disagree much gets built over the a - I mean all the Apple stuffs getting built over there now and there was just a recent story where Tim Cook was trying to get Trump to back down off of some tariffs because you know we're gonna have a 25% tariff on some apple products that they're building in China yeah yeah and it's the idea that look it's not the idea that you can Wow Huawei revenue Trump's 23 percent despite us crackdown yeah because look over it seized their phones are gigantic they figured out you know Samsung made a huge disastrous mistake with their Galaxy fold no no I know but right over the foldable phone well they have a mate X that apparently is way better than the Galaxy fold it's a better design and it's viable works yeah Samsung's an incredible company and it's it's got an amazing history of innovation and technology but but you're right they have had a couple of they've had a couple of missteps the fold wasn't the only one that they had a miss no seven that's low right that's a product right when you get a phone that explodes that's not necessarily what you want in a communications device what Jody point out of Y way mate X it's not as good as said where's design changed just a few weeks before the release well what's wrong come out yet they just does not change the I don't know yeah but it doesn't mean it's not better Y saying means it's not better the people that have tried it if said it's better he's just saying it's last-minute tweaks animation the head of the antenna released in September an additional sensor appears have been added to the phone's camera module that's to find out where you live exactly yeah I wasn't mean it's not better Jamie not yet so how would anybody know the people that have reviewed it there's people that are reviewed it all the tech sites were written they just changed you just don't know yeah well they just retweet the sensor yeah talking shit over there but it wants you to go back to coughing on water are you anti hallway no no they did use the like a name - like a license tip for their camera I don't think that they're using like Leica cameras no they're not it's like uh I've used it I use it at CES like three years ago I thought they use like your cameras for the the main pro or whatever they use the name but I don't believe that it's it's not I mean it might be a like a sensor but it's like a very it's a microchip it's compared to the the one I have in this camera that's expiry of course it's very different you know a camera but I mean I think these Leica lenses right or like something good but can we get to the bottom of this I was super interested in and I was trying to tell us like what are they using about this name there's a photographer I follow that was promoting it and I was like it just seems like they're using the name is all but I couldn't tell it you don't know they're not right I couldn't tell but as a photographer I couldn't I could like all you're using is the name this isn't a better photo it's not doesn't have the value at the lichen well that's good they have some pretty spectacular camera so Jamie I mean there they had the very best ever night-vision camera not night vision but night sight like the ability to take photographs at night and it looks like pull-up huawei night photograph examples because Google pixel 3 is the second best one but at West one is supposedly the Huawei that the zoom came out a couple months ago people were saying that that was bullshit which was that it was like I had a super zoom technology lens that people were someone what was that's real but who said it's no way that that's real photographers photographers reviewers people that are using the do this stuff and said but they weren't using this though they were just one thing has improved one thing has been proven that Huawei has taken some photographs and said they were taking on a Huawei phone and they were actually taken on a very high-end yeah a very high-end camera oh also Huawei posted some stuff on Instagram from iPhones couple two got caught a couple times doing that which is also quite hilarious but yeah it's a it's a sneaky business and if if that's how they're going to do they're gonna get in through the backdoor and get information through phones and modems and and it may not be you know it's it may not be something that they worry about now in terms of access I mean people say well why do they want the access now they just want to know that they can I mean imagine a conflict in the future where they have that ability right either to real-time monitor communications through this network that they've been able to build trapdoors into you know or to impact the flow of communication more aggressively more proactively to to do things it's you know it's it's like it's like mapping out our infrastructure right the testing the probing that goes on of our of our electrical grid it's an example I mean that's just planning for the future in the event that something bad is going to happen if there's gonna be a conflict you know they want to know as do we I mean again to your point that you know hopefully we're doing the same stuff and so yeah it's something else interesting when you talk about China though is and and you think about okay what should we be watching and we touched on Russia a little bit is the alliance between possible alliance between Russia and China and it's an interesting dynamic you know traditionally Russia trying to have them been together they've always been some areas of concern you know distrust but there are signs there are things happening that appear as if China and Russia have made a strategic decision to align themselves closer and that would be because they've made that determination that somehow it's in their best interests of it you know and not necessarily that it's going to be that way for any long period of time but right now in the current environment you see Russia acting as if what they want is a stronger alliance military alliance and political alliance economic alliance with China and it's it's it's an interesting dynamic that we need to be watching we need to be aware of and part of that is you know people again this this idea that you know there was this Russia Trump collusion and thinking okay well that's good except our relations with Russia have been this bad in a long time so maybe it's all a very clever mind game that they're playing because they're closely aligned but I don't think so so we've actually laid on more significant sanctions on Russia we've attacked them from an energy perspective in terms of our ability to create our independence you know particularly from from natural gas that is damage to Russia's abilities so I think there's reasons why they're gravitating towards China right now but this idea that somehow Trump is super friendly and is a useful idiot of Putin it doesn't doesn't play out when you look at the reality of the relationship between the two countries that whole Russian collusion thing is a very confusing narrative because on one hand you have the Democrats who are saying without doubt there's Russian collusion and then the other side you have the Republicans and say the Mueller report essentially exonerated Trump from being a part of any sort of Russia inclusion I don't think either one is totally accurate I think there's a lot of like weird gray yeah both narratives I I think that the Democrat narrative is easier to understand it just makes sense from their perspective why was how he wanted why wouldn't we push that to this day they're just still amazed that they lost and so there must be some grander reason why because we just how clearly we couldn't lose to this guy right so and it was also a talking point much less you know let's hit everybody with the racist hammer it's a talking point and it's worked for them over at least the first couple of years on the on the on the Republican side look the Russians knew what they were doing right they were fucking with the election on several different levels it wasn't just trolling through the internet it wasn't you know just placing stories that they could it wasn't just trying to film it you know a divisive miss and discontent it was also doing these little dangle things you know or they're you know they were looking to see a word I think in a byte what are they gonna do you know I mean you think about that Christopher Steele dossier it was a piece of shit I mean if we saw that in in the commercial side of things you know I've got a business and global intelligence and and and research and security that thing was just - there was nothing it was shot full of holes right and so you think well what's he should have asked tell me about your sources you know why are your sources talking what would you know you've got a anytime you've got a piece of intelligence right you got to a few basic things you know where to come from see any people you have to steal da C it was all about yeah it was basically just look they were going after opposition research political opposition research right so Christopher Steele who was a you know a paid hired consultant used to be with British intelligence not you know not a James Bond type but you know a decent enough by all accounts a decent enough guy but he entered the world of private sector information gathering right and I've got a company that's whether we do all around the world and and you you can't relax your standards just because you're now in the commercial sector right when you get a piece of information you need to test that piece of information and one of the first things you need to do is understand what's the sourcing for it and why did why did they have access you know how credible are they what's their track record and why by the way are they providing this information and how did it eventually you know make its way to this report and those are the sort of simple things that whether you're a corporation that's gathering intelligence about a market that you may enter with a you know an investment or whether you're still in the business and you're an Intel officer and you're you know talking to a source that works in some foreign ministry somewhere you got to be able to you know stress test the intelligence and then it shit wasn't done people people liked what they saw they saw negative information about the the candidate and just run with that shit right and the more times you it's like it's like the old wmd reporting that came out of the early days in Iraq the more you repeat it even if it's one source and that sources is a piece of shit when you repeat it people are gonna buy it alright so right conclusion conclusion you just keep repeating that and it's gonna happen at some point it'll happen but anyway so but it seems like Russia definitely likes to disrupt our democracy absolutely and they wouldn't steal an ax fit well part of it is in in the old days it was sort of a struggle for supremacy in the world right i mean that was that's kinda its core that's what it was right and their ability to chip away in faith into democratic institutions was at the core of a lot of the crap that they pulled and it still is I mean so that's all the when you're talking about a propaganda effort like the the screwing with the last election what's their goal when their goal isn't necessarily it that's where they you know do they care whether one Canada or another wins well maybe maybe they do right but you'd be hard-pressed to argue that you know they were working against a Hillary Clinton who had said you know we want to have a reset and you know and have a new relationship with Russia and work with them I mean maybe they looked at Trump and thought yeah that's the guy we want to work with but over that the more important issue was in just chipping away at Americans belief and democratic institutions get us all so that we question the credibility of a democracy and that's then the fundamental belief for propaganda efforts within the old KGB and now the FSU and and and so it's it's you know it's as simple as that in a way and it worked look at this you know we've spent years now just bitching at each other and yelling and screaming and complaining and we bought into it because we all like we talked about before we you know we're easily duped you know and and I don't know how you get around that I don't know how we walk that back maybe we don't but I think it's an informed public that that helps to battle this but we haven't we lost sight of what was important here and that is and so I think the public needs it's their responsibility you like this yeah you like where you live then you gotta make an effort to try to keep it right and and part of that is being an informed public and understanding what the hostile elements may be out there you know without being paranoid but just understand why they're doing things in the way that the world operates you know and and you'll always have that group of people that you know don't buy into any of that bullshit and think it's all just we should all be holding the hands yeah that's a that's that's a fun one that's fun there it's a good narrative it's a happy narrative yeah right when you've talked to people that have seen terrible things that take place all around the world that narrative is hard to swallow like when you read about these gang members coming in and growing pot and fucking shooting at people and they've had these high-level task force just to deal with these cartel members that are growing weed right and this is that's just one part of what they're doing right that's just human trafficking and everything else that they get involved in extortion and all which is probably the scary shit yeah yeah and that's it and that's that's what you have to worry about if you if you have push them out of the market because you legalize everything which you know I assume that's kind of the direction we're going then do they fill that gap again from a revenue perspective with fentanyl or something else whatever the next choice is how do you stop the infiltration how do you stop the gang members are coming in here I mean how do you do that other than eliminating them other than having some sort of a tactical registration well that seems like the only operation that would make any sense in my mind yeah well it's like jihadism you can't kill your way out of it right it doesn't mean you shouldn't make a good-faith effort but it's for the further for the drug control for the narcotics counter narcotics part of it is what we talked about also about working with the other governments right we've had some success in doing that well you'll work with the Mexican authorities you work with Colombians or out in Southeast Asia you know to try to you know push on the back on the heroin trade and so you work through them to some degree but that's tough right that's corruption yeah so much corruption and that's and that's that's the problem and it's and it's unsatisfying because you don't see an immediate return sometimes and it's and it's also it's uh sometimes seems like it's just a big you know bottomless pit and while you're tossing money right and effort and resources but it's something that has to be done doesn't mean you shouldn't still do it but it is I mean corruption in in a place like Mexico right whether people just don't have any faith in the institution's because they've lived in this system for so long where all the officials in their minds anyway are corrupt the police are corrupt the federales are corrupt you know the Marines down in Mexico probably the most trusted institution because they're not viewed in the same vein they're not viewed as corrupt but only the Marines well yeah pretty much I mean that's it which is it's it's odd but it's it's a it's a large organization and they've been able to kind of stay above the fray to some degree which is interesting I have no idea but it's it you know it's been the perception and just for the most part it's it's true when you work down there often enough you do get that impression but it's how do you get rid of that endemic corruption in that society and turn that public perception around you know because that will impact but look what happened you know previous administration when they they seriously went after the cartel members I remember that spree of violence that they kicked off it was in part because the Mexican authorities were going after cartels in a more serious manner right they previously that they were managing the problem so they said okay look let's manage down the violence everybody and we'll let you keep doing your business it's gonna happen so you guys do your business but just you know let's it's keep sort of public order you know as something that we want to demonstrate that we're capable of and when you have to when they went after the cartels in a more serious manner that's when that that real parse spree of violence kicked off and you know there was more Headroom so these you know these various members were you know they were combating each other and they were going after the public they understood that they had to you know basically wear down the public which is what happened the public said after a while they said fuck it we can't deal with this the violence is too much it's awful and so government you know eventually we went back to managing the problem drug trade didn't go away of course they just went back to the old ways of doing things so but the violence is just so intense the public eventually just that we can't know and and I think the cartels knew that they understood that right and so they were willing to to do it well the most ridiculous aspect was that Fast and the Furious deal where they were literally selling drugs to the cartels so they could track them and those drugs were used to eventually kill some US office right right yeah I mean it was yeah yeah yeah conflating things yeah those guns that they used they did kill officers right yeah there was there was a officer in particular was that was killed and and the the Fast and Furious anytime you talk about let me talk about as part of a intelligence collection effort right or law enforcement effort that you're going to supply the hostile element with weapons or whatever maybe yeah it's gonna it's probably gonna go sideways right who's like a great way to cover the fact that you were selling guns I mean if I was really skeptical I would say what are you gonna do we're gonna sell them guns how the fuck you're gonna sell them guns well we're gonna do say that it's an intelligence-gathering thing guns yeah we're all really cynical yeah a lot of people a lot of people are yeah yeah yeah no I I think it was it was a fucked up operation there's no doubt about it and I'm not a fan of you know it's sort of like the same in the gray arms marketing you know sort of on a global basis we can talk about you know like you know because again what are you looking to do you're looking to create movement track you know movement of gear or money or resources or personnel there's ways you can do that you know without creating potential for a complete go rope and unfortunately Fast and Furious did that that was had to be a goatrope you giving people the ability to kill people yeah you giving them guns yeah like what and what did they have chips on the guns like how are they even tracking these goddamn guns yeah it that sources method shit but it's yeah going back to to Mexico and how do you you know how do you resolve that because that impacts again that impacts us impacts our national security right yeah and so well they're literally connected to us yeah we're so concerned with Afghanistan and Iraq they're nowhere near us and we've got this thing connected to us that's literally filling this country with illegal drugs they sell meth they sell fentanyl yeah Afghanistan fuck they're coming up on another election presidential election in mid I think mid-september you don't you're not thinking about it I'm thinking about moving the family over there and yeah yeah I could me and Boris Johnson and Trump would get together but yeah though they've had an increase in bombings you know Taliban stepping it back and I mean we don't think about it nobody wants to think about that shit anymore you think about how many years you know we've been digging in and and it always comes back to the same thing a Taliban bad what did we think was gonna happen they got no place else to go right it's so difficult to track them down yeah yes and they and then the day we'll just wait it out right and then so they're back again they're increasing bombings they want to take you know they want to take over again and then it's just so you're right in a sense we did we take our eye off the ball yeah we did yeah and were there other issues that we should have been more focused on yeah yeah sure but you know then you're conflicted because you think of all those people that fought and died over there and and the effort that other people that came back and you know with with horrible wounds and and and the trauma of all of that and you know I feel somewhat conflicted because then you talk about you know I don't you don't want to you don't minimize their what they did right for the country but you also have an obligation I think they look at policy and what did we do and what was the purpose of it was the point of that exercise and I don't think we still disdain oh right I mean what are we create some pseudo state federal government there that's gonna be a bastion of democracy and not gonna happen so anyway I don't want disappeared on the Afghanistan rabbit hole but we'd like to think that we could turn that into another America that's we like to think when we think about nation-building that we think that we can go in there establish democracy and these people are going to be better they're gonna be able to go to school and it's gonna change the whole environment yeah yeah I guess and that is true and we talked about Iraq that way if we just make a rock a bastion of democracy then maybe it'll help to turn the tide in the Middle East and suddenly every won't have more of a respect for individual liberties and rights and all the rest of that and and how that would go you know I'm still looking into it it's I'll come back again and I'll give you my report I think it's gonna be negative a million people have died yeah it's yeah it's not good right that's that's typically never good when you get you get to those numbers some large number yeah but again look I mean the shit that we don't want to talk about it'll be on Thomas Syria mm-hmm I nobody wants to talk about Syria and then and and you know Assad you know as butcher he's still in charge why is he in charge well because Russia propped him up I wanted Russia prop went along with Iran and isn't there's a there's a nasty piece of work there and as an access goes well you know Russia had no intention of letting go mmm we should have been able to figure that one out but mmm we didn't and in part because we have these these these impulses let's say well we're gonna do better and because we're going to create this ability for people to you know create their own democracy yeah so yeah so anyway we see Ria's again one of those places that nobody really wants to discuss or talk about and we've got we've got attention deficit disorder nobody talked about North Korea anymore remember we're all gonna get blown up by Kim jong-un yeah yeah well there's pictures of Trump shaking his hand so we're buddies now go home yes we're all good good I mean the last article I read about North Korea was about how did Kim jong-un get his Mercedes is there some sort of a boycott or you know embargo yeah well and that's you know that's another part of it is although we have been we've been more successful I will say this we've been more successful than that in the past and part of that is a technology issue we've gotten better at imposing and enforcing sanctions than we used to be and part of that is because our abilities to understand the movement of money tracking transactions is better than it used to be so the sanctions as an example we put on Iran this yeah this is the most difficult time that this regime has faced in Iran since the fall of the Shah and it's because we've gotten better at looking at Russia China in particular that traditionally always kind of circumvented the sanctions we're better at enforcing that and we're better at working with the EU and pressuring them right I mean so that's that's a good thing but I don't know where that's going you know I mean Iran is kind of flailing about a little bit they seize the tanker you know a British tanker they actually seized a couple but yeah they're holding on to one in response to they were trying to ship a bunch of oil over to Syria and against sanctions that exist right so so they had a tanker that was taking 2 million barrels or whatever avoid over to Syria and the British in the territorial waters of Gibraltar intercepted that ship that was a beginning of July and in response the Iranians have done a number of things right but the most recent thing that they've done was they seized a British flag tanker and they're still holding the crew and that's sort of an example of their I don't say they're desperate right because they've got an ability I think to withstand and their control over the PAS population is so strong but it's an example I think to some degree of them flailing a bit and trying to figure out what are they gonna do what's their next move and I know people say well we shouldn't have gotten out of the deal and we shouldn't you know we shouldn't have this issue anyway because you know it's Trump's fault for getting out of the deal but you know they again I don't have a lot of confidence in in them sticking to the terms and agreements of any deal because they've never done in the past there's always been an effort and they've always broken the agreements so I don't know why suddenly they would change their tune if we can keep the sanctions on hard enough and force them to the table the only thing they care about staying in power if they think they're gonna lose that grip on power they'll come to the table and then make a better deal and that deal would include us being able to access their military facilities and for inspections we couldn't we had no access to any other military sites in that country because yeah we didn't make it a condition of the deal right so we basically said sure we want verification that you're following the agreements they said we'll fuck you this is these are the places that we agree to let you look at that's that was that I don't want to over simplify but that was the terms of the deal and so we we any deal that we do with them in the future needs to be able to say no we want on a percent verification as John Kerry said that's what you want you want to be able to verify so when we heard about it what we're hearing in the news from the people that are opposed to the deal is that Trump broke this deal and he was foolhardy to do so that Obama had put in place this deal and the Trump had broke it and it sort of leaves us in this terrible quagmire right but what you're saying is that the deal was terrible and that it didn't really give us access to understand exactly what their nuclear program was their military program was so it wasn't a good deal it wasn't it wasn't wise to keep it if you're if you're if the way that you judge the the value of a deal and they this is what the previous administration the Obama administration did was to talk about how you know it's important that we verify and we've got verification well yeah you've got verification of the sites that the Iranians agreed to let us look at that and so yeah it was a deal was it a good deal know they wanted this they wanted to sign this deal in the Iranians knew it and so yeah I think that that justified saying no we're gonna redraw this and even the EU which has been clinging to the the old agreement even the EU says well yeah we we could improve it we could make it better but there's no if you just keep things as they were there's no incentive for the Iranian regime to to make any concessions or improve it so the point being is we're going we're trying to force them back to the negotiating table and again given that their self-interest is to stay in power and and remain in charge then you know if with the economy and the condition that it's in currently if it gets much worse and they feel as if they're losing a grip on the population then I suspect they will come there then I kind of lash out that Iran doesn't want it nobody wants a military conflict we don't want it they don't want it yeah yeah oh yeah can they close the Strait of Hormuz you know where you know depending on who you're talking to a fifth of the world's oil passes through or yeah they could close the temporarily I caused some friction but they don't have the ability to shut down for any any real period of time we've just got too much in terms of leverage over there and our assets and so yeah I you know who knows but I I'm one of those people that says you know we we shouldn't have done that deal until we got it right and just saying it we got a deal for the sake of it because you had partial verification doesn't give you anything we've had partial verification of their programs for decades and they just keep advancing their program so do you think this criticism of backing out of the deal that you're hearing from Democrats is basically just a criticism of Trump to show an opportunity to yeah everything's icarus I think everything is a criticism of Trump is that a problem because Trump is such a polemic figure because he's so many people just hate him that any opportunity to have some sort of political talking point against him sort of confuses what the actual issue is itself yeah I mean I think it's no doubt he's yeah I I think what happens is both sides we lose in this one because the Democrats just sort of blindly you know accuse him of everything's bad right and no matter what he's doing a matter what policy is it's all bad right and so so that's not what you want to be and on the Republican side you know you tend to think that that's the case and so you know you don't have an honest intelligent discussion of the landscape right and so you again you were sitting in trenches throwing hand grenades there it's a world war one right and nobody's gonna get out and venture into no-man's land in the center nobody's living in the center anymore so I just think everybody it's a disservice to everybody but yes I think almost things that come out of Capitol Hill right now is based on on you know but my here's an example my daughter went she just got out of grad school and she's done a number of internship she's worked over in Asia she's been in China on internships and she's you know smart kid I'm subjective smart kid but she went for a job up in Capitol Hill and it was not a direct hire meaning that office had to go through the the other offices to get approval to hire an individual to fill this position and because the house is controlled by Democrats now she was everybody looked and said yeah she's a top candidate we want to offer the job well what happened was they submitted her details we want to hire this person to this office within the Capitol Hill controlled by the Democrats now because it's a House Majority and they came back and said no because you know why because she did an internship in the current administration right so a young person wanting to work in DC in policy and and and security studies and elsewhere doing a variety of internships around the globe does an internship at the White House normally you would think that's a good thing right but so they said no because she did this internship at the White House we're not going to approve the hiring and then it turns well she did an internship and Bill de Blasio's office - right and so they said that and the response was we don't like him either which I think was that actually provided some humor right through the whole situation but it shows you not I mean that's that that's a little tiny thing it's a personal issue but but it shows you Washington DC is possibly the most dysfunctional location in all of North America that's terrible yeah and it's in its and it's not the way it should be we should be able to have policy discussions we should be able to make decisions you may not like Trump you may not have liked the previous president but you know again we got to stop this bullshit where everybody's a racist everybody's a sexist everybody's a you it's not the way this country supposed to work and people you know you can't even get away from him okay who's at fault everybody's at fault right well we're the left are all guilty of creating this divisive mess what is this the cure to outrage culture I mean how do you get past us that's the real question right I mean what is the I don't see a map and I was going to ask you this about foreign policy because as a guy who has been involved the CIA for as long as you have and has seen all the inner workings of government and all the conflict and did you ever feel like you just were just running up of 70 degree sand dune that you're never gonna get to the top of you know I mean it sounds like it never ends and you're just basically trying to like oh there's another hole in the dike let me put my finger in this one Oh up water is coming out of this one let me get my finger in this one and it never ends yeah you're right running up the sand dune that's a good that's a good analogy it seems like a million mile high sand dune yeah and it is like it is it's always looked dc's always been divisive politics have always created the division the press has always been biased in one way or another you know these things aren't new but and we always tend to think it's the worst we've ever seen it look the civil war was pretty bad that was pretty divisive so yeah so when you have a politician like like I think was Joe Biden right that said that the president is is the most you know racist you know president we've ever had and you think well I don't know slaves exactly 12 presidents own slaves I think that might have been a problem but you know so so and or the race relations are the worst they've ever been and you think yeah how about the 60s that was pretty bad right and in the Civil War and I think so every time is yeah I know and and and but I guess my point being is that you know you can you can fall into that trap where you think it's it's as bad as it's ever been it's I think it's fair to say that it is more polarizing now than in recent times and how do we walk it back how do we dial it down a little bit and how do we actually focus on what's important for a general population there's a lot of big issues we should be solving right I mean but look at the insanity of when we talk about health care right it's right it's like oh it's got to be all this or it's got to be all that nobody's over in the middle saying well you know you could take a little bit of this and that and again how do you walk that back it's way above my pay grade I hunkered down in Idaho and I'd go fishing and I don't think about it I don't see any solution that anybody has it makes any sense and that's one of the things that terrifies me and I don't want to just step away I don't want to be that guy that moves to fucking Idaho North Saskatoon yeah Edmonton yeah but I mean it's like what we doing in Edmonton UFC oh oh you did River Creek it's you know yeah it's um I just feel like there's no real general solution nor is there a map of a potential solution and in I mean and if we get a Democrat in the White House it's not gonna end remember when Obama was in office they were mad that he wore a gray suit or a chance there's a tan suit making fun of his suit the fuck you care yes this is all you care about it's like this polarization the Fox News versus MSNBC polarization yeah that doesn't help anybody and it's fuck it's so bananas that if you have a podcast like mine and I have a left wing person on Imus if I have a right-wing person on yeah I'm a Nazi yeah and it just goes back and forth you can't even talk to people anymore which is no now if it comes down to you can't have policy differences anymore right it's got to be some personal animus that you've got towards that other individual which is its again is is is horseshit you can have policy differences with with people and that doesn't make you a bad person it doesn't make you you know they sure those are the races of course I friggin races out there right but that's we've lost them the meaning of the term when you just start hurling that around at anybody you disagree with right or well when people say well if you like Trump you're a racist right well well congratulations you're probably driving those people to definitely vote for them in 2020 that is absolutely fact that's one thing that I completely agree with you on that I think that this idea that everybody who supports Trump is racist it makes those people so angry that they just want to go okay I'm gonna well you're obviously nuts I can't I can't be on your side you people are crazy you want to open up the borders and you want to take all the money from the everybody that's a hard-working American give it to all the poor people and fuck you and it's like the arguments just get so confused yeah I know I don't know where it's I mean if you think about who who might win you know I don't think Joe Biden's gonna last I think they're gonna eat him alive it's not yeah it should be I think Bernie and Kamala Harris and Tulsi Gabbard those are the ones only ones that makes Tulsi make sense to me she's a veteran congresswoman for six years she seems incredibly honest and and morals and her ethics are on point I like her she's my favorite but if the the left is going to have someone they're gonna have to be able to deal with Trump's insults yeah I'm gonna be able to debate him and that's where they all fall apart because they're trying to use that old model of politics and he's not doing that he's a showman and I think what's happening is that the Pope that you looked at the people that count in this in the primary or you know that's a completely different bag right then what goes on in the general and I think the people that are in the primary right now all those people are gonna be voting in the primary they're watching like these debates as an example or they're just watching the daily tweeter Twitter feed from these people the candidates and they're thinking can I see this person debating Trump right right and so the not only are the policies that these candidates are spouting are moving further and further to the left which is gonna make it harder when the general election comes to shift to the center they're not gonna be able to do it right that Center is now shifted further to the left if they even make the effort to get back there but you know you're getting sort of like the worst instincts coming out from these candidates because they think well I got a show that I can throw a firebomb here because they're looking at me was you know can I debate Trump right and so you're gonna you're gonna get somebody who's not so I don't think Tulsi gabbard's gonna make it because I think they're gonna make that calculation I think that you're probably gonna look in there you're gonna end up with with Harris or maybe Warren Warren yeah I don't know I mean American think you would think so right you would think so Harvard actually touted her in some of their literature when they were talking about their diversity efforts over the years there's actually documents where Harvard was saying you know and we hired you know first Native American you know professor and you're thinking as a statistic I'm 200 times more African than she is Native American about basically Africa are yeah yeah I didn't know that one point six percent one point six percent from where we know 23andme it's a whole kind someone from that continent fucked one of my ancestors what if you find out in South Africa though and it's not quite yeah it's interesting yeah well that's more Bohr yeah yeah I haven't done that you know my daughter did it and I have not done that I had actually had a conversation the other day about this whole thing about the desire to know your ancestry and everything and I my dad came over never talked about his background never talked about his family CIA dad yeah but they keep his mouth shut and so he never he never demonstrated that interest right and so therefore I don't think I've ever been I've never just been that focused on it everything was in the air that I knew was in there mostly Italian a little bit of Irish but some weird shit like 1% Asian I thought that was odd to any Scottish no it's always a lot of Scottish floating around out there like the fuck yeah that's right they get out you can get out yeah yeah I don't know I don't know where it's all going but I do think that Warren could be viewed no I don't I don't like her study but I think that she well she I think the base looks at her and thinks yeah she could be a firebrand after that whole Native American thing she built her career in a lie they don't care that's the problem America cares you can't look past that the same way you couldn't look past Hillary being a liar yeah Hillary tried to say that her name came from Edmund Hillary the guy who climbed Mount Everest meanwhile he climbed Mount Everest three years after she was born but you know what he was still quite the character before so we're still throwing that name around yeah but more than three years yeah yeah after she was born might have been seven years yeah but you think it won't be I don't think it'll be Bernie I don't think you know why not Wow John democratic socialism why taste so much you go up to Vermont and look around for menthe and see what kind of job Bernie's done and how about people did you did you just pretty judge they fucking hate him in his own City Oh judge it mayor Pete they're pissed at him and South Bend they would form a ticket with DeBlasio that'd be a powerful wearing a oral ticket right there there's no one person that stands out there's no one person that like stands out as someone who's gonna win you know everyone's like Oh could this person make it to that person make it and then there's people that want a challenge Trump which is hilarious well I think that's gonna be we're gonna lose a lot of these folks after this next round of debates which I guess tonight and tomorrow night I think there's a it's not an A and a B card but there's two nights of two nights of the maids cuz there's so many bouts did you see the back heel fight yes yeah yeah Rob's Thurman in the first round no sermons a beast to man that's crazy it was it was that was a great moment and then it was it was a interesting fight and I thought I I wasn't quite sure at the end where I was gonna go but I liked I've watched patio over the years and I did there was it's kind of that typical you know you get older and you're kind of rooting for the old guy right he's compatible forty years old he's the oldest man to ever capture the welterweight title yeah and particularly when you consider those lighter weight classes like form and won the heavyweight title at 46 which was crazy yeah but Pacquiao winning the welterweight title at 40s fucking good night working their ass off I mean it just it was it was it was a good good fight I really enjoyed that that was the first time I've really watched a fight that I really enjoyed right beginning to end and and I was with some folks who were who were not for Pacquiao and I kept looking I'm thinking okay he's been doing this forever he's a senator ya know think about that that's Cruz going back to work on the budget issues in the Philippines after the fight that's good yeah yeah I think you made 10 million on that I think yeah good yeah good for him yeah teeth Irma - he made two and a half got some chatter now Keith how much boy I love it you may where was in the audience yeah yeah well that would be fantastic if they mean I was the time to do it if Mayweather really wants to do it but Mayweather might watch that fight and go yeah cuz the first time they fought Pacquiao on a blown-out shoulder then a lot of people were angry there was actually even talk of a class action lawsuit against Pacquiao but after the fight because people had bet on him and his shoulder was fucked up going he'd hurt in training and try I think he got a cortisone shot and said I'm just gonna try to fight on and then he wound up getting shoulder surgery and then from then on after rehab looks fantastic that's really interesting though the concept of could you could you push through a class-action lawsuit with an athlete who is in that position I mean yeah where does that go I mean then if you're playing hurt I mean you're in the NFL and you're playing hurt do you have any obligation no I mean I know it's interesting well you have C fighters fight hurt all the time I know for a fact guys fight with blown out ACLs and torn hamstrings and they just listen they get to that point they think I think I can still win and some of them still win tomorrow Uman won the title with a broken foot he broke his foot in training and he was literally on crutches the week of the fight and then the guy gets to the fight and he's such a fucking animal and so tough that he fought like there was nothing wrong with him and then afterwards revealed that he had broken his foot it's fucking bananas the mental toughness that you have to have to be able to do that for a living and then you you and when you lose to somebody with a broken foot yeah that's yeah yeah yeah it was dominated dominated tyron woodley which is even crazier but then Woodley went into that fight injured as well I mean it's just the nature of the beast if your job is to hurt people and break their bodies you're gonna have to practice breaking bodies along the way and you're gonna have to practice it with people that are trying to break your body and occasionally that they succeed yeah yeah no rough business yeah come come to an event actually I would like to do that Anaheim in a couple of weeks you should come to that one it's a big one Daniel Cormier is fighting steep a Miocic okay for the heavyweight title in a couple of weeks yeah Nate Diaz is fighting Anthony Pettis that's a crazy fight and Paulo Costa is fighting Yoel Romero with two or three rather epic fights listen I'm praying no one gets injured yeah you know what I gave brings scooter scooter like rings yeah he likes that come on down man yeah set it up you know what I'll follow up on I will do it and tell me when your show comes out so I could let that let the people know maybe you can come back on again whenever it actually if you wouldn't mind I once they give me the go-ahead because apparently I'm prescribed from talking about it but when they give me the go-ahead you won't be able to get to shut up alright just keep talking well thank you Joe do that thank you sir Thank You Man good times all right bye everybody [Music] fun times man oh
