trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night okay people love both ways it's interesting like people love your way but people also love like shit-talking so cable of Nate Diaz for that people love they love the drama but they also love someone like you I'm soaking walked up to Holly and hugger yeah yeah I'm somewhere in the middle though because I get a lot of flack for you know my mouth likes I just can't I say what I'm thinking and I'm pretty transparent and sometimes people think that you know I get a lot of flack oh you're faker this and I'm like not really like just because you know I'm like I'll say this like I'm a fan of Conor I am I like his fighting style and I thought you know his antics at first were kind of like wait who is this guy what is it you know and then I'm like man props to him he's done amazing things like good for him and he's done really good things for our sport but when he didn't show up to film that commercial like I'm not gonna you know I'll be honest like yeah I kind of rubbed me the wrong way because um people like oh he does so much more media than you guys do him yeah I probably does you know he probably does I do a lot he probably does more I agree but I don't have a private jet flying out to pick me up and bring me back and fly 20 people and my crew with me too he does more so he gets more when they bring him to Vegas they put him up in a penthouse you know they make sure he has everything that he needs I don't get that you know that's fine you know he's earned that he's in that spot no problem with that but I think three months out from a fight camp you know you have a private jet coming to pick you up with you can bring 20 of your teammates you could probably work out on the jet if you want to on the way there cuz it's yours it's private do whatever you want right you could probably hit missile in jail yeah you could totally you know any you're three months out and you don't want to show for your media obligations like I don't really understand that I don't like it just I don't know I guess I'm trying to figure it out but the only issue that I had and it it doesn't bother me like if he didn't want to do it that's his own thing the thing is is that I showed up the day to film the commercial and I had two segments I was supposed to film and that's all that was on my schedule and then they asked me like they're like can you please help us out because Connors not here and we don't know what we're doing for this third segment of the commercial that was supposed to be Conner Nate so can you please come back later that day and film that segment and what that was during my practice time so I had to come back and you know I did it it was a company woman but like it was just frustrating because it's like dang you know if I had known about this I could have planned my training otherwise but now I kind of have to like scramble to get my second workout in and it affected me so yeah his decision did and it probably is actually you know I haven't made any more money in the sport yet because of Conor like people like to call you know once I got a bigger payday because I lasted like no because I wasn't the champion so I didn't get any more of like and get any pay-per-views I didn't get any more money and now he's like not on this fight cards I'm like you know but it's whatever you know it's it's Conor's deal and I don't hate Conor but I'm gonna say how I feel you know and I would say it if he was sitting here tube like dude why did you do that you probably well I I feel like there's a bunch of issues here and we and the only way to really get a firm understanding of it is to sit down with everyone involved and say what was communicated your manager did he know what the what the parents schedule is going to be like did you guys agree to this did you understand what you were getting into maybe it's a misunderstanding you know who knows it's hard to say but it's the way he went about it was ridiculous like saying I'm retired thanks for the cheese and then saying I'm not retired then saying I'm glad the UFC decided to give the fans what they want and be I'm gonna be on UFC 200 numbers like what and so like what he's doing is he's kind of like using the the media yeah to try to get this thing to pass through but he doesn't understand Dana and the renzo and Frank like that's never gonna work like you're you you're either in or you're not in right like and they're like real clear about that they have to set a precedent so like if you say fuck you I'm not doing media they're gonna go oh well okay fuck you're not fighting yeah but hold on I'm Conor McGregor we're the UFC yeah this is what it is I made many stars don't make many more and we might lose millions of dollars cuz you're not on UFC 200 yeah well she's what he he had put they put 10 million into promoting this yeah see tonight he's like we're way over budget you know so that's why I was like you've got to show up and do that's how Conor was made yes just do that stuff so now like at what point do you get to decide that you don't have to do that anymore like if that's what made you who you are like I mean don't you kind of have to like does that make sense what I'm saying it makes sense I mean why do you get to decide like when you don't have to like look look I used the Machine and now like I don't I just want to hop off now that I'm here yeah I don't know don't you kind of have to keep it the same boys I think so but there is also like a fine line right like you can do too much like when I was watching the Joe's a aldo media tour when they were going all around the world I'm like okay I understand that you want to promote this fight yeah but how much of this is helping the actual fight itself how much of it is just Conor McGregor constantly talking shit at press conferences and grabbing the belt and all that I mean that's really kind of what sewing a fight was that I don't know they did a lot of it but apparently Conor was sick like he was like I'm just constantly fighting off a cold is really hard to get in shape really hard trained yes every week you know you're traveling I'm here to there and there to here it's just you're constantly getting beaten down and you know what it's like if I give you have you ever flown to Brazil and fought no I fall in there for fight cards though what is the the furthest you've ever had a fly to fight Japan Japan so that's an interesting one that's a long flight it's like 16 hours right yeah what is it like like like adjusting and then competing um I try to start adjusting my schedule at home like blacking my windows a little bitter you know like to make the time frame but you've never get fully adjusted but the my mind frame is like when when push comes to shove when fight time comes well it's 2:00 in the morning my time or not like I'm gonna be game so I just look at it that way but it's not fun like I remember three weeks out from my fight with Riddick I which I didn't even want it I didn't want to do that fight because she was so unknown she was undefeated I'm going over there to like fight on a newly blooming fight path so I was like this is like feels like it does nothing for me and like and if she wins springboards her you know then she'll be 17 and Oh she'll be judo background they're gonna want to make that fight for her and Ronda I know that's what they're trying to do so trying to use you know business use me as that spring word it's like I don't really want to but I did it but three weeks before the fight they had me fly to Japan to do some promotional stuff and I was flying longer than I was even on the ground and they said like ticket sales went up and everything was good but yeah that was exhausting so I do every weeks before yeah that's hard really hard you're peeking right really high ramping it up three weeks in super hard and now after my fight with Holly like I got to spend a little time in Australia and then I went straight from Australia to New York spent a day there did a full day of media went to Connecticut to ESPN did a full day of media went to Toronto did a full day of media and it's just like it's non-stop from like you start your first interview at 8:00 in the morning so you pick up at like 7:00 and you go until 7:00 at night and even while you're driving to the next place they'll have you on the phone with with the with the with a you know with a radio interview you know I mean there's no break it so it's it's pretty intense it's pretty crazy is pretty exhausting sigh I get it I have been in those you know issues before but um you know it's I don't know maybe there's more eccentric maybe he was hurt or something maybe he didn't want people see like maybe I don't know like what if there was even something like that like what if he had like hurt himself or something and he didn't want like Nate to know yeah who knows I don't know who knows and it's also he also had to realize there was a lot of work that needed to be done to beat Nate yeah like he's I'm hit Nate with some of his best shots and they was fine with it and it was a real problem I think that's more what it was is that he was just obsessed with beating Nate and I I get that too I don't take that away from him for a minute like you want to stay home and he was in Iceland I guess training and he wants to train to be Nate I get it totally get it yeah I get it too it seems like the only way also I felt like but then again he could have brought his whole gym with him you know sure we could have tried I mean it was gonna be a difficult time just trying to find the the moments to train in two states shape and then obviously being exhausted from flying which was a quick turnaround to you know like as far as like people I don't think he was supposed to be there more than like two days I honestly think he's better off not doing it I honestly think he's better off like sequestering himself for a few months like really focusing on what went wrong yeah how to correct it I agree and can you correct it yeah I mean do you like when it comes to the ground game what I saw on the ground I was like boy this is a long road like you've got a long road to beat a guy like Nate yeah he's so much further along in in and ground-and-pound jujitsu positioning everything when I was watching Nate beat him up on the ground and choke him I was like whoa that happened quick yeah this is not like like Weidman and Rockhold was a prolonged beating before Rockhold eventually stopped him the next round but with why with Nate and Connor wasn't that prolonged it happened pretty quickly yeah and when you see that you go ooh like this is gonna be there's a lot to overcome yeah it's not unsurmountable takes a lot of times I build that those skill sets they don't just they don't come overnight you don't know you can pick up your cardio pretty quick you can do a lot of things you can't you can't build a skill set any faster than it's gonna go over to your muscle memory and be interrupts you've got to put thousands of reps in on there's no way around it yeah there's no way there's no way to fast forward through that there's no way to cut the corner there's no nothing you can't just repetition repetition repetition what also it highlights all the various eccentric aspects of your training the people of mm is this what makes Conor great and you know and then you know Nate calling a touch but in the park like they do it all these cartwheels and stuff then media was so fun alert oh my god I was dying little arias so when this all you know he's doing all these this work with this movement guy but then you see what happens when it actually comes to fighting skills and you go ooh maybe this is not the way to do it like because like I've talked to a lot of people that were like this stuff that he's doing is utter horseshit like this doing cartwheels and being obsessed with movement here's the movements you need to be worried about okay moving your feet throwing kicks and punches takedown defense and jiu-jitsu on the ground that's it yeah you know understanding takedowns yourself taking people down if you must trip sweeps all that stuff but all this cartwheels and what this guy was explaining to me and I want to name any names he's a prominent guy he was like you have to understand that there's a limited amount of energy you have in your time training and you are not perfect at all these other aspects of MMA so if you are not perfect other aspects of emay you have to say okay cryo how much yeah how much of this stuff is going to help me well a guy like George st. Pierre he looked at gymnastics and he's like you know what's going to help me if I can be stronger physically and there's no better way I think like as far as like manipulating your body than gymnastics like doing the Rings and developing pre-reception yeah you're learning how to manipulate Orton yeah being upside down and understanding where you are when you're upside down where you're going to be with the momentum you have you have to calculate that your math is doing constant algorithms and math equations essentially when you're fighting to you know weight distribution where we at especially when you tie up with someone else and you have to feel their weight and you have to manipulate it in a way to get it where you want whether it's against the cage or whether it's on the ground your body is using a equation yeah you know your mind is equating how much force do I need to make this happen how little force like what if I go the opposite direction because they're pushing into me there's all these different things that you have to over there's no other way to do it than than a trial and error process and over and over and over and over again yeah and you look at someone who's like really good at one aspect of MMA like Yoel Romero who's just a ridiculous wrestler and you go okay look how much touch but in the park is that guy doing you know I went to how many cartwheels is he doing is he tumbling no there's a hundred double legs a day oh yeah at least you know yeah well he's doing all right and then a hundred single legs and then a hundred body locks and you know but until Connor lost everybody's like this is what we need we need a movement coach I need a movement coach you know and it still might I mean as we said with George st. Pierre it has massive benefits to get that kind of coordination physical strength do you like about Conor though is like his balance is impeccable and that could be part of that and he's never over himself at least with a striking part of it anyway and you know the ground is a completely different thing but when he's in striking range and it's just his body his eye hand coordination is incredible and his balance like he's never too far over a punch he's never too far back he's always centered he's always centered he throws a kick he never gets you know you see people kick and they miss and they kind of like stumble like their weights off balance or or they kick and even land and even when they put their foot down it's kind of like it's not a good landing you know like I I'm not like the world's best kicker but when I watch Connor do it it's like he kicks or push kicks and sticks mm-hmm he is like a like a a gymnast in the sense you know they do those flip and then they want to just boom stick it like an he's mm-hmm really really good at that well in that sense maybe that's where the movement does benefit I think so that never is over himself in his weight distribution but isn't it the case that whenever someone loses though everyone always second guesses what they were doing even if what they were doing was getting them to be like 16 and no totally undefeated world champion when you'd make a mistake or something goes wrong or something goes right for your opponent we should probably say immediately people start questioning everything you did yeah definitely all the time I didn't it happened with me when you know when I lost it surrounded that guy you got to change it she got change everything but as long as you're winning people like yeah I keep doing what you're doing it's working then you lose or like change everything it's like jeez that was quick well that's also the Rhondda criticism in the Holly Holm fight everybody was like looking at her like a dominating bitch go hey I would stand up you know beating Sara McMann the way she did Alexis Davis beating her down the way she did and go we'll look Ronda obviously is getting so good at striking she's just such an elite athlete that she can do what she's doing to anybody and then her trainer saying that she could go box women professionals and knock them out and so you get this thing in your head that you can do what you have been doing yeah and then you fight someone like Holly and you go oh well okay yeah if there's what is so there's so many levels it's one of the more fascinating things about martial arts is that there are so many levels yeah there's never it's never ending yeah never ending story he really is right yeah
