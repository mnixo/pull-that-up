five four three two one Ryan Sickler brought some Baltimore work ethic I can't believe you got actual pieces of paper that you brought yeah I'm coming what are you prepared I'm prepared man I'm prepared this is just shit to come back to that Baltimore accent is so on you I have two very good friends my good friend John Rallo and my good friend excuse me Ben O'Brien both from Baltimore both got that we if you don't know more yeah that's it's a weird accident like what is that hey Jay Road hey Jay Rogen yes I love your podcast Joe it's a weird accent it's so fucking weird it's and people they're like hardcore they say shit like for Sync they'll say zinc kitchen zinc ambulance like I I didn't realize I had a southern accent until I moved here and I still don't believe I have a southern accent I'll give it a draw I'll give it a draw draw it's a different one it's not Alabama that Mississippi South it's a friendly southern accent like it's not it's not like man I can't talk to this motherfucker right but it's like oh why are you from these none of those people are always surprised when I say Maryland but when you get into pockets of like Virginia they've got a southern accent they're even and when you go into like Indiana there's certain areas of Indiana that have a southern accent and other places that don't like it's really weird about these little settlements and they've just developed these accents that just stay there I think Baltimore is one of the most under misunderstood though that's a weird one because it's a big city I mean Baltimore's a big city they call it the big little city yeah how many people in Baltimore if I had a guess couple million I'd say that's fair yeah that's a fucking big city bigger than San Diego nice yeah but getting older you know history you know that's the lot a lot of history but that weird ass accent that if you don't know anybody from Baltimore you don't know that accent I think my buddy owns a junkyard in the city and I took Jay back when we were on tour else you got to come meet him see this junkyard shit and you know people drop he's like oh we're doing everything and he's like just put a K on me thank everything yeah you guys don't know anything you're doing over there and he's and also for four years I said Washington DC washer and dryer because everyone there says it right and one day somebody said wait what'd you say I said put it in the washer and they're like spell washer W a sh ER like there's no R and that I was like huh and I started saying to myself like oh my god I do fucking say Washington and washer so I trained myself to get out of that but anytime I see something political on TV if I hear someone say we're in Washington then I'm like urine that you're from that area yeah the same way with the days of the week I was telling you Monday Tuesday we do our podcast crab feast comes out every Tuesday and I listen to announcers like Phil Simms he's like well they were working out on Monday and I'm like yeah you're from probably from that area that's how I pick up a little shit like that yeah well I grew up in Boston that's an obvious accent everybody knows that accent but you don't have it I got rid of it oh so you did it shook it loose that's a drift but if you hear me from like to that whoa like early before pre 2000 I had it you know I just heard it too much I heard it in my own voice I was like ill and then I got rid of it first time I heard it I was 19 I did this thing I was on local television at 19 and I heard my fault my accent I was like what in the fuck is that sound coming out of my mouth I got to correct that do you ever slip into it if I'm hammered if I'm hammered and I'm around Boston people yeah it'll come out a little bit but just to touch just to touch otherwise it would be fake mine comes out more like I'll go home for the week in the summer I just by midweek I'm just talking way oh yeah I'm that's another one dropping an N on the end of now we're gonna come over right now now you swallow your ELLs you say let me get a salad and belly belly what do you want to have he's gonna have a salad - he's out in the alley right now like there's no L there's no L how is that there's no L peep some people I say Baltimore with a D I put a touch of a D on it bald Baltimore Baltimore versus Baltimore Baltimore right but Baltimore I bet your friends probably say Ballmer that's how like a hardcore like when you go ask you know out here you can ask anyone where are you from when you ask somebody back there to like they don't even say like another area of Maryland just go here you know I haven't left here this fucking block right here like what are you talking about this is where I like yeah man something about me that end these people that are just like super locals they just say fuck it did in my spot that's another great name super locals yeah that's the truth there's people that are like that right they just like this is where I fucked my bar like Denver Colorado every place else can go fuck off there's people like that man it's like there's something to that right you know that spot and you're like I get it I get the rest of the country good good luck good luck with all that you know if you didn't live here chasing those Hollywood dreams yeah what would you be in a perfect world I'd probably have a house right on the Wye River in Maryland salt water I'd have four-wheelers I'd throw some traps out in the water on Monday Oh crab traps yeah bro and by now here's this this is how you say the day Saturday and there by Saturday Saturday by Sarah T will have a fucking crab feast goddamn right hence the podcast and every week I would have my own I just throw them out there because I that's one thing I really miss about merrily the sushi out here is phenomenal but the seafood there is different we could go to a we could go to a dive bar right now and have a plate a bucket of rocks like little pony rolling rocks and a plate of mussels marinara that will blow any fucking restaurant out here out and a dot in a dive blues bar I miss the readiness of an availability of delicious seafood everywhere I go that's interesting yeah there's not a lot of really good seafood restaurants there's just sushi out here yeah that's a real good point it's like what do you get out here for seafood like someone will have salmon on the menu or maybe this like haddock or something like that or halibut you know yeah that's not like like back home in Boston was legal seafoods was a joint 100% I mean people went to a seafood restaurant yeah seafood restaurants not popular out here no why is it and we're all in the water yeah we're a coastal fucking stand like why aren't we embracing there's an ocean right there very embracing that not only that you go to that ocean it's hardly anybody fishing yep that's a weird one like California like go to the like all Santa Monica mayor of like Malibu hardly anybody fishing you might see one or two people I just looked up best bass fishing out here in California cuz I my brother just bought a place in Delaware on at the water's brackish but it's not enough to keep crabs but he's pulling out largemouth and sending me pictures I'm like good for you and go fuck yourself and he just I mean nice big fat ones out here they grow them big they do it they said cast a exploded cuz I got to get up there and go again but pyramid they said but I doing that drought I feel like the I feel like pyramid dried up a little but no no you could drive by it you can yeah I I Drive by on the way up to Tejon Ranch it's a beautiful lake Pyramid is like one of them lost lakes that people don't know about but yeah I would live there on the water and I mean I miss my dad was an outdoors I was talking to you about this at the Comedy Store my dad hunted and stuff but fished but he really got us into crab and not just throwing traps in the water we used to we had a trotline we used to run a trotline so this is if I could my father died when I was 16 I've always thought about this if I had 24 hours if my dad could come back here right now for 24 hours what would I do and we be up on the water crab and a 5 a.m. that's right when you're allowed to start dipping and then home by 11 and then steam them up have a big-ass fucking crab feast and probably watch a game I'd like hey these are the Ravens you know you know and then play catch into the night that would be what I would do but we had so he he had a friend that lived on the Eastern Shore that was a crab got your crab ermine I guess but he taught us how to do a homemade one so we had this he went and bought this johnboat this old wood John boat was it John John boats a flat-bottomed boat versus the v-bottom and it was wood not aluminum this one was white painted up just a beater you know and we had a Johnson motor yeah every time I hear that Alan Jackson song drive he's talks about 75 John's I'm with an electric choke I'm like oh yeah that was our boat that was our little rig it's me and my two brothers and my dad and what you do to do a homemade when you take a bucket 5 gallon bucket or even just a small I want to put just some quikrete with an eye hook in it okay tie your rope here to some chain other side of the chain another rope up to a Clorox bottles that's your float on this side okay chain 50 yards of rope chain 50 yards same set up I just told you on the other end so the Clarkes pile is just so you know where you are that's right that's your beginning in your end and then every three feet and this dude was so ahead of his time like this we're talking about mid 80s late mid to late 80s we're doing this he's like go to the butcher and get bull lips you know the lip yeah the discarded lips of bulls actual bull lips and that's gonna be your bait cuz crabs are the biggest scavengers you can use chicken necks are popular that's an easy ones you just go to the grocery store but you got to go to a you know fucking the butcher to get bullets I don't know anybody's got those why is it more effective it's just stanked and nasty and like using chicken liver for catfish exactly but also it's durable because these things are eating it that's gonna be your line for most the summer you know you might have to replace one or two but that's adorable bait that can withstand the crabs tearing it up for you know three months so really yeah three months well if you're going out over the summer I'm saying let's say you'd go crab in ten times during the summer you can probably get away with that whole trotline maybe replace one or two that might slip out because you freeze it so all right so the reason the lips yeah well then you tie them every three feet right and then that's your trot how big is a bull lip about that big and butt fat like a couple inches well they cut them I'm sorry that's not a fear they'll slice them so it looked like almost like fat eels you know a little time or leeches let me say leeches leeches so then you get out your loud Sun up you're only allowed two bushel without a permit a license so we're out there marshal aizen's mm-hmm yeah two bushels a lot like two bushel baskets like Apple basket you probably but you're getting that's the thing is you buy them you'll get maybe seven eight dozen but if you're going out you're throwing the shit away you'd pay good money for it to store cuz you're going oh you're getting the best big sucker there is nothing better than pulling it right out of the water and taking it home and eating it yeah not getting it from the store not been you know who knows how they stored it and there's dudes on the side of the road that when they have more they'll just pour over in their pickup truck they'll put a fucking cardboard sign down 20 bucks bushel and you just get them and go right that's something I miss blue crabs that's right so you get out you put a little 2x4 across your or holes drop your bolts in there that's your wood at the end you have an empty spool a rope okay empty one and you just stealth everything we were talking about those slow riding harleys you stealth ride your boat and you got to be steady someone reaches over and they pull the rope up put it on the spool and then your natural progression forward slowly brings the line up and then sets it back down on the water and you've got to go slow because those you're pulling those crabs up from the bottom they'll stay on the whole time and then you're just fucking dipping and dump and dipping and don't it's and then the tidal come in you hop out of the boat swim around a little bit you get the soft crabs the ones that are coming closer to shore to molt their shell so they can get bigger and then those you take we get about a six eight of those take those home crab you're having the time you're fucking lying off shell crabs are fantastic it's so good those are so good with lemon and butter I love it that's what I would do that's exactly where I'd be dude I ran into Jon REEP last night then you know reap is uh he's a he's a road warrior you know constant in the road and we were talking last night he's like I'm not sure why I'm still in LA because I don't have to live here he's like I'm here all the time I'm doing sets and everything top he goes but I'm on the road man and I go where you gonna move to and he goes dude I'm gonna get a fucking house on the lake in North Carolina you know that sounds perfect to me I got a buddy who's got a place in Coeur d'Alene and they sent pictures and eat dude you you could be in like 60 feet of water and you take a picture and you see every pebble on the bottom of the water I mean it was just crystal clear it's like a big ol bottle of Fiji yeah you just see everything on the bottom big old northern pike swimmin around in there oh yeah Idaho Bay fishing crab and yeah I've been to Coeur d'Alene I know driving to Montana from Seattle come through there I never been Idaho I'm going for the first time I'm in Boise this month right alright soon someone sometime soon I love that I just love country I mean we were I was born in the city but we only lived there till my parents had my younger brother almost when we were four we got out of there bigger house more land and stuff like that too you know you live in a room there's no I mean our backyard was the size of this table right know what I mean so I grew up out in the county about 20 miles or so outside the city and my dad was like look I want you to get a good school education but all of my family was in Baltimore as it gets where you're gonna go get your street education I'm so glad because I see shit from a mile away mile away Larson's always like I don't even now you do it we were we were at Denver we were in Denver at the end of 2016 we were doing our tour and we like to walk home from the shows at night we'll smoke a little joint take a walk enjoy your city whatever and he's a coach nothing wrong with them where I'm like Denver's got a cops episode bro you know and we're about to take this walkway underneath this tunnel and the sketchy fucking like white dude sketched out just start circling us with those dark eyes and this crazy smile traffic is haulin ass right close by us right and Jacek what are we gonna do and I was like we're gonna stay over here by this traffic and if that dude charges us I'm shoving them right into that fucking traffic that's exactly what the fuck we're gonna do I'll bait him over here just shove them right out there let those cars shit like that I was like yeah what do you do if you kill someone like that do you tell anybody like it's just you and Jeff well these days everything's on camera what cameras there's there's this guy but if ya I would tell ya Patel that one I would because I feel like that self-defense if you're living here even if you're leaning toward me wrong kill me veterans shove a guide trap kill any veterans you know the guys are veterans right what if he is could be PTSD all fucked you're right and then I start a mood careful yeah all right maybe the guy just needs a hug problem is you never know not when you say shit like that you semicircle any circled us like four times just kept circling yeah I hadn't thought to ask if you wanted a hug I'm gonna try that shit yeah when you're all stabbed to death on the sidewalk endeavour just know I tried to hug it out yeah yeah you ever been outside of Denver like evergreen never go up there I've been to know I haven't been evergreen I've been to Colorado Springs evergreen has the northern pike has a cousin the muskie it's the their evil cousin they eat ducks and shit ever see a muskellunge no dude they eat you know hold up oh yeah they're prehistoric I'm gonna look that shit's a giant ass fish but when I was up there the week I was up there someone on Facebook or somebody thought I was like I was like damn evergreens beautiful this place is gorgeous and I just was looking up shit on evergreen and I saw some guy pulled one through the ice that was fat around like a girl's waist seemed to get up this was holy shit Wisconsin yeah look at that one above it look at that one above it look at the size of that fuck and they look like Tigers do stripes is a tiger yeah me too python meets a fish yeah it's an evil fish they're fucking prehistoric and they're ruthless man I mean are you feel like you'd be fighting that thing like a Marlin for like two hours yeah you specially you have light tackle if you need to be strapped in a chair for that then no but look at that battle hold now well yeah you're gonna bow it you're gonna battle look at the fucker oh that's not a that's not a muskie that doesn't look like a muskie to me that looks like a gar mmm what is it the caption says are a PI ma o or a pieman yeah that's that gigantic fish that lives in Bolivia in Ecuador that are a Pima is a fish that lives in the Amazon I believe somewhere in the rainforest and they used to the locals used to catch him all the time it was like a big thing for their food but they're worth so much money for Americans to go down and fish for them and now they protect them my good friend Steve Rinella has a podcast called meat-eater and he went down and filmed episode 8 also his TV show and they filmed some episodes their show in Peru and in Bolivia and those people the the locals they make a whatever money that they actually do make they make a big portion of it some of them do helping people fish for these things you know acting as a guide the size of these things look at that prehistoric giant animal and they survive in water when there's a drought so when the water gets like super low they're surviving in water we're like literally like the water's up to there half their face and there's waddling around so you could just walk right up to it we catch them damn I wouldn't walk up to anything with teeth like that well they don't have teeth as big as the Muskies if you go back Jamie to those pictures see there's a bunch of them in like water where they're their upper bodies exposed yeah the water so shallow and they're so enormous I mean these are huge huge there's a dinosaur fish yeah there's you ever seen a gar do you know what a gar looks like pull up alligator gar alligator gar is that is a truly prehistoric fish like I don't think it's changed in millions and millions of years that's an alligator these things live in Texas they're here in the state yeah yeah people fish for them and they get fuckin oh man look that that one right there is clear that is an head of an alligator in the body of a fish yeah it's called a what an alligator gar and their body is armored like they're those those scales you have to cut through them with wire cutters like if you try to cut through that shit with like a regular like a buck knife or something like that no offense to buck you know like a Swiss Army knife or some shit it's not good enough man look at the size that one that guy's holding in the in the water look at the fucking size of the thing pull up giant alligator gar see if you because I think I think they get into the hundreds of pounds I mean what are you catching these with what does bait for this like it's a good question something big Jesus Christ but they look at the one of the operators one home in the mouth of it look at that fuck I saw a glimpse of that pop up out of the water I cut my own line I'd say fuck that fucking look at that thing it's such a creepy old dinosaur I mean at towers over that guy it's not even close eight feet three inches long 230 pounds that's soul and that's a freshwater animal - - 327 Broken Bow Lake Oklahoma - dolphin stuck together look at that thing and you look at that that's through that's good you cut through all that they caught that one in Nicaragua so I guess they're all everywhere but yeah you take them you got to cut through that scale that scaly outside with wire cutters and then once you get through all that you you take the meat and they really like to smoke in it put it on a smoker that's apparently the best way this guy's little baby ones in his fish tank they're a vicious little creature I mean they actually stay I mean that's what blows me away as they start that small yeah and he's fucking with him right here yeah well you can I think you can have him in a fish tank oh he's feeding him a fish oh yeah that's a whole fish yeah dinosaurs man yeah how long have our Gator guards been around find out I think I'm gonna guess I'm gonna guess thirty million years they've been that way it might be more thirty million alligators I think it's been they've been around before the dinosaurs straight done yeah they've been around I think in the same form since before that meteor hit looking like that yeah I think so might be wrong our subscription is 1803 the first description of them yeah but like how long have they been in that you find that out how would you find that out yeah whatever oldest fuck dinosaur fishing I mean I'm used to seeing those people pull out big carp and catfish yeah I've never I've never seen anything like that yeah those are big-ass fish they bow hunt for them - that's what I was gonna ask you one picture looked like it had a bow in it yeah all right so they do yeah a lot of people do that the golden knows those rivers and they do it at night too that they'll have like spotlights so you see the fish in the water you're shooting something that's like six feet away from you and they use like recurve bows that are made designed just for bow fishing and they have like a spool on it and you shoot into it and just and then they just pull it in by hand or they have a reel that's a about how they pulling that thing forever 300 pounds yeah it takes forever yeah there's some videos of guys catching them it's fucking crazy when you watch them fight these things see if you get a video of a guy catching an alligator gar kind of test line you got to have for an alligator rated braided line they have that like heavy-duty braided line and they use a leader like a wire leader big-ass fucking hooks damn yeah go for up to 40 grand for a aquarium in the Japanese black market it says 41 of those little ones like we just saw and say the size it just says that the 40 grand in Japan huh 15 note as high as 40 what would you say black markets it's probably illegal or so there's a article if someone getting arrested for it oh dude that was uh in Maryland this thing happened I I don't know the full story but it was called snake heads and I think somebody put them in the water yeah they're from Africa and they bred whoa I think that thing yeah they take over those snake heads that's a real common thing and sometimes what they do is they'll poison everything in the lake to kill the snake heads and then start from scratch and then restock the lake so that's definitely somebody put that in there yeah yeah definitely I think snake heads like I said I think they're from Africa but they're from somewhere else for sure you know what Oh monster on there how do you get the hook out of that mouth I'll be maybe it's just too tired by the end just gives up look at that yeah but again they they're good to eat this apparently they taste delicious especially when you smoke them it's got to feel good to fight that thing all day bring it in and eat it yeah that'll feel good I've caught some pretty good-sized fish but nothing like that I caught a Marlin once did you it was like seventy pounds not not a giant one you know but it was like five minutes into fishing yeah how long it take you to bring it in about a half hour that's damn good yeah it wasn't that big in 70 pounds for Marlins I'm not the biggest the guy that the boat said that he's they've caught him you know close to a thousand pounds a thousand yeah Marlins are giant I think I think they go a thousand bones they're fucking huge like what do you think whats the world record Marlin find that out though sherilee like right off a Malibu Malibu sport fishing it's a great place to go fishing it's just is not a lot of people out here that go I went deep-sea fishing it's a while ago now off of I think it might been out of Huntington we rented a boat just like six of us the world records thirteen hundred seventy six pounds caught off at Kona in 1982 whoo that's a big fish damn 20 damn man I mean that's a boat yeah as a giant fish and they fly through the air - and you're fighting them it's pretty eh that's they get up yeah yeah I went deep-sea fishing out here I was like six of us cuz I didn't want to do the you know fucking everybody leaning over your face and sticking in shit so we go out here it's in the more you know before the Sun comes up and we're heading out to meet the the sardine boat that's coming back in that's gonna sell bait to everybody we're getting everything all these guys knew what they were doing everything fresh everything fresh and just as the Sun starts coming up we hit a pot of dolphins I mean baby ones everything and I just was like if I don't catch a fish all fucking day this is app already worth it I mean they're just right next to is play and playing and if this guy was so good if we didn't drop our line and pull something up on the first one he buddy pick him up and he'd take us with his depth finder go find something else and we'd go by those big boats of everybody reaching across the bay look at that guy that could be you today we're having beer we're having lunch yeah I didn't know I just never considered it but I didn't know a fish could get the bends it fucked me up when I saw ya cuz the eyes were all it looked like a that a tongue sticking out and shut up like he's like you gave it the bends of my it makes sense I'm bringing it up and I guess a fish can get the bends but best fucking fish so guy you know on the way back in he's cleaning it packs at all nice for you it's out here it was out here where'd you go it was awful Huntington I think out of Huntington Beach it was like a product you know just hit him up and it's like a dude it owns his own boat he's like six of you come you know well I have plenty of room you guys gonna walk to the front and back of the boat fish wherever you want you had a choice to either Chum for shark or fish and he's like it's hours of me chumming it's it's kind of boring until we actually start getting at it so if you want a fish we'll do this so we did that through packs it all up so nice for us I'm all excited I just moved out here not long I'm living in this dump in North Hollywood I put my fishing - fucker freak so bad I called my buddy I'm like I'm coming over to have some of your fuckin fish but fish is all ruined but it was it was such a good time so I'm gonna be careful eating sharks today people get mad at you for sharks really yeah it's a new thing people think that sharks are endangered they've seen so many things about shark's fin soup that if you pull in a shark people get angry at you it used to be people caught sharks and know when he gave a fuck they saw jaws they're like fuck yeah but now everyone we have to save the Sharks save them save the Sharks what are you doing with that shark let it go there was a photo of was it the governor of New York or the mayor of New York City one of those it was the governor in New York caught a shark and people were pissed at him he's like no we fuckin ate it we cooked it up we ate it shark tastes good like it's totally legal like yeah I've had it in restaurant yeah yes good but people are loony with shit like here it is what is this yes this guy rips off his penis despite horrified sunbathers frantic battle to save his life on a Brazilian Beach Jesus and apparently this is a really really rare attack they duh they don't get a lot of attacks in Brazil because the water so warm but apparently that shark didn't get the menu clearly I think I thought I saw they thought it was a tiger shark that's that's not the fucking shark big shark well obviously I bit his pelvis off right where the dick goes mmm I can't even I mean that's basically like your legs you're swimming around fuck that man I just that's what scares the shit out of me about the water man that you don't you don't even see it coming at least if you're in the woods you kind of hear things yes that's right you got the hearing you don't even have that in a water gun you know you know what's out there nothing out there's growling in the ocean you know what I mean it's you you see red in front of your face you like fuck this is how it's gonna end all those Road gigs I did go out miles open mikes you know I've been thinking about this and talking about this on stage a little bit but the as far as death goes to go out of the most beautiful way I've ever seen any creature on this little rocket outerspace go out the most original beautiful way is that dove that got killed by Randy Johnson oh it's the best death on planet earth in that place at that time that's what I'm saying do you how many billions of fucking birds have been on this planet you know may have died of a Randy Johnson fastball one one one you could even narrow it down how many birds were in that area that day I don't care that one one and when he hit it it blew up into its own like fireworks yeah yeah I mean went out Kapow did it yeah and then he ended up winning they won the World Series this isn't spring training the same year they won the World Series he won co-mvp I think he split it with Curt Schilling and now he's got I just looked this recently he's got a company now and I think he uses the logo of like an upside down bird and has embraced it like but he was like that's not funny I don't think that shit's funny you know he threw a hundred-mile-an-hour fastball I mean beast he was a fucking beast now let me ask you this what do they do how do they how do they count that pitch they stats it's just considered a dead pitch they said it was a no pitch I just rolled it off like we're gonna reset on that Wow was was Randy fucked up like it bothered him I mean he talked about it like people were making jokes and shit and he was like I don't think that shit's funny but it's beautiful well wonder what they did with the Dove they should cook it because doves are delicious I've never I've had pheasant I've never had dove pheasants delicious yeah but dove is highly people don't know that and think it's another one that people get angry if you bring up pheasant or dove because it's the bird of peace yeah but it's a highly prized game bird like people go dove hunting and they'll shoot fuck loads of doves and take them on with cook I mean you tell people that they get so angry like what are you doing your cooking doves stop it stop it you want some chicken yeah those prisoners ground up into small cubes but not the Dove the Dove is about peace that's it it's a fucking bird it's just a bird it has no idea what it is like don't eat that eagle okay okay I won't eat the eagle like if Eagles get so plentiful they like pigeons do you think they'll let us see Eagles no never never never gonna let you touch anything I don't care if they're starting to attack us they were here first the eagle was in North America before the white man they were here first yeah man um our friends live in Alaska you go up there dude and you see Eagles everywhere just fucking everywhere they're everywhere they're like pigeons oh yeah it is I had this moment I'm so I didn't think I'm so glad you said that I my daughter's mother her family's from Seattle and they live right on Lake Washington they're good friends Bill Gates is around the cornice it's beautiful and they do this it's called Seafarer weekend where all the boats come out Blue Angels the whole nine likes beautiful and they were hearse for like a couple days before the actual event so I swim out into the middle I smoke a joint the you know that beautiful Pacific Rim weed they have up in Seattle I smoke a joint and I swim out into the middle of Lake Washington I'm just out there treading on my back floating having a good time and they have been saying there's this bald eagle that have been circling it's got a nest couple houses up whatever I swear to fucking god this is the God's honest truth there's a boat also for people who see it to to Eagles come out together in tandem as a team one of them starts circling hear this motherfucker nose dives into the water I mean grab sufficient flies off and I said like it was and the people in the boat or clap and I was like holy shit it was fucking amazing Wow amazing into the water I was in and boom out come fish and they were in the water I mean I have no I can't he's just sort of snatched him he gone begin and out beak so oh maybe maybe it was feet right at one's feet he had to go feet he went feet and boom lifted it off but he saw it feet in real life there town fucking crater in our hands yeah it's like a giant basketball player hand with claws I've seen those videos online where they like lift toddlers up and start to fly away with our little you don't know I think that's been proving that those are horseshit that's bullshit what about this girl I've seen the goat that's dropped once animalic that's real schmuck yeah that's Golden Eagles they're the biggest ones they're bigger than Baldy yeah they grab them and they I think they even have those in California believe it or not Golden Eagles learn a lot yeah yeah this fuckers about this one this old Fox oh yeah yeah that Fox has got his little boom the Eagle comes and snatches him it's like not bitching let's go no no no no no no I'm hanging our motherfucker motherfucker and the Eagles like alright bitch I'll let you go yeah it's funny that that's our national animal because it is a ruthless fucking flying cunt it is it's harmless you look in their eyes it's just death yeah just twitchy fucking death big old flying lizard you do a good ball do you go with a hatchet for a face he's got a pair of bolt cutters for a face I watched this they had this video online it was live videos of bald eagles having babies and that you could watch him they had cameras set up on him and everything was fascinating it and it ended terribly though the they showed you how the mom would sit and the dad would go out and hunt and then he came back and he would just his shift was like an hour or two and she was the rest of the time but he would go out and bring food back and the poor thing I think it was the mom going to get food it got fucking hit by a commercial airline line got hit by a jet on a landing and killed the mom and so they had to help the birds because the dads don't go you know that would have been the end of their ass so I think to help around him I don't know what they do they might they're savage fucking Birds savage bird Ravens - I learned about Ravens being a raving fan I watched this documentary one time this fucking lady in England had a rave and a pet raven you know that british that little that it's like an upside down you that car that weird old car it's just that it's just like a little like a parenthesis upside down yeah this she had a pet raven that was they said i guess they're the most intelligent bird and this thing she would keep the keys in the ignition in the windows down and she'd be like we're gonna go for a ride and the Raven would fly in the car start the car with its beak sit on the door she get in she'd start driving and then he would just fly right next to the car wherever she went why it was unbelievable I don't believe I could knock it over so she had like a relationship with this 100% and this raven knew and loved it like he was like huh let me go start the car for you yeah it was she would say let's go for a drive as a raven knew what she was saying out out boom in the car grab that shit with it's because their big brother big two and just turn those little keys and he would wait for her to get in she'd start driving Eli right next to it I don't know you might look for it but I watched they're so smart I saw a video one using a tool to get another tool so that it could get into something like they did these tests to find out how they intelligent they were to see if they could do problem-solving I'm gonna get food and so it had to use like one small stick in order to pull out a larger stick and the larger stick to pull out this thing that got them the food and it figured it out and figured it out quick like quicker than my kids would have it's crazy it's like this little conniving fucker there's a great video one of my favorite videos online of this one Raven that taunts these two cats into a fight it stars of them up into a fight yeah they're both what is this lazy bitch whoever you are if you stick your penis in that lady you deserve everything you got coming to you everything what the fuck you pick sit in that bag oh my god I don't know look at that heads your head some baby heads its dude over here just don't like it's nothing yeah the guy next he's just checking this Twitter he probably does even though he hasn't even looked over nobody's sitting next to that bitch though like nom I'll stand it all the way over look at it I mean everything about her looks weird she's like when do I kill myself today not today when healed crazy bitch with metal over boots sure you're goth hold it what does it say sure you goth by but are you dejectedly riding the subway with your raven guy you can find the raven provokes hats it's one of my favorite videos because there's two cats and they're on opposite rooftops like right next to each other and they're like wow look at each other this raven comes fucks with one of the cows like come on man watch this so the the cats chillin and then the raven flies over to where the cat is and starts fucking with them and after he starts fucking with them then he flies over to where the other cat is and he starts fucking with him he gets behind him he's like hey bitch what are you doing he gets just close enough for the catholic motherfucker is like not a normal fly back over here and i fuck with this coffee though so he just but he's doing it on purpose this little cunt like you could tell he's just getting the cat's riled up hey bitch look I'm a bird and I'm right behind you motherfucker cats like no no no no I'm gonna get this other cat and then look at each other the cats like fuck you oh fuck you no fuck you look he's keeps getting closer to the cat why would a raven get close to a cat I mean why why would any bird the only reason why is because he's fucking with him these cats are killing each other and this rave is like you dumb hoes oh look they fall into that hole and that raven is just hanging out with them an animal that can fly on the ground vulnerable watching these two cats fight fuck he jumped into the hole that is a crazy-ass bird that is a crazy fucking bird but also confident right he knows how quick he can move see coming in from the sides he's like no you're not done yet that cat is still alive motherfucker what kind of a pussy are you I know it's such a weird weird animal like once they found out that these things are smart they're like look in comparative tests when it comes to like problem solving they're as smart or smarter than chimpanzees Ravens yes yeah here is what I hear they're super smart super smart like they don't know how smart that we did the limitation is that they've got these feet and wings but if you gave them like fingers and have them like problem-solve stuff like like spell their name and shit and you know you give them some food they might be able to do that chimps can kind of do stuff like that here's one look at this raven it's a crow but now Oh crow Raven pretty sad what is the difference is it Raven bigger yeah a lot bigger yeah but they're all smart so this little fucker realizes that if he puts these rocks in that water that the water will float up and he'll be able to get that food so you can't quite reach that food so he keeps dropping those rocks in there to try to raise the level of the water up how the fuck does he figure that out man like look at that that's crazy Oh light versus heavy what is this one all kinds of experiments with them oh wow look at that says it's a casual understanding of water displacement by a crow there's the name of the video study done by Auckland New Zealand the University what just makes you think right look we always define intelligence by how much can it manipulate in its environment and where that throws this off is like dolphins and orcas and whales because they're really smart and they can't they can't do anything they have flippers but we know they have these really complex languages and calm and they have they have Baltimore accents dolphins and orcas have accents do that yeah I know they can't tell what the fuck they're saying but they can tell where they're from really so it's a regional thing not like bottlenose versus a spotted has a different accent yeah they're from different spots of the world different accents they make different sounds no shit yeah we used to fuck with bats when we were little you ever mess around bats no but I've been in Austin for the largest migration in the northern hemisphere Austin I think Austin has the largest migration like it's a largest daily migration of bats in North America daily yeah it's crazy when it gets dark out look at all those bats they fly out from under the bridge there's a there's a bridge in downtown Austin bro it's crazy it's crazy so we're staying in this hotel and they're telling us hey when it gets dark out that bridge over there they're like all the bats nest in that bridge they come out so during the daytime I was with my family we've walked under the bridge you hear that cluster is hanging underneath the bridge you go onto the bridge you hear that shit look at that dude it's millions millions and millions of fucking bats go flying through the air it's crazy to watch what is it about all does it say there was a pull it back to the beginning it says from march through April millions of mostly female pregnant Mexican free-tailed bats migrate north to give birth the NW Congress Avenue Bridge in downtown Austin Texas is the spring and summer home to these bats each night at sunset some 2 million bats venture out from under the bridge to eat an estimated 30,000 pounds of insects is the largest urban bat colony in North America and then you watch the departure play that video Sue's departure it's fuckin bananas dude you can't believe how many bats fly out like what that they all just pick this one neighborhood there's one bridge they decide this is our spot and so they just live in this bridge so somebody detonated that bridge look at that it looks like night it's crazy dude it's crazy I was there for this it's it's wild to watch you see them like like a swarm like insects how are they not running into each other like that and knocking themselves down that's a good question look how tight that is yeah people could barely get on the subway together without stepping on toes and sure these things are flying fly they say that they have some sort of a magnetic sense they understand like there's a frequency that each one of those animals gives off that's how birds do it like they ever see birds they move together in these creating patterns yeah no one understands it totally but one there's a company called hex HEC X HECS and they make this thing called a hex suit it's a very controversial thing but what the idea behind it is that there's an electric frequency that all humans and animals and especially like predators and game animal give off and that this this frequency is it corresponds to the movement of your muscles and that you give off this thing that that animals can see especially predators like predators apparently are really good at seeing this but holy shit where are these bad locusts Oh see now I've been through something like that in Maryland they used to have well they don't they do the cicadas would come through yeah and it would look like this and they would literally streets and the sidewalks well locusts sir look at that just grasshoppers under certain conditions right how does that work grasshoppers under certain conditions become locusts yeah I forget I mean in this five seconds he just filled that net up yeah what do you do with him though I don't I wait a minute I don't know if I'd eat that I'm down the giant shit yes I've had cricket chocolate covered though I had Mexico we stated a resort once in Mexico and you go into the hotel room you know they have like a little table there and they have like a little table full of peanuts with like like some hot like hot chili powder on them and stuff like that and then they had these crickets in a bowl and my kids like oh why do they have bugs yeah I'm like you're supposed to eat them they're like no way you're not eating bugs I'm like I'm telling you these the they eat these things and so I picked him up and I started chewing them I'm like they're not bad they're like almost like a soy sauce taste I was saying how are they done it looks like they fried him like they fried these crickets but they're so common that they had a bowl of them in the room you know you eat them Wow you know what I would try that I would I would try that I'm scared that they say that that might be one of the futures of when the weather changes grasshoppers turn the odds of weather issues the thing I clicked on this from says that just by swarming if it makes them become a locust that's it don't know if that's accurate but that's what the article is saying oh well it's the New York Times unless you listen to Donald Trump which makes it fake news I generally speaking I like to trust the New York Times yeah we used to fuck with them so we had a light a streetlight in front of our house and my brother and I would go out and my dad was like you can go out and play catch as long as you're in front of that light and I can see you so we just go start playing catch throw a tennis ball around one night we're just throwing it high up toward the light so you could see it coming down and this bat just starts you know swooping at the ball the whole time and I was like oh it's great so I throw a line drive at my brother's fucking face that fucking bat he's like it went right through his hair that the game peak it became you gotta be a fucking man it's tears take that shit of your face I don't I I maybe all the sonar coming after you know I don't know if it thought it was a big or realized it was a too big of a bug that when it got there you know but it would it would hit it would come right by your fucking face we thought is another bat or maybe something to eat yeah Wow yeah so anyway I was saying this hex suit yeah they they wear these things to disrupt their their big with people that go spearfishing and they wear this suit and you can like literally get right next to a fish with this suit on it's real weird like whatever this whatever this frequency that human bodies and just bodies in general give off this super masks it and they've been able to show that with these devices like that measure electrical frequencies like you you could rub your arm over shit yeah look it like these alligators they just for whatever reason don't fuck with this dude while he's wearing that that's a crocodile too so even though you're moving and there's no what you are and they just don't bother to fuck don't understand it see this is the figured out I don't know scientists super smart dudes but when apparently dudes wear these suits when they go spearfishing they're way more successful they love these things because you can get like right up next to these fish and fuck them up but hunters use them to now they're becoming popular with hunters so they don't work just in the water and so I don't know man I've worn them before I don't know if they're working and not working sorry it's hard to tell because what animals go by is not one thing they go by a bunch of different things the the big one is smell if they smell you you're fucked like the reason why camo works is camel breaks up your outline like a like a deer saw you there but oh that's a fucking dude yeah I see the arms I see the legs that's a dude but if you were wearing camo with all the broke like my shorts like broken up pattern right so that broken up pattern confuses them they're like what is that I don't know what I'm seeing and if you just stand still and you're wearing camo and you don't move a deer look at you and go mad and shit and they'll go back to eating unless you're close but let's smell you like fuck yeah yeah especially that real tree stuff I see these days looks so authentic like yeah that's not the stuff that works the best it's not interesting no authentic is not what works the best what works the best is like there's there's a bunch of different companies that make like really good camo but the secret behind it is just breaking up the outline doesn't have to look like anything it's just a matter of like breaking it up with like blotches and spots and there's a couple companies like Under Armour actually has a really good pattern it's called Ridge Reaper Ridge Reaper baron and that pattern is really good Sitka is probably the best pattern they have a pattern called a sub Alpine open country subalpine I think it's wrong but it's uh it's just a bunch of dots and splotches the whole idea is just to break up your your outline so when someone looks at you or an animal looks at you they don't know what the fuck they're saying so the idea is that this hex suit somehow or another it blocks out your electrical output whatever that frequency is that these animals can see and it's it's not proven it's it's real weird stuff it's like we know that there's something that gives off like these hex companies that they've that that one company they have this machine they'll show you their what you wave your hand over this thing without a heck suit on and it registers this electrical frequency and then you wave it with the hex suit on it registers nothing but if they smell you you're still fucked like yeah but anyway these birds somehow or another they're all giving off a frequency so when they're doing that crazy wave and their flight they're flying right so they're beating their wings together like a bunch of fucking helicopters but they're not touching right they're just floating back and forth somehow and somehow it works it's it's got to be inches apart inches yeah inches I mean there's these huge migrations of birds that are flying through the air and they move like fish in the ocean the same sort of thing right and they say that's how fish do it to that they have this frequency that they're all giving off and some somehow or another they all know how to move in tandem like no one's fuck there's no straggler either like one guy off to the fucking side it's weird I don't I don't understand it but people are trying to capitalize on whatever that is or hide mask whatever frequency we give off so the idea is that we don't really totally understand animal senses we've done a bunch of tests on deer they know they're colorblind they don't see necessarily greens and but they see shapes and they see they just they're real concern is movement and outline the outline of a person is very recognizable movement is very recognizable when they smell pretty good but they don't smell nearly as good as something like bears apparently one of the best at like using their nose mm-hmm bears smell anything like bears can smell a dead animal miles or miles miles away you know that would make me nervous if I saw a dead animal and I was in a bear country we're getting a fuck out of here fuck out of here my you talking about smell so this made me think of this in Baltimore all the street parkings parallel parking there's no assigned parking spaces and there's no driveway or anything my brother pulls out in front of sky Space 1 any guys like that's my space he's like snotting by space is fucking public street I can park her he's like that's my space in front of my house he's like dude come on so that night assuming that guy breaks into his car bust his windows out takes shit out of his car or whatever and he's like okay and he had some deer piss from hunting and he fucking busted that guy's window dumped it all in his vents and everything I was like I car this or the taking turns breaking each other's yeah alright so everyone ended after the beer piss one in there now that was the last of that shit cuz that stuff do you ever use that do you ever you don't ever put it on you know yeah that stuff's supposed to be I couldn't the smell of it just sitting on the sidewalk I was like good god yeah I would think a deer would be like why is that doe pissing all over self that crazy but yeah I want to know if people really use it yeah they do they use a cow estrus they have like a smell of a cow cow bull like a not a cowboy cow elk they'll put it on trees and shit try to drag a bowl over cuz when when Bulls are in the when they're in the rut and the females are in heat when they come into estrus and the male's want to breed them apparently they just they just smell it and they go fucking bananas and some people use that shit they'll put it on trees and stuff so that's why I want to ask you is that more to mask our smell or is it more to attract they're attracted to think they're attracting them yeah the way they mask our smell like their sense of smell is so powerful that it's almost impossible to mask it unless you use ozone and so what a lot of guys do is there's a company called o's onyx and what they do is they'll literally hang a unit above their head and it blows ozone gas all over your body and it collects like your scent gets combined with the ozone and that hits the deer and the deer doesn't know what the fuck you are huh it's like what is that smell it's just if you ever smelled ozone do you know no I have no idea I'll turn on my tank my floatation tank and you can smell it because they use ozone to clean the water to purify everything it's got a very distinct smell and when you turn the tank filtration system on you're not supposed to go in it for a half an hour and the ozone dissipates but it's got a very distinct smell and apparently that smell just overwhelms the smell of human body so when guys sit on the tree stand like I've I've hunted with my friend John Dudley in Iowa and he uses this oz onyx unit above us he sets it out it's there on the tree above us and turns it on and blows ozone over you while you're sitting in a tree so even if a deer's downwind of you they might not bolt because this smell is confusing to them like what is that fucking weird smell like they don't know what it is right like if they smell you the bike that's a dude gotta go out yeah like just a whiff though the wind will change like you know most of the times the winds blowing East right but then a little bit of West a little bit of West the fuck yeah they don't take any chances they just run but if they smell that ozone stuff they like what what is this fuck is this I don't know they just run take a chance sometimes they just stand there yeah when they're horny they don't know what that's like why people like to hunt them in the rut because when they're there in the rut they come out during the day like a lot of times the older animals they become nocturnal they just decide it's too risky during the day people are up I'll just just fuck around all night and sleep during the day that's when I was always scared cuz we would have there's deer running all over Maryland when you're driving those country roads at night I mean three four of them will come out crossing and shit and their monster you know their monster so we had beer whistles we don't know if they ever really worked to be honest water yeah you put it in the front of your car yeah yeah and then you don't hear it but apparently they hear and it's enough to but I had them on it would still come right up to the edge of the road and shit yeah date when the ruts going on they get confused they don't they're just horny and crazy they'll run right out in traffic it's smashed by cars deers that wouldn't hide all day long during any other time of the year just they just smelled that deer pussy just like minke imagine their nose is a thousand times stronger than ours well fuck it is the smell that puss it must be so tempting running out in traffic in the middle the fucking thing for ya you know and you only got a couple of weeks to fuck that's right you know it's not like they fuck all year like us they got a couple weeks to get their fuck on and then the rest of the year is so low - know how weird is it like what kind of a strange system did nature come up with where it makes the girls horny and able to give birth only like for a couple of like six weeks sometimes they go into estrus again like the other like a second a second estrus and then they all figure it out yeah with a man at Mel's yes L else I start smelling I fucking think unless it apparently as good as they smell a bear smells hundreds of times stronger than them they say a bear smells hundreds of times better than a bloodhound does I blows my mind crazy Myles blows my mind mile miles away when I Drive from here and I hit two miles I'm gonna be like goddamn yeah that's a long fucking way to smell something what they say is really scary is if you're in places where bears know the people hunt they hear a gunshot and they think it's a dinner bell so like if you shoot a deer you only have a certain amount of time to get that fucking deer out of there before bear shows up especially like Kodiak Island Kodiak Island is famous for two things is famous for gigantic brown bears some of the biggest bears in the world it's also famous for Sitka black-tailed deer so these these Sitka deer are really delicious deer and people go over there to hunt them but when that gunfire popping that bear hears as a rule and they go straight towards the sound of that gunfire because they know there's gonna be a gut pile there soon know so even if you miss you got it there's probably one coming your way probably no shit so you got to do what you have to dress it out there too or you just got to get it and haul it out well if you got it and leave the gut pile and take the meat away you're likely to just the bear is probably gonna go to the guts and it's probably like you're probably gonna be safe damn key word probably probably yeah I'm not fucking around the Kodiak bear my friend Steve Rinella who was talking about before they got attacked last year they got on a Fogg nak island in Alaska they got attacked by a gigantic brown bear and they said it was like 11 feet long it was huge one of the guys like it ran into cantwell that what happened was they had shot an elk and they you know when when you shoot it elk it's an enormous animal you can't really take it out on one trip you got to make several trips so they hung some of it up in a tree and then they went back to get the rest of it after they took what they they took what they could carry they went back to get the rest of it when they went back to get the rest of it a bear had already claimed it and they didn't know the bear claimed because the bear took off when it heard them coming and then the bear when they were hanging around the meat the bear was like fuck this and decided to make a run though but didn't know how many there were because it's such a thick brush and they said it was it happened so quickly look everybody had this well if a bear comes I'm gonna do this you know people have this idea it were like it happened so fast I'll send you the the podcast cuz it's fascinating it's a two-part podcast they did it over two parts where they talked about the experience but she's nobody got hurt but one guy wound up actually riding the bears barcloud into them and one guy hit the bear with trekking sticks like mountain trekking sticks headed in the head and the other guy got knocked over and was literally on the Bears back for several steps as it was running down the hill and then he fell off of it and that the bear took off that thing had momentum downhill coming at them they said it was so big like my friends were there four of my friends were there they were saying that they could see the teeth 10 11 inches from their face gnashing as a thing ran by 11 foot are you talking what 1,800 pounds so while they're gone on round trip one this bear had already claimed it I scared heard them come and then saw oh you're taking my shit and we'll attack that and Kane's actively defend it yeah so it didn't it didn't come by to chase him off it came to fight and it just didn't know how many there were and there was like seven or eight guys I think at least I think one two three at least five guys and so I think it just got confused there were so many people and didn't know where to go or what to do and then it got hit in the head with a tracking sticks and then you know fuck but like one of my friends had a my friend Remy had a pistol just for that just for bears but he had said his pact down and he like in his mind and thought well if a bear comes I'll be able to get to my pack fuck that he's like it happened so fast there's no getting to your pack there's no nothing and these are guys that know what the fuck they're doing well they're professionals with plans in place they're out in the woods hundreds of a year we're so weak and we're so look we're like just water balloons fill with blood hello man we're just we're nothing these things are like when you watch them fight each other and they're biting each other's faces and shaking each other back and forth and and it still doesn't hurt them you know we're so fleshy it's good we live here it's good we live in Los Angeles no not in the fucking mountains no Marilyn has you guys have mountain lions right we have mountain lions but I saw I went hiking at Fryman here one time I liked it for a while when I lived in the valley I hiked there a lot and I would see a lot of rattlesnakes I would saw a lot of rattlesnakes but one night I don't know it's probably fall it's right around 6:00 6:30 and the Sun starting to set and I'm just trying to get through and I've got my headphones on I'm coming down this hill and this fucking Bobcat comes off the hill and it I mean this thing was the size of a big dog stubby little tail it stopped right and I mean I was like huh you know and it just stopped it fucking looked at me and the first and only thought through it through my cuz I had nothing that would I got that I was like maybe I can take my head bowed it looked at me like it's your lucky fucking day and then it ran over the next ridge it was gone my I mean I was like holy shit yeah I've seen one of those with its babies yeah they're cool look they're big they're bigger than I thought yeah they're way bigger than I thought I thought when I saw it I saw it I thought it was a mountain lion yeah I was like look at that thing and like no it's a bobcat I was like why oh yeah that thing was big like 50 pounds yeah I thought you know maybe between like a little bigger than a cat nah this thing was like waste it was like up to my waist the fuck you I was like I'm dead I'm fucking dead have you ever heard a Lynx howl only because I wasn't Eddie oh that's the only reason I've ever heard it yeah videos crazy crazy right up in there facing now it doesn't seem real at all well there was one that got into some guy's house and the guy made a video of the thing in his house howling and I was playing it for people oh that's like sound effects right no no no that's what it's really making this sort of noise it's really making like what it's in his kitchen yeah I just saw this big yeah put it up me this oh that's the one it sounds like little kids pretending to be a monster don't quite do anything like neither one of whom's gangster they're both posers look up dick the clips of Leckie headbutt and one of them almost swatted was like bitch don't make me slap you they're not a slap you yeah that's a big animal links are weird it's a weird animal saying was an amused kitchen yeah yeah see if you can find the one with the one links is in the guy's kitchen because this fucking guy's standing over it's only like five feet away from it it's like you know I'm getting the fuck out of my own kitchen or it's sick like the Spirit is here to do this [Music] [Applause] we find this guy's phone later cover the blood playback his last video because I'm scared like I'm scared of snakes my brother gave me a fear of fucking snakes my eyes have a twin brother he's four minutes older than me but we've looked nothing like tall and skinny but I will say yeah that's weird it's weird but there are times when we speak even now and I'm like ah just hit like it's his voice came out of me it's weird that's the that's the weird thing but he was like what if he gets hurt you feel it no I don't feel any we used to we used to fuck with like if there was a girl in high school and I'm like I don't just talk to her I want to play video games he would set dates up and shit you know like hey you're the movies - oh my god but he was mr. outdoors like he wasn't he would play with snakes that he catch black snakes all the time we'd put them in an aquarium we go the the pet store and get little feed mice and you know they won't eat it when it's dead sometimes they'd be dead so my brother would reach in and just dance the tail and these snakes would bite him in the fucking hand how big Jesus Christ and he wouldn't even he just keep looking at the snake and rub his hand like okay and I was like you're fucking nice dude so one day it's my turn to cut the grass right we had the same snapper riding mower from can't buy me love okay that snapper with a bag catcher on the back okay I'm in the backyard going around three doors up so our buddy Jeff lives there and I see him and my brother there's a pine tree and I see him with a broom and they're standing away from it but they're swatting with a trash can oh my god they got a big s there's a big-ass black snake in there you know so I got my headphones on I'm just going around I look up on our deck and my brother's standing there holding this fucking snake he's acting like he's gonna throw I'm like don't fucking do it don't fucking do it I got my shirt off it's hot ass summer I'm back to minding my business I come back around a few times later and I just feel something slapped the back of my neck and I fucking look over this snake is looking at very high four guys I scream like a bitch I grabbed it I threw it on the fucking ground my brother's like don't I put that blade down I thought that bad I said there's your fucking snake you son of a bitch he would do shit like he'd catch little ones I can't remember are they garter gardener snakes maybe GART just a tiny ones I think they're called garter right yeah

just open up the back door chuck it in the yard and it slithers off into the swamps I mean Florida's all filled with swamps and the pythons thrive there come on yeah I didn't know that no no dude there's a giant problem with Python because of a man again be this easy money not for Python hunters who grapple with Everglades Giants for eight dollars and 10 cents an hour fucking they're so big dude they found one of them that had eaten an alligator and the alligator was popping out of its body they were both dead they were both dead floating in the water but that's this fucking 8-foot alligator was inside this pythons body Jesus Christ look at this one a hundred and forty four pound reptile up on a levee they dispatched it with a nine-millimeter pistol shot to the head inside they found seven or 80 eggs see there fucking there's a plague of them the Everglades there's so many leg it what is it yeah more than 800 caught this year this year yep six months into the year yeah and what may be the most successful program ever aimed at the huge constrictors that are killing the Everglades mammals wading birds and alligators and alligators motherfucker alligators yeah they have Python catching contests they track them with dogs they're doing everything they can but they're armed you know they're not put a dent in them there's so many of them out there man I used to watch the the gator on where they'd shoot him and oh yeah you just want peace swampy yeah yeah because the first they were extinct and then they dialed that back oh fuck now they're over running shit go and get him well I used to live in Florida when they were going extinct what is this one deer from as a deer that was inside look at what the size of that deer that's a big deer and it's inside this Python fuck Jesus Christ that's funny it said we have people don't have jobs who have day jobs people have night jobs some people have computer jobs technical jobs and they're all hunters herpetologist military veterans all these people are doing this going to the Everglades trying to solve this problem they're saying adventure and a desire to defend the Everglades what throws me is the fight the fight that the snake gives you that's my maybe one day you're definitely you're not gonna bat a thousand at that job I mean they're capable of killing people for sure when they get that big where they can swallow a deer I mean a deer hugger that's a small deer I mean it's not big like a a giant mule deer anything through that one that they caught what in the fire me that's five grown men a good distance apart and there's still some boughs in that thing it's 132 pounds seventeen feet long Wow Jesus Christ that is a big fucking animal matters and this is all just from assholes cuz just assholes just chucking them into the woods and Wiliam I'm done with a little thing bit me in the hand I can't my mouth is open I can't get over that that is now a plague because of that oh yeah I mean if you think they killed 800 of them this year and they're not even putting a dent right how many are out there god damn yeah you know what else they found out there Nile crocodiles they have a shoot to kill order on Nile crocodiles so some ass fuck dickwad let Nile crocodiles loose and they think there might be breeding populations of Nile crocodiles those 28 years monsters eat wildebeest shit with teeth like the size of our hands and two days ago this guy was doing a Baptist baptism and this dude in Ethiopia and as he's in the middle of doing the baptism fucking crocodile lunges up out of the water and snatches him in front of his whole congregation and brought him under yeah crocodile jumps from Ethiopian Lake and kills pastor during mass baptism man I am I worked in a junk yard growing up my friend's dad had a junk yard out in Mount Airy was called Mount Airy Auto Wrecking and there was one day where so we would have our own yard car we're driving where we we were in charge where younger kids so he would like you're gonna go get all the aluminum you're gonna basically clean up a junkyard of all the loose illumine I'm gonna put it in these bins well melt it down and they sell it off and like these little trays you know and one day I hear this we had a bunch of feral cats but we didn't have any dogs and one day I hear this fucking like growling eyes her and I look over and there's a fucking rabid raccoon it had one solid white eye one solid blue eye and it's bouncing just up and down it's not charging us and we're like what fuck we start throwing rocks and shit at it and then we're like maybe it's protecting babies we don't know what the fuck this thing's doing so we go down to tell his and this customers down there this is out in the country its customers down he's like I got a pistol in my fucking car he brings this thing up to to the dome to put it down to to took one to the head and it just was laying down ground to put this rabid raccoon was rabid it was testing yes the only ride had to had whatever animal control come out taken away and shit what does rabies come from like something has to be like I always thought thought about like VD whose patients zero right what dirty motherfuckers out there giving everybody syphilis what did you have to do to get gonorrhea cuz it's crazy that there's diseases that kill people like Al Capone he got killed by syphilis I know that yeah killed by some shit that you get from fuckin yeah let him eat him alive they let him doing is that what they did that's what I've read before like they couldn't get him on anything so they got him on tax evasion and then when he developed syphilis they didn't treat it oh really and then he lost his mind he just ate his brain away went crazy Al Capone bro did you know that syphilis was the reason why all those dudes in the olden days had powdered wigs no yeah man man I should come here for my education we've covered this several times I'll just be really brief there was these Royals from was it France something like that Jamie will come up the story but they got syphilis and to cover their syphilis they started wearing wigs and syphilis was running rampant through the this neighbor all these rich people started wearing wigs these big-ass wigs can I ask you what do you was it eating their skin like was it like a psoriasis and shit they you was noticeable how the hair fell out falls out a big patchy that's the only reason they did it yeah I thought it was all to be majestic you know it became that see it became that and the bigger the wig though the more money you had like if you had a lot of money you get a big crazy weight that's why we call like rich people big wigs they're crazy you that why people powdered wigs like those guys and it all came out these two brothers I think there were serious for nearly two centuries powdered wigs called per ooks we're all the rage the cheek cheek hair pieces would have become pop wouldn't would have never become popular however if it hadn't been for a venereal disease a pair of self-conscious kings and poorer hair hygiene the proof story begins like many others with syphilis by 1580 the STD had become where the worst epidemics astride Eastern Europe was strike Europe rather since the Black Plague and according to William closed an infinite multitude of syphilis patients clogged London's hospitals and more filtered each day without antibiotics victim faced the full brunt of the disease open sores nasty rash is blindness dementia and patchy hair loss baldness swept the land and so these dudes louis xiv is only 17 when his mop started thinning worried about baldness with her his reputation louis hired 48 wigmaker's to save his image five years later the King of England Louie's cousin Charles the second did the same thing when his hair started to go gray both men likely had syphilis courtiers as how you say that courtiers I would go with that and other aristocrats immediately copied the two kings they sported wigs and the style trickled down to the upper middle class your Europe's newest fad was born in that crazy it is see where he says there the the bill for large elaborate per ooks balloon to as high as 800 shillings that term the word bigwig was coined to describe snobs who could afford big poufy Perutz hmm so the average was 25 and they're paying upwards of 800 yeah look at these dudes they had like crazy wigs look who those wigs shit all because of an STD yeah they all were bald with fucking sores and shit everywhere looks like one on his face losing his teeth still still fucking alright so I was still fucking oh yeah well the semi getting a semi-hard yeah shooting their poison into people what an education here well imagine life before antibiotics I can't imagine life before like the 80s I mean how people did shit like when we were having a baby I thought about like how did people do this in the covered wagon huh like just going yeah they still doing bathtubs these assholes and rice fields I was reading these things about these ladies that will go out in rice fields and stand and to hold and they'll don't drop it into the water I don't know if it goes in water but they just natural and squat and then they'll just have it and have someone there to catch it and just like fuck I was like now I think in Baltimore Mercy it's called Mercy Hospital they were the first I'm pretty sure they pioneered the underwater birth like you can go get in a tub they're a big tub and then they say I guess that's the most natural way to have a baby I guess it makes sense if you're in a placenta and you're just basically transferring into another one before you come out instead of just boom out but they say it's I don't know how it's natural I mean how can it be natural water is not attached to us breathe well I think I don't know laughs quick and bring up hmm yeah and it's in like a tank and you sit she sits in there and then they just deliver it in this big big water tank like has a kid breathing when they're in the womb I don't I never thought about that I've literally never thought about that I know they're attached to the umbilical cord biblical cord they're in there they're all curled up in the fetal position how they get in there like what's is it going through the cord I mean I think all life comes to the other right the belt comes through the cord yeah so do they not have to breathe while they're still attached to the cord how does that work here it goes the fetus is not actually breathing the monster the mother breeds for the fetus and essential oxygen is passed to the fetus through the umbilical cord yeah the fetus does not make breathing like movements though these begin at nine weeks of pregnancy and allow the fetus to practice this breathing movement fuck man that is just you know what's really weird you take a baby you chuck them in the water they immediately hold their breath they know exactly what to do but monkeys don't throw a monkey in the water they fucking panic they start breathing water and they die really chimps too and I can't I can't get over the education he's telling everybody all you know chinchillas drown in the water you know try yeah there's something about people like we know how to hold our breath even when we're babies if someone takes to look like that Nirvana picture yeah remember yeah that baby that's a real baby swimming like kids love it as long as you do it to him on an early age and you're there to catch them oh this is horrible don't watch this I don't tell me this I don't wanna see this fucking baptism that slamming this baby into the water what what race is that would Greek Orthodox loose yeah fuck that that's crazy shit i watch somebody say I think Segura sent me that like what is that for babies in a pool and that light just popped up let's end all this baby stuff that's how a horrible thing that they do they smash that kid into the water and pick them up by their arms and smash them down in the water again and they do it a bunch of times then they cut his dick yeah you dick don't look pretty bro no cut it up bro one day old dick cut it up man slice slice it dice I was glad I didn't have a boy because I I you you have to you have to girls all girls all girls three girls three girls if you had a boy would you get into circumcised no see I was glad I didn't have to make that decision yes like I am like I am but I was like but I do that no way dude sometimes they lose their dick sometimes it gets infected it happens every year really yes every years the shoddy little syringe every year kids get infections from circumcisions and they lose their dick every year also kids this has happened multiple times kids have been circumcised by a traditional you know what is it a mole or with a rabbi and the rabbi's had herpes and they've transferred it because the rabbi has to suck the kids dick stop the bleeding yes they still do that yes yes they still do that and they still defend it it's a traditional way of doing it and you're giving it herpes you people have given the babies herpes and the kids have died from it yeah they've died from it yeah I didn't know that still was going down they suck the baby penis and a fucking video of this one rabbi explaining the necessity of doing this because it's the part of the ancient book it's in the Torah wherever it is Robert Bakker estimates 229 deaths per year from circumcision in the United States Bollinger estimates at approximately one hundred and nineteen infant boys died from circumcision related each year in the u.s. 1.3 percent of all male neonatal deaths from all causes are from circumcision these are several cases this there are several case reports of death in the medical literature yeah people die all the time from circumcision we just understand that folks this is an elected unnecessary surgery that you're doing to a fucking baby and there's no medical reason to do it though aids prevents a people say stupid shit like that does no it doesn't make any sense there's a lot of people that are doing it to justify the fact they've done it forever and try to come up with wool hygiene wash your dick you dirty bitch walk open water wash your dick I watched a guy at the gym one time as the old dude stood underneath you know the hand dryers with his balls he rolled his circumcised dick down to drive it dude that's a dude I don't know if those numbers are accurate that you just read that we just pulled off found another article talking about it and this is an Australian link to talking about the same information it says that yeah bye according to say that not all deaths that might be circumcision related are officially recorded oh there might be more so they hide it guess they say it's an infection or something like that I mean I yeah man it's unnecessary it's yeah it's barbaric they're gonna look back on this 100 years 500 from now and they're gonna make fun of it the same way we make fun of powder wigs but it's even worse because you're doing it to babies yeah babies Kenny didn't have any of you say by the time they're adult they're like what happened to my dick exactly my god we just thought it was ugly we had you cut cut yeah I mean I would you should I mean you should be that's a decision a person should be able to make because I feel like every guy at the age where they were old enough to make that I'll be like fuck I'm not doing that yeah I'm not doing that do you know that they some guys are trying to grow their circumcision back yeah this is what they're doing they're taking the skin that they have the regular skin around their dick and they're stretching it out and there's all these devices like the lip pole and they're trying to go back so they take in like the base of their their dick where it was cut and they're pulling that skin up a little bit every day devices they believed by reattach and grow well it looks weird it looks like a turtleneck it never really looks like like you know it's not a single layer of skin at the top you got a double layer now right it's got you got a rolled layer you do have skin at the top but it's like you know it's fucking it's like a blanket it's not like a sheet right right I can't get over people or do I guess people do everything why am i there's a whole community of people that are trying to grow their foreskin back they're really angry and they they feel all this pain and and that like emotional pain from the fact that cut their dick cut when they're a little baby and they had no say in it and apparently it makes you dick less sensitive when you do that and your dick is naturally self-lubricating the head of your dick is and as soon as they cut this foreskin off then it dries out and you know we're used to dry dick that's like that dry day got plenty of the regular dicks if you don't cut them they're moist the tip like you pull that foreskin back and that tip has got like a layer of mucus on ah which is why you got to clean it yeah Jesus Christ that was me yeah it's a weird practice man and it's it doesn't make any sense the fact that it's still around in this day and age with all that we know and all the risks that we know about where kids actually do get sick and die from it that's a real thing it happens every year who knows how many people are out there that have fucked up that are just because some asshole ancient tradition that we passed are just supposed to do it yeah yeah my friend did it to his kid he goes I don't want my kid have a weird-looking dick what are you talking about all right how often you gonna be looking how are you gonna how are you got trained that kid do you really think that that's gonna fuck with him that much yeah but he goes to the locker room and other kids gonna stare at his dick I know what I've been in locker rooms you piece of shit nobody cares nobody I don't know Joey Diaz he calls his dick the Cuban egg roll he wasn't he wasn't circumcised I've seen at least a hundred times at least many times for punchlines of jokes and you know we're hanging around the parking lot or something like that I've got pictures of him with his pants down like carrying somebody on his shoulders and his pants are down he doesn't have any underwear on you see his dick he's so crazy but you know nobody like was like I'm not hanging out with you I could see you foreskin how come you didn't get cut right yeah like what kind of kids you know what kind of kids you bringing your kids around well they they're gonna tease them we can't you kid can't take a little teasing yeah hey I'm sorry my dick didn't get mutilated by that witch doctor that's the fucking yeah exactly exactly you're butchered dick over there yeah it's fuckin intact right here what did it feel like when that oil was sucking on your dick yeah that's when your days old that's the that's the thing I didn't know was still gone obviously do they circumcised baby still but I didn't know that do they defend it it's an Orthodox Jew tradition I wonder if I'll get his dick sucked the news baby Hari was hardcore they were deep in the game yeah Ari was deep in the game Ari went to Israel and like lived on it was it a kibbutz or something like that one of those things he was in one of those colonies where you're you know you're reading the Torah like fuckin 10 hours a day deep he told me about that and you and it's a funded trip you pay nothing to go do that it's your said I'm probably saying it but is it not rite of passage or maybe it is I don't know it's a something that's paid for yeah if you want to go and he was telling us how he went there yeah he's a fascinating guy because he went the other way yeah he did they got him over there and after like he just experienced it all he's like okay this is all horse shit is crazy braids yeah he had all that stuff he had the crazy braids he went to Kinison route yeah yeah yeah without the head injury yeah you know kidís and all that shit came from did you know that all came from a head injury are you serious yeah damn dude kinnison's book my brother bill or my brother Sam his brother bill wrote a book about him and he said that Sam was one way and like a normal kid like you know calm regular kid then he got hit by a car and when he got hit by a car he was like like seriously injured bad head injury and then out of that he was a wild motherfucker oh it all changed yeah that happens people head injuries I am I had a good friend of mine she passed away and she was 16 and I was talking to the doctor at the time I'll never forget he said this about the soul and you know we were just having this conversation he said I believe the souls in the brain and I said why and he goes why everyone associates the soul with the chest and the heart and the soul and the harness on he said but I can literally replace anything in your body and you're still Joe Rogan but the moment the moment I even tweak your brain you can become a different Joe Rogan and he's like that's why I believe the true soul is in the brain I think that's really fuckin interesting because you can't manipulate a brain and still well maybe you can but you start changing even a little thing on a brain and it can be like you just said and become a wild man from that or the other way you remember when you were kid mmm and they had TVs that weren't that good back then and like the TV didn't work good and you'd fucking yep you'd smack that bitch it work that's that's with something with people some people you just fucking rattle their cage and they become a different thing and it works better but it's like a very inexact science like people gotten hit in the head and all sudden been able to play music and got really good at math yeah that's amazing Sakura talks about that on a special with a head injury Zack with oh man is it Tourette's or something they come back different yet accent that's what it was next yeah yeah that's real right yeah yeah dude head injuries there it's a weird thing the the dome is a weird thing you know what with all the weird fucking shit going on up there and all the different synapses and neurons firing and one little you know rock the somebody throws at you boxing the side of that done now you're a different person yeah forever forever there's so many stories about that too I've talked to so many doctors and a neurologist that are you know they study the human brain and it's one of the most perplexing things is like you can get the same two people one person gets hit the same way nothing happens and the other person is a different human being for the rest their life and they'll struggle with that injury forever and it's like real similar real set real similar impact real similar circumstances and you can just never know you never know what's gonna do it that's why these check talking about British woman wakes up with Chinese accent oh oh play this play this I want to hear her thoughts be sweet our ticket home phones down it's just been such horrible thing to go she was diagnosed with foreign accent quiz etre reports others who have suffered from the same change in voice had severe migraines only 61 cases have been identified since 1941 one explanation for the

no one can call people crazy anymore no one calls people crazy anymore you're not allowed to oh you you are so rude you're insensitive to her condition maybe she's crazy right maybe she's fucking crazy but if you think you're a fox like Fox can you know there's people that are Fox can you know about this about furbies skin are people that really believe that they're in the wrong life form that they should have been born at Fox specifically Fox some of them foxes some of them they think they're unicorns they think they're all kinds of shit so what this is where it gets real tricky because I think there's people that are legitimately transgender like they were born in the wrong body legitimately you agree yeah madam absolutely I believe it yeah but I think there's also people that are fuckin crazy and they just decide that they should have been born a woman or a man or they go back and forth what do we got here other kin other kin that's called me oh here we go demons angels Elvin Elvin polymorphs I'm a polymorph I've been thinking I'm a polymorph thinking about I want to be like one of those people in Avatar I want to be the Navi I'm not vegan other kin are people who identify as partially or entirely non-human a dragon a lion a fox you name it there's probably someone out there feels like they are more these things than they are human the other kin community can be found lurking on reddit tumblr TV Tropes and other online forums mmm I believe it this poor people look I think they get fucked up on their kids somebody probably cut their dick when they're a baby yeah we're all confused instant trauma I mean I have mental illness I have a cousin who is paranoid schizophrenic all right and my dad would tell me about he's my I don't know how the fucking second removes shit works is my father's first cousin okay still alive dude smoked a carton of cigarettes in three days whoa I mean we have no idea how he's that was a throatfucking left but he was really fucking he was a black belt in karate he was great at lacrosse he had Hopkins Syracuse big schools looking at him and then he'll tell you he started doing drugs and he went fuckin the Syd Barrett route and he just went off the fucking deep end and he's permanent disability diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and you know he's we all loved him but and he's fuckin hilarious like he'll play with it cuz sometimes he's on his meds and you can tell you like all you're dialed in right now start telling family secret something don't listen to him like not on right now is when you listen to them I can see the other times he's off looking over here like I don't know but we would like he had an apartment and I would go visit him from time to time and he had poetry and sayings and stuff written all over the wall and I'm like what is this he's like well at night when I'm a home alone the doctors come in through my window they drop liquid acid in my ears and they knock me out and they start taking samples of my body and after they leave the love of my life comes and I can't communicate with her so this is how I communicate with her these are therefore when she comes in to speak for me and I'm like yeah so his windows are nailed shut to keep the doctors out I'm like how does that work and he's like it's not so one day I'm over there and he's watching TV with the volume all the way down and the radio up and that's how he's watching this program and I'm telling you it started to fucking make sense I was like I gotta get to Lookout I gotta get out of here Gary I'm out of here on this there's a disease that I'm trying to remember the name of it but it it basically is when people are around schizophrenic s' for too long they develop schizophrenia themselves really yeah there's some people who are sympathetic to it to the point where god I want to say I want to say it's called Aleph Renia there's some sort of a disease that occasionally infects people or gets people that visit people in the hospital that are schizophrenia so someone will come like family member will come visit you and they will get diagnosed and and they will get admitted themselves and no hat no actually yeah yeah they get it I don't know like to what stage but apparently it is an it's a potential issue for some people because like look have you ever been hypnotized no I thought it was horseshit till my friend Vinnie Sherman who is a sports hypnotist works with a lot of fighters he hypnotized me I'm like whoa this is real it just puts you in a very bizarre stay you feel that state yes you're there you're awake you're conscious but you're in a strange state it's all feel something you like you're like like you're in a a tube of consciousness or something like you're in a womb it's very very interesting but I'm listening to him and he's a friend I trust him he's a great guy so I wasn't weird about it I was like I yeah you could do it God let suit let's see what happens I was kind of skeptical like this is horseshit but I've been to if you're been to one of those hypnotist comedy shows know my friend Frank Santos he was a guy who he's passed away but he was a big-time comedy hypnotist guy in Boston and in Rhode Island and he had a show and he I saw his show man he's do like one night a week it stitches in one night a week at Knicks comedy stop and dude we would go down there on days off just to watch it was crazy he would take people out of the audience like who wants to be hypnotized and he had a weird way of talking who wants me hypnotized he won't be hypnotized fun up come on he was like a round jolly fella of real friendly glasses you know a totally unassuming you didn't think you'd and then he would bring these people onstage and he would just be able to take sweetie you're gonna go under you know you're gonna fall asleep you're gonna fall asleep when I snap my fingers you're gonna think you are Sally Fields have right next to you is Burt run and you would see these people and they really they were like smokey we got to get away from the police like they really believed he had this one guy he told her today what they would actually speak like that person oh yeah yeah they didn't know what they were out of this one guy he told the guy this was the 80s he told the guy that the guy was having sex with Madonna he's like underneath you is Madonna and you're squeezing her booties your boobie her boobies and she's naked and you're about to have sex with her you're gonna have sex - you're having sex with her right now and the guy had an orgasm on the stage he's he's sitting there on the stage like oh and the audience is I'm talking people are falling out of their fucking chairs be crying laughing you couldn't but it was real man and some people it wasn't real like some people would look at him and go hey hey buddy hey buddy look at me look at me you're not under good come on come on says guys like ah and the guy would climb off to say he would know who was under and who wasn't under this guy was a man he would work with people who are trying to quit smoking right they're trying to quit gambling friend that did that smoking thing gambling booze they can apparently with a lot of different things with it but if smoking is a big one but he he just could do it to some people and I'm telling you quick you do it is fucking three hundred people in the room but he would be like I'm gonna count my fingers from the count of three you're in the car and the police are chasing you one two three what are you doing now I'll be the car the cops are chasing me and it was just instant man I mean it was it was some people they just fall into these states of mind and they're open to suggestions some people can be hypnotized and this is why some people I think join cults like I'm watching this new the Netflix program wild wild country yeah fucking I just are you crazy but some people I think are more susceptible to suggestion and more susceptible to cults and I think that is that's what's happening I think that's what's happening with with at this Aleph Rania thing if that's what it's called I might be remembering that incorrectly but this this thing that being around a schizophrenic person like whatever weird error their brain is making your brain tunes into that error and you start going crazy too as soon as that shit made sense Myles like I gotta get the fuck out of here cuz he's done create he's harm he's never hurt anyone but he's still you know these daisies boy he's probably guys probably the sixties not in any kind of shape but back then when he still knew martial arts majors but he never hurt anybody but he knew how to and so one day there's Eastern Avenue in Baltimore's for lack of a better term the Ventura Boulevard of Baltimore's shops everywhere and everything and there was this one woman that had cut his hair one time and for him excuse me to touch his head was a big deal for him this so he immediately fell in love with this lady her name was Carissa so he went home and got his guitar and the thing about this guitar like this dude would pawn his bed his guitar everything but that guitar was always out of tune exactly the same way you understand I'm saying that makes sense okay so always fucked up but always consistently fucked up every guitar he had that's how he tuned it that's how he heard oh wow so he writes her the he writes her a love song and he wants to go up to her shop and now sing it for her so he goes up he stands out in front of the shop and he gets her attention he's got his guitar and he's gone and starts off where he goes Chris I love you in Baltimore accents her name's charissa but he says Chrissa okay Chris I love you Chris I need you then he goes Chris it'll die Chris and I'll cry because I would have died cristinaw and she's freaking out like what the fuck yeah like your eyes so they call the police he gets arrested but he doesn't understand why he's arrested in his mind what did I do wrong I just wrote a beautiful song for someone I care about and I wanted to share it with her so my cousin's all of us were like we got to go to court and watch this so they bring them out from the back and he stands up and it's a female judge and his mom my aunt Marguerite she's my great aunt my grandma I'm sister bride's extended family big time and we're all there watching and the judge says ask the girl her side of things look will this happened he's like she's like would you like to speak on your behalf and he's like I just don't understand what I did wrong I wrote a song for someone I care about and I just wanted to share it and she's like would you mind sharing some of the lyrics and we're all like oh shit and he fucking Chris I love you Chris I need you Chris and all Krakus I want a dyke she goes okay okay that's not that's enough and then they're about to let him go because they understand I'm gonna put a restraining order he's under supervision but they're about to let him go and she goes oh wait a second oh there's a other still an open charge here on the books so we're gonna have to take you back to he starts losing his shit like what Maya Marguerite stands up into a judge she goes hon we dropped those charges everyone calls people hunting ball much because hon we dropped their shard that lady said first of all you don't call me hon I am a judge you address me as your honor we're all like we got school and they fucking took him back and he was screaming going us that they put a family put a charge on yeah he had he would do things like he would show up to their place in a cab the man they pay for it they didn't eat throw brick through the window so they had and they really did drop the charges but it was just a clerical error that never made it to the paperwork and she's like I got to do what I got to do we're taking you back today and he was they were bored he was gone nuts yeah fucking haircut but he would say shit to me he would swear to me that nurses would give him head in the hospital he would and part of the time I don't know but one that really blew my mind was um he had to scab on his stomach and he was like they keep coming in and cutting me and testing me they're taking me to the doctor today Ryan I think I got something I got a disease and that that cut I'm like what are you gonna do he's like I got a plan so I toss him later that day and I was like what did you do about that disease man he cuz you know what I did with that scab I picked it off and throw it away I talk about people it's not funny melted and it's not mental illness is obviously not funny but the shit he would do we would take him so be me and my two brothers his daughter and two sons on Christmas Eve we'd go over we take him a plate of food we'd hang out with them for a little while and shit and there be times where he's like you guys got a joint like we should so we give him a joint oh no and he smokes it and now we're driving back to my aunt's in the city which is I'm 12 minutes away we get back what are you giving him wait he bro he would rat us out he came over gave it a food thanks by the way they gave me a big fat joint so then we would play that whitey listen as crazy as this I gave him like he would he come he smokes he would come to my grandma's house when I live with her he'd sit in a chair and he smokes cigarettes like this and he doesn't pull it any farther away than three by three inches from his mouth and not just down done down done and he'll do he'll go through three packs my his mom died of breast cancer and she would say all the time I don't know how he even has a fucking throat left and I'm dying a cancer over here he is he's still alive still alive smoking cigarettes like that - still smoking cigarettes like chained a carton in three days what does a carton I don't even know 20 packs probably seven packs a day something like that a day for decades oh my god that is so crazy no word do you remember what he was like before he was schizophrenic I don't because when I was a kid he was already gone and but my dad loved him and would bring him out to the house cuz he was safe he was just crazy he would say shit and he'd be like don't you know don't give him a brick yeah don't be that's right be nice don't give him a bug and brick but my dad would tell me all the time he was a phenomenal athlete like I said great at karate he had a black belt he was really great ahead Ross know just he sweat he tried to tell me so Highlandtown is the area where my aunt never is the old greek town in baltimore it's not it's you know greek is long gone in that neighborhood but that's where he grew up and he would try to tell me that Highlandtown was the haight-ashbury in baltimore i was like get the fuck out of here at that garbage but he was doing acid you know early 11 12 and he dabble I think he said that early and then eventually after like into the college years the 20s he really fucking ramped it up and so he was almost before there hundred percent you know he made himself Orion the common story is people that have a tendency to schizophrenia or maybe they have a likelihood of developing it later in their life acid trips mushroom trips heavy psychedelics tend to bring out schizophrenia they tend to make it manifest so maybe he was ripe for him because there's there's no other mental illness in the family it's just just just him yeah man I think especially when you're young you know I mean think about how many people have had horrible horrible acid trips just taking way too much and tried to fight it and just been fucked up for days and weeks and then you still feel slippery you like life feels weird even after those trip I had a DMT trip one time that fuck me up for a couple weeks like for a couple weeks after is I'd be driving my car to be thinking there's going to be a car it's gonna launch itself off the fucking the the oncoming lane and fly right into me I was thinking I had this image would be upside down and though the car was gonna hit the windshield flying upside down down just slightly for weeks and weeks weeks afterwards that's why I'm scared of that shit it's because I tried to think about what was possibly happening I think it dissolved my ego so much and it made me think so much about how relatively unimportant every single person is in terms of the greater scheme of the universe that whatever it did to me had broke down all my conceptions of myself all my preconceived notions and myself so much that my ego was freaking out so it tried to invent danger so I would have to be more primal to defend myself again look out look out over there there's danger instead of me going man what the fuck is life what is this what is what is the energy that courses through your body what is the purpose of the human race like what are we moving towards why are we so committed to innovation and technology I had all these crazy thoughts where I was trying to figure out what the purpose of the activities of the human race were that it was so bizarrely different than my normal pattern of thought that my mind just started coming up with all sorts of weird paranoid ideas with things could it took me like two weeks before I normalized and after two weeks I felt Nora and I knew DMT again four years after that so here's comedians have come on and talked about it is it is it just I'm obviously asking you because I'm ignorant is is DMT isn't that the chemical your body releases as you die I think your body releases up as you die but they don't really know they know that your body makes it mmm they know that your liver makes in your lungs make it and they think that your pineal gland makes it which is your third eye like and reptiles it actually has a retina and a lens really yeah yeah the pineal gland it sits in the center of your Braille iterate is your third eye like if you look at like a third eye and the Eastern mysticism that's where the pineal gland is and now they know that rat while they're alive produced DMT in the pineal gland this is a new study that was done I think this research was published over the last five or six years so because of the fact they know that now they're assuming that human beings also produce it in the pineal gland which would you know it kind of sort of verifies what everybody always thought the Piney of Glynn is they thought they would call it the seed of the soul that this is where your your journey to the afterlife begins in the pineal gland and that this chemical gateway opens up and your soul passes through to the great beyond but it can it be like a bad trip on the way ass oh yes I've met I've been with people who have had bad DMT trips I was at Stanhope I got Stanhope high on DMT and I thought he was dying he's not he's at my house he's he's moaning and foaming at the mouth I've never seen anybody do that before I'd see a bunch of people most people smoked DMT they do this they smoke it and then they just go let me lay back and then this this overwhelming experience happens to them for like 15 minutes and then they come that's it and they come back yeah they don't move they just it's not ours no no no it's a quick experience ayahuasca is an orally active experience with DMT what ayahuasca is when you if you tried to eat DMT DMT is broken down in your gut by something called monoamine oxidase so when they make ayahuasca what they do is they take part of one plant which has dimethyltryptamine and part of another plant which has something called harmine which is a DM it's a mono amine oxidase inhibitor mao inhibitors there's some and medications and there's some is a bunch of like you got to be very careful if you're taking mushrooms or something else that you not taking mao inhibitors as well but so you take this stuff together and what it does is gives you an orally active DMT trip so as it's broken down by your gut it's like a slow release DMT trip that'll take several hours as opposed to this fucking rocket ship right to the center of the universe that you get when you take it when you smoke it because when you smoke it or intravenous use if you you know go to a doctor and it's going to do that that goes directly in your bloodstream and it's just something it is impossible to avoid you cannot you can't hang on you're just it's gonna take you to the center of the fucking universe and you're gonna experience life-forms and interaction with spirits and angels and aliens and gestures for me as a bunch of gestures that would give me the finger it was great giving me the finger like fuck you like it was very very very very powerful but did Stanhope one was the only time I ever saw someone where I thought they were gonna die and I was thinking I can't what if I kill one of my best friends like what if I killed Stanhope I yeah you know I was like mmm I remember I think I did it first because I think he hadn't done it before so I said I'll do it just watch me do it and just sit down here and then you do it next so I did it I'm gone 15 minutes come back I'm like you're ready he's like yeah I'm a zombie so I give it to him and you know Stanhope's been drinking since he was three his his body's honestly held together with duct tape you know lies down if he lies down and pushes his stomach out he's got these he's got these fucking what is it called ham no not hemorrhoids was it called hernias he's got hernias was his stomach will poke through the wall the stomach or is a his gut will pop in the line wall of his abdomen he's got a bunch of those got him all over the place just like this he'll pop up like you're supposed to get those yes he just just keeps on truckin he's and I've talked to him about this - he's like one of those no MRI guys nah no doctors no MRIs and I go I don't want to know what's going on in there that's everyone dead and my family by the way that's why I go to doctors everybody so and this was more than ten years ago this is probably 2002 while this is all going down so me and Stanhope are on my couch and he is moaning like this foams coming out of the corner of his mouth and jumped over and I'm just praying to come like please don't die please don't because I didn't expect this I expected what everybody else who I've seen maybe a handful of people do DMT they all do the same thing they smoke it they lay back they trip balls they come back in 15 minutes and they're like what the fuck was that about but he was mullet and he came back as I go life eats life constant cycle it's like he just goes on and to the next thing and then life goes on life is like yes I'm so far behind I'm so far behind was my thinking I'm so far behind with everything and I'm just like I'm just glad you're alive dude yeah no shit I almost killed my cousin like that I two times I've watched people almost die on drugs that I was with the one that scared me was my cousin we found out my cousin Timmy is he's allergic to it's got to be THC he's allergic to weed it just destroys I mean uh like that will fucking turn him gray and so this is what I what we didn't know so his younger sister had had a she was turning 19 I think it was and I'm living with them at the time I my grandmother just passed away and I don't have a place to stay and her sister my aunt Marguerite took me in and I'm living with them and my cousin Jennifer's like I'm having a birthday party tonight at the house the girls are all gonna come back here right so my we get some good weed from organ it was rare to get good fucking bud from the West Coast in the early you know let the 90s regularly and you've always got we call it a practice wheat that's what we always talkin got but this shit came and I rolled one all was beautiful it just had a pencil point to a while we're smoking it I was like let's it's February it's so fucking cold that would that bone show cold I'm like let's go sit in my car I'm gonna smoke this joint I had a 1990 Honda Civic with original rims bro we're in there fucking smoking we're listening to Hendrix and he takes one hit he goes let me have one more I'm like you should and you remember let he's like let me have one like this is really strong weeds let me have one more hits one more so we get out of the car and he's like just standing up and he's got his hand he looks like he just stole second he's got his hands on his knees he's breathing heavy and I'm liking you all right let's go get back inside and I'm walking down the driveway and I remember visually seeing that gust of wind come around the corner of the house and just plant itself in my fucking chest so I get the fucking shakes it's like two degrees outside ah we go in the house and we're just start throwing thermals and shit on and as I'm doing I'm looking at him and I'm like hey man you don't look so good he's like oh he's touching himself in the mirror he's turning gray starts sweating I don't fucking feel good I'm like go upstairs and get some water right now and it progressed so quickly and he looked like shit so bad that I'm over in the mirror looking at myself like I'm like I'm okay I'm fine I go out to come to hell my cousin his sister what happens and there's a fireplace fires going I'm sitting next to her and we're just warming up and I'm like he goes what she goes what the fuck's a man my brother over there I go he just went out in the car we got high and he's fucking freaking out she goes well there's 19 girls here and 17 of us are tripping on acid right now I go there's two girls scared of the other group locked in the bathroom okay he comes back down the stairs and he's just four he's battling for life at this point he's trying to get in the bathroom they think it's the girls on acid so they're not letting anyone in he's he just turns around and at the time we're watching I'm like look at him look at him now and he just takes two steps and he stands erect and just rocks back and goes face forward into the banister he crashed bust his face open he lays on the ground he starts having like a little seizure I'm like oh my and I'm where you I'm like oh my god I just fucking killed him Friday had just come out my cousin Allpoint jumps on top of them it's like you got knocked the fuck out they all start laughing I'm like by the way my aunt and uncle they're asleep upstairs and I'm like oh my god his eyes are rolling back in his head this one girl grabs the fucking phone to call 9-1-1 she hits nine she hits one I've already got his head tilted I'm ready to go I'm very good in controlled chaos and I'm just I'm about to fucking put my mouth I can't believe I got to get my cousin and they're all laughing they're on acid they don't they think it's hilarious go to put worry about this close and get the fuck off of me and I was like don't hit while I was like oh gotta go what the fuck I because I was I was locked inside myself I heard everything you said I couldn't respond though I heard everything right I was stuck inside myself he had come out now his teeth or through his lip here cuz he's hit the banister and the chicks on acid now see the blood and now they start freaking off like 17 girls of 19 I'm like I'm not taking you to the hospital we can't go to the hospital tell them we've got a bunch of kids on ass and all and I was like you just gotta suck it up and tough it out so he waited til the morning then got my uncle because it just busted his lip all up and he was like I just tripped down the steps and hit the banister but that was the second time that we almost killed his he did a gravity balling one time out of the kitchens sake I really thought he was gonna die I'm like why would you ever touch a weed again I was in New York film and Fear Factor and I was with some friends dad I don't know if they get high and they definitely don't get high on a regular basis but we're all having a good time we're at a bar and it's post 9/11 right and so New York had a lively weird feel to it like a friendly feel to it it was very strange like after 9/11 something happened in New York where it was so devastated and horrible that in the recovery process people were nicer to each other it was very strange so anyway it was a friendly feeling so we're all sitting outside we're in this bar we're having a couple of drinks we're you know it's right after filming and with the producers and a bunch of the people that work on the show and we go you know I go hey you guys want to get high and they go yeah be sure okay so come on outside let's go and I'm giving them that serious California weed yes I'm serious California weed I don't remember what the name of it was like whatever the jail break or whatever the fuck was ball but it's yeah it was really strong we all take this a hit of this joint I take a hit I passed to my friend he takes a hit he passes it to this other guy and then it passes it to my friend shy and she's one of the producers in the show she takes a hit of it and her eyes rolled back inside of her head and her knees buckle and then she just goes and this is where on the street you know he dropped dropped Carter Carter just in time Carter and you know we we had a call the fire department you know call nine-one-one fire department came they checked her out and you know they could probably smell we fuckin scar and they're like hey man what are you doing I go yeah we're filming fear factor here and uh you know she just she got dizzy he said oh she got dizzy huh just lucky we caught her man because if we didn't catch her she was gonna bounce her head off the concrete I mean she just went limp she just went like this like our eyes went back it just went like this and I think it was me and my friend Tom wound up catching her but it was um it was weird like her body just shut off her body's like too much pot fuck it like her body was more comfortable going unconscious than it was dealing with being that high that quick tell me if you ever heard this you'd be the person they asked so like I've never done acid coke I'm weed I've done ecstasy a couple times not for me I've done shrooms a couple times where I enjoyed it but after a while I was like okay get the fuck out of here you know what I mean like it's enough it's enough I get it but a friend of mine this was when I first moved out here we went and saw Pink Floyd at the Rose Bowl and we take a bunch of weed and some drinks and he's got a couple this guy and girl are gonna meet us there and she brings shrooms and I'm just like I'm cool I'll pass but the three of them do the shrooms and we're in the middle of the concert and fucking the pigs are inflating their bags and we're having a great fucking time and I look to my left over here and I look back to my right and hit my friends gone he's gone and I hear screams and I look and I look down and he's passed out okay he's gone into a seizure so Rose balls the Bleacher stadium seats so he what happened was he fell back and his feet got locked up under the bleacher in front of him so he's bent completely like this and these fucking idiots behind him I shouldn't say fucking idiots I don't blame him they got scared instead of catching them they moved out of the way so his head strikes the bleachers and he starts going into a fucking seizure and I'm like I've never seen anybody do this from shrooms and they're all yawn is he a blip I said I don't know anything the girl that gave him to him she saw it and she just immediately had though she started vomiting in her like $45 concert shirt she just her trip went south immediately and I did not know I didn't know what to do and I just fucking punched his face bro right across the jaw he woke up and he's like what the fuck happened I was like you just passed out and had a seizure he's like how long was I out I was like how long do you think you were out and he's like two minutes I was like it's about 15 seconds dude he's like holy shit and then he was fine after that but I've never seen ya I don't know if the head striking the bleachers what caused the seizure or but he just had this moment where he just passed out from shrooms I've never seen that before it does happen people get knocked out in the seizure that does happen I've seen that before the toes lock up people get punched and knocked out that toes lock up really I know about the arms that go up like this that this shit's dangerous this it happens all the time and fights I am the weirdest thing this this make me laugh just the weirdest thing I've ever seen on weed you know smoking weed so I'm a Oriole fan I'm a Ravens fan and and back in the day I'd go to Anaheim by myself to see the Orioles and play the angels and just nothing was built around there then it's a dirt lot I go by a scalp ticket a single from this dude and then I'd go across the street to like $4 parking and we're like it's a business complex like LADWP they're all in there but the the buildings earned a square and the parkings all in the middle and it's just me and a friend of mine one time he's like hey he's a Cubs fan he's like I know you're gonna go to the game today I love baseball you mind if I roll with you I'm like nah man let's go do it together so we go out it's early you know it's a 1 o'clock game so we're getting out there like 11:00 and the two of us are sitting in the middle of this empty parking lot of hundreds of spaces we're smoked we got sand chair smoking joints drinking a little beer in the parking lot tailgating before we go in the game like 150 yards down this corner this fucking pickup truck hops the curb and I mean like a hundred miles an hour's gunning right at us again with your friends it happened so quick we're like grip our chairs like the fuck's going on and it you know those like those Cadillac commercials on the dry lake beds with the Mirage and it's humming right at you that's what this fucking thing looks like and it's a big-ass truck and it pulls up and and it parks like just four spaces to our left this hundreds of spaces and we're looking at you like what the fuck this lady gets out and she's like what's up we're like what's up and she pops the tailgate down it's all happening so fast there's obviously her shit cuz she's just fluid doing everything she grabs thing snaps it open it's a big-ass wheelchair I'm like what the fuck is going on she goes over the passing door she opens the door up and she gets her friend out who doesn't have legs and we're like what the fuck is happening right now she sets her friend in the wheelchair and she's like you guys got weed you got beer we got fucking jello shots let's do it we partied our nowhere dude just decided to party with you we're pulling in here you're here we're here she doesn't have legs we're fucking doing this and we were like holy shit yeah jela they were the nicest Cholet everyone knew her you know she was a role during shit under blanket so weird should I think I've ever seen but I've been smoking marijuana right there well once you're when partying is happening the normal rules of life kind of go out the window the weird shit happens I'm a yes and guy I like the story like I didn't I wasn't gonna be like it's pecker she don't me to fuck out of here I was like let's stay here and party with these two doesn't seem too dangerous what she was a Christ so that but what she told me she's like you got a Cherokee I go how did you get in down there she goes you can hop the curb down there and park back here for free I did that for two more seasons all that off that tip of her oh she just big enough she's go right cuz you know four-wheel drive pop it right over the curb and go shit clever lady mm-hmm clever girl yeah partyin it's not good for you but it makes some good goddamn memories I remember it took me when I first started so I was a late bloomer on weed I was 21 when I started smoking I was 30 yeah you were like and I I it took me a month like I did I was ignorant to the whole idea of just having to learn how to smoke happen to take smoke into my lungs right I just that you don't I didn't even dawn on me I would just be a call it stick it in I won't call for anything so it took like a month before I got high and the first time I got high I remember freaking the fuck out and I was trying to talk myself through it like it's a plant you can't overdose unless you smoke your bodyweight at least I heard that one hell I don't know if that's true even a newborn Bream you can't do it I'm saying this shit to myself but I kept asking questions out loud like you guys hear my heart beating I'm dying and no one's even taking me to the hospital it's got a fucked up guys they were like shut the fuck up good out stairs dude you're brand new my stepdad smoked weed and we stole it once when I was in high school and me and my girlfriend and my friend Josh smoked pot over my girlfriend's house and we were 16 I think I was 16 my girlfriend was 15 and we got so high that we would wake up in the kitchen and then wake up in the living room like we would miss would lie missing time we'd be missing spots like how did we get here like I never forget that like when you're 16 you don't really get paranoid because you're not worried too much about stuff you're too stupid your brain hasn't fully formed yet right you know and I didn't really understand pot I have no idea how much we smoked we just kept smoking it you know when you're 16 you don't know to stop you just keep smoking and I just remember like my whole body was tingling and we're like lying on the couch together and we like couldn't move or like oh my god I can't move and all sudden we were in the kitchen stand in front of refrigerator like how do we get here yeah we were too high we just didn't know what we did no idea what was happening that's it that's the one thing that's cool about getting people high that don't get high is you get to see that overwhelming rush where they don't really know what this is what to do right Chris McGuire I got him hi once at the you know Chris no stand-up comic funny guy he's produces a bunch of TV shows now he's one of the he produces I think he's the executive producer of that Snoop Dog and the marthis - oh yeah okay um anyway got him hi and he's like I think there's something else in this body I think there's something else in it no no it's just that's what pots like today's like no no no no no this isn't pot it's instant pot this is more than pot like no this is pot this is what pot is now pot is now a different thing it's like you totally you go back to some pot from the 1960s those hippies didn't know what the fuck there's no smoking bullshit yep it's pot today's scientifically organized so my uncle he's in his 80s who's got stage 4 cancer he's he's on his way out and he's not eating at all couple weeks now he hasn't had a bite to eat like two weeks and my cousin takes care of me he's like I thinking about giving him weed and I give him we give it to him he's fucking 80 couple years old he's got Stage four what does it matter at this point like heroin whatever the fuck he wants to put him at rest he's like I think I'm gonna give him weed I'm like let him smoke some he used to smoke a pipe let him smoke a little bit so he goes down and he gives him some weed and he smokes it and he's like I'm just gonna stay here with you for a few hours and a few hours go by he's like how do you feels like I don't really feel anything but I'm tired I think I'm gonna go to bed and the next day my cousin goes back to see him with some more weed and he's like how was last night he goes I didn't feel weird he goes but I slept like a baby and he's like all right good let's let's try this again day 2 not eating after almost two weeks nothing smokes weed and he's sitting with him for a couple hours he's like how do you feel you know I think I could eat and he ate a fucking plate of spaghetti and meatballs heavy ass meatballs boom on day two from smoking marijuana and I was like keep cuz Marilyn's way behind I think they finally just have their first and only legal dispensary and he's the prime candidate for that shit you know what I mean I'm like go get him a prescription now and just let him smoke himself on the way out that's one of the saddest things about it being illegal and stigmatized for so long there's so many people with diseases and arthritis inflammation all sorts of problems that just been just you know just told that they can't you know they can't have this one thing it's gonna give them relief and it's not hurting anybody it's just a plant I got some CBD cream on my back right now farm works it's phenomenal it's amazing I can't even get over it no side effects I'm new to the CBD side of it and I'm just like man it really fucking works this Liberty lotion stuff is here oh yeah I love that stuff I started using it when I was I had some tendinitis that's healed it since but I had some tendinitis on my elbow I started using that I was like how many times a week whenever you could use it whenever it doesn't hurt and the next day you feel how pretty what you feel real quick I feel this pretty quickly yeah I had a bit of a pulled muscle on the outside of my hip it was real stiff and was bothering me I put some of that shit on before I went to bed I woke up in the morning I was like what did he go away it was weird I went to bed but it was aching and I woke up in the morning nothing yeah just so there's that stuff all up on there it just reduces inflammation I'm gonna write that one down and here's the thing is one of my sponsors I hear you can have that one thank you have that and here's the thing it doesn't it doesn't hurt anybody it's there's no there's no negative side effects nothing hi gang that she I got a bunch of those I love I mean I'm so new to I went and got this one that was um like super strings and man I couldn't believe it I cum Baines I had a rough patch on an elbow I was like I'm just gonna say this shit was caught in a day that day yeah yeah it's it's great well any sort of inflammation diseases like people that have like sore joints and you know problems with muscles that stuff's amazing it just loosens you up and it doesn't hurt you it doesn't fuck you up it doesn't get you high you feel exactly the same and some people would take it orally I take it orally occasionally but most the time I just rub it on like any part that sore but when you take it orally like people they find it relieves anxiety it helps them relax and it doesn't fuck you up but you can drive it's not like you're high right are annoyed it just chills you out a little bit just calms you down I just got a CBD vape pen I've tried the vape so I the vape pens don't work well for me marijuana ones I a plant works well for my system even edibles don't really I took two stars of death in front of Joey Diaz didn't do it dingos it's a shame thing to you this fucking guy he doesn't get Jaime Jaime has one of those weird bodies where he can eat like what's the most amount of edibles you've ever eaten 1300 milligrams the scene that's what here's what I feel like I feel like I would have to figure out what that number is go past that point and then dial it back from there and I don't really want to go past that fucking point you know 1300 - I was trying to test to see what a tip - but that's what she felt I don't know that I did I'm sure I did a little bit obviously I had to have like I did it again I took a thousand and played video games in like five hours in it was just it was really tough to play games I just like I didn't care I didn't want to sit there anymore so it's hard to keep my attention on it so it obviously worked at some point right but it wasn't freak I wasn't freaking out or anything like man subscribe I can't take more than a hundred I go into the hundreds and I start getting weirded out like well I I like I'm a 25 to 50 milligram guy because it gives me a little little high just get a little high and I'm fine unless I want to go into the tank I'll go I'll take a hundred and go in the tank but when I get in there I think I'd literally start thinking about things I did when I was 14 like why did I say that why did I do that like hey man forgive yourself you were 14 stop beating yourself up you're 40 but I literally will think about stupid shit that I did when I was a little kid it's it's so it just it forces you to examine anything in your life that you might have pushed aside yeah like you have to come to grips and make restitution and figure out what the fuck you did that for and why do you have those thoughts and why did you behave that way and you know how are you different now and how have you grown past that that's the thing about marijuana that it's a really high light it's a there's a lot of it people say it makes you paranoid and and it certainly does but I think a lot of what that is is just making you aware of things you're trying to not think about it's convenient for you in normal life to not think about those things but as soon as you get high marijuana is like hey there's some shit that's bothering you and you're not even thinking about it come with me we'll go to the back your head I'm gonna sure to shine a light on this yeah look at all this stuff we can do with that dress this motherfucker how about you clean this shit up yeah those pens do you like them have you tried them I have I'm not a fan I occasionally will use a pen but I prefer smoking joints yep that's what I liked it yeah that's it I so when from time to time I'll clean out my just my place I believe in just getting clutter it opens up so many different avenues to bring other things in so I instead of just throwing it all away I make a game out of it so I go out to the Pasadena Rose Bowl and I just sell my shit I just sit there in a parking space at half by myself and I fucking sell garbage and my goal every time is to sell everything whatever I don't sell I swing by goodwill I donate it and then I'm out of there how much have you made doing that well I would average 350 bucks which is solid four or five hour day out there having fun just yelling at people watching the goofs because you see a lot you see it's interesting it's it's a weird social experiment because you see the people that are addicts to whatever it is shoes belts leather whatever then you see people who are addicted to the sale oh that's just too good to pass up I don't need that fucking iron but it's 50 cents I'm you know what I mean you're like wow so you see you're like okay you really like you want all my leather goods you know they'll come running to you for musical instruments and jeans or that's the first wave of people they're sprinting through you have Gigio musical instruments so I just take shit my average was 300 bucks as my my daughter's mother and we were I was like I'm just gonna sell all her shit she's like you're not gonna make a lot of money I'm like I'll make at least three or fifty bucks it's a fun day throw it towards some baby stuff you know so I go out you got to get out there before the Sun's up you know and and you've got all kinds of people out there they're praying to Mecca before the Sun comes up and shit like wow this is a whole universe of different fucking people not only the sellers the buyers and this the Rose Bowl it's the rose of always the second Sunday of every month yeah what do they call it Pasadena flea market and it's at Rose Bowl you have to have a license you buy a permit and basically your Park at your space is a parking space and a half that's all you get it's narrow so people right on top of you so I pull the truck in and then I just set everything up behind it so I can chill on the truck and I've I just put blankets down I'm like and I just start yelling everything like what are you doing this I'm ready to do it now it's so much fucking fun so I get out in the lane and also play a game to like a friend of mine he would go once in a while I'm like all right let's pick the fucking item you should never be able to sell but our goal is you got to fucking sell them we had I had a VHS self prostate exam a VHS cassette and I was like I'm gonna sell this he's like you're definitely not gonna sell that today and I packaged it with a little rollaway and I was like by the way this is a hilarious Father's Day prank she's like that's great how much was like a buck bought it boom but I just get out there and I yell you know cuz I sold a leather jacket a nice one and this guy came sprinting with you any more leather goods I'm like I'm not no I just had one leather jacket and I'm like I'm out there like so my whole thing is I set it all up and I don't bring plant because you can smell that a mile away so I bring these little you know that brought this vape pen and I'm hitting the fucking thing and I'm hitting the thing and I'm all set up now I got a ten dollar table $5.00 blanket and shit and whatever doesn't sell by about 11:30 noon I start now it's a $2.00 blanket now it's a dollar blanket everything's and I'm scum and they'll buy books I'm like hi can I get four of these for a dollar I'm like you up so I'm hitting this fate pen and I start to feel this weird sensation in my chest and it spreads to my arms and it's almost like like I'm almost powerless I can't I can't raise my arms and I see the circle start to close and I'm like oh no I'm by myself like there's no fucking way breathe through this shit and I'm just like hey don't pass out don't pen I've never passed out but that circle was fucking closing and I caught myself and I was able to keep with it and I was texting you know my daughter's mild like some shit you know it's fuckin 6:00 a.m. she's dead asleep like if I if you don't hear from you in 30 minutes you know I'm just texting weird shit so I sell ice to myself and I start selling shit and by the end of that day I fucking sold the table I brought to bring this shit on I went home with nothing and I get home and she's like how'd you do and I go not as good as I thought I would cuz I thought I made 350 so they start telling me that everybody in the apartment complex had bets against me of what I would make and I was like what was the top there like 150 I fucking threw $650 on that table I was like that's a good mother fucking PS almost died so I tell my friend about that who he grows marijuana he smokes from the time he gets up to the time he goes to bed and I was like I'm hitting one of these pens this weekend at the thing he goes let me tell you how that ends I go what do you mean he goes I hit one this weekend at a wedding same fucking thing he went into a seizure thank you like he said for a good 15 minutes when they were like you're at the hospital he didn't know what a hospital was he was like he said it took him a minute to come back to himself and I was so I just recently tried a new one again I was like lemme just try it like an idiot but for like a good two weeks I had that feeling of like I didn't have my strength you know what I mean like I could be like yeah it was so weird all crossed this you think it's all the vape pen look what is in the vapor what isn't that stuff because there's a bunch of oils and stuff right they use Tomatoes wax it for like that's what they all tell you we can't tell you I did Todd Glass's podcast a while ago and I was like dude you've had a heart attack you shouldn't be smoking those pens and as I'm telling him that story his producers got this look in his eye ago I can tell he's like dude when the Todd have a heart attack solo why like a few years back I didn't know yeah young and his producer was like step-by-step what you're saying to me happen to me in Todd glass look I'm over shoulder I was like dude get rid of that thing yeah just regular weeds good that's it playing stop playing around there's no you don't need anything else yeah the people are always giving me stuff and I was like look I just like joints and sometimes I like blunts I like blunts this is the latest thing with tobacco on the outside yeah see I don't like that the the thing I never liked about the blunts was I really like the taste of weed that old fillies like that rapper it dominates the flavor right it's like cilantro you know what I mean don't change anything but that yeah yeah yeah he's got the shit and that's that stuff is this stuff it's got it's like got some sort of a nice tobacco leaf outside but powerful weed inside you just got to be careful how many hits he take yeah I bet yeah that fucking looks it gives you like a little elevated thing to like I had but Charlie Murphy was always into them and that's how I first got introduced to blunts I was hanging out with Charlie we did a tour together and then we would get high together Charlie was always rollin blunts I was like all right I'll try it now I tried I was like wow this is interesting I'm like it's different it's like it's different right it's good it's different it's like it's wee but it's also something else you know it's got a little extra kick but yeah this this Penn thing and just people always trying to find new ways to get fucked up like there's enough waste already established you know it's the the the joins are the best I mean does that I was talking about those doctors we were talking before the show and the thing he said about smoking a bowl is just the only thing you have to worry about the butane you're sucking in from the lighter it's not the you know smoking in glass don't put it in like taste it yeah you can absolutely I just saw a lighter the other day at a shop that was alcohol I've never seen that before and I don't know if that's aI don't know if that's any better for you or not but it was an alcohol lighter instead of a butane lighter I imagine it would be better but I've used matches before for that very reason because I could smell yeah yeah like that's with cigars like you're not supposed to relight a cigar with a butane lighter they stink right and you're supposed to light it they let the real cigar dorks they'll take a cigar or lighter rather and they'll light a piece of cedar and then they use that piece of cedar to light the cigar so there's no bullshit no no bullshit fumes they'll take a match light the cedar and then take that cedar light the cigar yeah I'm not a blonde fan no but I get it I've smoked enough of them but I'm like really like the test why I like joints cuz you can taste the we I enjoy the taste of marijuana yeah I do too especially good California weed yeah stuff we're getting today it's like it's nice it's nice we live in a good time we do live in a damn good time Pot mm-hmm I gotta wrap this up it's three Clark Ryan your good man I'm glad we finally did this bro yeah thank you so much again I would love to tell people podcasts yeah the
