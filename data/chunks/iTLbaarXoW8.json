four three two one dude I didn't even get a picture you ought to get a picture would you go with the blowtorch or the samurai sword and find the flag what do you I don't know what does everybody else do they mix it up some some folks go blowtorch it's that Elon Musk blowtorch I'm gonna eat a lot Musk that's good yeah you know why would I want to be like Elon Musk don't anus I don't want to be that smart why not I think that's bad for you now when I was talking to him and you like one of there was a moment where I said like what's it like being you and he's like it's not easy like he was lose like talking about like the thoughts that are bouncing around in his head I think his head is like a like a runaway train like his brains just constantly going well yeah I mean but but to be that smart man you come up with anything you could make anything to make things work for you in life well that is true I guess yes I don't know man I want a little peace and quiet I think it kind of dumb do you really think ignorant is bliss you can just kick back and relax sometimes you know I don't sometimes I just like to come home put the headphones on just lay back on the couch and listen to music just just listen to some music I don't want to think about having to fix the environment yeah I mean I see that too I mean I'm the same way okay I'm an introvert so like don't get me twisted are you really yeah really yeah really yeah yeah no I just I could play the role though you know I can play the role I mean that's all a part of like life well I think you're both because like you're really good at being friendly and like you're fun guy like you like you you're extra you have extrovert qualities well you need those to survive in life but is that what it is like you prefer to be introverted yeah I prefer to be introverted like I like I love my alone quiet time or I'll just sit back and chill but you seem to love being out and being around people to the angle I love that too yeah that's good that's a balance yeah that's a healthy thing well because you know in order to survive in life you have to be out there right because you ain't gonna make money sitting at home listening to music that's a you got to get out there right and showcase you enjoy it though yeah well I mean I I want to enjoy everything I do well you're really good on Dana White's looking for a fight oh you think you're very good at that yeah I didn't know if anybody even watched it yeah it looks like it's a good time yeah silly now yeah well you know me and Matt we we have a good time I love Dana too but like you know me and Matt really have a good time yeah Matt's hilarious ain't him and ray Longo who should have their own reality show I know and if everybody was saying that from for year like Matt and Ray are like the best duo ever when they're in the corner the absolute should be one camera that's on them all the time right I know it fight pass how's that right they have the option to go to the corners you can listen to the corners do you yeah yeah fight don't think fight pass has some pretty cool audio options but like with ray Longo and Matt Serra that's a that's a plus I know I know I love hanging out with them right they're so fun they're so long Ireland yeah I know so long I mean the epitome of long I'm one of their I'm gonna go up there next week and hang out with them actually yeah yeah I'm fine to find time because I'm going on for Brooklyn so I'm gonna find time oh that's right yeah that's right here um who do you have on that card Greg Hardy Oh interesting yeah okay cool I'm always nervous when I say that I know yeah cuz everybody everybody's already cast judgment all four people don't know the story um explain the story like he was an NFL player and it was a very high profile yeah a high profile player and something happened with domestic violence yeah he had um allegedly you know beating up this girl and you know did some whore with horrific things to her and um but somehow he never was convicted of it and the case was thrown out what do you does he talk about it no no and that's the thing is it we don't talk about it because I'm sure that's something he wants to forget about in his life so I'm not gonna be the one to bring it up to learn and I just know the experiences I've had with him have all been positive yeah it's hard right like you're not a girl you're not alone with them you don't know what happened yeah that's what I'm saying like I wasn't there so and I don't know how he is around you know with his girls yeah but I just know how he is with us and how he is with me it's fucking hard right and it's also hard because you don't know what really happened yeah maybe something happened maybe nothing happened maybe a lot happened you know maybe it's exaggerated maybe wasn't exaggerated at all baby lost his fucking mind yeah maybe it's just you know the other thing is this is something that people don't like to discuss but fucking TBI man traumatic brain injury causes people to do terrible things there's just just a fact ya know don't even know why they're doing it and they're they do wild violent impulsive shit I mean we see it with fighters we see it with football players I don't know what's worse for you but I feel like footballs worse oh man I'm guys head-to-head all day long it's way worse way worse even boxing is worse than MMA I think football's worse too because of the the kind of impacts when dudes are running each other you got to volsces super athletes you know 250 pound man fuck those collisions you watch me just your whole body aches just looking at it but when they have and they have to do that like that's what the whole thing is is predicated on yeah like MMA like for me I'm always saying listen if you get hit twice you need to grab him yeah yeah yeah and there's just a fist swinging right not a whole body just like you said 250 pounds this yeah even like the hardest kick I guess if you get like neck kicked if somebody roundhouse kicks you in the neck and that's probably bad yeah that's a good life yeah but like yeah or like wheel kicked like when Edson Barboza wheel kicks people yeah yeah yeah what he did Terry Adams yeah wheel kicks you that's like full rotation of your body weight into that one kick on your neck yeah that's pretty bad dude his fight with Dan hooker holy shit shit occur tough cuz that got tried to keep going but his body was just I would his organs must have just been annihilated yeah cuz Barbosa don't play no they train with us now too doesn't ya he trained it's out team now oh that's right here to Florida right kamo to Florida why did he decide to move deploy his motor coach was in Florida yeah we because I was with Mark Henry right hey Mark Henry but his more time coaches the guys who brought up who taught him everything from from a kid yeah and I know we reached out to his Muay Thai coach to come down and work with our team mm-hm and you know cuz I think he was in Brazil whatever so he came with our team and then Edson just followed him Wow yeah yeah that bond yeah well I'm telling you man he looks fucking good I know I mean he's an amazing athlete he's so fast his switch kick is probably the fastest I've ever seen yeah I don't think I've ever seen anybody throw a switch kick that fast yeah I remember watching his switch kick and I was like it's like someone took a frame out of it yeah you know I'm like a Bruce Lee movie and not only that but he does like he's got a pretty high level of intelligence with in terms of fighting he makes that stuff work yeah you know I mean and I look at this like because I've worked with with Mark de Casas in case yeah physically I mean just god-given abilities yeah but he just doesn't have the intelligence to like make all that shit work he's screaming out of the TV right now you know I know and I say that with all due respect yeah yes I mean early to mid-20s yeah maybe just trying to figure it out yeah yeah and it kind of pushed him a little fast so he didn't have it you know about a ton of his excellence have some Edson's had some ups and downs yeah you know cowboy fight was a big down I mean he's had the khabib fight it was a big down oh yeah that was a terrifying fight don't you realize how goddamn could khabib is oh I know yeah that was like that's the fight that I put khabib on the mat really for everybody to say man who's gonna beat this guy yeah he did to him yeah beat this guy yeah but that's what I've always said is that like if you had to pick like one thing that you're good at like what's the most important thing it seems to me to be wrestling because the wrestlers can just if you get a like a real high level wrestler they just dictate what happens they dictate where the fight takes place I don't think there is I mean you have to know how to strike you have to know the other things as well but I feel like the if you have a pyramid of shit that's important it feel like at the bottom is wrestling and that motherfucker wrestles better than anybody in that division yeah I mean but see I disagree kind of okay and here's why I don't necessarily think it's necessarily the techniques of wrestling I think it's just a waiter brought up don't brought up different interest and not not only daggers they're definitely brought up differently but like any wrestlers just brought up different toughness different level of toughness a different level level of competitiveness so like when you go to jiu-jitsu school the first thing you learn how to do is bow to mat and kiss the instructors ass that's it you know you bow to mat and you're learning self-defense you learn that respect and wrestling it's not about that right it's about dominating it's about winning and dominating so they're they have years of experience of doing that like just that mindset it's also about being uncomfortable all the time yeah yeah and it's like Gator just the room is always rough it's always tough like you go towards you Jitsu school it's a bunch of dudes smoking pot lamb back they roll five minutes to sit back smoke 4:30 roll another five minutes and you go to a wrestling room it's hot sweaty they're all uncomfortable they're all grinding so you take that guy and you teach them some basic jujitsu you got a champ yeah yeah that's just a mindset for me physical strength - yeah physical strength the grip strength like that's so important like for me like grips is everything in wrestling you learned a lot of that early so I feel like that's kind of the difference they're just brought up different yeah I definitely think there's something to that and then also being able to cut weight and still compete yeah I mean so I'm always telling my fighters now like when you have that wrestling aspera specially if you wrestled in college like you go all your high school years you got 50 matches a year so you competing 200 times before you even graduate high school and then you go to college if you wrestle in college you competing it's the best of the best in the best room and then you fight MMA it's nothing there's nothing to you and now you and then you take kid off the street who's never competed before they're nervous they don't perform well they're always at a disadvantage against somebody who wrestled right because the experiencing competition yeah yeah that makes sense the only thing about some rest because of the like there's like a tightness to wrestling and some wrestlers just never learn how to be loose yeah yeah yeah and some some pick it up quick it's weird well that's the difference and that's what makes some of them better than the other ones yeah when I look at you know the obviously tyron woodley yeah he's got it yeah he's he's got it yeah even Michael Chandler when he throw his right hand yeah but you're right some of them just can't get it and that's why they struggle yeah and they struggle if they fight a wrestler who can strike oh yeah yeah yes terrified yeah for a wrestler who can't strike to fight a wrestler who can strike is terrifying oh yeah yeah absolutely some dude who can keep it standing and can fuck you up special they can kick - I know I know but that but I think that's another problem wrestlers they fall in love with the striking earth yes jiu-jitsu guys - yeah yeah and that's nice and and that's what messes them up man I'm all in love with it and think oh I have to be well-rounded so I have to dedicate all my time to doing this I'm like man but you're getting worse at what you good at wise to watch George Gurdjieff fight I'm like if you watch that guy fight you I'll never know that he was a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt man hang I used to get so mad at him I do what are you doing what are you doing like he yeah I don't know if it was like fan expectation or just like in his mind he wanted to be a striker but I'd like dude what are you doing I think he liked it - I think there's something to that - something that they like I don't know it gets weird when they have that new tool yeah yeah they for everybody but it's ruined a lot of good fighters careers I mean you look at Johny Hendricks yep or Josh Koscheck they he fell in love with that right hand Henri's fell in love with that left hand and then when I caught up to him Hendricks is an interesting case cuz something switched off something something changed with that guy like that guy used to knock everybody dead and then it just stopped happening like you watches Martin Kampmann fight mind cam and went flying like he had the death touch yeah John Fitch went flying like the death touch yeah like he was some mash I mean he caught him early oh oh yeah they were flying yeah I give it you if he touched you you were getting fucked up I said it happen and then all of a sudden everybody surviving yeah I'm not sure I'm honestly I'd have to look back and watch but um I don't really know man he started throwing a lot of leg kicks and just like taking a little bit of steam off his shots off his punches I don't really know it could be injuries like sometimes you see a guy they as they get older they get injured they just they don't throw the punch the same way anymore it's almost like they can't throw it straight it's like yeah the mechanics are off yeah the mechanics change you see that with arlovski oh yeah yeah when our last kid was young dude his right hand was a fucking piston oh man he was great wasn't he yeah have you ever watched his fight with Paul Buentello it's been a while since I've seen that but it's like the perfect example of an Orlovsky knockout hehehe caled Paul Buentello with his straight right hand it was just black it just came right off the shoulder block and it doesn't come off the shoulder anymore now it's like it comes up almost yeah it's like his he doesn't he can't he doesn't throw it straight anymore it doesn't it doesn't seem the same when he throws it well I see him in the gym all the time he chained with us too so I see him in the gym all the time and and I mean obvious is kind of sad because you see him was like you remember how great he was you know and now like what age and injuries yeah no he's just trying to get to a workout yeah and that's not a knock one him it's just what happens when you get older he's 40 yeah 40 years old so like your workouts are different well it's also he's 40 years old with 15 plus years of world-class combat spirit yeah I mean if you look at some of the knockouts that he suffered against like Sergei Kharitonov against Francis and gah no I mean he suffered some brutal fucking knockouts oh I know I mean but there's the fact here's our laughs key this is this is like I want to say this like a UFC fucking 37 or some shit boom look at that oh yeah that was straight down the pipe yeah show that again real quick this boom I mean just the timing precision he was a fuckin savage back then yeah that was yeah you couldn't really be what better than I am yes he was the scariest fucking heavyweight on the planet for a while I mean and he had it you know you got to respect his career because he's done a lot and he's still good yeah yeah and he's so good yeah I mean he loves to fight you know he still fights with enthusiasm yeah he just can't get his body to do what it used to do yeah in the gym like it took him a while for him to kind of lighten up a bit I remember he coming to gym you know he's you know he's got that Russian that scary Russian look to him and he coming to gym and wouldn't say nothing to nobody but now he smiles let me smile it's hard to get these guys to smile sometimes so is he down in Florida yeah he's down to Florida when did he start going down there it's been like two fights right yeah maybe a little more than that he works a lot with Mike Brown yeah and I and they been working together for maybe long maybe two years maybe so he was at Jacksons for quite a bit yeah then he just decided to just keep moving on yeah that's the life of a fucking ramblin fighter moving different towns and trying to assimilate man is so hard single no kids yep but now you know what they end up doing is they're getting girls and like they end up shacking up with a girl because it's easier for em away like when you should use struggling a fighter you got nothing hardly nowhere to live you find a girl and you shack up with her and she pay all your bills oh really yeah that's what a lot of fighters in the film and that's why you see him end up like with a girl in a young paying the bills that's never a good relationship now girls paying the bills especially when you're fighting and you lose a fight she looking at you like this motherfucker get a job get a job you got bringing in yeah yeah it's uh it's a weird road when it's a weird road when you don't think that you could win the title right like every fighter wants to think that they can one day be like a title holder or be one of the elite of the elite yeah it's not the end the hunt it starts out like that it starts out like that yeah it all always end up like that though yeah but that's the weird the weird world is the world of the journeyman like when arturo gatti used to fight Micky Ward and we both knew everybody knew that these guys were not gonna win any titles but but you still wanted to see them beat the fuck out of each other still want to see them go to war well I mean but that's where we got to kind of draw that line between like sport and event right yeah you know because like when we and fighters have to also be real with themselves to is are you doing this for the sport you Chompy to champ or are you just trying to be a fan favorite right and you should train the way you want to on what you want to project to the world and a lot of fighters onto that well but if you're trying to be a fan favorite I'll give you a guy who just wants to bang it out like how many of those you got in you it's not many but something you know I you know Donald Cerrone you know he's that's that's his road now yeah in a way but I think Donald still thinks he can win a title that's tough no it's gonna be tough for him well they were trying to get him he was trying to get the Conor McGregor fight I had a bit of tough fight fan it would have been a tough fight for him but at 155 pounds is not a bad fight for him no not really in this but I mean the problem is stylistically he just he don't move his head enough yeah you know and Nate I mean Nate doesn't either but Nate took a lot of shots you know to the head so I mean it's kind of a bad I don't know yeah but Nate Nate is uh Nate is a very good boxer yeah make a box yeah Nate Diaz it frustrates the shit out of me that he's not fighting why is that because I like to see him I want to see him get in there I want to see him make money while he can - I mean you're only gonna be able to live this lifestyle for I mean I know he made a couple of million dollars off of the Conor fight but he hasn't fought in two years more than handle nothing else like but the Dustin Poirier fight that was gonna happen but then pouria got injured he's got some hip issue and then he pulled out of that fight I just I was looking forward to that fight I wanted I want to see him back in it yeah but I mean I would have loved the seen a fight and then never supposed to fight Myles Badal that's that's not gonna happen no why no that's the perfect fight it's great fight I mean that's the fight where you could have got like the Hispanic culture the Civil War and española going at it yeah that would have been a great stylistic yeah and like they would have talked trash to you I would have been dropped the ball on that needs to be fired I think Nick just decided not fight I don't know I do not know I don't know I'm talking out of my ass I don't know the specifics but I was looking forward to it but then I saw an article that said Nate Nick Diaz confirms he's not gonna be fighting at UFC 235 like what what get in there oh come on man last time he fought with Anderson Silva that's crazy that is crazy that's crazy but I don't know I mean I don't know Joe and this is something that we kind of kind of stopped doing man like baby they ain't got it no more well I don't know if it's he doesn't have it anymore because we haven't seen him not have it he fought well against Anderson Anderson's 185 pounder yeah when you lead down yeah I mean I mean honestly if anybody could still fight in their old age the way those two Diaz brothers fight their style yeah well allow them to fight longer you know cuz they're not like the best athletes so they rely on skill and just endurance endurance yeah so they can fight longer so I'm assuming that they still have something left in the tank I'm sure I mean they're obviously not out of shape they're both thin yeah yeah they look like they're fit I see them training I see you know pictures them with Diaz Yogi's on and hitting the bag and shit is you know who knows man I mean it's also like they want that big payday you know especially now and they should get that big payday but goddamn if I was the UFC if I am fuck yeah I think those guys are superstars I think the UFC doesn't know I think one of the reasons why Nate Diaz vs Conor McGregor was so big is because people love Nate Diaz - yeah yeah no doubt no Conor McGregor no disrespect to Eddie Alvarez but when Conor McGregor fought at the Alvarez the vast majority of the eyes were on Conor McGregor yeah when Conor McGregor fights Nate Diaz you you're looking at a lot of people who love Nate Diaz yeah but how do you think that happened like how do you think Nate got that says that star power you think he's like his editor he legitimately doesn't give a fuck he smokes weed all the time people love it they love the fact that those guys are like that I know man but what does that say about our fan base in our society well I don't know you know what that's here's what's disappointing to me that for whatever reason Mighty Mouse never became a giant superstar yeah that confused this shit out of me I'd watch that guy fight you know when he took ray Borg and suplexed him and caught him with an armbar on the way down I was like what the fuck does this guy have to do to become a superstar I mean his skill levels off the chart for sure doesn't get hit for sure and put on he's a dazzling fighter puts puts on show skillful skill there's nobody on the planet who can do what he does now he's the best ever he's the best physically ever yeah when the only thing that keeps him from being thought of as universally the greatest of all time is John Jones and John Jones been able to beat better guys like John Jones's fight fights a better caliber of competition because the 205 pound weight class at least at one point time had a deeper talent pool yeah but do you think it was uh yeah I mean I'm gonna agree with you there but I will say this I think that sometimes we confuse popularity with actual talent well I say yes and no because if you think about like Daniel Cormier Daniel Cormier twice being humble for sure rumbles this Rumble yeah yes knockout artist in the history of that division okay nobody mercs people like Rumble no kiddin fuck that guy hits home I know Jesus Christ he's one of the scariest I got would not want to mess it piss him off I wouldn't want to piss him off yeah fuck yeah I see him in Florida I want some I'm always like hey yeah good can I get you anything stay tight yeah as a scary motherfuckers Rumble beat him twice think about that and think of what he did to gustafson thinking what he does to everybody yeah I mean fuck man what he did a little nog or crow he just smashed his people yeah yeah I mean you're right I mean John yeah you're right John to beat a better caliber guy yeah easily yeah and he did it easily I was I was really looking forward to that fight John Jones versus Rumble very I was looking for to that fight I wish that fight took place before whatever reason rumble couldn't beat the best of the best you know it's it's unfortunate you know I think I mean he and he wrestled too so I don't know really know what his performance anxiety was based on but he had it you know there's some reason he said after he retired you know in the fight with when he lost a DC he goes I'm just good at this he goes I'm not really a fighter he's like I'm an athlete he goes I'm just really good at this yeah like how fuck are you not a fighter you smash people I mean it's he's a terrifying fighter but he just does not his thing well that's the thing Joe and I I gotta tell you cuz when I'm coaching guys I have to identify that early and what I'm working with are you a fighter you are athletes Brian you're a competitor or are you artists right I put them in um four categories and they have to be trained all differently hmm yeah I trained artists I got artists you got to let him get creative or give me an example of an artist like as a fighter yeah I look at somebody like prime example we just saw him Ryan Hall yes Ryan Hall is an artist what he did that was like art that's poetry when he did the BJ and but the fight world ain't really ready for that yet you don't think so no well it's getting there but they're not ready for yet because when you saw him when he fought Gray Maynard mm-hmm he's trying to perform his art Gray Manor wouldn't let him so who do we blame we blame the artists everybody said all BAM Rhino kid him out he's a pussy he fight the smart way pushy Maynard hits hard for sure so he fought him he'd over is like 15 minutes but when it works we can appreciate the art yeah well just great Maynard was prepared and he struck them off here's an example of an artist style bender stopping an artist score artist real artist pure artist yeah Anderson Silva artist artist these guys are artists and they can't sure you can't train them the same way you train like an a fighter or an ally yeah you can't trade on Mike Perry's yeah Mike parrot and I know Mike Perry since the first day he walked into a gym hmm and he's always had like this edge on him and his chip on his shoulder I think he'd make it this far to be honest with you well I thought he'd be in jail I swear to God why yeah wow what made you think that just as he had to look like he had a little chip on his shoulder he was always getting in trouble getting arrested getting in trouble but um I'm proud of him man like he really turned it around and you know he's got a good head on his shoulders well he's still in the hunt yeah yeah yeah I mean he can recover from the cowboy fight he's you know he's got some holes in his game you know but he could sure those up but he's got the one thing that you need in order to cover up holes that's power savage that's power you know I'm saying like even though he got holes he got power not just power he takes it well yeah yeah yeah you had a great chance yeah yeah yeah he's got a great chance toughest shit off his mind like he's an absolute fighter yeah absolutely so he's type of guy who just hey man get on that heavy back for 30 minutes now throw you some raw meat go fight yeah that's that's how you train him yet I'm saying yeah let him go right but don't you like it seems like what they've done at Jacksons though is made him more calculated made him more technical like if you see some of his more recent fights before the cowboy fight he's fighting a more calculated style I like the way it looks better yeah I mean sorry that works but the problem is sometimes it takes time to develop mm-hmm and that's okay like my pressure still has time so that's okay but the thing is you don't want to calculate his offense too much you calculate his defense make him more aware mm-hmm but then you when it comes to offense man just punch a motherfucker in the face just punch him in the fucking face that's it right so effectively you keep him aware and calculated it's like his attitude you just want to like keep it the same yeah yeah and that's the problem is it like some coaches and I'm not blaming nobody over there be but you just have to make sure you communicate with them they look I don't want to change the way you think right I just wanna make you more aware you gonna be a better fighter if you don't just run out there swing it wildly we need something to do before you can swing wildly what was it like for you to transition from being a fighter to being a coach is it it was it a seamless process or where there's some hiccups along the way no it was it wasn't a seamless primate it was seamless as is it could be it was no hiccups really because I can I can identify and I can relate to Rumble because I wasn't a fighter neither really yeah I always thought I was an artist so when when I was time for me to transition I said I no longer want to express myself by punching people I'm gonna show people how to do it hmm do you like taking people that are already good and making them better or do you like taking people that don't know shit I don't think people that don't know shit yeah yeah I like to I like take people don't know shit cuz like if you're already good so I mean that's hard because like if they're already good and then you like you win a world title with them right that's them you know I'm saying like God there's no real oh yes yes you gonna take a guy like this okay what would you do with Gustafson Gustafson yeah cuz Gustafson that weird spot right can't be DC can't be John flux up Glover Teixeira yeah it looks like a world-beating repeats Jimmy manoa I mean he's got world-class talent for sure but it seems like it's just shy of world championship caliber see but this better something that he might have to like go soul searching for because he might not have it hmm you know so if you don't have it said oh you just started going you know what I need to get faced just make a bunch of money do you think maybe it's where he trains do you think maybe it's he you know he's training overseas with you know he trains with a Lear the TV who's really good yeah I mean does he have world-class coaching over there I mean does he does he have world-class sparring partners people that recognize yeah so that's that's what I think - is it in Europe and some I mentioned is to me a couple couple months ago is it and you're up the coaches are better really and I don't necessary things are better but they're more attentive mmm they're more attentive to their fighters so they note so if gusts were to leave his coaching T his coaching staff I think he'd be a worse fight I think he needs to keep his coaching staff but maybe add something else to it we spent some time in alliance yeah and I think he needs he needed that but what he might need are just better partners mmm he might just need a few better guys to give him some different looks but I think the coaching staff his coach staff is fine I've worked with someone before because a little atif he used to come to the top team and I met all them guys smart and they're more attentive to their guys in American coaches hmm American coaches sometimes guy there's a bunch of good guys in Rome I don't need to tell you nothing you know so I think that's the biggest difference between like America and then like in Europe they're more attentive do you think kind of what is what's the reason for that it's not many not many guys to work with right you know so you know was you go to the States here so big is you go to our room there's one coach 20 fighters right the coach is just like wow you guys are good go ahead spar and whoever's left everyone get you a fight yeah yeah you know this that's a similarity with comedy managers it's a very similar thing like there's some comedy managers that have like a hundred clients and they just let go out there figure it out yeah to the top yeah I've seen like Kevin Hart oh yeah most had a great manager look how good he got no she's fucking Kevin Hart you gonna make it no matter who is is brighter and then there's some that have like a small amount of clients they spend a lot of time with them yeah and they they calculate a career together they map it out you know I think with fighters a lot of times you just it is a lot of like who's who's left who's still standing yeah who's still standing and I think you know being a coach a top team we have a lot of coaches yeah so I think that helps us that place is so big yeah it's so big it's so big we have a lot of Fighters but we also have a lot of coaches so we can give a man a Nunez 100% she weak she is whatever she wants yeah you know so she can get she gets the attention and um and I think it's just great because she can get that attention like in different places she might not be able to get it I mean she would still get it but with the level of our coaching expertise is just ridiculous dude that chick is a savage I know she's a savage when she she had a smile on her face when she was fucking up cyborg I know she like a half a grin when she was digging like is a half grit teeth half smile when she was fucking her up see see people are like they ain't never I don't think they gave her no credit I did yeah I mean they're all yeah she hits hard she knocked out Ronda she knocked out you know me tears she beat up me Stacy knock these girls out but it ain't but all yeah she fight like a dude but she felt like a brother yeah she gets mad you know says she find like a brother well you know what to me I think one of the the most impressive performances was Raquel Pennington yeah cuz I don't think people give Raquel Pennington enough credit I think Raquel Pennington was one of those girls like you see her first fight with Holly Holm she almost beat Holly Holm she lost by split decision her fight with Ashlee evans-smith holy shit was that chaos yeah she gets her in that Bulldog choke chokes her on kind of like one second left like it was madness blood everywhere I mean that girl's tough a shit she's super you're right man she's super tough yeah and when a man too fucked her up I was like good lord yes like this is a different Amanda she's she's got everything now before she had the power but she didn't have the endurance and she would fade and you know like perfect example was the cat Zingano fight she fucked cat Zingano walk bad in that first round so bad that cats head was fucked up for years afterwards she was having problems with her cortisol levels her hormones were all fucked up she gave her hypothyroid she gave her who she killed her thyroid in that fight oh my god yes like she talked about it on my podcast she's like that girl hit me so hard she fucked she gave me a thyroid condition oh my god yeah she went to all sorts of serious fucking traumatic brain injury therapy afterwards they did this shit they do for soldiers down in San Diego they did it with her she did she went about it in detail with my on my podcast from Amanda she's like that bitch hits hard yeah so hard like different than anybody else I mean she's just I mean she's really good at hitting home runs like she swing her swing to contact ratio on the money on the button is just high yeah and the force behind it yeah you saw when she clip sideboards yes yeah yeah I said oh my god I know it was over soon as soon as I said this is over yeah this is over Z crazy but a man is another one prime example because I've worked in I've worked in all Amanda's camps except for maybe like this last one but she's not a fighter believe it or not really yeah what what is she she an athlete or she's an artist she's she's an athlete she's an athlete and a competitor so here's the thing like what if you know you can't just put Amanda and go Ari she's not and you try to push Amanda she's not gonna she's not gonna respond well to that and that was why I think you know and in fact she would guess out because like she didn't train properly she wasn't happy what really would her training because it was like everybody was trying to push her like a fighter but when you let her do her thing she pushes herself oh yeah she pushed herself to the limit but when you try to take control of her no you need to do this you knew that she's not gonna respond water that but you let her do her thing coach I got this go ahead you do it world-class best stuff weird yep so for her what was the missing ingredient when you look at like the early Amanda - like champ champ Amanda I think it wasn't necessarily missing the green I think it was just everybody was pushing her too hard really yeah a person are too hard oh you need to come in you need to come in and wrestle for two hours you need to come in and do this you can't be a world champ if you don't really train hard and she was like I'm good you know I'm good and I love him down for that just let me let me do it let me let me figure this out let me figure what my body needs and when she figured out what her body needs she said all right I'm gonna push myself and she gives no less effort than what she would have gotten before but she made a decision so maybe she just doesn't like people telling her what to do I think yeah I think that has a big part of it cuz like she's now the best of all time yeah no doubt how does she she knocked out cyborg in 50 fucking seconds she beat everybody yeah she fucked up Miesha Tate I mean she fucked up Ronda Rousey yeah I mean she fucks up everybody I know she's the best she is no doubt about it no doubt about it beat Valentina twice yes yes anybody is other than her who's the best it's Valentina yeah Valentina's a beast yeah she's a beast but I think that the more confident Amanda gets she just walks Valentina down a beat she walks her down a beats her stay for she's super yeah she's just too big too good to quit oh god but Valentin is so skillful she's yeah and that's like stylistically it doesn't make for a great fight because Valentina is so skillful yeah so like it can shoot matter oh yeah she's got good defensive moves her feet what does every yeah she's really good yeah I feel bad for them other girls it didn't fly fly wait yeah well she might take over that division for a long fucking time sure sure yeah I mean if you look at what she did she shut you in J chick down and Youngjae check was way healthier yeah way healthier flyweight then she was a straw weight I feel like straw weight she just sucks too much weight you know drains are too much just isn't she's not as durable because you look at the shots that she got hit with by Valentina they're probably arguably harder shots yeah but she just you're right she's more durable just not she can't cut that weight and uniform at the same level yeah I don't know why fighters feel like that's the answer all the time cutting overhunting weight cutting wig I hate it I hate I'm like if you're gonna allow seven pounds to dictate whether you can beat this guy or not you got a problem yeah yeah you're not that good then yeah you should never allow like seven pounds to dictate whether you could beat somebody or not do you think that the support would be better if they eliminated weight cutting the way one Fc did I think so I think so too I think so I wish they would I think the performance would be better I think guys would be more durable they'd be able to take shots better and I think there'd be less bullshit I think they just need more options in terms of weight classes I think that's one I think because there's just too many giant jumps like 5 to 205 like what the fuck is that 20 pounds a lot well I mean that's just one issue with the sport dislike incredibly antiquated the weight class yeah maybe I mean this stuff was 20 years ago I mean it was anyway keeping it the same like the page structure antiquated when bonuses but nothing bad for women I'm like why we have a window knock a guy for winning you paying them double to win yeah well not only that you're paying these assholes to judge yeah judging is terrible you're paying people who don't know what the fuck they're watching there's I I would love I mean there's some great judges don't get me wrong if you're listening you're a judge and you're great thank you there's some terrible judges and I want I would like to know how many of them have ever even trained probably not many if you if you're watching someone there's some crazy scramble and some guy almost catches someone with something and the guy gets away and catches someone and they get sway the person who doesn't train do they even understand how close it was like how do they yeah they don't they don't know how could they know they how could they know they can't I take him but and and sometimes I get in arguments with people about this too another thing is like this you know the open scoring I feel like we need open scorn I love that idea I'm like because as a coach you go into a fight and like there's certain things that you want to do in certain rounds based on where you are in the fight you are where your only argument against it is that a guy would coast yeah then the other guy would go crazy yeah that's what I'm saying I think it'll be more exciting going he's gonna coast but this was having an ounce for both fighters are coasting because they thought they won right that's so both fighters are coasting because they thought they won you you have to be crazy to think that these judges got it right you have to be crazy yeah it's like you won the first two miles like I got this yeah you gotta be crazy yeah yeah you never know you never know guessing yeah I think sometimes they do I think they do too but I'm like man well if I know what the score was going into the third round I would be have be able to tell you better what you need to do you know Douglas Crosby you know he's a referee a judge rather and he told me once they're in the middle of a fight and some woman looked over at him a guy had another guy in the Camorra and he's like what is he doing what is that oh my god what is a Kimura oh my god it's not something crazy and I mean these are the guys that are in charge of your life your career career yeah and especially in MMA you look it's terrible in boxing as well as terrible decisions in boxing but this one is insane because it's 50% of your purse yeah win bonus is 50% in most cases yeah I don't even know why we still do that I hate it why don't they still do that I hate it guys fight their heart out they should get what they're supposed to get paid yeah you should get what you get paid no and the only bonuses should be for finishing the idea that someone's not gonna fight hard like they're not gonna fight as hard as they would if they would guys want to win yeah if you want a way you know how to win anyway everybody answer wins should I fight any harder right because there's a win bonus no that yeah I don't never I've never come back to a guy in the corner like hey listen you got that win bonus got to win but you gotta win this cuz of the win but no you want to win any with some advice to Fighters to stop asking for those performance bonuses you're not gonna get them when you ask it just doesn't work they never get it yeah yeah unless they need it's obvious yeah you know there's this some like some wind bonuses where you like of course yeah well Connor started the whole thing didn't he did it I think he did 50 G's baby I think he might have met him want to start this huh maybe he did but again it was probably a performance where he was gonna get it yeah probably got it anyway he - I got it anyway I mean some guys do it on like fight pass prelims I'm interviewing him like wish you didn't say that yeah you know I'm gonna get this you might have gotten it if you didn't say no yeah yeah yeah it's just I don't like that either no I feel like the performance bonuses on like I think they should give everybody knows if you finish because then you gonna get guys looking to finish that's a great idea yeah that's a great idea having a finished bonus yeah Oh on every fight yeah every fight every if you finish here you get paid what you get paid when a loss and then there's a finished amount of dollars for every finish yeah yeah I'm gonna finish I agree with that that's great I think that uh I do think that there's a real I think it's unfair that you don't fix the judging but yet you also have win bonuses I think that's unfair it is oh I don't like it the fact you just told me that story I get breaks my heart to think that these guys are judging and control of everybody's career he don't know what a Kimura is there's a lot of people like that out there there's a lot of people I thought I mean we've seen we've seen scores where it's just so like this is what I think I think first of all three people is too few yeah I think seven should be the number that's a good number I would think I would like this I would like like a good number like seven maybe but then on top of that I want an online score I want to see what people and I want to get like you know just experts like get a bunch of Fighters to give their input on it like have a pool of experts yeah you know it's like what a Tyron Woodley think about that fight Oh Tyrone's watch at home he felt like it was this yeah what did Mighty Mouse Johnson think what did what did John Jones think like if whoever wants to contribute who wants to contribute the pool like have a verified account and say this was I'm scoring it at home it was this you know this it was that and then you look at this online pool like ninety percent felt it should have gone this way but the judges went the other way yeah yeah yeah yeah that kind of shit would be very telling yeah and I don't get it like cuz we all look at fights and go alright that shit was not that's not how it went right this guy won but we all know he didn't win that fight what's like the big can you put I'm trying to think like what's the most egregious example that you could you could come up with well I just saw a fight and I was I it was a Justin Scoggins for the kid this recently and I think got dropped from you see from that loss it was a bad decision Oh terrible just I'm thinking oh yeah I'm wait I'm thinking I left to get something to drink so I was like I am he won that the audience got dropped yeah he just fought in like Japan or somewhere yeah he's good yeah yeah weird style yeah small like Wonder Boy to Caressa yeah yeah interesting yeah whatever from the same area late do a lot of karate up and this Carolina's up interesting yeah did you see that Robin black breakdown of the dude this I've always said that one thing that I used to see in sport karate and I just see in Taekwondo was sliding like guys knew how to lift up that front leg and slide in yeah it doesn't I don't see that a lot in MMA but if someone was good at it there was like there was a guy that I used to train with his name was Larry Jones and Larry was he was tall he was like 6-2 but his legs went up to his armpits man it was crazy she would just fuck people up with his front leg in taekwondo tournaments he would just slide across BAM yes slide across and people just didn't know what to do with that front leg they were trying to figure out that front leg and Robin black see if you can find this I think it's on his Instagram this dude I don't know who the guy is I never seen him fight before but he slides in with a sidekick blam slides in again blam and then goes to the guy's face with this I mean he's covering like 15 feet with his one leg up in the air and one leg down just sliding in with his momentum who see that's a unique skill to have and I gotta tell you and like when will mean entire when we first started training for the one both wonderboy fight we couldn't find anybody that could do that really yeah and that's why a lot of people have problems with wonderboy because oh yeah I'll just get a bunch of guys like a strike post his striking is different it's different it's different and it's here's the guy look at this watch this guy do is it this one yeah yeah yeah do it from the beginning though yeah but just reset it watch this guy watch how this guy does this this is crazy see a slides yeah look at this slide watch this boom that's some serious fire goodness serious coverage the distance of that's in that you see a lot in those sport karate guys yeah especially guys that know how to correctly throw a front leg side kick and this dude whoever this gentleman is he really knows how to do it what is his name Jamie yeah click on his shit I gotta follow that dude oh he's a jujitsu guard too damn he's gonna be tough some serious fucking power with that front leg but it's he's also if you watch go back to that original clip again you watch what he does when he does it he watch a lifts his knee up waist height which is critical yeah because everybody the the people that do it wrong their knee is low yeah their knee is low and they're kicking up he's his knee goes high his knee goes like when he he throws it it comes off straight see look how high his knee is his knee is like up where his hip is and then as he throws it he throws it in a straight line he just get all this power see like I've even delayed like he just hop hop hop yeah we've gotten range Danny delivered yeah man I used to see a lot of people in the the Taekwondo days that were real good at this and very few in MMA until this guy like bang like that is a fucking look at that stretch on this dude that's some serious flexibility to and to fuck a guy up with a front leg side kick to the dome like that that's incredible but it's the slide that's the most impressive the distance he comes yeah you're not used to that you think you're okay because you're outside but you're not even nearly outside you're right in the wheelhouse and like he doesn't have to change his position he's not he's not vulnerable to a lot of attacks yeah blaming like that wonderboy has an interesting way of doing it's a little bit different wonderboy does a slide but he his leg comes up from the ground like he's lifting his foot up and you're not even sure what it is and then as he's extending it it's still low and then he brings it up yeah he stabs you in the stomach with it you like what yeah you the Johny Hendricks why it's a great example that Johnny didn't know what the fuck he was doing and then Johnny smiled and then he got roundhouse kicked in the face like what well I'll tell ya I mean it's just because like the way like Johnny came up a little bit late he came up after I did but when I was coming up nobody you couldn't do karate right no so karate no karate karate so like that that whole stigma towards karate just like it carried on for so long did now like if you do karate you got up you got an advantage because nobody knows how to defend it right yeah there's definitely something to some stuff as long as you do the other shit yeah something to some styles of karate yes but Connor does a lot of karate yeah you could tell me you see it in his style yeah when we fought although he tried the front leg side kick to the thigh yes back but he's got a karate style he's moving in and now karate whoa yeah it's not more time no he's very elusive and then but when he gets him boxing range he's put them hands on yeah a boxer yeah that's an interesting style that's an interesting way of doing it this is there's just a bunch of different ways that's the beautiful thing about MMA there's a bunch of different ways to do it man yeah this Ben Askren zwey Sam grab a hold you in gorilla fuck yeah baby the grip is my man to like I've known Ben since before he started fighting like he he came State of Mind my dog bit him in shit your dog yeah a little chihuahua yeah bad yeah Ben is my homeboy man and I think that I was nervous about him going to UFC because I was thinking it you know they was gonna get him too late yeah you know because like when he you know but I still I think he's still he's in his glove he's never taken anything he never takes no damage so I was just nervous that they get him too late but you know Ben has been instrumental in tyron woodley scam some aegis his brain is just like we think on the same lives he's he's a brilliant guy yeah he's always sending me book suggestions like he's smart as shit yeah but he's also very analytical in his approach you know like he's not he's not gonna you know no disrespect to George George elbow George go JAL abandoned his jujitsu and you started banging Ben's not no no he he's never gonna do that yeah never happened and I like the way he thinks too he's like you know like he didn't he doesn't spend time away from what he's good at yeah he stays in that room always coaching yeah wrestling yeah yes always coaching kids but I mean even even would himself like we'll go we'll go up there been any training for nothing will go up and Ben he'll give tiring however many rounds he needs really yeah you know most guys I gotta bring it like two three guys in to get time or some work you know battle give him work no matter what no matter what kind of shape he's in he give tiring work well he was talking about you know if they do open up that 165 pound division which I guess they're talking about because there's so much talent in that division I really think if they moved it to 75 and they had a 65 75 85 I think that's better yeah and then Ben would fight at 65 because he doesn't want to you know fight tyrant yeah him entire and a real good friends but I like a lot of matchups with him I really love the Robbie Lawler fight I mean I know they pulled off that fight because the Anaheim card fell apart but they're gonna fight um is it on Brooklyn I think they're fighting March 2nd is that what it is I think she's robbing him and Robbie and I felt like they were gonna make that headliner for a fight night I felt like I saw Robbie's face as a head I don't know if that's been so little just text yeah yeah right or text Dana um it's a it's a great matchup though that's yeah yeah that's where you see where Ben fits in is against world-class competition I mean you'll see where he fits in against world-class competition or see if Robbie is done or not yeah yeah yeah this is a great fight right for both guys or if Robbie's still a savage yeah yeah yeah I mean I like Robbie taking the time off - yeah that's important for Robbie I mean you look at the wars or suck I went through the Carlos Condit fight oh the fucking Rory MacDonald fighting me good Jesus Christ I don't know who gets out of that unscathed oh not a single human that's ever lived gets out of that and he needed that he needs time off yeah yeah cuz we do get hit like that yeah and just he's a Sabbath he's a fighter when he was screaming in his lip yeah was split open I mean it was like a zipper was open yeah and yes screaming I'm interviewing him after the fight and I'm like dude I could see your teeth like literally see his teeth right through his mouth yeah through his lips oh yeah my god yeah I didn't give a fuck now stitch it up no like yeah he's he's a fighter man like that's that's the type of guy like a get on that bag yeah and throw some meat at you well he used to not even spar which is really crazy when he's fighting in Strikeforce he wasn't even sparring and I asked him I was well I already know how to fight questions are over thank you I mean also - you got a but you got a look at it - like where he can't where he comes from yeah like you know dumb dudes in the Midwest don't got no filter you know I'm saying they just they was just trying shit out of each other every spar on practice that was every practice yeah the military's just knocking guys now drag them off the floor until they wake up and then bring another guy and then when I wake up bring them back and bring them back in yeah that's what's really crazy when guys get ko'd I remember that from boxing gyms he'd watch guys get dropped like butt and then they'd be sparring like 10 minutes later but what are you doing oh you should be in the hospital Yeah right do you understand what just happened your brainstem see I don't like that part of the game you know well I don't even know if it's even necessary it's not necessary it was ignorance because if that guy gets hit again he could get like do you know Joseph Valtellina after he beat Mark de Bont in glory mm-hmm he won he won the title he was fucked up for months like he could he couldn't have any lights on he had to be in a room he said that the light from like a charger from a cell phone charger that little tiny light would fuck his head up he'd give him headaches he had a severe concussion of a from a fight he won he got clipped with a giant knee in that fight yeah and just boom sent his head back and even though he won the fight he still was fucked up for a long time afterwards I was looking at Yusef see 235 takes shape with two title fight sin 3x UFC champ so is that on the card says it's Jones Anthony Smith boom Tyron vs. komaru smile and then ask her inand baller woo that's it there we go is that March 2nd yeah you uh that's in Vegas right god damned prey to the MMA gods keep that card together keep that a and then don't forget our pedro muñoz and um Cody gar Brandt - yet Wow Wow that's a fucking card I know yeah fucking card Holly Holm Aspen Ladd can't get rid of that ad does that beat and Jeremy Stephens holy shit gotta love it gotta love it Mickey Garland Diego Sanchez Jesus ovince st. Preux any jerking off and that's a great car that's a fuckin crazy card that cards bombs away man that is a bombs away card I um I don't know about the Anthony Smith and John Jones wow I wonder why day I don't even know why they made that fight in the first place they probably just want to need it john wants a fight again really yeah John's probably well look he had to take two years off no money all that bullshit finally gets his title back let's keep this ball rolling yeah you know and then probably also feels like the best way to get back to like his top form is to compete regularly you know it gets loose so we could really show what he can do yeah I mean although the fucking pressure that must have been on John from that fight you know I mean part of me that wants to feel bad for him I mean there's a lot of pressure on this young man yeah but that a part of me is like man will you stop fucking up yeah it's it's again I think it's what we're talking about do with fighters and you know they're crazy impulsive - y-yeah make mistakes oh you stupid shit especially if they like to party yeah you add that into the mix like you're gonna make some piss-poor decisions man I should have sold a science how hung out with John this was before he was a big time it was in Buffalo as a some small show and Buffalo like I don't even know why he was there and like he was just doing like fucking Jack Daniels like out the bottle like but that's also why he's so good yeah it's such a wild motherfucker let's party there's there's a an ingredient list and great champions ya know and it's part of great part of it is they just don't give a fuck yeah they just are good go and that was what I was saying about Amanda when you allow her to not give a fuck and don't try to control her yeah she's gonna fuckin rise to the occasion yeah and but the problem is it doesn't work for everybody because some people need to be controlled because they can't rise to the occasion like right when you let them do their thing man he just rise to the occasion it's finally trying to figure out what is that what's the right mix yeah it's my right mix of discipline and conditioning but then just being free you know Dominick Cruz brought this up we're doing commentaries like some guys fight better with like a weeks notice yeah there's no pressure don't just show up and they're good you know some people fight better when there's a underdog nobody's nobody's thinking they're gonna win there I'll show you motherfuck yeah yeah and you go out there and put on a show I also think the part of a man that that part of existing Amanda too isn't when she's the underdog that's just less pressure on her so again that's another distraction away so she just like alright watches you know I'm the underdog watch how I fuck y'all but when y'all put pressure on me to be the chick you know to win this fight easily you know I think she can hold back a little bit well she was this favorite against Raquel Pennington she was a favor against Raquel and I think that was one of her best performance yeah but Raquel hung in there a little bit you know she did a look at what she had her throat yeah we kind of had a round or two you know I don't think she had a she had a round you think she went around she took Amanda down at one point and had around mm maybe I don't think so I mean I don't get it I don't think I was I don't think Amanda was in trouble or anything but mmm interesting I think Amanda won every round if I was if I'm recalling it correctly I'd have to go back and look at it but I remember think it was like a slow steady beat yeah it was I mean it was I mean it was pretty it was convincing it was pretty easy fake fire but who the fuck is what's left for her especially like this is what one legit featherweight size-wise it's Megan Anderson but Megan gun exposed a little bit by Holly yeah you know because Holly took her down and really dominated her in the clinch and got her kind of to the ground at will and I'm sure she's tightened up a lot of that but she doesn't she's too slow you think so yeah yeah I think a lot of people to understand like speed is everything in this game really more sewed in size that's why I was saying about like cutting weight speed is key in this game and a lot of people get exposed when they're not fast enough you know because and I don't mean necessarily even just speed and physically I guess heavyweight speed physically but like speed and decision-making right we all that speed is key and I don't think Megan absence will be have enough speed to deal for Amanda well you also have to think the meegan Anderson when she fought Holly Holm that was her UFC debut right and that is that octagon yeah jitters fuck that we've all had yeah they've all had you see that moment where the bright lights hit you for the first time he like whoa and he also her first fight is against Holly fucking home I know Jesus Christ yeah I mean that's experienced as you get I mean Holly is she's what was she like an 18 time world boxing champion yeah she was like 27 and two she has one of the until Amanda knocked out cyborg she had the greatest highlight reel ko in a championship fight well yeah in the championship fight because I think that Jessica and ROG when she knocked out Karolina Karolina Kurkova Kovich yeah yeah that was that was a bigger than knockout then yeah one lamb not bigger it was right up there yeah it was right up there but Amanda just took the fucking cake I was like she's like out it's my saw the best women's MMA ko ever hold my beer yeah cuz it's who she did it - I know I know ah it's everything surprise I mean I ain't gonna lie man I was surprised as much as I loved Amanda she's you know she's I hold her dear to my heart I was even surprised she throws bricks I know she throat you know what she's like she's like a bowling ball in the end of a rope yep boom boom but but if you have you ever spent time around her and hung out a little bit out you know at the fights when she's not fighting backstage very friendly that's but this is what I'm saying you know like a lot of fighters are like you know they can have kind of aggressive personalities yeah she's nothing like that right I mean she likes to sit at home like she she's got an Instagram pic like she's cutting the grass and some flip-flops I mean she's just so carefree and she just like she likes to play with her dogs in the backyard and well I was upset when she was fighting in Ronda that all the promos were about Rhonda coming back yeah that Minister off I said before that before when she when Rhonda was about to fight Holly home I said that I disagreed with that fight I said I really think Amanda Nunez is the most dangerous challenge for Ronda I said because Amanda has a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt and her hands or what's really scary like when Rhonda has to close the distance to get a hold of you when she gets you on the ground she's armor on you I'm gonna felt like Amanda like sizes up with her that's the most dangerous challenge in my opinion but then Holly knocked her out and then when you saw Amanda knock out Ronda I was like well this how did you guys not see this coming like this is not a good matchup and you you spent the entire promo talking about this one person who's not the champion who's coming back after a devastating knockout and then you didn't show anything about the one person who is the champion who's the first openly gay women's champion in the history of the sport right she's she's the first gay UFC champion yep and she's a fucking destroyer I mean she's exciting as shit and all you're showing is Ronda pacing around her mansion you know Ronda getting excited about this fight and thinking I'm gonna go out there and like Jesus Christ and then backstage he was what was crazy I was listening to these agents talk because Rhonda's fights one of the things that was interesting about it was she was such a for such a cult of personality that she had all these agents and shit around like all these like it was all agent of fire back state so I hear these guys talking and they like one agent dork is talking the other agent dork and he goes who's Rhonda fighting and he's I figure if raising but his basically said I don't know who she is but she's a victim uh her like I don't know who it is what's call her today so they really thought that no idea what was gonna tear they had no idea I mean look that's what they were hoping they were hoping that Rhonda wins cuz she's this gigantic superstar like if Rhonda comes back beats Amanda Nunez wins the title back rematches holly holm beats Holly home yeah she's back but instead she gets marked and 48 seconds I mean Amanda just hold it so and I was saying to them afterwards Legos this is what I was telling you like how the fuck are you not promoting her like what she just did if you put equal time promoting her now you got a new star in your hands instead the story is Ronda Rousey got smashed the story's not Amanda yes that's where they really dropped the ball even afterwards a DA didn't pick up what Amanda yes yeah I agree but it's crazy to me like it's crazy me to think that they thought that this was gonna be Rhonda's comeback to start them because and I sent you to breakdown I think that general if you saw it but because I asked out all Amanda's opponents and I do to break down I come up with strategies for her and after scouting Ronda I said there's gonna be an easy fight for you and I told her that yeah I said this is gonna be easy and and it turned out to be easy and it just surprises me that they thought that this was gonna be to come out I don't know and I don't I didn't talk to Dana about it I told Dana before I thought it was a terrible matchup for right but that was before the Holly Holm fight no no no well he was saying you need I don't know he thought that I was saying that Holly Holm that Iran was gonna beat Holly might well I'm not saying that's easy either that's a tough fight too yeah but the thing about Amanda is punching power Holly's not known for a punch I know she's known for speed or kicks her timing her technique her toughness yes she's known for all her athletics physical strength yet she's known for all those things she's not known just to go in there blast girls yeah look Amanda blastp she puts him into another dimension she's different in that respect but they didn't concentrate on that at all like how are you not concentrating on this destroyer that Rhonda's about to face but show them Miesha Tate fight and people would just be like Jesus yeah beats the fuck out of her and then strangles her like you like I know that's why it surprised me that they slept on Amanda how y'all sleep in our cuz it's Hollywood man they the the narrative that they had was Ronda was the best ever which she was when she was the best right until she but if you looked at the way she fought Holly this is my opinion I feel like there was a million things going on other than just fighting there's a million things going on there's movie offers this television shows there's everybody's there's agents and deals and books and all this shit is happening and then she's with Edmund okay yeah she's not an American Top Team she's not she's not dealing with a bunch of people that are being a hundred percent honest and people who have a deep background of experience of training world-class mixed martial arts fighters who recognize that the holes in her game two strengths the weakness someone like you who couldn't like categorize who she is and how to mold her there's no there's no great minds behind her orchestrating this it's just some guy telling her oh you're great you're getting better and she was great on the Mets and she does a great on the man she there's times when she didn't look too bad on a Miss when she fought match go hand she's in Brazil you like damn right but that's there's a big difference between that and then being able to do that on Amanda Nunez there's a big difference yeah and you need world-class coaching you need someone who's gonna recognize there's hiccups in what you do there's there's miss you got there's stages missing I mean one of the things that Greg Jackson's him when they prepared her for Holly home or prepared Holly home for they said if you look at how she she engages it's always grab with the left arm it's always grabbed with enough time and they were just quick move out to the side and if you lock when she ducked under Rhonda's punch and she went to that right side she's always going that right yeah and then boom there's that head kick that might have been one of the funniest moments in the history of say when she ducked that punch and that she hit the Dean hit the fence yeah I know a lot I was pretty funny well it was indicative of like some serious errors in preparation and and also I think the way she fought was just so reckless just charge it or champions don't fight like yeah right but I mean but it's understandable I'm gonna say this and her defense is understandable because that's who she was at the time because she was the greatest ever so she didn't expect to ever be in this position right you know that's yeah what true she got enough but she had an opportunity to correct it and she yes she dropped the ball on that well here's the thing about Rhonda she's very smart she's very very smart but she's also very strong-minded and willed Abilene there's probably very few people that can pull her aside and go you gotta listen to me because you get knocked the fuck out this is real ok you're the great you the greatest ever of course but this is not how you do this camp this is not how you prepare for this person we need more we need we need different thing we don't need you just bar and boxing with people because you're not boxing you're not gonna have these gloves on we need world-class MMA coaching we need to figure out how to shoot and land a double you can't just be grabbing and closing that shit doesn't work on everybody right and in like she almost got choked out by Liz Carmouche remember that yeah and Liz had her back yeah a little bit yeah Ronnie just gutted it out and got out of it such a great grappler and her neck is so goddamn strong yeah she's gotten it out and made it out of there but that was dangerous yeah her job was fucked up after that fight for a long time really yeah from just getting cranked badly and she almost pulled it off I mean she almost pulled it off from that that headlock position is a very dangerous position yeah you headlock someone yeah and they're their legs go around and if that had on your back yeah it's the worst position if you can't pull it off yeah and that was her thing her thing was headlock people flip into the ground and it worked on almost everybody but it's like eventually who's going to catch us you know a venture was in it maybe maybe not but the thing is you need look you could look at a guy like Mighty Mouse who we both agree is like the best expression of mixed martial arts talent that guy does every night he shoots doubles who ankle pity he'll fucking he'll hit you with a flying armbar yeah he'll do whatever the fuck he wants he could do everything you can't have like you can't have only one approach to success because as soon as someone figures out oh she grabs with that left arm I'm just gonna get the fuck out of there I mean there'd be anywhere near that left arm right yeah what I said I was saying about speed too like when you looking like a guy like Mighty Mouse like he's doing all that yeah with speed yeah and the precision of his technique is just like unstoppable ridiculous speed I grabbed him once just joking around backstage and he hit me with two knees to the body it was so fast I was like my brain is too slow to even calculate that you know that that kind of that's like Oh imagine PN Henry cejudo when he fought him and had her experienced that and written the first fight yeah in particular realized like oh Jesus I know but Henry came back I was he made a just made an adjustment but I think in a rematch I think I think TJ beats him in a rematch do you think DJ beats him in the rematch I wonder because it was very close yes very close that's what I'm saying it was a very again eventually it catches up to you yeah the streets get caught up to how did he win he won by taking him down yeah he didn't win by dominating him right it's not like Mighty Mouse beat him he destroyed him right it's like he could he has a much better chance of finishing sudo than sudo has a finishing yeah yeah no doubt yeah so that's why I think DJ if they fought again I think DJ finishes and the only guy I think gives DJ a problem you might not you might not know who well we haven't seen TJ 125 yet right but uh Kyoji Horiguchi really oh mighty beat Horiguchi he did yeah but now so that was years ago really yeah that was years ago the armbar he dominated him and then he did he did this guy but this guy's gotta be coaching Horiguchi I've worked with him a little bit but I'm not like his main guy right but this guy's got a speed unbelievable speed it's got serious knockout power and serious knockout power mmm I have to see yeah I believe you I think you should I think he gives I think he gives DJ I'm not saying that he we'll beat them if they were probably sent but he could he could I would not Scoggins was a real threat when I first saw Scoggins I was like he should have done he should have been yeah I was like discount that style at karate style but also can wrestle and I think I had to do it more with coaching than anything now hmm and I hate to say that because he's probably out of coach right now listening but I really do think that is like maybe not really filling in his holes you know cuz he's got a lot to work with mm-hmm like you said like that karate style he can wrestle I'm sure he's got decent submissions but he's probably got some holes coaching is so critical coaching can take a guy who could be a journeyman and turn them into a world champion there's there's there's this pivot like the fights you choose the things you do when you do them you know when when to say no to things when to say yes to things yeah guidance and Jing yeah but the problem with fighters man is a so damn hard headed yeah you have to be right no crazy bleep yeah yeah you do you got you have to and that's like like we were saying earlier like Amanda she hard-headed sometimes you know like yeah but that's what got her her success but most fighters are hard-headed and and are in a position to be hard-headed right and that's like the hard part it's like you tried to tell him listen you need to listen to me right now no I got this and then their careers just it's crazy cuz that's what made them a fighter in the first place right tell girls to fuck off yeah that's it that father beat their ass you left the house they're 16 fuck you I'll show the world fucking girls out of me and next thing I know I'm out there and I'm fucking getting the cage I feel bad for dudes who didn't get dumped I do why that cuz it's good for you yeah taught me a lot man I remember my girlfriend in high school dumped me I was devastated for months just devastated but then I realize like what the fuck is wrong with me and I thought imagine if I'd married that girl Oh imagine had kids with her and ooh and every day was just torture her bitching at me and controlling and oh I got like I got off flight well here's one for you to enjoy well same thing happened to me I got dumped in high school yeah the girl started dating another dude I ended up hitting this motherfucker in the head with a wrench Oh friends yeah I had a hit the demo fucking the hair with a wrench why'd you him in there with a wrench he pissed me off oh he pissed me he made me so mad did he make you mad cuz he was banging the girl or do you make you mad on top of that on top of that yeah so I end up hitting him and then I ended up going to jail and I end up doing 52 weekends in jail yeah but within that time every week every weekend I had going on Friday for year come out on Sunday Oh for a year so I couldn't leave I couldn't leave my city so in that time I told myself how to fight that's why I'm here today Wow yeah and during the weekends uh-huh no so during the week cuz I couldn't leave so I would just say I work and then me and I Paul Rodriguez he for 22 Susan C 32 yeah mayhem we trained that we taught ourselves out of fight in the backyard watching videotapes Wow Tony D'Souza the originator of the peruvian neckties yep yep that's what I came from is that really what I came from she's proven no kidding that's what I came from huh yeah yeah that peruvian neckties a motherfucker that's a great that was Tony shit yeah I hope write that on one of my systems man I love them he's a hell of a grapple yeah yeah so he ended up choking out a Paul Rodriguez UFC 32 and I was the night I got knocked out Bobby J yeah but it all happened because I got dumped wow that's crazy you hit him with a wrench huh yeah I know I am proud of it yeah how old were you 17 yeah frontal cortex not even fully formed yeah making some decisions you 17 like you would the girl is 17 for two years that's half your damn life I know right you know so you thinking that's the one also like the the heartbreak if you're not accustomed to it like everybody experiences heartbreak somebody breaks you it breaks up with you like oh I feel like shit then you call your friends up like come on man we'll go out get a couple drinks you then you have a couple drinks I got whatever and then you get a text from an ex and like oh yeah girl my I think it's good to get broken up with it is a you learned you know you learned you also you learned why you were annoying to her you know like there's some stupid shit that you're doing that you don't even realize you're doing but you're doing it and then it becomes a pattern and you do it again and again and again then finally they dump you and then you get some reflection time really calm why am I so annoying yeah I remember you said talked about that before about like self reflection and awareness and like that's so important man it's critical being real to yourself and aware and being aware of where you are in relation to everybody else in the world I try to coach myself do you yeah I try to sit down with myself and when I do like meditation sessions and shit I try to pretend that I'm like a coach and I'm looking at myself honestly I was like all right dude you ain't spending nearly enough time doing this you need to fix that that's great yeah start doing it it's a skill like like you have to like develop it because I think like that's part of most people's problems and they're not aware of where they are in life you know another product of problem that people have too is momentum they get caught up in momentum of doing stupid shit yeah or momentum of being lazy or momentum of eating bad or drinking or whatever it is that does that's bad yeah they can't break that you get caught up and you need to stop reflection and that's one of the reasons why I think meditation is so important oh yeah I meditate every day do you yeah how do you do it what do you do I lay down and close my eyes so what I do is I'll start with some self-talk first just to get me going self-talk positive affirmation statements just lay down quiet without any example like what kind of self-talk like what do you what kind of positive affirmation just you know just um you know I appreciate life appreciate where I'm at yeah I'm I'm gonna keep going I'm doing my you know just everyday strive to be better you know or I'll get even more detailed you know you know you know I do a lot of entertaining try to do a lot of entertainment stuff so I want to get better it's public speaking yeah so I'll you know try to talk myself into a little stand up yeah do standard I do every so often are you funny ah are you funny not diamond bar last time I was there dive bar sketchy is it really look good that makes me feel better yes yes Jeremy Piven said the same thing he said yeah I bombed actually not when I was there yeah but um but not so I'm trying to I'm just really you know you know I'm intelligent you know I'm smart I'm gonna make it I got this I'm making lots of money you know I'm trying to talk myself into that and then I and then for the next 20 minutes or so I just sit in silence and just let all of that soak in mmm do you concentrate on your breathing or yeah yeah yeah because you know like if I get distracted like noise or whatever I had to Center it back to my breather yeah that's the big one for me I've tried a bunch of different styles of meditation but one that I like the best especially in the tank is breathing you bring shorts with you today yeah no but have you done tank no what is it you could do today yeah yeah yeah okay well set it up I want to do this yeah here I'll show it to ya some I said some about some tank yeah what is it there was only one guy who's used this tank other than me unless Jamie's been sneaking here in the middle of the night is uh Dan Harris from Good Morning America he's used it because he's he's a big meditator no I set him up with it but it's amazing it's a tank that's filled up it's a floatation tank it's it was made by this guy named John Lilly who is a psychedelic adventurer and a pioneer in interspecies communication he was working on trying to communicate with dolphins he was taking acid and getting the tank and take acid and give dolphins acid and he was out of his fucking mind Lilly was a real trip you know his books are amazing he was a like a super genius who was he was going through his career during this psychedelic revolution like the Timothy Leary's and all those people of the time Terence Mckenna and he was trying to figure out a way to separate the mind from the body and one eat one thing that he realized is like sensory input like you and I are sitting here your your butt is touching the chair your feet of touching the floor you feel the table all that stuff those are signals those signals go to your brain your brain is processing that and the way I the analogy that always make is imagine if you and I were having this conversation but right over there was a dude with a jackhammer we could still talk but it would be super distracting right and maybe you wouldn't be able to express yourself the right way because you would be taken in the input of all that noise mm-hmm so we'd be like hey man let's go talk over there where it's quiet you go talk over there and it would be easier because there would be no distraction well your whole body's a distraction everything's a distraction sitting down as a distraction the lights in this room were a distraction the fact that Jamie's here and the tables here and you're taking into account all the objects around you and this is all input without input your brain becomes a very different thing so in the tank the water is heated to 94 degrees that's the temperature the surface your skin then there's a thousand pounds of Epsom salts in the water so which is really good because your body gets the magnesium from that but also really good because you float like a motherfucker you lie in that thing and half the your body is above the surface of the water you're just floating because there's so much salt it's so dense and then you lay back and then you close the door total darkness you don't see anything you open your eyes just as dark is when you close your eyes then total silence your ears are underwater you're just laying there floating in this water and once you once you Center because you kind of wiggle around a little bit because the waters swishing you because you step into it and you know you got to you got to let the water settle and relax and then lay your arms settle and you can't tell where the water is and where the air is because it's all the same temperature because the water is the same temperatures your skin you don't feel the water after a while uh-huh and you get relaxed so then when I'm in the tank then I constituted my breathing all concentrating is in with the good out with the bad in with the good out with the bad I'm just concentrated in breathing through my nose out through my mouth and I'm only letting myself concentrate on the nose but I'll think about stupid shit like I gotta clean my closet and I'm gonna do this and I haven't been in yoga in a week and I have a but all those thoughts eventually will go away I just got a little don't do that don't do that I don't think about that like man I need I think about Lisa my car is up soon and I can't let those rights gotta think of the breath breathing in through the nose out to the mouth in you net I never in all my times of doing this I've ever had a pure experience where I didn't have to fight off those thoughts yeah you think they all one day you'll get to a point we just hope not and have never had never been that never I try all the time yeah but when you have the absence in the absence of any sensory input your brain becomes supercharged you could see your life much more clearly there's nothing there but you and your thoughts your mind is detached from your body this is what Lily figured out he figured out a way to separate the body from the mind damn but you sure I'm a float because you know black people don't swim mm swim either oh really think like a rock all right good yeah did I send like a rock I barely could tread water barely even in the ocean I struggle all right kind of died yeah yeah you're dense man I'm sure you but that thing is so there's so much salt in that water everybody floats everything floats yeah it's basically like it has to be stirred up every day there's a pump that constantly circulates it it's got all these water purification tanks that are attached to it there's purification filters rather for like their there this giant the guy who made it is my friend crash who runs the float lab in Venice which is the premier distributor of float tanks they make the best shit on the planet bar none he's a mad scientist when you see the whole setup back there you realize like there's so much salt in it that it has to constantly be recycled and move through otherwise it'll crystallize and you get these giant salt rocks again yeah so he's gotta constantly you're gonna float you'll float like it's gonna be beautiful you'll be like that baby and Nirvana's phone you're gonna love it it's amazing yeah I definitely want to try it yeah it's but I feel like ATT could benefit from having one of those down there it's a really good thing for fighters it's really good thing for relaxing like epson salt baths right this does giant for just loosening your muscles and relaxing good therapy after you train that's the more epson salt you're ever gonna get in a fucking bathtub yeah that is real episodes you put that thing around bunch of Fighters ass that I share or missin in there whatever Brazilians gonna steal it ATT has you guys have dorms too right yeah we got dorms that's crazy yes great though I mean it really it's really helpful to the guys cuz we got like at all times we got like Brazilians and dagestan you guys huh and Gregg living there so yeah crazy yeah yeah it's amazing I mean it's good though man I mean it's a it's the best gym on the planet can't complain but certainly one of them I mean yeah it's in terms of the actual overall facility I don't think there's another facility like it on earth no it's number one right just the size yes size and all what Dan Lambert is done like fucking god bless Dan Lambert the guys put more money into the development of MMA than anybody other than the four team yeah and there's there's absolutely no doubt about that I can't think of another guy who has been around as long and it's pumped more of his own money into just helping guys and he's such a good guy yeah he's such a good guy in a fucking real man yeah yeah hands met but not just a rich guy that's throwing his money and he fucking trains trains his black belt yeah yeah Jeff I can't in this house he had a gym and he used to have all the dudes come over back in the day more Laputa March and potentially come over no care brothers be that training with him he's legit yeah he loves it I mean legitimately loves the sport like when Amanda won and he was in the cage he was so happy he practiced the tears crying she he sees a legit dude man yeah he's very legit but what he's done is amazing cuz he had an amazing gym already and then he built this gigantic fucking facility built it from the ground up specifically yeah yeah you're right and he bought the land and built the gym just goes to a warehouse and okay we'll set up the cage over here no he designed it I know I wish I designed it a little differently though because I would like to have seen um the pros separated how so from like general population you know like and that's something that might I mean it's easy to look back hindsight and say yeah it's better if they were separated but like now it's kind of like you kind of want to separate your pros from like you know five-year-olds take you know right you know yeah you know Arlovski walking around with no shirt on and hairy chest bumping in there like some old lady who's there with her grandson you know you look at his nose yeah yeah yeah it's a bit scary you know so I mean it just you know my selfishness is like yeah man we need to get stay outside so we can yeah yeah well how many regular folks do you have coming into that gym regular folks yeah oh I mean it's a whole thing with like regular folks really yeah so like classes for little kids classes for little kids regular jiu-jitsu guys bang it out and the same well we do I mean we do a good enough job of having to bang out sessions in the morning but like at night you know they're still running you know the fighters are still running around acting a fool is there good pictures of what it looks like online yeah yeah I think Google of American top American Top Team did the new Jim in particular fucking incredible facility man yeah how much does that shit cost I don't know I just don't like to think about I get that place I mean it's you know South Florida - oh yeah it's expensive as shit that's a amazing facility - and they have a giant help big the mats bases holy shit Stadium stairs or seats yeah do they have they have a whole strength and conditioning set on the other end of that where you see that man hand make the strength the condition inside over there Wow box aside what's amazing yeah I mean that's what everybody hopes for I mean how many people must move down there just to be able to train there you know honestly we don't I mean we do get a lot of people that move down there just a trainer but I think we do better with guys who come and just do camp brilliant yeah how come I don't know I don't know we just seem to because we can provide for we have dorms yeah so we have dorms so it seems to work out better for most guys where they live somewhere else and then they want to just come to camps they come for six weeks they stay in the dorm for six weeks we tighten them up boom yeah who does that a lot of people do Robby is doing that right no we Robby actually moved down oh yeah Robbie moved down Tyron was doing that right not really we siren comes down whenever he feels like it mm-hmm but he does his camp sit in Milwaukee with we go to Duke Rufus's what do you think about him fighting us man I like Guzman it's a great fire yeah I've always liked this much that's why I like him as a fighter for sure yeah I don't know him as a person but as a fighter he's fucking terrifying yeah he's super smart yeah he's really good he's very versatile he can do everything yeah so that's why I think it's more of a challenge than Colby yeah because Osman brings more to the table Stryper striking power wise power and the the Kobe thing though was in terms of like a marketing fight like I felt like that was a very good fight marketing wise yeah I think they could have had that fight stand alone yeah you know I don't wonder why they didn't know think I think but you know I don't think it could have had that fight stand alone they didn't need Jon Jones and Anthony Smith I think another thing he doesn't just talk shit when the cameras are on a big talk shit all the time we had Kobe in camp sometimes and like I'm um when he first started fighting and we was always cordial but now you know I'm saying like I don't even talk to him he he goes his way in the gym we passed each other eyes up just as awkward yeah you know it's like he's talking about my homeboy he's dogging him out you know and but you also know that he's gonna do that yeah but listen I'll say this too like even though I know that I'm still like happy for him mm-hmm I'm happy that he was able to get to success he's got yeah whether it was from talking or not he still won two fights he still beat dos Andre yeah and he beat dos Anjos convincingly yeah he still won yeah he talked a lot and I'm happy for him but if but I was just hoping that you know it's time to face the music yeah you deserved his ass woman well I think the UFC offered him a usman and I think he said no I see I think he said he wants to fight Tyron and they're like you're not in an imposition to the side and even though they had promised him a shot at the title before Ben Askren said did you believe Dana White and skurd tweeted - i love that he's he's the most ruthless when it comes to twitter yeah he's the most ruthless he's so honest and hilarious - check you check under your skirt yeah then I'll get you it's a great fight though loose mud and tire and I'm not mad at the fight I do kind of wish that Colby was getting the shot because I want to see that fight I don't know if I will ever see that fight like tyrants mad he doesn't like Colby yes he doesn't like me yet an angry tyrant is a scary human being yeah he might be the fastest hardest hitting 170 pounder that's ever lived yeah who the fuck is faster than tyrant who the fuck hits harder you look at his fights with Wonder Boy Wonder Boy recognizes one of the greatest strikers in the sport ever the only person who got hurt in those fights was Wonder Boy the same thing with with Darren till Darren tells a motherfucker on the feet tyrant shut that shit up quick blam one big right hand dropped some beats the fuck out of him chokes the shit out of him well here's the thing man is it you know it's coming - yep like you just can't prepare for yeah it's so fast yeah you know it's coming you're like here it comes here it comes oh there it is yeah well you got engage and the thing about tyrant 2 is he's intelligent and patient yeah and he'll just he'll just hang around on the outside hanging around the other come on yeah I know you want to do this make a mistake yeah make a mistake the Wonder Boy fights like we're saying all those fights are boring you have to fight Wonder Boy that way yeah how else do you fight him there's not another way to fight him just another way you're gonna lose yeah this is the way to fight them you have to fight that way if you don't fight that way you get fucked up if you fight the way you know fucking Jake Ellenberger yeah yeah we'll kick the net yeah yeah you put you fight the way um Hendricks fought him yeah fuck you fucked up yeah you got a fight that way you got to stay on the outside you can't give in to those faints and he's gonna hate you with him little pity Pat's and tips and taps because he's he's trying to tag you and touch you there for the big ones come yeah and he's elusive and he's clever and he's a lot quicker than you think he also bends at the waist like a god cold yeah yeah he's very good at bending at the waist and then coming back with punches yeah he's a dangerous fighter and Woodley fought him the perfect way and he did it twice yeah and people like all that's boring but that's Wonder Boy that's would be exciting and you get fucked up or you fight in a cautious intelligent way and the fans boo see I don't see Joe I got you all wrong how so I thought you hated tyrant why would I hate I don't know you don't saying because like everybody kind of always had tyrant thinks everybody hates time yeah maybe we talk now we never told Nelson to the shit I like about Tyra it's all pop yeah we've never actually talked about it but but it just seems like everybody wants to jump on him no matter what no yeah not me no I think he's if he's not the greatest welterweight of all time he's in the running cuz like Matt Hughes I feel like you have to give legend respect to his Matt Hughes was the first yeah Matt Hughes were the was a powerful wrestler that was the first guy to embrace submissions you look when Matt Hughes beat George st. Pierre and he hit him with that far side armbar that spear the Kimura yeah that's some high-level shit now he fucked up Frank Trigg twice took his back and strangled him Matt Hughes was the first high-level wrestler toughest shit strong as a goddamn gorilla who embraced submissions and he and did it within a really intelligent and you know effective way he was like I feel like he was the first okay so you got to give him his props he's let his legend props yeah then George st. Pierre is number one after that because George st. Pierre was the fucking full package he could do everything he figured out how to beat everybody and he beat everybody for a long time then this Woodley and I feel like I look at Woodley and George st. Pierre I feel Woodley matches up very well with George st. Pierre and I would I would have loved to see I think George is still look if you look the way George looked against Michael Bisping he still looks like he's in his prime and he hasn't he didn't get me fought very well in that fight and I think his submissions are probably even better the way he took Michael Bisping's back and choked him like motherfucker still got it well you know he's working with Danaher solely that guy yeah wizard yeah that fight I'm very curious to see and I feel like if George really wanted to come back with a big challenge and have a big gigantic you know epic super fight I feel like tyron woodley a deserves it and B matches up with him very well I mean there's a very interesting fight to me the other interesting fight to me with George is khabib if he could really get down 155 pounds which he says he can't that's super interesting well yeah I'll say what do you think about our George and Ben I like that - yeah I like that - I like that I like ban against I like been against khabib yeah yeah a lot I like that a lot because Ben is bigger he's strong as shit and you don't get better wrestling quran credentials know the problem like what MMA is like you get all these fights he's like fantasy fights that you want to make but you can't make them yeah because a lot of politics involved but at least everybody's under the roof right like before I was like when phaidor was over in Pride like goddamn I want to get him over here I want to get him over there so bad but that never happened you know and then when he finally made it to Strikeforce he was kind of it wasn't the same guy anymore he had some miles on them long fights didn't look physically the same as he looked like back when he fought like Mirko Cro Cop or Nogueira I mean he was a goddamn destroyer yeah I always wanted to see him fight in the UFC I think he could have been UFC champion I really do yeah back in his prime yeah for sure cuz he was like the first dude it was really like mauling guys the way he was mauling and like with his ground-and-pound yeah and that's something that like I don't think with the exception of khabib nobody else has actually recreated the type of violence that he put when he got on top of people he would hurl himself into you and throw bombs yeah you fuck people up man and it also could catch submissions in a blink of an eye yeah off his back yet yeah we fought Randleman yeah sent him flying suplexes and he lands on his head he lands like those neck and his shoulder and then seconds later he catches round them in a Kimura oh hey watch this yeah yeah yeah now now watch my turn yeah yeah yeah if a girl was the man like it sucks like this generation of MMA fans that we have today don't have that type of history yeah and they don't know they don't know like the real phaidor and they they see him now and Bellator I'm just thinking yeah see the real phaidor you know you're not seeing phaidor from the early days you know yeah he was he was so good he was so fast too yeah you know I mean he was just everything he had here the full package you could smash you standing up he submit you on the ground ground and pound the fuck out of you he could do everything yeah and he was just terrifying a robot I know this didn't know no expression no emotion I was with Jeff Monson when Jeff Monson fought him in Russia and when Jeff was walking out it looked like a man walking to his death I swear to God and then when they fought it was the worst beating I've ever seen a human being take yeah Monson took some beatings too and he was getting kicked in like he broke his femur he was from good from leg kicks really yeah he was getting kicked in the leg so bad and just falling down and oh it was it was a scary night I felt so bad for Munson is Monson in Russia now doesn't he speak Russian and he wants to be honest right he does I'm not sure if that's the term he would use but he's socialist yeah socialist Marxist whatever he wants to call himself but he's in between like Russia England and South Florida they know bounces around fighting and every so often Oh buddy I got a weird fight and I'm fighting in Russia or I'm fighting in Africa or like these weird places where they're fighting or he like just had like a wrestling match against like Tim Sylvia he's doing like all this weird stuff that no other human being does do when he was at the top of the the grappling world he was like wrestling a building yeah was like wrestling a building he was so jacked so jacked and he was so good yeah but he did like he have a diverse skill set but he was he'd beat everybody to to nothing yeah you know what he did he also was one of the first guys to use the north/south choke but he was so strong like I talked to some Brazilian Jujitsu guys and I was like is that legit he's like I think he just gunned him yeah just grab his neck and Gundam yeah but then marcelo garcia started hitting people with that and then everybody's like okay wait a minute what's going on here yeah what is this guy doing and then you realize like oh you can you can just get it in the right way right right right yeah and north south choke a real black belt yeah you can no see Monson was one of the first guys to show that but yes so big and strong he was just yeah he was just like just squeeze in with his sweaty armpit but right marcelo garcia in fact marcelo garcia taught me how he did it and how he does it and he showed me like the finer details of it and i was actually working with Hani yah yesterday that cock get squeezed him neck and that guy can squeeze that guy's got a squeeze and he was doing it to me yesterday I was like you got this he's weird too because you look at his body like how was I gonna grab her he doesn't like if you look at Monson you like other girls here grappler honey Yaya looks like like you to play soccer not even he looks like I've never done anything athletic in his life like he's like really yeah he's like flimsy just gets a hold of a playing ability his the way he moves and I think he's a black belt on a Hickson is he really a Visia the easy they're a black belt on history's most certainly coached by Hickson because I remember Hickson was with him and some others early fights he worked with Hicks and there was some sort of connection between him and Hickson but his his his strangles in particularly unbelievable so seeing him I've seen him tap out a lot of good guys in the gym I believe it a lot of good guys and it's like they're just different just it's you know what it is it's not that they're different they do it right yeah you know they also they develop a skill like whatever it is you know some guys just have a triangle stay the fuck out of his guard the guy just has a triangle that you just can't get certain guys who just get really proficient at one particular maneuver yeah and honey I was like his chokes were just nasty yeah he's so I'm working with him now on some some ground-and-pound dijanna incorporate that into see in South Florida yourself or to Wow South Florida goddamn hotbed now what do you think about altitude training I mean obviously it has to work right yeah I mean I tried it I don't think it worked for me maybe I just didn't believe in it at the time but it has to work because I mean I don't know maybe everybody does it so it has to work seems like it would work scientifically right he agrees his red blood cells yeah should work it should definitely increase your endurance but TJ Dillashaw disagrees really and he's got incredible endurance yeah you know he works with that calivita guy and what he would their take is is that your ability to work is compromised when you perform and train at altitude so even though your body produces more red blood cells you don't you're not working as hard because you just can't there's not enough air so the idea is I've heard you should train at sea level but then sleep at high altitude and TJ I believe TJ said that that's not even they don't even think that's the case anymore I think you're better off just with all that air just for recuperation and just higher work output higher work output and heart rate monitoring and making sure that you know you're doing like like tabata intervals things like that will you recover and making sure that all that's monitored that it's done scientifically yeah I don't know man it's hard to go it's hard to go against TJ because I've never even seen him breathe harder to fight oh yeah so like it's hard to go against what he said but I kind of like the idea of that you know I mean I just you know I'm kind of an old-school guy so I don't really believe in all the bells and whistles and gadgets and I guess with TJ Santa's just work harder yeah well he does a lot of calisthenics a lot of explosive stuff a lot of like plyometrics and you ever see the shit that he does down in the garage no the guys name is calivita right Sam yeah and he's apparently I've never worked with a guy or even talked to him but massive respect from so many different fighters a trained with them Aaron Pete goes down there without really yeah and this guy is just a mass strength & Conditioning look is they're doing a bunch of this kind of shit jumping over over strings and bobbin and Weavin under him and I mean and calivita is like got them all wearing heartrate monitors this this there's no guesswork to the training the training is all really well-thought-out and it's all like mostly that kind of stuff plyometrics box jumps medicine ball work that kind of shit and you know I mean you can't deny the TJ's in phenomenal shape and that guy never gets fat never takes time but what is it isn't this in Colorado no it's here now oh it's here yeah they're doing they have a new gym they're called the training lab but the the word train is has word rain in it like Mark Munoz style like rain gym so tre I end yeah and they put together a gym so he's down here now Dwayne goes back and forth you know from Colorado to here Dwayne still has a school in Colorado and he comes back here to Train TJ so but who does TJ do work with as far as skill wise while he's here I think Munoz in him we're doing wrestling he's got a bunch of people down there a bunch of jujitsu people and then also like I said Aaron Pecos down there it was very high-level a bunch of a bunch of different guys training them and I'm really interested to see how he does it 125 how his body does with that massive weight cut I mean and this is the one thing I like about TJ is it I don't think he's doing it just because he feels like he's gonna be better at 124 I think and then he's doing it because it's a challenge yeah because he's also said he's willing to go up to 145 mm-hmm to fight max Holloway yeah so I I'm kind of rooting for him I'd love to see how he performs at 125 yeah he says he can make it no problem Wow that'd be interesting be so lean you look at him now he's leaner than he's ever looked before him he shredded now he looks like he's ready to weigh in now really you know what I'm seeing like you know guys looked so lean when they're weighing in yeah and then they fill up a little bit when they add water he looks like that now yeah I mean whether or not he's got too little body fat I mean is there a point of diminishing returns you know what that's that's a big question and that's the way I always see it too whenever guys cut too much weight the return aren't the same like you just you depleting yourself to hunch almost like the same concept mm-hmm is it if you are so concerned about your weight your output as far as like skill training and physical training isn't the same yeah look at them they're shredded that's yesterday reddit well look at that that's ridiculous is he is he working with some eye on his weight cut or is it just I think calivita works with him on that as well it works with them with nutrition I mean that guy is supposed to be a real mad scientist I need to talk to that gentleman and have him in here but he's um you know this is in the garage together new videos them training together yeah so his nutritional analysis oh this is what he has set up for it oh he's got an app yeah Jesus jaysus yeah become a fat burning machine ooh I want to be a fat burning machine virtual training yeah I'm interested to see how he performs against Sahu dough because so who don't has a hard time making that weight as well yeah remember that could imagine if she made him fight at 135 for a bit because he kept missing weight I mean ever seen the size of his head it's a big bowl that at eat away yeah but he's you know for uh for a wrestler man like he box yeah well the Wilson Hayes fight yeah no I mean any fuck karate style on that yeah yeah I mean when you can wrestle that good you can afford to be in any stance you want because you can always just you know adjust and revert back to your wrestling position but yeah that's true yeah but I'm not sensitive right I'm looking for us that's next week I can't wait to that man I'm ahh that is next week it's the 19th right yeah are you going out to that no that's Brooklyn yeah that's a SP n card I'm not doing that one I only do North American pay-per-view now that's it uh uh big-time in too busy yeah shows in a row it's that I travel too much as it is and you know I don't want to I don't want to do that I don't like going to Australia and shit anymore I love Australia but yeah fuckin that wrecks you for two weeks yeah yeah now I know you got on eBay I saw you do um stand-up in Boston yeah did you open for shop yeah yeah that's fun I was proud of him man shards killed he's about to do is special that's why we're I'm gonna be on the 19th I'm gonna be with him he's recording his Showtime special down in San Diego no kiddin yeah I'm like Danis because he like it only done comedy for like a year or something two years now two years over two years and I saw him like it was like a year ago maybe not man it may be you're good it was like doing comedy for you and you had an hour show and it's good yeah and it was yawning yeah and I'm thinking like you know I've stabbed one in it for a couple years and I got five minutes not even I got I got a week five he's out there doing it every night yes you gotta do it every night I mean he's performing with me tonight at The Improv oh yeah yeah yeah you got to do it every night it's like it's sort of like like you can't be good at jujitsu if you don't have endurance from rolling right you got a roll you got to do comedy all the time you got to get in that minds on there's like a hypnosis zone of stand-up yeah that same thing Jim Norton told me yeah yeah but I mean my whole thing was like I'm not really in love with stand-up like that to go out and we want to do it every night I love it grind you and when you eat shit like you bombed the dime bar you know what that feels like yeah one time that is shit don't work well shabd treats it like a professional athlete and there's one thing I say to young comedians when they say how's he doing so good so quick I won't listen to me you lazy fuck you don't even write you barely perform you do Lee the same five minutes over and over again night after night without any improvements I got this guy's treating it like a professional athlete would treat it that's the difference yeah having being a funny guy already he's funny having a good mind and then having discipline just discipline where you analyze your shit and you work on it and you get better it's possible he's on an accelerated program the most accelerated I never heard anybody doing a hour special two years in yeah that's why I was like damn he's killing it yeah and he's he's cool too man like he responds to my Texas and shit like that you know some yeah some people you know they get all high big-time yeah big-time he's a great guy yeah you're like a genuine good person yeah you look forward to seeing him succeed yeah and I like this is that you said it was funny but it was honest you know he's talking about his career and his life is honest and a lot of people you know aren't willing to be that vulnerable right yeah they want to be the cool guy yeah yeah I always try to be - to cool the cool guy is not funny it's not funny to be the cool guy yeah that's right like yes what cuz that lame and everybody tries to be the cool guy how do you get out how to get away with that all the actors try to be the cool guy or rappers maybe actors and maybe singers and musicians maybe they try to be the cool guy but in comedian world there's no room for that you know people paid money to hear you talk you better have some funny shit to say yeah if you have some funny shit to say but you don't have any funny shit to say about you game's weird it seems weird yeah so you got to be kind of self opening it up open up Pandora's Box let's see the zombies what's in there what are the demons let him out that amount you know you only do so many specials before you let the demons out and you might be able to get away with one special making fun of stuff outside of you but you got a you have to have to bill see everything if you're gonna be a comedian you're gonna keep going you could be how you're looking at the world and if how you're looking at the world none of it is reflecting on you none of it yeah yeah yeah yeah if it's reflecting on you and you're funny you got to be able to be a fool you have to be able to be a fool you have to every every great comic makes fun of themselves yeah I mean I so I mean I'd do more improv shit you know master always gives me shit for that because I hang out with nerds and fucking improv the improv troupe yeah that she's not do more that shit Matt Sarah gives you a hard time oh my god [Laughter] fucking them an improv troupe I'm a theater nerd man I hang out with a little improv nerds and shit so I do that but um but I guess why I didn't really dig into stand-up as much for some reason I was just like and I've got time to be going out there fucking every night getting my fucking teeth kicked in by these audiences yeah but I noticed I know us it's necessary and it's part of the process yeah but it's not necessary if you don't want to do it like it's it's not something everybody should do yeah yeah you tried it you didn't like it and it's not that I don't like it neither that's the thing is like I don't mind it right yeah it's just yeah but I feel like if you want to be good at it and get to the next level right did you have to fucking go do that process is this you would say the same thing to a fighter if you had a fighter that was coming in like I like to train but I like to train that much like don't you know fighting yes love this thing if you want to be a professional fighter man do you have to have a singular focus like you have to be really driven and dedicated and the difference between that is with comedy yeah you might get your teeth kicked in but but with fighting you're gonna get your teeth kicked in like really fucking banged up and you have to be able to suffer almost every day in order to get yourself in the kind of condition that you need to be in to fight yeah you need to have there's a level of discipline that you need to have to be a professional fighter that's almost unequalled in sports yeah because I mean it can like that because it's not just discipline like you you have to have great discipline if you want to be a runner you want to be a marathon runner or a great discipline if you want to be a professional football player or professional basketball player but the difference between fighting is you have to have great discipline but you also are gonna get fucked up yeah you're also gonna get your face punched in you're gonna get your liver kicked you know you give me the limbs pulled yeah yeah you need your legs thumped with shins slamming into the meat of your leg where everything goes numb oh don't remind me do that shit no more I don't do that shit no more do your legs go back to normal to the point where you don't feel like you could take it anymore yeah I can't take kicks no more it's not a weird thing like he did develop like an ability to absorb those like you watch like Robert Van ruse Milan or something oh yeah Robin van Moo small neck I'll take a leg kick and it's like doesn't even seem to affect him yeah but when you stop doing it you can't go back right die I mean do you spar a little bit now oh yeah no I haven't kickbox part in forever yeah I was I just think like getting hit in the head should be something that you should decide okay no more of that like there should be a time like you could sparred you Jitsu and you can keep going pretty much forever I mean the Elio was sparring when he was in his 90s you're still rolling yeah but striking that's like at a certain point in time you got to stop yeah I don't do it yeah I bet I mean honestly I barely roll to be honest with you like I just study mm-hmm study and study do you work out a little bit like I mean I still have to roll at times to try what kind of workouts do you just know that happens a lot of fighters they stopped fighting and because yeah I mean he spent so many years like running and doing all this stuff like when you're done like the last thing you want to do is run in fact like tyron woodley we gonna camp but I say hey listen you gotta buy me a bike if you want me to go alongside of you while you're running are you running with your ass it's got to be hard for him to run too because he's so thick yeah yeah he's I mean he hates running but like I think that part of part of that motivates him to go dis muhfucka made me run fucking him up yeah yeah so he yeah so how about Styron now 35 35 maybe 36 how many more years he thinks I left hey be bullshitting people again another three years I don't think so you know his rap career about to take off sir you think so I don't know it could I mean you know I mean he's such he's done most hustlin guy I ever met he's always on TMZ he hustles is always doing something the cat hustles so he have a podcast will meet him have one together but we have one now yeah but we don't ever record cuz he be what is it what's it called it's uh it's the morning wood oh yeah more so but we we ain't recording like year oh well so he'll really consistent yeah the state at least that's the number one thing about podcasts you got to be consistent well yeah so like I do one now with a with TJ DeSantis called the beat down and like okay and I'm like dude let's record we got him cause like you said consistency is key to everything yeah there's too many out there yeah people get bored with you yeah if you don't if you don't give them you got to make them addicted and the only way to make them addicted is you got to first of all be addicted you got to be enjoying all these conversations because it's it's the only way that it is that it's contagious there's no other way like if you're half asking or faking it you really don't want to talk to these people yeah then that comes through people's ears they hear that you know like I always love talking to people I like I've always been like when I was in the brief amount of time I was in college the only thing that interested me with psychology really yeah I was interested because I knew my own mind like I got into psychology because the same reason why I was got into philosophy because I was scared scared of fighting I was like what's wrong with my brain like why my was scared like why my scared before every tournament and scared before all these different things like what and then I realized everybody scared okay well well how do people manage that like what what is is there a right way to think because I knew this sometimes I'd go in there with a perfect mindset and I'd win that feel great and then I couldn't recreate it like two weeks later I'm like well what the fuck is wrong with my head how do I figure this out so I always wanted to talk to people and find out like what makes you tick like what what what what motivates you how do you how do you discipline yourself like what are you thinking about when you're pushing yourself like what are you thinking about when you're calm do you spend time reflecting on your work do you just keep going and keep doing it or do you analyze it like what what is happening with you like what do you do and then so a podcast to me almost came naturally because I'm always I'm always talking to people and I'm always trying to do I want to always trying to like get behind the doors of the eyes like what's in there but I said Jim Norton said that about you too you think it's a great conversation with you think it's blankenship well I'm curious I'm late I don't want to just talk I want to I want to want to hear people like sometimes comedians are just waiting for their turn to talk and they're not listening to you like I've always tried very hard to listen to people and like see what where they're coming from trying to get into their head so let me ask you this did you ever figure it out what out why you couldn't manage wow those emotions I was young first of all I stopped fighting when I was 21 or 22 somewhere on that range between 21 and 22 I there was also no future that was a problem too it wasn't like I was working toward something when I was fighting it was you know I stopped in 88 89 I think maybe I had my last kickboxing fights and there was no there was no future there was nothing nowhere to go like kickboxing you got like five hundred dollars for a fight you get your brains punched in there was no money in Taekwondo and then the Olympic scoring system the Olympics were incredibly corrupt like the the scoring was terrible like especially be fought a Korean oh good lord and I went oh yeah yeah not winning I just beat the living fuck out of them in order to worry atop them you know KO them and then I was also seeing brain damage I was seeing people in the gym with brain damage especially when I started kickboxing so spending a lot of time in boxing gyms I was seeing guys that were slurring and stuttering their words and they'd just acted weird and you see guys that acted different after a KO they got ko'd and then you see them just a little bit more distant a little bit more glassy-eyed and slack-jawed and you're like oh Jesus Christ but you see it yeah I mean I hate it man it breaks my heart every time I see a guy take unnecessary punishment yeah and not even even if he's not slur just like taking unnecessary punish because you know where it leads I know where it leads and it really breaks my heart when I see like the fans like expect it from fighters yeah Dayoung you know they don't know what they're watching you know they're just they're just watching violence that it's almost like it's not really there yeah it's not really happening they don't like they don't know what it's like yeah where the guy gets knocked out yeah and then because if for them is over and they just you know they going back to the regular life but for me I'm going to the hospital with this motherfucker who got knocked out yeah and he's got his fucking eye you know busted open and he's all busted up from just orbital bone and and for the next you know three or four months you know this guy's depressed because he was trying to cater to the fans and put on this exciting fight yeah and yet he doesn't do all this punishment and that's just then and then you do that have a career of that you gonna be fucked up yeah yeah I don't yeah I don't like it you know it's uh it's just it's hard when guys don't know how to get out or where to go when they get out and it's hard when you see them knowing that they have to get out but they're still fighting yeah oh yeah that's the worst man I'm always like what do you do when you have a fighter that you you know should stop I'm pretty honest with them I'm always honest I'm always like man listen this ain't for you no more and I always have to tell them like if I if I feel like it's gonna affect them physically and hurt them by continuing to fight I tell them that you need to stop and more often than not they kind of listen they're probably kind of know they kind of know and they just need some I else to say it you know and I'm more willing to tell them I always try to tell them but sometimes if they don't want to do it then I can't really be a part of it like when you saw Tito versus Chuck yeah that's one of the my opinion in no disrespect to Chuck he should do whatever he wants to do maybe he enjoys it maybe he wants to compete but that was one of the worst examples of a guy who used to be a fuck and destroyer ah chuck was a destroyer like bobble hallelujah man dude Randleman came Randleman failed everybody he was a he was a killer Chuck was a straight-up Ken I'm watching him fight fucking Pele Landi bare-knuckle in Brazil yeah when they had the net the ropes he got knocked down with three times when head kicks in still fuck yeah Manus yeah and then I watch him and then again another another case in Scenario word like young fighters see him and go harness old guy yeah but he shouldn't be fighting yeah he shouldn't be fighting at 50 and he clearly can't take a punch anymore like whatever it is like when Tito connected on him everything just shut off yeah you see it just shut off and then Tito smashes him and we talk about Tito we exactly talking about fucking Anthony Johnson that's true but I think Tito's punches are a lot better than they used to be yeah and I think Perillo Jason Perillo is a fantastic coach I think he did an amazing job and I think Tito you know he's just not a natural striker it's not like his thing he's a wrestler but it's the way the way it happened it just Chuck couldn't connect he is like everything looked off his timing his movement just looked this balanced looked off and when you talk to people that are neuroscientists and they understand what happens to the brain after a repeated brain trauma over and over and over again and then what we're seeing is just in the cage we don't have no idea how much brain trauma he took in camps and it's probably pretty magnificant yeah I would assume his style was so he's such a brawler and he had an iron chin for the beginning of his career was it just one of the greatest Chin's of all time so when it failed him there was no there was no escape clause there was no there was no way there's no backdoor this was the style the style wasn't all of a sudden you're gonna be like Mighty Mouse and not get hit switch stance yeah and become slick that shit is just not available and when you saw him with this hampered movement he just doesn't his balance doesn't seem right like I was watching him hit the pads when they were preparing when they were he's getting ready I was watching hit the pass I was like what is happening here because balance looks fucked up like it didn't look right like even when he's throwing kicks he like threw a kick and then fall back like it didn't look right yeah but I mean and I feel that even with myself like I don't have the same balance I had when I was 20 Brian and I could imagine him like because he probably never even focused on that right he just did it he just he was just on punches right so for him that like I watched a video him shadowboxing horrendous horrendous but didn't you go back and watch him when he was the champ it's like Jesus Christ yeah hey I heard no I watched him hit the bag and it's like a fucking mother his beans power.yes everything putting it together yeah and just that style just the I mean the reason why he became such a fan favorite because you knew chuckle Adele was coming to kill you yeah yeah I mean he was coming to kill you in that cage door shut and they said let's get it on he just stepped forward and just looking to smash that was his style and it was the reason why the UFC became so famous one of the big reasons why the UFC became so popular was Chuck Liddell yep he was a guy who everybody could identify with yeah and the fan base City FC saw themselves in Chuck Liddell well they wished they wish they could be that guy yeah yeah yeah shave has the Mohawk tattooed it was fearless it was knocking people out and scream afterwards yeah yeah it's like they saw that's who they saw it I said I won't be that guy yeah and you're right and that's how the UFC became so popular so fast as with child when you see him now at 50 fighting the way fought against Tito you're like oh so hard what but they had the other hand it's like I don't want to tell the guy what to do he's not gonna live forever like if this is what he really enjoys and he wants to do that I mean maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world for him to keep going I don't know I don't know I'm not his dad yeah at him you know I don't know what to tell him I mean it also you got to think like he's probably does worse things in his life didn't I been getting in a cage with a good old buddy you know you think so probably yeah yeah hanging out at the church he definitely did a share partying yeah which doesn't help yeah yeah depending upon what you're partying with too you know I'm sure there's certain substances that are worse than others when it comes to your brain see that's why I can't never live in LA stay my ass in Florida well what's in Florida it's a cocaine capital of the world I know man but not as much ecstasy yeah I don't know the party scene just seems it's not the same as Florida fucking Florida if not Miami's gotta have the craziest party scene in on the yeah you could stay away from that though yeah well you can because of the gym yeah and hanging out with the right people but whenever I'm down in Miami I'm like this is the most chaotic place ever yeah Miami I never go to Miami I don't ever go down there really yeah it's a fun place last time I did a gig there though I was it was right before I was filming my Netflix special and so we have these Yonder bags yonder is a cell phone bag that they use well you have to put yourself on this magnetically sealed bag to get into the room and the only way to use your phone is you got to leave the room they open the bag for you they give you your phone you hold on to your phone the whole time you have possession of it but it's sealed in this bag keep people from texting and filming and all that kind of shit while the show is going on every other place it accentuated the show because it mean it made the show like 10% better because people were just focused they weren't staring at their phone they're just focused at the show in Miami all people kept doing is just getting up to go outside to use their phone it was like no it sat down the whole really moving pop it just made it worse huh it made it worse yeah there's one of the few play like when Tiffany Haddish she just bombed in Miami there's like this big TMZ deal that she bombed there I'm like yeah in Miami you got to grab those motherfuckers you got to go hey here's the show well that is I tell you though South Florida is probably the most unfocused place on earth like nobody's focused on anything nothing I said starve to death open a bookstore in Miami yeah it's true man people Miami like they don't they don't have a little handle football team they got the Dolphins but

Miami they say that at one point in time I don't have to steal the case but at one point in time Miami had more banks per capita than anywhere else in the continent and it's all because the cocaine money was being laundered through Miami these areas 100% there was one this is all Billy Corbin's documentary he's got two documentaries fantastic documentaries cocaine Cowboys wanted to but one of the things that he talked about is one year every single member of the graduating class of the police academy either was murdered or went to jail every single member that entire Police Academy was

Twitter a lot of people are doing that now I know a lot of people are deleting Twitter and they just don't they don't read it anymore don't pay attention to it anymore I go in every now and then but I would the way I describe it it's always like peering into a haunted house yeah fuck's going on there well the problem is it puts everybody on the same level mm-hmm so like you can you - it you don't saying you work your hardest to get something and then you let these fucking guys just sign in and talk shit to you yeah you know right they don't do nothing they'll do neither life but you don't sign

no disrespect to any of these bands I'm sure they're really good but yeah Chris is right I'll belong superorganism Oh super organized under there working again what serpent with feet okay shut this off before I become crystal Lia and that's music today meant everybody had come out with music these days a lot of musicians I'm not in that business I understand it I have them on here I don't know how they do it I'm not gonna in what you do on wait you have them on here all the time musicians all the time but I'm like just that world it's just such a difficult if it feels so difficult to break through like it seems like the most difficult world to break through because of the competition does everybody thinks they can do it he's a lot of competition especially rappers you know if you hold a note all you have to do is just make shit rhyme yeah and you don't even really have to do that not anymore ya know I can mumble your word hear things yeah you're right like the rap industry God like at least in fighting you can win yeah keep going yeah yeah yeah and fighting you just fuck people up yeah and if you fuck everybody up you win yeah you win and you're gonna be they're gonna be the greatest ever nobody has to like you yeah yeah once they lock that cage door yeah you just fuck that person up I'm sorry didn't like it fuck see boy up cut-and-dry that's what it is and rap or music industry it's like yeah I'm the best yeah there's a lot of biting a lot of stealing doing raps and stealing the Rhymes and just a lot of that in that world too rough in comedy if people are laughing then you keep going in right I suppose yeah but also in comedy there's so many places to work like to so many comedy clubs there's so many comedy clubs oh really so you can work a lot as a comedian yeah you work every night you might not get booked as a beginner but once you get going and once like you name a guy who's who's a good colleague Adam hunter the perfect example good comic think I works everywhere yeah every it's always working everyone yeah he's always got something going on and you could if he was a rapper he would be fucked yeah you know I mean it's like if you're that level rapper like there's not a lot of options for you yeah where you gonna work there's no rap club I'm gonna go to the rap club do a 5-minute set that shit's not real yeah you're right but comedy yeah I guess I but I didn't know but I thought it was kind of hard to get put on though like it's a it's not well not for Adam obviously but he's pretty successful but in the beginning there's plenty of little tiny places and bringer shows where you do like you know a couple minutes and then once you're good call me one thing about comedians they help each other yeah like really yeah I heard it was like the opposite would you hear that well Norton no no no every day he said um it's different in New York yeah there's some comedians they get jealous of other ones that I may have that are successful yeah those are the ones that suck yeah okay yeah the good ones support other ones that are good because you realize you need them it's almost like you need if you're in a gym you need guys that are really good around here pushing a train upon us you need that with comedy - yeah you need other comedians were really good elevates your your idea what's good yeah that makes sense you know I think in general comedians are probably one of the more supportive of all art forms one of the more supportive of other people that are doing it I would hope so because it's such a world where if I should be comedian against the audiences it's like so like you kind of need people to to support you and have your back can go up they don't worry about that one also as long as no one's stealing from you when they're on stage you're not so it shouldn't affect you at all and in fact you probably got into comedy because you're a fan of comedy that's how I got into it so if I was if I didn't enjoy other people that were really good at it like what I took away that one thing that I really love to watch and then I started doing it for a living now I can enjoy it anymore that's crazy the only way you enjoy it is you got to appreciate something that's really good you can't be seeing someone goes up now fuck that crowd so do you still go watch sometimes like you ask your homeboys yes watch my friends you know all the time yeah that's one of the reasons why if I go on the road I always bring really funny people with me I want to laugh I want to laugh before I go up some comedians don't want that though they want the audience to be suffering until they get up the pre terrible opening acts what yeah that seems like a terrible idea I agree but see yeah you're coming at it from a martial arts perspective like martial artists yes like we look you martial artists first of all everybody supports everybody everybody helps everybody you have to be training together you're working with you there's coaching there's like you're you're advancing each other you appreciate it when someone fucks somebody up like you realize like damn the guys good that's good there's like a lot of props like if you see like a comedy special you'll see a bunch of comedians tweeting about how good a comedy special is you know I don't think you see that much in the rap world or someone is really good and a bunch of other people other rappers are chiming about how great that thing yeah yeah you also yeah you're right that's you're right about that oh the Shriners you do yeah if somebody fucked somebody up and like some some big like damn he looked good tonight they look good and you'll see all this chatter all the people supporting it yeah rap is the opposite opposite yeah throw game yeah that's the weird one right the drug game yeah do you do you anticipate staying in South Florida I don't know I mean so I don't know if they have it on where you're from originally from Delaware oh yeah so I got buddies from Delaware I know I'm the only one I made it as the only person ever escaped Oh actually man done remember it was a state you know it's a interesting fact me and Roxanne mattifier was born in the same hospital really yeah Wow that's crazy yeah what are the odds I know but I'm not visiting from Delaware so eventually I feel like I want to be a snowbird yeah meaning you know right yeah so code hangout Florida during um during winter months yeah and where were you live and the other time I don't know I might go Pennsylvania Jersey or some shit that's a vania like Philly yeah si mom my folks is wrong really yeah Philly's nice yeah I love Philly it was real real city yeah I said they're really intelligent people that will punch you in the face yeah that's Philly yeah yeah yeah there wow people are Philly or wild yeah they're real and they're passionate and they're wow yeah so you kind of have to like that yeah it's a and they're better looking than Boston sorry Boston really girls are better looking in Philly why is that it's too smart my girls awesome yeah yeah I don't know about that I think Boston is dealing with a lot of the original genes of the original travelers that made it across that boat this savage folk that didn't want to live in Europe anymore yeah yeah those genes are not the best genes bunch of animals so they're still dealing with them fucking genes it's still punching each other and a lot of fistfights in Boston yeah you go out on a Friday Saturday night and go around the bars to see plenty of fistfights in Boston it's one of the few places in the world where people still are got a regular basis beat the shit out of each other on the streets that's good then you know police ain't shooting drunken savages well there's some shootings too for sure but there's a lot of knuckle and down yeah that's kind of good but I think there's something to that Jean hold Jean thing when I was in Milwaukee and I was like damn body's fucking people so ugly some mixing going on yeah well I think that's the reason why California has some of the best-looking genes because the people that lived on the East Coast look I gotta get the fuck out of here they kept going until they got the californian they hit that water might I don't want to live in Hawaii fuck yeah stay right here and then just the breeding yeah yeah and then there's also the entertainment business all the pretty people from Cincinnati they got on a bus yeah I'm gonna make it look at these cheeks yeah I'm gonna make it how many of them make it very very very very very few it's almost not even worth it almost not even worth it unless you make it then you okay me bitch dad dad dad who won I did that's right cash throwing them up there making Instagram videos rolling around your silk sheets filled with hundred our pills I almost feel like it's best thing like in the age we live in now it's better to just stay where you're at and put your shit out online online yeah for sure yeah but I think people are still caught up in the mystique of like coming to Hollywood making it in Hollywood they even people that do big things online they still want to do like legitimate things like I love to do movies you know who love to do TV they want to do things that pay them less money than they do being a YouTube star yeah really YouTube pays a lot of money now like if you're a big like Logan Paul type dude yeah they make he makes a shitload of money on you like who fucking pays him by who who signs his check advertisements so he's selling advocates these videos on the videos get millions of millions of hits and he gets millions of dollars from advertisement revenue probably more money than most successful sitcom people yeah yeah if you think like someone who's on a successful television show you think well that guy's got to be ballin I bet Logan Paul makes twice as much money as those people fuck I know crazy and then there's people like pudy pie how much does that guy make he's got like 77 million subscribers so the but the only thing about that guy is he likes to say controversial shit and he gets in trouble and then sometimes they pull ads off of them stuff like that but I think if you're one of those like ninja Z another one that video game guy those people make outrageous sums of money outrageous sums of money like playing video games and talking shit yeah I saw it it was like this little kid it was like a seven year old me like twenty million dollars like that doing toys yeah Ryan Ryan's toy review that's the kid at him he made 22 million in 2018 by reviewing toys this little Asian kid right now a little kid right there how much do you think the parents let him keep I tell my parents to suck my set up that fucking video and you clean my room this month will just be raised up a wiffle ball break Paul 21 million so you look at that 21 million just by talking on he had a Disney show for a while was on a Disney show that my kids watch and then he decided won't fuck that I'd rather just be in my house what does it say on his wall team team Paul team ten that's a team ten squad he'd be like pinging down on his wall he's got a man she's gonna fucked up inside they've got one of those Lego installations to that some guy came in and put Legos all in this wall no interesting so who's number three let's see this is a group of guys dude dude perfect they make like five man sports crew I've seen those guys they do stuff with bows and arrow it just all kinds of thing they've been doing it for a few years they're cuddling they've been burning down like any kind of chick shot you can think of so they made 20 million dollars all five of them so five million bucks each it's not nothing to sneeze at and then what else this guy's solo like damn TDM yeah and he made 18 million holla slash ball and I can go anywhere Oh Geoffrey star is that a guy or a girl say chef makeup star makeup artist since the myspace era has reinvented himself as a beauty mogul wait a minute you say himself are you misgendering him I didn't miss gendered I think that's whatever that is was this one marked up video game choir 17 nobody ever see that guy before that guy could go anywhere meanwhile I made 17 million dollars vanossgaming Canadian gamer Evan Fong plays mainstream titles like the Call of Duty plays games 17 million its man another one yeah sixteen million look at this guy like you benching him before I never hurts another guy that just he's a famous guy I don't know too much about them I never watched him the most followed seventy two point five million followers I think the reason why he makes less money is because of the advertisers have abandoned him because he dropped some em bombs oh yeah what does it say up there what does it say about his uh No below him below there swedish gamer the most followed yeah a backlash last year rash of anti-semitic videos that's right anti-semitic he said he but it was like he was joking around in the like was making fun of anti-semitic people but while he's wearing a Hitler outfit right George work like you paid some people like admit to make a fiber video putting up signs that they didn't know they just did it does that too yeah well anyway point being you're right they can make a shitload of money just being on YouTube and on Twitch playing video games guy I know that's real that's like if you're a CEO of a gigantic fucking corporation you work 15 hours a day you be super happy to make with these assholes man fucking like you're like you're right like with the exception of a little kid I'm gonna give a pass but the rest of them dudes are just assholes are YouTube making money I mean I think you have to be an asshole to get attention to I mean that's like part of the thing you got to be how would is Miranda sings is she in that list this was just the top ten okay she's not the top I mean there's probably like a hundred people that make seven million I know mommy just give me so break me out got my online project coming out trained BJJ online.com yeah nice oh shit - shit and your trained BJJ online.com is that it's like from white belt to black belt like you learn no so Rick ulam no not even like that like cuz I don't really care about bills okay to be honest with you I care about being effective and you know as much as I do like jiu-jitsu at for MMA is different for like competition sure very different yeah so like that's what I'm focusing on you know the difference is mm-hmm and to make the shit work again because I think a lot of people are doing that jiu-jitsu wrong for MMA yeah they're using that thing they're using it wrong how so you know like cuz when you talk about like jiu-jitsu the way it's been played recently it's like well juju eight you just played in competition but all about getting points passing card run getting the back put the hooks in that shit don't work in MMA focal points yeah there's no planet for points right so I do it created and developed a bunch of positions too we fuck people up we hurt people and then submit them mmm that's the key usually Jitsu to hurt people then submit them when you say use it to hurt people you mean use it to maintain a position and land strikes yeah yeah punching people bunch of people and then submitting women soften them up a little bit yeah it's like the mentality of it is different you know not I'm not cuz like think about your like if I were if we and you were doing jujitsu right now like in order for me to pass your guard it would take me fucking ten minutes you know yeah five minutes to do the shit right I'm not trying to pass your guard right I'm trying to punch you yeah and also the other thing about it is like there's certain positions where you really just can't get away with if someone's punching yeah yeah for sure like especially the bottom a lot of game yeah has suffered tremendously because it hasn't evolved like jiu-jitsu hasn't evolved from the bottom and like that's something like I said when I stopped competing I studied studied studied said what works what doesn't work and now I figured out like it's all these different systems I think the jiu-jitsu has evolved from the bottom in in high level jiu-jitsu competitions we just haven't seen as much of it in MMA yeah yeah oh for a competition like jiu-jitsu is as great as it's ever been it's beautiful to watch like the way these guys move you know watching kina Cornelius like slither on afford someone beautiful but Ava do okay in MMA but like most like just there right away most guys wouldn't I think Gary tonin's gonna do very well he's doing well already yeah I think she's fighting in one Fc but I think Gary tonin has such a high level ground game particularly with his leg lock yeah and you know and he could do everything yeah back armbar you whatever you whatever you need and he's he's making his way through the ranks at well I'm very excited about one get me to I'd like one FC I'm a big fan you know gate owned it like he he can't I don't know if he wrestled before but he has like a wrestlers mentality when it comes to jiu-jitsu yeah like he's very aggressive yeah and he's like he's fearless you know he's fucking on the money so I like his chances against anybody yeah I like his chances to be a world champion yeah me too in MMA in any organization yeah and but I think on the ground like he's so far above almost everybody else he's gonna face I know you know especially when it comes to the leglock game his leg locks are just that hold Danaher death squad you know there's he they're raising some fucking killers over and I'm studying that shit now because I think there's a place for it and I think that in MMA people all that shit don't work jungle punch in the face yeah that's what I'm saying yeah I'm like cuz MMA guys don't really know how to do it right right cuz I'm doing it right sure just they're just swinging a leg around trying to squeeze they're not doing it right right well even Paul Haris you know when they were when they were talking about Garrett Onan was gonna face Paul Haris Paul Harris is so much bigger and so much stronger than Gary tonin and Gary tone and still threaten the fuck out of him had him in some real bad spots and you know they went to a draw it was a draw but like if they were points here I mean if you were to see who won wins yeah well first of all they're not the same size right I mean what is Gary fighting in 1 FC 150 55 yeah Horace is 200 pounds he's a gorilla yeah he's he's on every Mexican supplement yeah it's key would come to him with a like a fucking paper towel just wiping every metabolite that's ever existed yeah he's a he's a gigantic guy and but they were saying that his leg game even though it's effective in terms of MMA like his transitions and his entries they're very limited and they're obvious and they were seeing him coming and he showed it when they competed against him yeah yeah yeah no but I like Gary tonin I think he's gonna do wonderful yeah I mean it'll be interesting to see him fight uh I mean obviously Eddie Alvarez that'll be there probably the same division so it'd be interesting to see yes yes very very interesting very interesting yeah Eddie Alvarez going over there is huge Mighty Mouse going over there is huge you know Brandon Vera's the heavyweight champion now you know Brandon Barrett's fucking people up over is it yes yes under a radar cuz you don't really hear much about him being over there fighting it seems like someone he knows been south of the border as well about 240 pounds oh my God he's so jacked you never seen Brandon Verena I haven't seen him in years do not I didn't even know he was fighting over some in people yes smashing people and he's like 242 plus pounds now no shit cheap giant neck fucking traps jacked his fuck is he still training an alliance oh I believe so yeah but I tell you what man like you sent a leglock game like Ryan Hall has the ability to beat anybody in the featherweight division yeah if he catches a hole over there yeah yeah I think he could beat I think he beat Holloway the same as he beat anybody else and I'm not saying he can beat him but I'm saying like if he it's a whole damn legend yeah yeah he could tap anybody that's yeah his level of jujitsu his understanding his technique his skill levels very very very high like world championship caliber yeah yeah but there's a bunch of got looked at that's Brandon Vera now jacked he's Jack dude show me show me yeah look at that he was skinny and slim always fighting 205 and heavy weight in the UFC now he's just heavy weight and so he just packed on some meat put up put a video of like there's a Brandon Vera highlight ko video out there but uh he's fucking people up over there man let's see something just that one that's on the two other ago the truth Brandon Vera highlights don't don't don't don't don't don't don't mr. Freak Z's 75 whatever the fuck that is however the gentleman is put together this highlight reel it says the truth Brandon Vera highlights February 1 Championships highlight contest you see some fighting parts is it all no here we go boom and Brandon Vera always has like very high-level striking yeah he was always crisp yeah and they see the one Fc getting head kick and he kicked people apparently in the back of the head which is kind of fucked up I don't know what the competition is like in the heavyweight division at one Fc like what level it is but I imagine with the size of the organization about how big it is that the competition is going to continue to rise in all weight classes right now like in terms of the number of people that are watching it rivals the UFC does it really hits ja and in asia jaja jaja jaja giant but I think it's gonna continue they're making a lot of money yeah a lot of money elite fighters I'm hoping it bring some more because they don't really have a strong American presence well I think they're signaling by having Eddie Alvarez come over there Miesha Tate is running shit over there now too as well as Rich Franklin he's running things I think he's the vice president there now a lot of shit happening over there we need it yeah we got another pride we need something like yeah we do yeah we do I listen I'm all for because I hate you know I work with a lot of guys and I hate when a fuck I don't have nowhere to work exactly you know and like if they're just if we only rely on the UFC and we all know that is it the one bad performance means you're out so it's a bad judging right yeah yeah what did you think about the PFL I love the PFL yeah yeah I love it I love the structure what's his name Sean O'Connell said something very interesting just off the top but he said I just made a million dollars and all I had to do was win and he repeated it all I had to do was win so to me I was like I guess he was just saying like he didn't have to be a character and this is coming from prior to only character in pfl right and he said that because I got none of my mother guys gonna do that shit you know but um but who was watching I don't think anybody was that's the thing that's the problem yeah I'm surprised he beat Vinny me too I thought I thought I thought so too but um but then when I thought about it I said damn he's been training with Jeremy horn his pride his whole career and Jeremy horn is a wizard too yeah so yeah but um but I trained a couple of Russians for four um magum he won - Walter Wiggins Ray Cooper - third yeah ray Cooper's a fucking beast I know five seven I know hundred seventy pounds throwing bricks I know the one he fought Jake Shields and beat him twice I had that stopped him twice all yes she's a state championship wrestling I know oh yeah I was you know I didn't think he was um because my guy took him down early and I was kind of surprised he took him down as early as he did because he has a state champ but but um he seemed small for the division yeah he could prior fight at 155 yeah just gotta have a little more success yeah but I like the fact that at least these guys have an option just a place they can win a million dollars and that's then the finals like leading up to it they're still making good money yeah like the loser made 250 and then like how do they get eyeballs though I don't know that's the problem that is the problem right that's the problem with everything I mean even with Bellator I mean the way they got eyeballs was to have like hoist crazy fight I mean that's the way they get eyeballs to have they have to have someone they have to have someone who's got a name you know that's the reason why he's brought over Tito and Chael and all these you know it's hard and that's what I was saying like Sean O'Connell like if you ever hear him talk like he's very charismatic and charming and he's the only person who probably can handle himself on a mic isn't he a radio guy I think so yeah yeah I think he's got a radio I think he's a sports radio yeah and for him to say all I had to do was win you know implying that he didn't have to talk like what did I say for you know Natanz Schult who won the lightweight who can't speak you know write it like it I don't know I can't imagine where they go in three years cuz they're not gonna have many stars well it seems like what is the same 2018 one championship registered an average of 11 million viewers per live event across its core markets according to nielsen that's a lot of fucking people 2015 this figure was less than one pop-up ads goddess son of a bitch 2015 this figure was less than 1 million viewers per live event so in three years they went from less than 1 million viewers for live event to 11 million viewers per live event that's fucking amazing the course across its core markets the article is comparing it to MBA viewership in Asia dramatic increase in TV viewership fantastic can't be more happy I hope they keep growing I hope they I hope they develop like real legit stars and also they have legit world championships across every combat sport over there they've got yachts and cly is doing MS Dickie Holt skins the kickboxing over there yeah yeah they're I mean they're they're bringing in world beaters and bait basically every discipline yeah I mean I love it I mean you know we both have fit our affiliation with the UFC but like without those other organizations the game don't last exactly the game can't last exactly it's so critical it's so critical that there's more opportunities and then also it raises the level of the UFC as well yes is everybody yeah rising tide raises all boats yeah really does hopefully of UFC kind of take the page from what I've seen and does the weight thing force them into that but they're trying to figure out what to do about weight cutting I mean they really are they're trying to figure it out and I brought to their attention the one Fc plan how the one Fc does it they've been basically eliminated everybody goes up a weight you know they moved every champion up a weight class they do hydration tests they find out what your actual weight is and they don't let you fuck around and you fight out what you really weigh I mean that's really what it should be and if you need to be in a lighter weight class guess what Fat Boy time to fucking get on a bike do it again try again next year I love that like at the beginning of the air this is what you're gonna weigh and fight at for the year stay here yeah if you don't like it next year fucking get another weight class that's right all right dude we just did three hours damn crazy time five-man time you see how that is we finally did it we finally did I'm sorry I'm the owner for like 30 minutes no 15 minutes and let's do it again man yeah listen I know give everybody your social media dresses that Dean Thomas at DIA n Thomas or go to me at a oh yeah or at trained BJJ online okay yes it's Dean Thomas on the gram twitter twitter or facebook all everything alright beautiful thank you break about how at me man my pleasure man was fun it was fun alright folks see you soon bye [Music]
