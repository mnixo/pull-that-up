we're here in the podcast on day one of the robots attacking the people it started Tempe Arizona someone's killed by a self driving uber I'm not buying those things put the self-driving goobers I'm not ready for this yet no chance it's not ready dude I'm not ready for planes they should have those things on a closed course over a long period of time you know and then let them drive around cities yeah we got to build some trust yeah I'm not I'm not trusting we got have some obstacle courses self-driving Overkill's Arizona pedestrian there's all these cops this is hilarious is that an uber car or a cop car they're all goobers they look like cop cars what's the thing in the roof the camera it lets it drive sensors dude fuck all that yeah not to say that a guy couldn't have done that and not to say that this person whoever it was who knows what the circumstances were sometimes accidents are unavoidable right I mean there's certain times where someone makes an error we don't know but I just feel better if it's a person making an error for some strange reason same here I think uber and lyft would have like a gang war they probably would yeah if you let the algorithms take over it's over they'd probably fuck with each other don't think like that we were guys super aggressive isn't he ticket didn't get in trouble for doing the like fake oh that's right that's real is that real is that a real story logging networks it was like allegations I think because they were private considered each other whatever so I don't know if it ever came out and hmm yeah I know there was allegations that they were like making fake calls right is that what it was fake requests I'm just bailing last minute dude you got the right idea living up in the middle of nowhere yeah you got the right idea with that yeah we just got Hoover but it's only two dudes and I have both their numbers let's see just call me cry yeah that's actually cool people are in your town a little 2,400 as long as you not a drink that's a fucking good place to live oh well the currency's beer that's the thing those everyone can do everything but no one wants to work it's pretty hilarious look at this goobers dirty tricks quantified rival counts 5560 canceled rides that's in 2014 is that real that's right when it started is that definitely let's on CNN so it can't be fake news oh I've never cancelled an uber I feel like really bad about it about never cancelling well no I mean if I cancel that'd be like I'd want to like tell the guy yeah I'd be like hey man you should be away if you have to cancel to give the guy a tip that that's a good move you know like say I have to like super last minute cancel this guy's already won this way over here let me throw them 30 bucks or at least a 5 star at least something something give him some money give them five bucks give them five bucks for cancelled ride that's not bad right that's more than fair you're sat in the back a few minutes you don't get anything back when they fuck with you though oh I don't know you son of a bitch but who are these people that are fucking with you is it the rare uber driver yeah every obrah I've ever been to was a dream I've never had a single problem have you had you barracks ever though that's the truck well that's just like random people with cars all right right no I always do the one with like it's basically limo drivers that are like off-duty yeah those are awesome if you ever barracks it can get a little dicey oh I think you're just with a random chick that's having a meltdown oh yeah yeah I could imagine I mean she's cool it's not like it's a big thing but it's just like you know I can't pay my DSL bill this month and you're like lady I'm right here it's a very small car yeah there's people that just they're working their their life out but it's a if they're on like a hundred level game they're on level one and they're bouncing into the walls over and over again and they just don't seem like in order for you to give them real advice you'd have to basically move into their house yeah you'd have to like give a full revamp of the way they look at things you'd have to go okay stop okay first of all what are all these pills second of all what are you eating third of all like why do you talk to people like that like if you talk to people like that they're not gonna want to talk to you like you're upset that they don't like you but then you act in a way that's very unpleasant to be around right and then you'd have to go through every mistake this person's been then you'd have to find out it's almost all shitty parenting it's like plumbing yeah yeah yeah down to the root system the roots got into the pipes or you know I'll look at crack because of the earth shifted and you're losing all this water down here yeah you just start screaming when you feel threatened at all that may be a thing from your childhood yeah there's a lot of that out there there is I wanted to talk to you about social media okay because I love you okay - I think you're very good guy I really do but you are the worst representative of yourself on social media I'm a bad lawyer myself it's a bad form of getting out tricky ideas it's a bad form it's just not good I mean now it's what is it 280 now 280 characters it's better than it was 140 was very rough like 140 you'd have to you know you have to really think about what you're saying it's like you're yelling like as you're falling into a well you have like one sentence but you you are without a doubt addicted and I know you bailed on your phone for a while and you went to a flip phone yeah but I see these manic tweets from you and I just want to go hang out with you and go dude what are you doing like why are you constantly tweeting and attacking people and it's like sometimes the chaos helps me you're right I mean you're right right like I've had chianti that's David but like I see it as almost like a idea sonar where you're just like I get that I get that but I get that because I know you yeah really good dude in real life thanks man so when I see this online and I see these blurting out post you just outbreak post they're just they're just like like you got just let me see if I can throw the word nigger in here for a goof let me see if I could write you know say something that's gonna piss people off and it's just there's this weird thing you're doing like this Jeselnik thing like you decided to attack Anthony Jeselnik what happened was someone said that uh they'd hurt I he said I was alright which is like the new and he's old can believe that they could believe that you were alright but if you read one your outrageous tweets just one or two of them did go this guy's an outlaw trite comedian and then they see you with certain people that you've had podcast with and talked to that might also be lumped in even ridiculously so like Jordan Peterson they lump him in there right now I got you it doesn't make any sense but they do it yeah like I mean look I've had people on that people think are alright I mean people this people are fuckin crazy I mean there's people out there think ben shapiro is anti-semitic that's how that's how no i know there's no there's no logic at all like right now Martin Luther King jr. would be considered alright by certain crazy people he would probably have adjusted his views don't you think I mean his views had probably changed knowing all that we know about people today and he would be a different person you gotta think that guy growing up in the nineteen fifties and then you know beans into the 60s as the most important civil rights activist of all time he was dealing with a completely different world man and yeah there was no social media there was there was not much consolidated power it was probably very difficult to get people to march once they start sick and dogs on people and blowing fire hoses on them I mean you had to be you you had less protection and yeah he'd had to be more more rigid and conservative than just because people would have to be like just very careful that son you know we talked about this recently I guess it was with was it Daniella belly we were talking about about how recently slavery was was it him was it Daniella might have been either way um it's that's a crazy small amount of time crazy two hundred years ago and it's been existed for like tens of thousands of years and that there's more slavery in the world today because there's more people alive yeah that's kind of tricky but there's less percentage of people that are slaves right it's kind of misleading when people say there's more slavery there's way more people that's a good point yeah there's more everything way way way way way more people and there's way more crazy people and now they all have internet access yeah because I was looking at this thing where they were trying to trace you know you've heard about that new species of human that they found I think around somewhere in the range of the seven or eight years ago des no sins I think they called them they found them in Russia and what they are is you know when there was Neanderthal and Homo Sapien there was another one and then this other one bred there's apparently they think there was many different kinds of humans oh yeah for sure but what the thing that fucking freaked me out they were talking about how long ago this was like seventy thousand plus years ago that they were they were talking about one era and then they were talking about the amount of people that were alive then and they said something around the area of a hundred thousand humans total amount that's like that's on the 405 right now just fuck that on the 405 between here and like West Hills yeah probably more and that's why we have such a vicious instinct yeah because at that point it's just I think it got down to like 10,000 people at one point yeah that was what I was reading the article about it was also talking about um in Sumatra and we talked about this recently there was a gigantic supervolcano that blew up right and it fucked the earth up for like a thousand years and we had to survive that yeah and now we're trying to survive Twitter storms but we have those same instincts the same instincts that are like if you can't eat your dog right now you're gonna die right with the jezic thing uh so what else so I just went on his and he already blocked me and I had never written anything to him sorry just so I just posted that and said he got he has a liposuction his ass cuz I thought that was funny cuz I don't want to go too big I was like but why even do that like who gives a shit if he blocks you I just saw I was fine right but you're attacking them publicly this is the thing it's like you have like how many thousands of Twitter followers you have like 120,000 that's a lot of fucking people so a lot but he's a strong man like this day could've method me way very strong man like that's gotta sting there's gonna be like this disturbance of peace and tranquility for no reason just cuz he blocked you yeah you give a shit of people I hope you bought just like I like you go block me buddy I love it's a good guy he's a great joke right there's a funny guy man this is the problem is that like I'm a colleague of his I'm at the Comedy Store with him all the time yeah we go on back and forth next to each other all the time and you know just like you should attack someone when they do something really bad but see but you know what I'm saying I do know what you're saying like the sheath sword until you absolutely need it yeah well about that and I I wasn't like full attack mode dawg I was being playful the wars started you're talking about him getting liposuction and talking about him being gay and you're talking about you said a bunch of different thing no but that's after he said I was out in response he said that I'm an alt right third-rate piano comic I was like dude I just did a liposuction joke hmm but English I'm not even mad at the guy at all like I want then you again do a terrible job of representing yourself that's a good point because it seems to me even I had a text show I'm like what are you doing I know wait I just want to give you a compliment I love that you're more critical offline like you're one of the few people right now in this world it's like oh what the fuck you doing I loved it but online you're chill and so many people are the opposite they attack online and apologize in the DM and you're I just want to say that that's good leadership qualities oh well that's very nice for you but I'm not trying to be a leader I just try to be a good person I think that you you have an issue with someone you should do you should talk to them in person if you can if not on the phone but that one-on-one like this idea that you should automatically blurt out what you think about someone's public mistakes to the rest of the world to state your position like there was a lot of the requests to state your position after louis c.k got in trouble right i have no idea what actually happened if the way the women are telling it is a hundred percent true then i am i think it's fucking gross and disgusting and I'm sad I'm sad that he had that in his head that he wanted to do that I'm sad that the girls had to experience it it's an uncomfortable thing but I don't know that and I've heard stories about people thinking it was funny too you know there's there was like this weird thing going on the tribal stuff where it's like what side of it what side are you on but people were like this was the Louie CK instance was the first census that I've can recall where people were demanding a response like a public response about something well I noticed that in entertainment with Trump it's like the lack of talking about Trump it's now seen as endorsements like when Taylor Swift just didn't get involved in the chaos people were calling her like alright man it's it's there's so many people just waiting waiting to pull the trigger and they're doing so in such a fucking insane and ridiculously misrepresentative way there was something about Jordan Peterson man Jordan Peterson going to speak somewhere and there was these people sending emails that he was a Nazi and oh yeah schist and a racist and transphobic and just but they're just hurl these nuclear bombs of words with literal literally knowed were no thought whatsoever about the consequences of using these words to describe someone who's absolutely clearly not that of course it's someone can't argue on another side they just that's how they shut down the conversation but here's my point is that it elevates this manic misrepresentation of reality because they've agreed to not look at it realistically they've agreed who cares if he's not a Nazi we're gonna fucking calm a Nazi and in doing that you view your your escalating what's like if there's a mob mentality right as part of what's going on one of the things in happens in ma mentalities people start murdering people you can jump in right okay if people killing people and you're trying to get away the guys running at you with a knife you're gonna fuckin kill him that's what people do it's it's a normal thing it happens with mob mentality - that happens this with this these kind of arguments the same kind of thing people could just decide they don't care if you're right they're gonna call you a fuckin racist they're gonna call you a Nazi they're you're just gonna keep saying it until you believe it 100% like this fucking Nazi pull pull up you know you can get him in there you got him on camera there good good see you buddy well this room is separately heated this is its own little air conditioning and thermostats just oh my god savasana that's not good yeah this part was built this was not a room so this room was created like a radio studio like same deal thick walls all insulated in sheds on a nice end to the world bunker yeah buddy it's all concrete cement shit and there's a fan that sucks pot smoke out so if people are getting high you just huh scenic drive yeah well today it is man LA when it rains out it's like nothing else beautiful it's so green like that drive over by when you're going over the 405 when you're coming over the top of the hill holy shit it's stunning during this area sick like I I can't stand West Hollywood area you know there's too many people too many people it's really this is too many people - I did I really would like to do what you're doing what you're doing I think is idea what are you doing oh and did you return to the land of giants to my wildlings we just yell at each other and it's all good did you return to Lilliput as the god of those little people I brought home new information and gold and silk are you where you live again you told me in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York oh I get a boner just thinking about that wow it sounds amazing except for where you are I got a lot of ticks that have it gets too cold in the winter to really have that but it just started coming a little bit because it's like negative 40 where I live in the winter so Jesus Christ yeah no my 44 real negative 44 like a while that's why I got the sauna cuz I just fire up and then go outside nude and roll around it's just crazy negative 40 yeah I don't think I've felt that before it's do it it's so remarkable where it's just you go outside you think if i didn't have clothing i have ten minutes to live yeah it's just this wild feeling well you know i do that crowd therapy shit which is a lot colder but it seems fake like the Dino was million a guy in YouTube that Italian Oh Luca bocce yeah he's friends with Zac Efron oh ye signs and everybody that guy is hilarious he's a DJ yeah there's everything he's the heir to a vitamin fortune or something so what he is or mom is his grandfather former company Gerry centrum fortune that guy is living a fun life you know he's like an Italian version of Dan Bilzerian in a lot of ways Yeah right old buff rich guy thing yeah but he's like bilzerian's in his 30s like this yeah this is only his thirties heart attack in shape he did but it was from doing a lot of coke and doing he did a lot of shit he told the store he was up for like two days yeah dancing thousand Gianluca bocce hilarious I think that's super doing weird stuff with his pants they're very feminine like yeah you know I glue those shorts he's Italian yeah but be honest if a dude that was wearing shorts like that came up to you start talking to in a men's room you'd go hey buddy let me get past you and get through that door oh we're gonna have a problem no those shorts those short serve more of an obvious like it's it yeah I don't want to be too judgmental but that's more than like an erection in a sauna yes the tattoos tattoos everywhere everywhere it's his whole body and he's just had another one he had himself yes on his back he's got a new one called the shut-the-fuck-up tattoo it's him going like shush on his back I guess if I was out of guess if I wanted to decipher that people were talking shit behind its back right this way he's always facing them going shush oh yeah I like people get tattoos too uh you know like it's a power like you get eyes on the back of your head in prison look at this that's it look at all that writing it looks like he's got a little tiny writing all over his body he's a weird guy it doesn't look like the stop talking behind my back shush it looks like I just fucked your mom don't tell anybody it's kind of passive-aggressive dad fought that small logo who's gonna take the time to read his back great buddy got a stop from coming so I read he does have a wonderful bug on his back he does a lot of body weight exercise well he freezes himself that's why I brought it up because I saw him on a video freezing himself well time you want to do it after the show it jacks up your norepinephrine epinephrine norepinephrine levels it produces something called cold shock proteins that are radical inflammation fighters it's fantastic for people that have like arthritis aches and pains there's a lot of older folk that go to the place that I go to that go all the time and they said it's just changed their life like people with like hip issues really yeah because your body goes into this thing and if you do doubles I'd like to do a double means I go in for three minutes I warm up for about 10 minutes and I go in for another 3 minutes how much is it to do it a lot it's a good question I'll find out I don't know it's not cheap yeah because I only saw this fucking Jillian yeah it's good in my mountain man it's the whole thing all the time what it is is your body has to feel like it's gonna die when your body feels like it's gonna die it freaks out and produces these anti-inflammation properties it's basically yeah right yeah yeah it took me on Twitter the same thing with the sauna you know Barry Crimmins just died yeah we got he wanted to meet anyone on tour okay like that yeah guys save my life I was like in a bad way when that guy called it but anyway we got in a car at this guy driving on black ice in Pennsylvania we he tries to pass a tractor-trailer you know some people don't want to be behind trailers yeah so he goes to pass it and we didn't it's like 60 which is the it's under the speed limit but it's black ice you know so we're going nexus it look it felt like a jet engine sucking the car like it was just wobbling and so I'm in the passenger seat Barry was behind the driver and we just get sucked into under the trailer through the trailers yes oh my head I mean I Johnny got my head cut off and I had time to say what the fuck three times I didn't duck fuck what the fuck and then I was like I guess I'm dead I just remember thinking that I then swerved and then the back end like Myatt start going away from the trailer and the back end got caught instead where no one was sitting that got pulled in okay the windows blew in and then drugged us a little bit and spit us out and we spun and landed in the median - that's insane it was and uh the driver was weeping oh my god me and Barry were like I swear got like high like I have never felt I could do that once a year vacation to me I swear I liked it but I had to be I was like sure I'm I guess my brain thing I'm gonna die but yeah sure my body thought it was so but it felt fucking amazing dude I never felt anything like that like the being sure you gonna die and they just don't know that happens the vets sometimes when they come back they don't want to admit it but they got addicted to war Locker they can hurt like oh that's 100% legit they also there's a good Sebastian Junger book about that I read that based on your pot tribe yeah and these people that's like the closest they ever feel to each other is when they're in the middle of a war zone it's like me I'm Twitter man we were talking about his Twitter outbursts and more representation of who he is as a person wait so I don't see what did you set although what could nothing he just blocked him he blocked him on Twitter so he decided are you sure he blocked you definitely blocked him yeah so I just said something that he had wipe on his ass that's good question I mean it's not worth it he was never a fat guy no that's what nature funny it is crazy like if it was like a because he sees it really handsome man so it's like that is so funny to me till like wait so he did do that no no we just made oh yeah because I seems like a very extreme uh it's just a funny insult how many comics if you had to guess if I'd live on their ass just over I would if I had like a friend that was like hey dude I I do I bow like you do I just do some skill and you have to wear like this crazy compression clothes afterwards dude it's not joke that I probably want to do is fucking surgery oh yeah right there they're they're numbing your shit up and they're going in with a goddamn pipe that's got a vacuum attached to it and they're roughing you up and sucking Chung's you don't change your habits either it works but you listen you're gonna get fat again like you it'll make you look good for a little bit but if you don't change how you eat your you you're in your static state right now where you're at you're getting fatter most people most people if they're overweight they're getting more overweight they're not steady at you know whatever the fuck it is 50 pounds over there yeah they could keep going because it's the same pattern of behavior so if you get yourself sucked down it I know people have done this got yourself sucked down with the vacuum down to a good legitimate sighs they just balloon back up and a lot of times there's a lot of unevenness people get fat in weird places because they took out right around the Weiner I feel you got a quarter-inch in there there's new fat but it's also I think they're saying bass fat out you your butt can get lumpy smooth yeah like at least if you got a natural layer of fat it's like a smooth it feels right leave exercise doesn't work I've seen people like no you understand I can't develop pectoral muscles I had sugar nonsense it's not some guys like I can't do it it's not true there's always talk shows these guys at PEC implants yeah I know do have one of those I know dude with implants huh and how did it end up for him not so good man yeah not so good that sounds real bad he wound up killing himself because of something else like here it is oh Jesus Christ Yeah right look at what in the holy fuck yeah I'd be scared what's under the fat my ass I got I don't know what's under there this step limits your gym it's blood loss and maximizes post-op comfort and what they're doing is going in on this person's stomach and sucking tubes of it out here's the thing this guy's not even that fat yeah a little bit oh this guy or gal I don't know we're only looking at it so you say Jess Nick was already hot he just was getting a little bit just a handsome guy it's like so irreverent I think that's really funny how it works look at the little fucking edges on the thing oh that's this is disgusting this thing look how it like you see like when he was going back at up a little Jamie those little things those holes they're like little knives man like a little bit this is violent good little knives in the end cat's dick so he's just scooping it out of there is this a woman or a man I don't know it's someone who's not that fat if whoever the fuck this is if they just got on a carb free diet for like a couple weeks it's not even this is like a not that long of weight to lose I know a lady who didn't need it and got done did she literally didn't need I don't know I don't know her that well but I remember her friends saying how much extreme discomfort she was in because she had to wear essentially electus these tights usually super tight compression pants everywhere to keep all your ass fat together is it amazing having my ass fat loosened like well I had a hair transplant those are the dumbest thing I've ever done he did have his giant scar in the back of my head it looks like a smile I wonder if that's okay Sam meet Mike Joe you got like a scar from it yeah my joke was that it's like taking people from a town where everybody's healthy and moving him into a town where everybody's dying the only ones that were left to like the new recruits like the hair that was supposed to be up there like going out so where do you get it from I take it from the back your head they take a strip now the way they do it and a lot of places they do it differently do one individual follicle at a time yeah I just was scared that I was going ball that was like what can you do and they tell you they can fix it they're like oh great I'll just get it fixed but it doesn't really fix it now well how come cuz what's his name Joel McHale sue cuz I remember him from those Burger King commercials we had less hair than I do hmm and now he's got Dragon Ball Z hair wow it's a little thick it's almost like more thick than they start with something you have a killer trans player or is that just a great head of hair man he could you didn't do you remember the Burger King commercial right I do I do not nobody does it was when the office was getting popular and not therefore the American one and Burger King had these commercials that were kind of like the office and he was like the wise a picture why have thicker hair I just works better every bald guys fucking has more hair I remember people with thick hair follicles can get away with it like my hair would have looked way better but I have thin hair the hairs themselves are thin so if someone has thick hair they could they could have some pretty dramatic result if it's the right kind of thinning what is you do it dirty no not even yeah but what do you talk dirty when you do yeah I think I was 28 I was I just started acting on TV no so panicking because my hair was yeah seriously falling out and I was like this shit is going quick you know and and I was like what where's it gonna go and just get thicker pubes well I was like I knew that part of the reason why was making money was the way I looked I mean I I was doing stand-up and I was acting in these shows but I wasn't an ugly dude and it helped you know like it was getting certain kind of role boyfriend roles it's like something that a chick has to go through yeah you could be panic because you like well this is how I'm making money and I never made any money before Wow I went from being completely broke and being a super struggling comic like if I got lucky that's making 300 a week 350 a week was a big bad for a week if you're a 25 year old guy what I was trying to make it as a comic right then I went from that to making fucking shit piles of money you're like how do I not know back I'm not getting rid of this oh yeah I figure out a way it's rolling but if I just shaved my image didn't know freedom freedom I get I think even if I it grew like a thick head of hair I guarantee you I'd still shave my head I don't want to go to a barber I had a really nice lady used to cut my hair too I loved her she Funch fun conversations but I have to go to her fucking place I just have to wake up every four days like a wire remind me of dude could you talk about that I eat that chilling proceeded but I was running some j.b smoove you said this like dinner show where it'd be like a couple athletes and like a couple comics oh yeah and I because I'm one of the fall sports but these guys originally is a hockey player in some football plant much minority and they're talking about all these treatments they would get you know and most of them sort out his beauty treatments for rich fucking Hollywood women real and then they trickle down to athletes Wow I swear to God they were talking about cryo that way like it was for fucking hot chicks because they're caught like a hot chicks the kind of athlete turn or like blew her face out on steroids for arthritis no way she didn't want to beat you want people to know about some illness cuz don't you get less work so she just was like took all the jokes about how she looked like a man she just took all the jokes to work and then finally came out we took God why good for you man if he got work out it because you know people are terrified uh well yeah I mean being going from being an insanely hot woman gross that is a change of everything that's a change of character losing all his money you find out who really liked you the whole time you know yeah change is how you interface with the world like a beautiful woman interfaces with the world like the most popular celebrity possible yeah a head of a woman is like Tom Cruise everywhere she goes it's like Michael Kosta is a bit about that it's almost the same amount of danger two of you got a watch who's like coming up on you like how famous person way worse though yeah for girls you don't think we were crazy listen men are dangerous and that's why we have a system called the patriarchy to agree system to protect women from the dangers of men called patriarchy and we threw it we threw it away cuz ecologists I think it's important talk about patriarchy because I feel that young twenty-year-old women need their own Illuminati to talk about you know disguise going on it's yeah it's like it's Illuminati for girls for the set definition there isn't one is that especially the same with races there is one in the dictionary but that's not the except of one ask just any online fellas what does it mean there's no well you can be you can be like it's its it means you're my ex-boyfriend named Gary click of Mean Girls is that patriarchy or in a position of power right that's the patriarchy but men have been in the workplace for hundreds of years more than women is there's a real problem the idea that collison it should be caught up where somebody goes when people wonder where all the female comedians are like know that dude they're people talking about it when Louie got shellacked by that fucked up article what people were saying that shit about you know what how come there's an equal number of female comedians to males well cuz women are treated better in our society yeah female comedians you know women are being abused way more than ever because you don't getting this job from a happy this job isn't about support it's you get laughs cuz you fucked up so I hope there's not a lot of women in it I mean they're being like raped more there's that but it is also it's just from a female perspective of a chick's funny it's harder because something happened to her they can't but they can't talk about certain things like no no man wants to see a woman on stage telling politics stories are politic jokes it's fun you know you say that but this show maybe you maybe you but most people in the audience I won't rule out anything if I'll take I won't say any premises hacky just punchline so if your premises airline fucking peanuts such fine tell me what your punchline is maybe a punchline justifies it right I don't I won't rule out any tremie premises are hacky but people probably don't want to hear it but you know it's like look if you can get people to listen to some shit that they basically don't want to hear like oh great like this room I use do the black rooms I started I'm totally an agree with you I'm totally in agreement with you we're not talking about drinking Capeman coffee we're not talking I feel wired as 70 milligrams how many my gut well I just started sipping wine but I'm like I'm just a second one that's empty did you black out and suck the hell and just I just drank one what the fuck is talking about me I'm talking about when a woman goes on stage and does stand-up most people that are gonna be in the audience there's men that are just not gonna want to hear you talk about politics there's men that are not gonna want to hear to talk about sex it's harder for a woman I think it's a word it's a harder position be a stand-up comic for a woman is just harder so I think if it's harder you're naturally gonna see less people doing it and then there's naturally less people inclined to do it but it's just like female MMA most women are not gonna do it but guess what a lot of women do it if you're the type that does it you fucking do it but there's no fucking what about the patriarchy in MMA why are threw an equal number of women than men you don't say that right fans I noticed that remember who delete that's it I think it's cuz it's an untenable argument what that you can't say there should be an equal amount of women fighting as men because it's not nothing that's what I didn't punch in the face area that's one area where we agree right it's one area we get to ago yeah well men are they do this better right this is they do it more they're doing it constantly and there's some elite female athletes in MMA don't get me wrong rival the elite athletes of men but they used to SMED they had the operation way more men fucking way more and I hope right but this is what my point is the same as stand up yeah kiss the end of another getting punched in the face sport to me like is super fucking difficult you take an emotional be some people don't want to do it it's not a judgment call it's not like you're better or you're worse it's like see I think it makes you because the people that left that I start I don't know if you think of when you started people you thought that were funny that left right and people that stage I can't believe you're still here it's clearly a calling it nada yeah you gotta beat it some people just decide to they've had enough they're like they don't want to get off this fucking ride you know there's a lot of guys that were like big time touring headliners they get to a point like this usually go to Vegas or something yeah yeah they do that or they just fucking get some sort of a writing job some writing jobs you know they start doing tree work like me I like the writers guild but listen man anybody who thinks there should be an equal number of men or women in any job and that if there's no clear evidence that this is a neutral occupation that this is an occupation that doesn't favor any gender like there's got to be jobs where it's equally represented men and women outside of that your job is what you choose to do with your life run boys grow up playing with fucking trucks and superheroes and girls grow up playing with dolls and they obviously are more inclined in this direction and men are more inclined in that direction that we expect them to meet at any interest and that we that we would force it and force it for women it makes them think that they should do jobs that they might not enjoy and then they get really depressed right yeah or they think did they need to prove themselves by doing a man's job exactly instead of just doing what they actually enjoyed doing well I mean you know it's funny I was a camera my mom wanted to work as she got a job and she was mad cuz she wanted to stop working cause it's yeah but uh I mean it just depends on the level of need right like what if there's like a war or a bad economy so I'm guess what I'm gonna go get job that's a different thing right it's different during the war like everybody was sort of bonded together because you know they had shit constantly well there seems to be a much more of a uh I you know some time my girlfriend like uh my girlfriend colicky like I realized this is even ties in with this jazz night thing I realize like or she realized I like half the bad things that happened to her in the last four years were social media related or maybe all that I'm thinking about it like I think all bullshit like stress on my life that I had and you it's fucking it is real though like I've had a couple theaters can't ruin my life dude it's strangers like set out I'm gonna ruin your life like where I was like wow you got a lot of good it cost money now it's crazy that's why we don't you get theaters canceled for well I booked two art schools I just paid them to rent it like the area and I sold it out myself and then they would just cancel saying that I do hate speech or something what I'm saying oh there's one merit in Chicago and then Brooklyn school music just can't stop me and I had to switch it that day Chicago and Brooklyn though are like hotbeds little Chicago is filled with social and that's social Johnny's like I'm a piano player GW social jihadists no dude and I thought that was like my safe spot I'm like I'm a piano player Chicago is so full of like dude everywhere is nothing from the neverending story it's just like everywhere now well you know dude if you go to these underserved markets like Detroit's right there there's people who wanna I want to see in Detroit you gotta be fucking amazing Haman track is that the fucking Aereo's and no I did this place small some rock dude it was tremendous yeah I had a great time in Detroit I did that Fillmore I did two shows they're often amazing sports in there like seven years ago a sick fucking fun man they appreciate you well it's easy to forget I happy I uh you know this horseshit because it's this cult that these people are in that's in Hollywood in New York and yeah just there it's not view is the country people aren't you know this is thing that you get fooled with social medias you think this is like reality no but it is everywhere but they don't like it that's the difference like Hollywood can have people being like oh no this is great but it is in other colleges and like of college kids right me that they have to sign a white privilege contract I've seen them at least thing it means they acknowledge their white privilege which is basically I don't know something that happens you see or genocide or whatnot but we put you acknowledge your white privilege it means that you have it easier that's me I've never heard of bro it's unreal well they're giving kids in certain schools are giving kids lectures on gender and that how some people are gender fluid meaning that they can switch back and forth from male to female at any time like at what time do we go okay maybe that's true but what's the odds that that's nonsense the 100% overwhelming I mean it might be someone with some sort of a psychological disorder where they do bounce back and forth between being a man and woman but at what point in time could we recognize there's a psychological disorder and this is just on a natural state of being like having red hair by the way also I don't give a shit like I know it's waiting to be you know they go like well white is considered default like well that's because it's a majority white population like default doesn't mean I don't think what people are fine is by default what do you mean it doesn't make any sense that they like when people go flesh colored band-aids or white and which I don't even know if that's still true Brown Band Aids but it's it's literally a Matt a matter of like populate like why are you fighting to be default or like the boring like I became a comedian to be marginal like on the margins I didn't want to be in the main did my hydration I can't go on a fucking roller coaster well the answer the band-aid things very easy the time that band-aids were invented there was a far greater population of white people yeah no shit there's more now it's like what they say within 30 years why people are gonna be the minority looking forward to it yeah which is my kid white is your kid is definitely not white well your and your kids half Mexican yes we can I smoked this in here by the way yeah sure I'd rather you not marijuana yeah what do you got going on there some little glass pipe yeah it's a chill it's a chill Oh chill them that's what these like a Phish concert pipe was that thing they do with hash just a one-hitter yeah we got joints here if you want to spark a joint I do want to sorry I think it's cuz its students yet that all this shit's happening because of what student debt no one's gonna get a job from underwater doing that vagina ballet the economy tanked all the sudden there's money to be made and there's 60 grand in debt for underwater vijaya ballet and then after like justify it somehow it's first of all if you are an expert underwater vagina ballet that's a marketable skill team yeah yeah you should not be broke at all I'm doing for jan availa the the social media if you notice the news media started taking cues from like gossip shit okay so like TMZ is almost a quaint old respectable thing now did the onion is the most very source a werewolf right did that I I'm gonna smoke out this waiting for you to get to that's okay but you know drinking crack whatever Gawker and fucking BuzzFeed basically the print media starts going out of business all of a sudden gossipy bullshit and all the social jihad money it makes a lot of money everything's got to be outraged or uplifting click I said yeah and right my friend networks enough or no more but my friend Erin no you knew her from when you came on race Wars on it's serious she was yeah I remember yeah she should be managed to get her a Jezebel okay she would get sick of these fuckin generation she spawned with her fuck it yeah just a sell shit to that's the thing it isn't like a big plan it's just like to sell Geico ads it's the there's now these people whatever these problems are their claim they don't want them solved they clearly want to have the conflict going on forever because they make a living on it there's people that just make they're all on patreon they're busy clergy their clergy this jihadi shit and and they're always on patreon with a handout you'll help me go to schools and tell kids about fucking you know hit the werewolf generally for whatever I know they got to like make like make problems where there aren't any problems but I think it's because of our instinct to run away from a lion and stronger than towards a banana let me go for an alternative point of view okay think about how often you get into bullshit arguments online and you're a successful comedian who's married with children now think of yourself as being 20 years old at college talking shit writing a blog whatever decided you're going to take down all these monsters it's it's a natural inclination to do and it's also natural to pick a fuckin side it's natural to decide you see people aggressive in one direction I'm gonna be on the other side and say fuck those people okay I'm just smoking the manliest pipe in the world don't mind me how dope is that that's the pipe design on Instagram like talking about fucking society and shit smoking a werewolf you can't fault that any of these loans it's a trillion dollar debt well that's a giant issue those kids getting fucked because it's a hustle they tell you how to do it and in some jobs you do have to do it but you should probably think about what the fuck you want to do with your life ultimately before you do it I don't think it's a bad idea to travel overseas to experience some things get take some jobs and then get some life experiences that you know what I'm leaning towards being of this or I'm what interests me is that take the time to find out what gender you are 50 grand and a history education that I could have gotten from Dan Carlin for nothing sick he's a bad motherfucker that Danielli Bliley I don't know about he's a history podcast guy do not reading books by white males for the next month just say enough just read more books of people of color you can read what books by white people look the way I suggest I suggest a 5 to 1 ratio people of color makes no sense Nigerian a Filipino and like a sri lankan have in common there was something that's not join ye derson tweeted real recently he was a HuffPost editor that was talking about her ultimate goal of attributions being white or less contributions being white more contributions by people of color and women and she had like this whole breakdown in numbers like the numbers that they've achieved of like how they're still working on it of getting rid of the white voice white guy that he's never done do so much they cuz I don't know any black people anyway whoever like all the the gibberish that you hear dude I can't think of a single black person in my life that has ever demanded I say any of it or agree were this good shit that they're claiming I'm 40 though this is like people like I guess my age and not you know it's generational dude because yeah you were in the 20s if you were hanging out with 20 year old kids you'd be experiencing this well now they went full circle doesn't matter though like a race like I can't even believe it's a point where people with a straight face push segregation under the guise of anti you know I mean like what safe space this is a colored space I'm like you know we had that in the 50s and shit that's the Soviet Union they do everything the opposite it's doublespeak solid tolerance is authoritarianism well yeah but it's all the opposite it's double speak where if you say tolerance that means authoritarianism no it's what is is enforced tolerance yeah it becomes like a mandatory behavior pattern that you're supposed to like hate speech is free speech who decides hey once you got this you know stupid cult I got I have an obsession like people have you heard me on your show before they don't know about there's a Java witness which I never thought I never thought it was a cult honestly I never called them a cult and I never really had an anger towards it but when I think about it you know they didn't help my foot it didn't help my fucking family it only hurt that's the thing with these religions they never help and that's what this should all see some some religions I think can help certain people I don't believe they don't especially Martin has helped learn nicest people on the planet like what I'm saying is the parts that helped were parts I didn't need the religion for you didn't but you haven't accelerated mind giannis I saw people have their life guy who's a meth head this is my church and you're like bad teeth and shit and then his whole family came in all sudden II had new teeth and they were like a happy and sorry okay what I wanted to hear that stories that's what I'm talking to me that happened like I don't think I'm an atheist at all like I I have no when you were under that truck so when you're in that accident you contemplate like oh my god I might be going to heaven or I might be going to hell someday I didn't even have time for that until we were just like this is the end well I'll tell you why I felt good was if was so out of my control what was happening I mean not one part because usually I think I'm gonna die cuz I fucking did something right like it was so out of my hands that it was comforting like I I was like oh there's nothing it's just you your time when it's your time man yeah that's right yeah I'm like oh that's right it's Anne versus me I'm like I shouldn't have tweeted that is they're stabbing I think we'll people this is this is the creep because the jobs witnesses on that guy with the teeth he had a way to come back in yeah or my ex-girlfriend got caught shoplifting because all white girls shoplift I don't if you do because no one would ever believe it was them past Winona Ryder was the queen yes shoplifting white girls cuz who would think she would do that I would ask like what they all do it so they and they all i've almost all white girls unless her i mean my church i'm sure there was sincere people to java now fucking thing to do with the shoplift birth control birth a gala used to date had a real issue yeah she was a real addicted shoplifter she got arrested hundreds of dollars of clothes go and change in just different things put things on under clothes and walk out with them and well my ex got caught and she had to go and not even know like I don't even know why she didn't tell me she was like I don't want to talk I'm like I don't care but she got caught and had to do community service ooh I think I'm like harlot and she was afraid to do it but she said like people were walking up and like thanking her for like you know picking up trash with an orange vest those people just skip out on it once you do the service they wipe it from your record basically off it's like you got caught you're offered a way back where you don't have it on your record some more it's that's the thing that could work for somebody that's not gonna be like so religion has if I want to go back and make Javas witness I could go listen I was wrong i I miss being part of the truth blah blah blah and I can get back in these people have created a religion where they catch you in some minor mistake and then throw you to your banished to Kramer island or whatever and they're fucking proud of it and the only way you can move ahead is to catch someone else so it's like worse than religion but the same thing love or forgiveness of any kind it's this empty but and the only thing that matters is you're part of the right identity I mean it's basically just a racism as religions but it's what they use shame and that's why if you're the only way out of it is to not care cuz shame is the only way to control people know your big ways you could control the other way no no for this for the social justice warrior religion like the way to do it is important what you're saying is that that is the it follows the same sort of patterns that these bitches like Jesus I'd be happier know yeah gluten-free is Jesus Christ the fucking but you know what I'm saying me it's like what you experience as a Jehovah Witness is the same thing like right they like we were talking before you got here about them trying to cancel Jordan Peterson speeches and these people were sending these emails and professors were sending emails calling him a racist and a Nazi and saying he's a fascist and all these different things like and what I'm saying is that when you ramp up the fake reality to the point where you you're saying things you know aren't true Yeah right you think you're thinking to do a purpose like they do it purposely they think they're doing it for the right reason but if they've really art they're not they've really not a fan of Jordan Peterson they would realize how crazy it is to say he's racist how crazy it is to say he's transphobic or anything he's not a Nazi by any stretch of the imagination oh he just doesn't tolerate nonsense that's all it is no they want nonsense of course so they're proving him right by calling him a Nazi you're right like well it's just look this is why I think that'll just burn itself out eventually because I don't know man you can't keep throwing they throw people they throw other people away you had Jamie kill Steen on yes recently I I never look they stick around like The Hunchback in 300 you know they're like can I get back in that guy from my started comedy okay yeah and Jamie was always like I think I talked like a wild guitar but it was like you know he was always a dude that felt small that it was I always got the impression his girlfriend made up most of most of most of him when I knew him that he met this girl he was married to and she put all that shit she turned him into who he was because he's just like a low self-esteem dude from you know and I mean I can relate to that I could relate to a lie that shit of where someone's like alright so he feels bad and they want to be part of a group right but I just I'm just fascinated like how do you for yourself like how do you like make old and and he's telling me all this personal experience it some shit I won't share with like he can but it sounded like being in a fucking religion and like when it went like thirty tests there's literally like purity test yeah and then have you heard outside ideas you better not a listener Peterson dude it sounded so much like we were supposed to guard our hearts and like not even read certain things you know like and and if we had doubts not say them because you might stumble your they're out of the faith well and that's the worst thing there is like okay just put your questions aside because god forbid you say something puts doubt and Owen and then he falls out of the truth it's a clever little tactic the reason they got a crackdown on bullshit like comedy or whatever the fuck are your Facebook or give if you give a shit about something somebody tweet it I mean you must be fucking stupid but that's all of them and well it hurts cognitive dissonance hurts where it's like Donald Trump is Hitler now give him all your guns man like that hurts your brain and so when someone shows smoking pot so are these the same people have been all year have been trying to convince everyone that Donald Trump's being run by the Russians and he's Adolf Hitler and then the government should have all your guns in Pro free market but now you so both of us did I smoked myself stupid Donald Trump is to me he's the guy he's the perfect first of all the perfect president of America I this is there's never been and I mean for whatever party are in he is your avatar man is he is the fucking like everybody that can't thinks they can do a job that they can't do but they saw something on TV like I could probably do that better like it's high time we didn't have an expert just a guy like me like that's he's the candidate of the volunteer firemen of the gender studies professor of the fucking the vine star that became a comedian yeah like all these people that like think they could just walk into some fucking he is that well that's our DNA it says he'll being like the earth is flat give me a boat is there gold and please yeah but across the oars you like my truth and you all that shit like dude some Lewis and Clark like those the original fucking to man comedy duo we wait like the people that Lewis and Clark that the Explorers no show y'all the blood relative of that guy how'd you know that did you go to one of those genealogy reports no my my dad told me he just now oh wow that's crazy who told him why my Warren Pocahontas things I took the genealogy test gay dad dad how crazy is that Elizabeth Warren lady she's insane fucking she won't take an ancestry test she was a long time ago the name was fuck is it Sean let me ask you this Oh what yeah but why were on this Elizabeth Warren thing do you care about what about whether or not she's really Native American like yeah she took a job like she robbed these good job she's Harvard she got like one of those she got a scholarship yeah for being Native American she got a scholarship to how much Native American Shaun King 132nd yeah but you ever seen some and I didn't know this that should have blood-quantum Native Americans didn't have you could be fuckin if I'm like let's say I'm a chief and I just adopt yo rogue and I go Joe rogue is my son he is now a hundred percent part of my thing no matter what his blood they didn't have to get hung up on that came about to divvy up benefits you know after we were like the real evil shit we did the natives was in modern times back then I don't I mean that's what everybody did back then I don't give a fuck but in modern times you're absolutely right there but in modern times they did some very evil showed them yeah the blood-quantum that was what they're kind of cool about the most most Native Nations is they didn't get hung up on your amount of blood right you when you're in the family so you could be one like Johnny Depp when he said he got brought in the tribe so we could play Tonto mm-hmm that's a legit thing in traditionally a Native America they were much cooler about racial shit like like Europeans kind of brought that nonsense over more right you know but uh kidnap people and people would stay with them survive the Sebastian Junger book detailed how many people would leave Western society and join the Native American I didn't know how much it was like separate country see if they teach American history that's what they just start at the very first whatever countries were here and then just move up through America because it's thousands of years shit count them dude it's really interesting shit like I didn't know how populated it wasn't like do they were considered fauna in Canada until the 60s or it might've been Australia but they were considered like fauna like well help might be insane Australia yeah that's Australia oh the Aborigines they have a terrible story they were in the 1950s kidnapped the aborigine babies and made him be raised by white people they took the babies from Aborigine families it's like where'd you get that baby it's a gun oh they did it like a concerted effort they were gonna try they decide my buddy Adam Greentree lives over there and in Australia yeah he's born and raised and he works in mining companies so he deals with all these different Aborigines and they all have different languages they call they're called a mob like instead of a clan or a town really they call themselves a mob really yeah and they have they might have a totally different name for things as a guy that lives five miles away right yeah like five miles away there's a bunch of totally different names and those people stick to themselves these people stick to themselves so there's like bands of them hundreds of them all over the place and these all these different languages are all losing all of them they're gonna lose all these languages if these people get assimilated because they're not really written down in a lot of cases right yeah they did you see that lady it was on some fucking discovery maybe you know one of them fucking things but the oldest human language I think is kaesong people they got wiped out by the Zulus back in the day like Shaka Zulu conquer them but the kaesong their language is like the oldest thing they can find say that ka e song s Ong I think whoa what the but so this old this old-ass lady who knew something about like the word and it's like well we think she's like they come from animal noises like the lion goes brah and then the words they got came from mimicking it was it was interesting as fuck but it's so it's such grateful of civilization shit but the kaesong i think i think it's like their languages they're the oldest like proto well you know monkeys have a language that's different different sounds for different things like watch out there's a lion is a different noise than watch out there's an eagle and these these biologists or what would they be will they be if they're studying monkeys primatologist I guess these primatologist set up these speakers and played the sound of watch out it's an eagle and all the monkeys fucking doctor and went running down the tree and they played watch out there's a line and they're all looking down to live a language language they have a language and they play tricks on each other like one guy will say hey watch out there's a lion and they all run up the tree and he gets the food stinky I told the teller I was coming on he goes oh you guys get all pothead excited about the same stop fuck ways you can't shame me into getting not geeked out about like super volcanoes and shit I'm gonna freak out about it I don't care it's work it exciting it's fun super volcano I would love to oh we were talked about one before you got here that killed most of the people seventy thousand years ago we were talking about how seventy thousand years ago there was only a hundred thousand people oh yeah that is this a Rick still a thing that said that like let me trace of genes that comes from like a population about 600 people yeah yeah yeah I mean there was probably at many times during our history we would rebeled dwindled down to a very small number - yeah it's crazy it was really cold - oh fuck man I mean half of North America under more than a mile of ice we made it through we can make it through Twitter guys we can't make it to thread it but you you gotta like leave Anthony Jeselnik alone oh this is how much weed has of course where's the bomb do you know how many people in the last like two weeks and I mean having conversations about dire shit in their lives or like so-and-so unfollowed me on Instagram and it was like weighing on them right so and follow me how come you don't follow me on something I'm like dude the greatest thing that media should store man cuz I feel like I did everything you can do on social media but I haven't that happen I get I got to the limits of social good for myself I've been banned I'm so glad I'm so glad I mean I put shit to promote on it but I was telling you that like I'm so glad not to be talking to people with fucking social media the idea that I would give a shit and that's like adults man like grown adults the unfollowed me on Instagram like just thinking gives a shit of jazz Nick block George I mean I just definitely not I was too aggressive but it's not even that but there's no contest there's no con so it doesn't matter there's no way to take it right because it's not being said you could say it's to somebody and they go I like to get what he's saying and let's say you even he got the contacts you're trying to be funny someone else is gonna make it something it's not that's what they did it's such an I don't even it didn't even occur to me dude how much like quicksand like like people that shouldn't be allowed to make fuckin eye contact with me that I'm having discourses with and shit our lives like I mean just because you're getting your head the way pi2 diet people like threatening to create whatever they shit you hear some fucking a college speaker complain about ten times over I had coming at me from from I'm gonna rape and murder your niece let's explained for most people that don't know I did a terrible thing where I said hey if you get raped maybe go to the cops on the way to posting it on Facebook that UCB has determined guilt in a rape case suggested hit the brakes hit the brakes no one knows what the fuck you're talking about so let's just explain the story to this cos is so strong and a quarter and it is fucking wrong it's crank I'm trying to counteract it with indica I just I want people to understand the story there was a guy that it was accused of rape and you had decided like they shouldn't be tried in the court of public opinion on social media right and what you said is why and that's my friend now somebody now I'm not even defending him I'm defending any but like how is this fucking cool that this is going to be tried on fucking Facebook someone's sending around a message that so-and-so has been found you see be denoted Clown College has done an internal investigation internment so-and-so is guilty of rape so if you have any information come in that's on Facebook now did they really say it that way it was first in an online woman group then it got leaked onto regular first is it but is a representative of the UCB that said that they used to be didn't it was some fucking girl on her own that's a big difference right she's an umbrella of UCB did she do it under the UCB Twitter page or Facebook page rather I have no ideas from Twitter or something well whatever it is I mean she could ascend from Lecce I saw it on Mike J's page it was even a fact if you're saying the UCB did it and they didn't it's that's no no they did not they did but you said okay she said that she said but you said the UCB determined right that it was right I saw a post that said that right and this is but she said it the UCB didn't say no it's not their official word at all right okay so it's just a person well it's very clear Brad okay they never claimed that right it was a person who I think was like a rape counselor or something or somebody to deal with like there's like a rape a job so something happened but job performers something happened between performers and this one guy was being accused and he said he just real simple without knowing who's guilty well it's you said he shouldn't be tried some occult here's a guy that opened for me somewhere was friends and I go hey can he call you now first question why call me what am i a noted rape investigator on Facebook I think just because I'm somebody yelled this is me not being aware of what's building up I just yell out on Facebook about stuff and I had a following so it's almost like oh like can you talk to you and then throw your weight behind you know I think it was like but I'm you know I didn't look at his shit at Facebook like that like it was like not I don't understand like how people were looking at my facebook it's ridiculous but anyway I talked to the guy on the phone and he told me something I think was a lie I mean you know obviously I can't say we're together but looking back I think what he told me is a lie that people were accusing him because he didn't book them on a show which just doesn't really make a lot of sense with that quick to pull the trigger on a rape back to how evil they would have to be book me you fucking crazy that accusation I believe they would be involved in comedy but that many at once together it's like let me at 8 minutes I'll make it 10 or else we got a rape on our hands well that's so quick it was it just is guilty this is worse because what you've done is handed some of you lost here you can't defame someone like that and it's like written like you just get sued for that and also this is you have to be convicted before you're allowed to say that like legally but to me it's not I mean it's like they're taking the campus thing of like where we're gonna have a college campus guy say kick you out of school for that rape you committed over each other I'm sorry okay but that's the punishment that's not a punishment for rape is you get kicked out of school this is gender studies bullshit trickling down into real life okay so the colleges I assume what let that let that go on because they don't want to be known as a school where your daughter can get raped so they let these little groups pretend to have power and do a little tribunal and then everybody's happy but meanwhile what a rapist got expelled that's their punishment your great job it sounds like the Catholic Church transferring people it doesn't sound any different so this is someone too so to me that was just like a garbage ass if this guy's dangerous go to the fucking cops right so so then I'm getting all this people come to me about like don't you dare tell a victim to go I don't know you're a victim yet though that's the thing like when a victim says they're a victim if you don't believe them you're calling them a liar we have to make sure you are a victim before we say one way or the other so we're getting ahead of ourselves but but this is just basic due process shit I guess the argument is because historically this is like the argument coming against me from fencing historically women are not believed which by the way by who other women because what my experience is is any woman close to me that says she got raped I probably believe her and every man I know in fact I know women they have dudes into fights over shit like that especially if you're in like white-trash town where I grew up around like women are the ones that don't believe women men are the only people stupid enough to believe women most of the time okay so that's already a bullshit thing that women aren't believed with there's lynching rosewood remember that shit that was cuz a woman a white woman was just believed and then there's a bunch of lynchings of black people well I think there's got to be instances we should be very measured about this cuz it's gotta be instances in which women weren't believed of course it has nothing to do the idea is that you can't believe them every time well the larger point is you have to look at it as an individual case every case is individual and you look at it on it because that's right it doesn't matter let's say no woman in history has ever lied about rape once well you still have to have new problems in case it happens once I'm not getting sacrificed to this state for the good of the fucking you don't mean if it that shit arrives and they need happen you think it happens when you have something to lose like you're famous custody case a rape case yes of this going uncritically believed yeah when by the way was someone not believed in the media and and it turned out I see a lot of people can't believe who lied none of it matters though because like I said that has no bearing on my individual anything like any of them we've have clear double standards it's like when we'll just believe you and when will be super scheme no Barry Barry Crimmins like cuz he you know if you haven't seen that documentary anybody listed uh call me Lucky's really great so like cuz cuz that guy's kind of heroic what he did with al they he basically he was raping his for which I I mean that's crazy what that would do to somebody and he I think he told us talking about on stage first there's something and he ended up when when the internet was first becoming a you know nationwide ding he was a child pornography everywhere like pedophiles would by AOL by the hour if you were rich you could just freely trade child pornography so he had to testify before Congress the Senate an AOL had a lawyer there because they didn't want to change their policy which was three strikes and you're out for child pornography that's in do we get they actually with a straight face like we have a firm three strikes and you're out policy it's not crazy that was only like 19 95 or 96 what the best parts the documentary because Barry slake will hit the OB is like the ISIS three strikes I goes yeah listen I love baseball too but uh I love baseball more than anybody play but they they uh the senators and congressmen were tripping over themselves in a manly display of being ignorant of technology or something very like really is like a quotable dude like the shade says but they got well I don't know what all this internet is I just know that pornography is bad like some of them didn't where the fuck they were Robert Byrd is just like with the scourge of pet Nagas fee we're here for the scourge of putting on the fear and then one point in the documents that he was talking about how it was almost like the other warrior against him and it was who had better stage presence that's hilarious yeah where he was just clearly a better speaker like this really expensive lawyer was just like a shitty opener and Barry got to talk yeah you know he went over his time or he would offer his time Barry did after that I saw they talk minds like wow that guy's fuckin man I was like crying from that documentary um well anyway so no I man the shit all that shit came down on me people were going to Barry to get him to like denounce me like I hardly knew him yeah so he called me up and uh you know what we realized a lot of this shit cuz he did real work helping people the rape victims kids were like that man shit okay and and basically he fuckin this shit's turf if you're a feminist or whatever political thing he owes you understand this is turf to them didn't give a shit about an actual victim so like it's you know you'll try to do something good and help someone if you go two ways groups they grab it and they use it as their a little symbol or whatever it's never about an individual person I talked to this woman at core some woman when it the height of things coming down to me for saying go to the cops in on Facebook and always people like no like the system has failed well you I don't know that you didn't go to the system so how do you know also you're a white woman I think it'll it'll but just people to call me to be fair this woman call me who wanted to she won't get touch with me some other creep inserted herself like some bloggers check who initially basically they baited me with these nonsense arguments let's not say I watched on there because they're nobody's talking to you on there like having a chat or there's what I learned there they're baiting you to get you to say something that they can they can say I took down such and so and there's no I'm from this dumb cult so I'm sincerely interested in being a Chatty Cathy it's a little cunt and people are not sincere they they want to make a name for themselves baiting you into doing something get you in trouble and they will fucking fuck with you a shit you can't believe you'd be in trouble for saying such as go to the police and not fucking Facebook if you're raped so so this woman call me in a thick of it I don't know her name still okay cuz she didn't really know anything about me they're telling her I'm a rape apologist which thank you for putting that next to my name online for all time I have now crazies just come pop up around it will explain what happened The Improv the other night oh this was a few months ago so it's a woman I've never met in my life if there aren't you right after it happened I think I texted you I couldn't believe it I I what my manager system text me a picture is some somebody with giant glasses feel like you told me in person I might have but she goes do you know this person I thought it's like someone from Tim and Eric like she's asked me about a cat I don't know where I know now why Tim Eric personality that kind of weird look giant she's she went in the improv and said Kurt Metzger raped me I'm here to confront him I know yeah they said she was visibly not right like it was it like I mean but just someone throwing that around casually you know but that's because she they put they make these little shitty names like that would know what the fuck is that there's no such thing as that okay no one's pro fucking Ricky man if there's someone out there go what's a little rape person out there that's doing that let's go watch same thing if you don't accept every tenant of fucking white girl fat Taliban feminism you love rape that's the fucking org it's like it's like all you know with a girlfriend that you should have dumped three years ago it's a bad relationship except you're not dating why is it so hostile because this is because they're they're going we don't even they're so into this identity shit you know I think yeah I think part of it is social media of course you're not really communicating yeah so like all these attacks and shit or anti-social they're like weird yeah they're not the way people would talk well it's tricking these girls they're thinking they're gonna have their little angry black eye moment but here's the thing you're not like black people you're not like a suppressed marginalized minority feminine I don't know where they're getting that from you are absolutely not an identity of women together and here's how I know they prove it at the women's March when they kick the pro-life women out see black people have to take all all their garbage my people they have to take in their movement cuz they don't though but black people have to they're forced to bargain like a minority I get that women are half the population so in women's March they kick out the pro-life women that's a luxury you have when you not an oppressed minority that's when you have it pretty good no you take a walk we don't know what like what does minority mean like being 47 everyone in 10,000 that's it that story though that's crazy that they can you know that no I did not you see if you find that Jamie I want to see some footage a woman okay yeah like you're not an oppressed minority if you can afford to kick out the pro-life women this is a racist March it's a crazy time - I mean unobjective Lee with no political leanings left or right it's crazy when they're kicking out the people that are saying don't kill the babies I know look at what it is I mean I'm not saying you shouldn't do it but what is it but you are aborting well you know it will eventually be if these are people that fundamentally refuse to acknowledge it's like watching people that you get divorced argue right like the argument I've tried to argue this patient cuz like my mother doesn't hate women she's a Christian lady that thinks it's murder right I think hey maybe I'll kill a baby I don't give a fuck it's not my baby go do what you want no anti the pro-choice is super intense I don't care I don't give a fuck like listen if you're the kind of person that can do it then maybe you should do it you know well I I don't give a shit it's not it's not a fucking uh-uh that's you and your God decide your turn you know so but you know I good versatile so if you have your kid I also don't give a fuck about your kid if I don't know I just don't I don't think bad to happen to you but I'm just saying I'm not like your different amount of caffeine bro so jacked up why is the women's March excluding pro-life women well this is the week now wait are they again oh you should find someone that's a lot what's that thing listen the bottom lines they go and I have talked a million times to people that talk about they go it's either somewhat uh noise emotional the person you talk to and it's a they want to control my body as a woman that's why they're anti-abortion like no they think it's baby murder no they want to control my then you talk to the other people like they want to have any immoral lifestyle and blah like gets broken down into that one sentence a woman's right to choose right like you don't even say to choose what I keep going like they they cut it off because it sounds uncomfortable it's a woman's like a woman's right to choose to abort a baby right and I think it is that's not my right that's right I would decide if I'm fucking having I couldn't care I'm Mike Nam inside yes your decisions I can only put myself in someone shoes if that's what I'd want so that's why I'm forced so right but but Ruby weight is a very excellent compromise by the way it's me yeah late term abortion see the late term abortion is fucking gross and I understand if it's some miserable fucking defect fine but if you look at the numbers and very hard to get accurate abortion numbers because it's so politicized though the late term abortions are not as I would have thought because of deformities it's a lot of times they either didn't know they were pregnant or just hit like it's kind of shitty bro he's like you can see that how long man but like I said if you as a mother could do that that late yeah maybe you shouldn't raise a kid you know but but early on I don't think you're murdering anything like or if you do it early I think you you know it's it is a slippery conversation though and this is what people who are ideologically like attached to that left-wing Dogma they're not willing to have this conversation so if you have these pro-life women they don't want to have a dialogue your mind is completely made up well they better listen here's my other thing is just be consistent if you're pro-life because the Catholic Church is at least consisting pro-life they're anti-death-penalty okay they're pro-life they were against the Iraq war like okay go down the last birth control yeah because you're supposed to bring more like that so yeah if at least your teaching is consistent I can't see on these people that are like no if you want to have your right-wing no social welfare state you're gonna have to fucking allow abortion because you're gonna have to take help take care of these fucking kids are you willing to do that some of them are but a lot of them are not and by the way if we went and blew up Iraq those Christians that want to do this yeah there's Calvi and Christians they're okay they're like the original fucking Christians there have babies that but they're collateral damage you call them and that's that's fine it happens but but okay what's the difference between that and some woman in New York at the collateral damage of on the way to her career she is one of the baby if you accept that ah stropping bombs on somebody's fucking pregnant wife and killing their unborn baby because it's convenient for us then shut the fuck up about someone get an abortion use your hypocrite throw life down the line yes that's a very good rant and true yeah well I can't go on Facebook anymore I'm in trouble it's a very good rant I mean what you're saying is right if the people are very convenient it's not very inconsistent I think you're absolutely bitter I'm bitter for my religion because I'm like the sucker that would believe it right it would dawn on me later oh yeah we don't actually do that we're just you know no you can't you on your shoulder because of that and you and I have had the conversation a bunch of times because you'll say I know what these people are trying to do with their words I remember this shit from when I was the same thing I'm a suppressive person right or an apostate Jose I'm always in a positive because of good things to be a national title well because dude I like it dude 12 apostates I'm really upset by that group like don't stumble your brother once once the truth is just saying telling the truth it's not in the interest of the group to tell the truth that's really upsetting it just really gets under my fucking well it should it's like what we were talking about it brings back the same thing with this Jordan Peterson thing when they're calling him a Nazi and they're calling them a transitional Anderson he's a professor at the University of Toronto it's become very famous for battling against social justice warrior ideology online specifically them imposing in one of their bills in Canada the you have to use someone specified gender pronouns and their if you if you don't do it it could be thought of as like a human rights violation will they have those human rights course yes the human rights councils up there it's a lttle council it's a very different thing they don't have freedom of speech free speech is kind of an American thing what have you pronouns like faggot like like do you have to say that because that would also be hate speech it's like this weird so it can't be a pronoun you that's right daddy there's some control over what the pronouns will be like you could probably say you're a stormtrooper right you could probably get crazy but you probably can't say you're a faggot but if that's your identity like who's to say what your identity is well your identity cannot be an offensive word because your identity is lashing out hurting other people what if you identify as white sis mail that's it I'm a white cisgender problem I'll call you whatever the fuck you want I got no issues I know wish it was yeah this is saying he was battling against it very early on and almost everything he said would happen is happening now in terms of this overreaction culture well how come by the way how come that's remember Jamie kills Dean had it I kept asking about it that uh white boy blues song and it goes con I don't know what this means and I go Jamie I know you got to put everything on the white males now that's like the religion but do you honestly believe anyone outside of a young white male knows what the fuck's this means like where I used to live in Washington Heights in New York I want you to go out and talk to any these Dominicans on the corner go do you know your assist male right and ask me if they know what the fuck that means they'll stab you you have to be a white super recent thing yeah please genders they're supposed to adopt it like okay I'll tell you what you want but why are you get to pick my title and it's also nonsense word this is Marxist it's what Marxism does it's compliance and if you agree to nonsense that's one step closer to dominance yeah it is really like a religion you're right it's a consensus-based religion which is really you're being vegan is kosher why is it that people fall into that so easy because themselves too comfortable by Barry told me that I didn't understand the level cuz I people fucking hate themselves that's why they're online creating these new identities and shit okay and if you don't hate yourself because I before I had that that media shitstorm I I had I had all right guys would fucking try a date they all did different things are trying to ruin your life like there be people pose alright guys like to be a fake you and then go to people you kind of know like John Daly who I'm like I know I'm bound no one where it's like and then as you say some fucked up shit and then they think like that's the John Daly the golf guy no the from Kroll show he's pretty funny dude actually he's only uh you he always in his in Chaska John Delaney daily daily you've seen him in shed trust me he's got like a square head okay but uh whatever it but but they would go him faked me out when Patton Oswalt's wife died somebody asked me sends him a thing with his dead wife photoshopped in the Ghostbusters poster Jesus I like using your shitty on cuz I like the mild thing was you not you don't know what's funny so don't if I tell you you know does that whole joke thief shit then I'm like listen III was there and also I know comedy and I know better than you jerk-off at home so if I tell you just nothing I know better I'll just put it that way maybe that's arrogant but I just been doing it for 20 years and you never had the balls get onstage so I think I just know better there you're fighting when someone's not even here I started some jokes t fight no one has any idea fuck yourself right guys is when I defended Amy right Amy and I had people like lecture and I'm like don't listen who don't presume to tell me shit but but they're outraged Dave but the same as yes the social jihadis they all think they the same reason I became a comic mom I could do that so they all but at least I did it you know if you get on stage and do it I'll give it to it but these people think they can do your job but hold on a second in their defense yeah they're looking at a film that shows time after time bits that daddy made specifically fuck her because she said I play a racist Republican right the little YouTube video where they took movies fucking the show which by the way she doesn't write the show it was ridiculous and it was exactly what the fucking sjw's did to me where they don't like your do they think you have an agenda they got to destroy so they create this fucking a you know it's like a smear job there were bits that were exactly the same dude relax relax I drank to leave man nitros and you're talking me this way I do I know this but you run through the wall and I know Kurt shaped and break in touch so caveman nitro yeah but you're you're arguing against someone who's not even here why they are going at me that is what the problem with what you're saying is they have evidence they're looking at one bit and it's if I look at the evidence and I come to a different conclusion right let's go with my conclusion because I was there that's not enough to convince someone Oh trust me you think isn't that like some authoritative Sheriff type shit just trust me trust me I'm watching this video I'm watching these jokes they're being repeated you're saying just trust what you talk I'm talking about sketches these claims were taken which is nonsense I was in the room I guess on top of the room about shit but that doesn't mean no one watch me a TV and stuff sorry stop that doesn't mean anything because the bit still got on the air see what I'm saying like you might not even happen intentional it doesn't matter that's what you have to say that's not what you say that no no joke you can't but you can't say that these people don't have actual examples of the same bits over and over again if there's if it's parallel thinking that's fine but it has to be absolutely but you didn't really see this this the whole thing about this is you're saying very confused but if they see the evidence right you have to like you have to be real clear confrontational when you're when you're handling some point right dude I won't first of all number one the larger issue is I never should be on social media talking to any of these fucks at all complaining I don't owe any of you anybody listening if you have a question or a judgement I don't owe you an explanation for shit I understand I know where the fuck you got the idea that I do so I was wrong that I even fucking at any answer at all because you people hey joke thief really that's the word about me that I'm a joke thief from some know-nothing and it's they just want to see I'll talk back to them these animals you did steal it and you gotta explain how this was a parallel thing yeah well there's gonna be many times I did I know but alone people haven't heard it and you're blurting it out like that someone's arguing you in the room I'm just free they're always a pro rape yeah guys here's one thing I wanna make clear I am pro rape yeah Arif apologist I'm Pro reap I really apologize for one thing like yeah I'm gonna bring up why this why I was getting shit I was getting shit for defending Amy from these all right drunks I understand but it's also because you're confronting them like you're your confrontational yeah I like so hon I like being online and also it seemed like know of no consequence to me I'm like I got all this shit going on I can what one hand sit here and answer your dumb shit I was like cocky I understand I understand but what I'm saying is from the perspective of someone who's a stand-up fan my hand is trembling for my dress that's crazy it's got some serious shit what the fuck is in this 270 milligrams caffeine you probably have some coffee earlier - yes so you do Twitter like me where you think it's almost like the candy crush of words and then before you know it I just pissed off uber or some shit listen I'm speaking as a nitro caveman - you're right to start small I'm saying though as a person who's a fan of comedy like and I am a fan of comedy when I see like if I if I was never a stand-up and I saw this all going down and I was a kurt metzger fan I would want Kurt Metzger to explain to me what happened I would want you your your specific words on this because you were a writer over there right so like as a fan I would want to know I think Kurt Metzger is a hilarious creative comedian I want to know how this happened sketches were so for you to say it defensively to brush it off and say that you know better than you know I'll tell you why because I the way someone would come at me would it be rude immediately like this way so say you're very defensive well as soon as I have somebody coming at me a certain way like just your natural mode right yeah you know naturally dude I found out that that's one reason why people think I'm a psycho is because I'll react to that and no one else sees that guy yeah they don't cuts please okay you're a psycho from running your Twitter listen have to do is read your tweets cuz I got way off track of right - but just what you said that girl that so so what I'm saying hey go maybe go to cops and don't on Facebook announced a rape verdict I had this I'm not gonna even say her name because he people benefit every time I fucking mention him this girl writes this idiotic blog at me we have a back and forth I mock the stupid language of her stupid she said asking for any details of what happened is like rear aping the victim just believe and I go so I go that's like rear aping I said the word rape hole in a post mocking her language okay she deletes her comments takes what I wrote and goes to these chicks that say like look what he said about you so nobody cares what anyone saying to you you're the person that they've heard of so they only care what you say and there's no context there you go he said rape hole go ask somebody what I did that's wrong but they won't be able to tell you and they'll go well that he said something repo is that's all they have is that proven do you have screenshots of the original tweets no because then people complained not only could I not because I don't delete anything that I put up right removed all of that Facebook's removed all that because the people I am offended so I can't even go back and show anybody the Facebook took it down oh wow but even if she didn't take fucking shit off it doesn't matter like nobody's reading her shit they don't give a fuck what she's saying right they're like oh the writer for humor show is saying it thing and that's what all these people can't believe it's so easy to access you and fucking have you get a reaction to them and they're amazed they can't believe it they're like I can talk to the fucking man and the TV and they've built an industry around it so if you speak to them at all you're a sucker dude if you have any emotion about this you're I mean you're a fucking sucker don't like just don't get suckered that's all I'm saying same thing happen to me without the Black Panther stuff because I was just doing the reverse of any marketing it's not a Black Panther well Black Panther is black yeah it was like finally a movie with black people for black people so I was just like there's no white people in it pass who do I relate to said that really because I know what you're talking about it is all over that was like the whole thing and then a couple people like ah Jeffrey Wright the actor and yeah Cheadle they start reacting like I was serious and I started being like this is satire man I'm just doing black musial did you feel like a little cool that you got on she was like how do you think it feels to me I'm like dude how do you think it feels what finish the sentence oh sorry man I'm a little jacked up to his energy got me really good watching you know growing up as a black man and watching only white movies and I was like dude I have Michael Jordan on my wall I love Karl Malone it's like kung fu movies my buddy still got a point you still got a point I mean the problem is that he didn't take it as satire but he's right - you know what problem is you weren't you weren't being serious you were cracking a joke about how people are reacting to this movie I love it because they're black and it's black - I'm at the worst level of being known we're like I have reached but I'm not famous enough for people like he's a comedian I got fucked it's like not famous enough to be like fine but famous enough to get fucked over big enough for someone wants to hunt me but like no one's like oh oh and Benjamin the comedian some of them are like oh we must work for a college HR department by the way did you see the Black Panther no fucking good what annihilation I want to see that dude that's a trip yes no spoiler please I won't bits from that ex machina guy the guy made it I didn't see it watch that but by the way if this was such a racially uplifting movie um first of all his name wouldn't his first thing wouldn't be black the Black Panther that wouldn't be forbidden the Black Panther forever yes it's like actually saying shaft is like Selma like when do you think they came up with the Black Panther Panthers are black already you don't need to specify that unless you're letting me know the guy under the suit is black well you know what it actually is it's a Jaguar it's a Jaguar that has spots everywhere instead of just some spots so I didn't show Jaguars some jag they're not really totally black like a Black Panthers kind of it's it's not like scientific for they if you see the really black ones you could still see like some faint outlines of like those Jaguar little dogs and it's kind of funny I like David Attenborough does almost make it seem like black panthers are more hostile the black panther stalking his prey well the Snow Leopard is as elusive as in spirit they're all Jaguars yeah I think the black ones probably evolved to be more successful hunting at night because you can't see a goddamn thing at night in the jungle you don't know what black is I would imagine in a jungle no but I've been to the Pacific Northwest into those essentially rain forests up there yeah like there's there's some parts of the Pacific Northwest that are insane at night too right like you can't believe how dark it gets because you don't see shit sounds it's dark at noon when you go through the woods it's dark like you won't get a tan it could be fucking new now could be meeting five degrees out and it's dark walking through those woods because this canopy of leaves and super dense tree grows like it's dark it's funny at night you must just hear these crazy noises oh yeah man like elk sound intense they're intense yeah and you just hear the sound of like a dude where's my point about it being dark there I know about the Black Panthers Black Sea once the most likely in the jungle it's the same situation and the ones that the darkest are the less likely to be seen and less likely or more likely to be successful because they're there attack ambush predators they sneak up on things and Jack them well they do to deer and fucking people well that spirit is what the king of Wakanda has come into him to become the Black Panther I thought it was technology no that's actually pretty cool this suit is like I think one of Kools parts the movie because it build a force and hit you back like the dope but then his other part of his power is that they have this this they make from flowers and he lays down and they I swear to God they give him a purple drink he drinks a purple drink oh Jesus and that's where he gets his other powers no jesuschrist guys watching is that freak from the comic book - the purple drink I'm like that's so when they make this are they even because they're making it like you know it's like guest star fucking Maya Angelou is giving them a purple drink guys as long as no whites were involved it was an Asian comic it's - all Jewish guys Brody it's from the 70s like that's when it came out put it out like finally you know let's get the origins of the Black Panther comic by the way Luke Cage was already out and that was a fucking awesome I think that she likes Superman if they were like what would I get a Superman almost like the old joke but it's fucking great I don't Luke Cage was Greek aids gets to fuck Jessica Jones yeah yeah interracial romance super because they're both super fucking each other the both three monsters grind your pelvis who does he's fighting gentrification well she sees him beat the fuck out of some dudes in a bar realizes that he's one of them and she's up Ben she's a mutant and he's a mutant they get together and mutant sex fucked up the bed who could lay pipe the way lace pipe yeah if you look at him you go I bet that guy thought that guys with sex scenes was there a rumor that they really were having sex on cameras make teamwork it was a big one in that movie angel heart it's never been true really not true at all I think it's other lens in that killer midget movie they say Mickey work really banged Kim Basinger in nine and a half weeks but he's a word did he I don't know wasn't there I like to believe I mean you're so anti religion you don't even want to believe rumors back was fine does my first my first joke ever yeah similar to that really and you still know I didn't show people they didn't inch but I was like when I was 11 his guy in my blocky my uncle Charlie they used to rate me every day and he would go if you ever tell anybody what I did to I'm gonna kill your parents and I told everybody it's your first joke yeah I told everybody and he never killed my parents you know I don't we had a deal enjoy that joke at all fucking weird looking yeah they're not laughing at that they're different yeah yeah but I will say best thing that was started out in those rooms because there was a crowd it wasn't other comics that were waiting to get on right it was a fucking audience yep and uh it kind of you couldn't be precious yeah fucking perform you know like you couldn't be one of these like hanging in the back pocket oh dude you can't know that you're gonna perform yeah yeah and so and you don't have to fucking but talk black we tell you just be very confident and your own whatever and crowd will go it yeah yeah it just be funny just be funny you bring a notebook they see it as like weakness they're like fucking notebook I see it as weakness to do your home some yeah but there's some rooms where they're like oh that means it's like brand-new he's writing he's working at you today the worst is when someone pretends they're reading their notes and they do the same bits over and over again like you can't you just pretended you just looked in that book and my first name for them well it's just like people in the audience like hey don't don't do that you know Jay raping Jay yeah sure here these people call them bataya college yeah I do some new thing that I think people have mistaken laughter for like support or like a poor use did you say that to me they missed a kit for applause they've confused laughter and applause well you know it's an ideology versus like laughter when someone relates applause is when someone agrees well there's too many people that are trying for applause right my point is like you're supposed to this is only supposed to be funny like the one you're just trying to like to say a bunch of shit and memorize it and say it real fast and then to get a big applause at the end like that's great dude I'm not trying to change policy constraining to laugh when I was a kid I remember like Eddie Murphy you were an Eddie Murphy was the biggest cannon in the world yeah like and this funny one in the 80s I remember watches stand-up it seemed more integrated or something like in the 80s and I swear to God like when the evening at the in a comic strip live or on TV let's be on like Friday night or that's why I used to watch stand-up comedy I was like like like 11 or 12 right and then the nine like death I mean when Def Jam came out and I remember it was like a lot and also racially a lot of shit seemed more segregated and it was like I think the beginning of just marketing to specific you write me like oh here's an all-black show and and they had jokes on Seinfeld about it like that Seinfeld's market was being eaten away with Def Jam his mother sang it to him and I didn't think but that was the beginning so now it's like everything get just specifically you know I liked it I was like kind of grab-bag when I'd watch stand-up it would be like you'd see like a ventriloquist you'd see like you know any Eddie Murphy kind of person and like some fucking real dry person there'd be like Elliott point it was more mixed on its own and you know solution yeah I think we should do some of those like Rodney Dangerfield type specials like how Rodney would do a special I'm thinking of us yeah I think that's what we should do yeah I think is also a lot of us you know if you're gonna put out a special it takes you a couple fucking years or a year solid to have the material lockdown rock and roll but if you're gonna do 15 minutes I think your minimum by the way sometimes it's not enough I agree a nice I agree I've been doing a year and a half in between specials and I think that's the right amount of time yeah yeah six months is probably either because that shit gets hammered down like a samurai on his website and you got fucking my point is like if there's more of those 15-minute sets like you could come up with a 15 minutes and a couple of months right you know he really could and it would be locked in right right and so if you were if you were doing something like that you you could do that like get a prepare set over like three or four months and have hey you know we're gonna be filming will film some of them here we'll film some of them like three months later so you'll know you'll have it all locked in you'll know when to go you know I do that with way precious I couldn't I didn't have a booking agent for the road Oh guide switch managers and I was like we can't take him until he fucking does the hour but I'm like I need to work the hour out so I had to do it in 15 minute chunks around the city and just do a lot of city spots oh wow which is I'm happy without came out but I mean I'm so fucking nerve-wracking because I'm like I know I'm not preparing this properly right right right cuz I these 15 minute chunks of the material yeah the really why didn't you uh schedule yourself on the road and like small-clawed has been writing a lot and I just like like I said I switch managers and I didn't have an agent a book and I don't know how easy it was to like book you know at this point what's up once I all these people were like you know I had banished to Kramer island I couldn't get them to do shit for me I found out it's actually very easy to go book yourself yeah people actually wanted to book me everyday it turns out not everybody's in this dipshit cult the way it seems when you like online a lot well I just think if you can clearly explain yourself and you can like well it'll see is a chance yeah they could do it without you they don't need you present to fucking set you up is whatever I bet you get it oh then they'll go Kurt what did you say they you know they don't even bother with that but they don't care a lot of people just I wanna burn yeah there's just this all your media is based on this conflict now and they Patrice used to say like they always need us to be at war so they need men versus women and wife or they always need that going 100 all the time what district to you that piece of shit did you watch that documentary about Gawker and Hulk Hogan no I did not oh my god it's on Netflix if you've got to see it because it's amazing it's very heavily skewed to make you feel bad for Gawker but it doesn't it actually makes you go are you shitting me Gawker like ways you feel bad for Cosby it's like dude you can't tell me that I feel bad for fucking Donald why do you think it's designed to make it you because their life so Hulk Hogan basically because Gawker this is how the news media like that despicable shit they did to Louie in the New York Times which shouldn't the New York Times is now fat girl's diary basically like they never should have been allowed my girlfriend me that that's very funny Annie's very fun like that's what it is and nonsense I mean like if you read the article there's no crime people just make up what like what did Louis do I used to ask like that should happen to him I go what's it Louie do wrong and it go well one time at work my boss grabbed my tit my girlfriend says to me I'm like I'm sorry I asked you what Louie did it's not about that we're gonna use him as a fucking symbol cuz what did he do wrong ask for consent for non contact in like what are you talking about like why would that have to come out why would that be anybody's business it's to make him look like he's a Weinstein for comedy like Harvey Weinstein right and by the way Harvey Weinstein that's the old casting couch which I'm like good get rid of that shit but they try to paint Louis a stand-up comic as if he's a producer director like it is a conflict of interest if you have produced or come to my room they're like hey but another comedian at a festival brought you it's reasonable think you might be fucking because you're not on a different it's a power level we're comedians we don't work for a corporation together okay we're each an independent company z' can fuck with each other also do you think that what it was is just a weird thing that he liked to do and what they made it out to be is like a sister looks like he's a fucking a predator and there was no such anything he doesn't Supriya never surprised people jerking off now I'm going off what Louie told me right and by the way I believe Louie by the way oh my god you're supposed to believe women there's a whole new thing what kind of an imbecile on me too I mean first of all you there's no woman on this earth who's stupid enough to just believe women like women know way better so I'm just what imbecile people yeah I was like oh I just that you're a woman is not evident exhibit a you have to admit it's kind of weird to just do like an impromptu whack off sesh yeah it was it is weird unless like you know we're talking about sex shit back if it's not like Weinstein but it's you told me that's the point that you told me tell me the lies of omission first of all just well I'll just go off the article cuz I don't know what what trouble I'll get in saying anybody's name but just read listen just read the fucking article okay there's nowhere where it says then he separated says hey will you watch me masturbate somebody said no needed masturbate they went and said something reported or whatever supposedly and by the way the story of that that I know more about its despicable how they frame that the guitar comic thing absolutely despicable how they frame that what's the target anybody read the article nobody did right nobody reads he literally did nothing if you read never mind what I would know personally just read the article nobody bothered to so all this nonsense that everybody put out of him surprise whacking off that's not even in there okay like like it's the first one is the guitar do that people thought were Garfunkel and Oates because all these young kids can't imagine anything happening before who the guitar duo that Louis suppose a jerk you know remember this no that's why they had a lot of shit hard duo that was Louie jerked off in front of the new dude I saw like some of the headlines and saw some people commenting it on online that's just let me ask what do you guys think Louis did that he got in trouble for I'm just someone to master if he could masturbate in front of him and then did it they said yes and he did it that's it essential and then was asked it to people who said no and they felt very uncomfortable they had to work with him right that is the sexual harassment aspect up right that's the difference like if you're on a TV set right that's the only one that I went I read and went well that's crazy but you were telling me something yeah I'm not gonna he could say what he wants you know you don't want to explain to this story yeah and and but there's a flat-out agenda here no what's the agenda to ruin a guy who means Mexican now I know it doesn't help this case this is like the Taliban this shit now like they have to write I bet he's a fucking Buddhist statue that has to be exploded do you understand we now have to take all these unfunny people okay that for political reasons and and you can't have evidence of someone being funny that fits in the wrong group it's the style again there's no style his fucking leg see patriarchy is like every man that ever achieved anything they got to remove it so we're gonna throw Louie away Louie CK we're gonna throw him away with Harvey fucking Weinstein I'm sending you right now Jamie you got to put this shit up you're gonna cry yeah no you're right in some ways that there's there's a Taliban going on but if a guy like Harvey wines existed you know there was a real fucking problem for a lot of people for sure a hundred percent in fact Hollywood's fucking Despicable both things what you're saying is true and that's true but the idea that that another comedic because back when they suppose it happened in Aspen Louie was not a fucking but he was a comedian who was a few more years ahead than these two girls that were also comedians I've been at festivals and had sex with comedians this is outrageous yeah but on the engine or even industry these girls attractive and you were attracted to them and you guys had consensual sex is that what you're saying yeah rape what the fuck dude that's or as it's known now really this guy 88% of white wealth is dude how do you honor an assembly line of t-shirt I hope that that's not really his shirt I hope someone he thinks he's a fucker and they they Photoshop that shit out of a shirt maybe that's because first of all what does that have to do with me at all like well you might say if I earn something 80% all night in that when you throw those numbers up I want to see studies I want to see 88% well that's a very specific number do you do not notice the fucking shit that it isn't white no this is a what white young white woman led fucking movement the social jihadis they're just fighting for the right to do to white men what they've always done to black men which is like he scared me I want him fired well it's also all the men so congratulations you get to be like an inward now well it's also toxic femininity where it's like the way a lot of women's instincts are based around keeping a toddler away from like light sockets so it's like whatever they do it's all good it's not what you feel an instinct to do that to is away from a life socket all right like women are more designed in general to take care of very young children and men are more like seven onward we're sorry if you fall down you hurt yourself and you learn your lesson now get out there design that makes them do that why how you mean ergonomically designed or how they know emotionally wired to do that yeah women once my wife first had a baby I really was like oh this is like makes perfect sense that's why they have brass yeah for your baby exactly yeah well I don't think that's uh no but you know it's kind of like a lot of this SJW mentality is that save space like if there's a group of people there's nothing they could possibly have done wrong where I protected all costs it's almost maternal exactly yeah they're not maternal I mean like this is the thing makes me laugh right that's the point I was making you want you want a mother society but you killed your babies this mothering job is maybe you shouldn't so you don't abort us didn't kill their babies like that you throwing the ones that got abortions in there all the clergy oh gee the online feminist clergy do you have an abortion you get in a club card Lena Dunham is the classic because I feel bad for it's like she's like I just want to be good in my church what what might the guy who worked for me didn't commit rape oh I'm sorry he did do this is communism this isn't harmless the bodies stack like the number one death of the 20th century was your own government my own wait wait we talking to me you people is in us like human government is that yes 60 million Russians 60 million Chinese and got Hitler you got like that like that are we in - I'm so high are we in Russia what do you mean when you say your own government like inclusivity all that stuff it all leads to like the way to make a forest equal is with an axe that's it and the tallest nail gets hammer down right these are all and we're starting to enter like an upside down world and the left but the right wing tyranny is more sexy that's why you hear about Hitler because he's an evil guy but at least he had like great boots and shit but like the Stalin is a bean-counter that's why he has way bigger death cap we never hear about it cuz he's just like let them starve I thought Stalin I always what I was worried about Stalin was he was kind of like meathead and Lenin was like the intellectual and stomping sound was the things like the muscle that kind of crept up but he was just like a fucking you know am I wrong in that I thought that's what I know if stuff he was an ideologue did you read the shit of you know classified when from Russia that stuff Stalin had them working on now he wanted to make these gorillas human hybrid soldiers this is when like they couldn't say no to Stalin like the later years where whatever he said yeah okay Stalin you imagine he goes make guerrilla soldiers that don't have to eat very much and they're like well gorillas actually eat all day it might not be like but do it soldiers that don't have man half gorilla soldiers so that they wouldn't have to eat a lot I mean it's crazy the shit oh well if you stop clapping first he killed you and there's this one time where there's nine straight minutes of everyone clapping and like is they the the people knew that the first one to stop is going to die and someone finally passed out and they killed him yeah because that's how far compliance goes it's just they keep getting you to comply comply comply and that's that's the question I want to know about guns and abortion it's like what where's the line because if you can't determine it someone who's doing what when like you were saying like when do you think it's okay or not okay to have it more he wait is a good fuck on both sides there's an unreasonable argument on both sides they're not willing to give it up at all right on both you know it's funny man cuz like like I said I don't care about all your kids however I don't get I don't get aggressive okay I don't get that having been said I don't get why the only thing we can do is nothing like they're like I'm very sorry there's absolutely nothing that can help Donal but if you're a gun if you're a gun lover or just shooter or know anything about guns and someone says err 15 and they don't realize in 8 10 is the same gun except with bigger bullets or an SKS or or that automatic guns are already illegal and they want to like ban something they don't understand like there is no such thing as an assault rifle like that doesn't make any sense well you call it an assault rifle ikan with your mouth who cares that the point is there's guns that you know make shoot a bunch of people real easy with yeah but what right a or 50 they know what's going on is a gun it's killing people like all this other stuff is nonsense and people get lost up in the minutiae of it like you know the right names what's a bump stock fuckin canned peaches like in someone's basement who owns that shit lasts a while like years does it last years yeah they're designed for like the apocalypse there's like 50 they'll do this not yes by I swear God told me he's not he's a Christian but he's not a good Christian oh so what he's wrong I didn't I didn't pry but he's not going up he's not going up in the first leg pick up Christian says you could always even on the fucking buzzer on the buzzer except Jesus not during the Great Tribulation that he was planning to live through which it was the stockpiles before he was gonna have to live through that and then get caught up in the second well pick up he won't be the disappearing out of his clothes guy the problem with where both of us live you and I know is if the shit does hit the fan we're kind of far far there's too many people too many people in Manhattan too many people here it ain't good this is no bueno you really want to I did but but yeah winter look if you don't have laws you're gonna go out and you could whack thirty fucking deer and stack those fuckers up in your garage like there's deer all over the place up there you are going into the fresh water with your car not even wanting to well they some places they allow you to pick that deer up and take it home and eat it like after you hit it with your car yeah they should for sure but the thing is that they were saying like what if people were targeting the deer like well yeah look you know how much it costs the damage that a deer does your fuckin car like they destroy your car thousands of dollars of damage who the fuck is going to do that and that's a lot of driving yeah for a deer that you could buy a tag for for like 50 bucks and kill with like a knife like you're in my yard literally just be eating my flowers and just look at me like this you know this is the village and like do I live in Boulder when you are when you get out like in the the town of Boulder you'll see a fucking giant mule deer sitting on the side of the road eating big-ass buck giant antlers just sitting there and you can get out of the car and go motherfucker are you for real and this thing will just be looking at you're just eating there so convinced that no one's gonna eat them they just wander through the city it's amazing it's fucking amazing but I just was just in Denver there's about a shower outside maybe well maybe it's a cool little mountain community very very quiet I love it I shake into the best oh they just give you an egg a day it was hilarious I had not seen like the guy with like the oak leaves on top of his fucking Sun vial Ike like a whore the homeless white kids with the dog and shit oh I haven't seen in a while that is so juicy wedges a bag in Denver no outside is like the mountain was in under the tree baby so yeah one of those mountain like a South Park Town yeah there's that's where evergreen is is where they grew up I grew up in evergreen evergreen it's fucking amazing it's amazing just like outside of Denver like just outside evergreen has a population of elk that's a hundred strong to walk through the middle of the fucking City really a buddy of mine lives there my friend Brian Carly put a bunch of videos on his his Instagram his Instagram is the gritty Bowman or it might be gritty Bowman he's got a podcast called do you see those things in person even like oh like a horse I don't last nights are like a life worth but like you look like a fucking dinosaur to you if you've been in a city long and I feel like I can't believe it a giant fucking Hannibal looking at me I mean that's uh look at that that looks prehistoric yeah those that's great I don't know who that gentleman is but that's a few buddies that got one of those but he's got some videos on his Instagram somewhere of his town he lives in Evergreen I believe and in these gigantic fucking deer just walking through his yard Wow on his Facebook it says his two loves are bow hunting and Barack Obama what are the odds this horn size have to do with Hammer sighs oh yeah for sure did you know hammers on the bigger the elk the bigger the antlers the older if they keep you like she's trying to get rid of it she this is in her yard they just wander into people's yards and that's a female but that's probably a 300 pound animal not an animal you know man I'm I'm a little cuz I love shooting but um I'm like I think I'd be a little queasy I just want to clean my hunt I like that's what I want to hire you get used to it yeah I never did right it's a different thing than fishing it's way more intimate yeah fishing like I don't anymore you're blooded now I don't feel any remorse when I kill a fish hey weird by the way the Donner Party died in Colorado yeah no they were in warrant wasn't it the Sierra Nevadas is that what they done I drove through there on the way back it is remember how long Inc it was Nevada the Donner Party yeah how long before you eat a guy me yeah none there's no chance no look what kind of fucking life is this gonna be they got trapped in the snow you had to eat each other yeah each other out all winter is it true this is where father and son mother and daughter eating you just print it online and it'll be so it was a tragedy and any correction of it will be ignored they just had our standing 69 constant just each other the bush lies back there in tui through oh man in the huge bushes chaos chaos Joey there's some dicks that wouldn't make it through that Bush yeah probably a lot of them just like you could have a four or five inch bush I feel like super sorry - never yeah measuring the butch like I got a five-inch these have beards these long-ass beards and the longer the beard like the more desirable the turkey is balls on their nose is a beard oh no no no down here it grows like right off of like their neck area like where that hits the chest it's just a long thing that gets called a turkey beard yeah they're like dinosaurs there's like a whole caulking Bowl it's lucky they got all that stuff but I forget what that's called geez it's all fucked up - yeah what does that shit the red stuff you see a rooster like a roosters what do you call the fucking red thing man I have no idea what they call the red thing I have no reason to know that yeah but dirty - fuck you up - fuck you places I joke about that and it sounds like I have this personal issue with turkeys right because I saw a PBS think about turkeys they will never be a friend a turkey did you see what the guy lived with turkeys no fuck my life is a turkey identify as a turkey that was going on he was with them from when they hatch they would follow him around the second they hit puberty they turn into prehistoric dinosaur vicious fucking they're gone right except his favorite stayed with them Turkey boy his favorite Turkey okay tableman yeah and then one day they're by a log and this would to me if you should swatch as soon as possible I hope I'm not remembering this wrong height but I swear to God so Turkey boy one day just fucking it turned on him attacked him and went for his eye they go for your eyes his favorite turkey Turkey boy who was like I thought that was gonna be an in Turkey boy wooden - no he went for his eyes and they show a reenactment with a nod another - like it's like an after turkey because turkeys just go for your fucking eyes yeah you don't need a lot of training they might visit Turkey but my joke is like you cuz you know big as a live Turkey is a huge size of Katt Williams and it's like and it's like and his body's probably didn't get like very picture they probably weren't too compassionate when they're like what why did he turn on me like I shouldn't trust the turkey and they're like fucking turkey man while you think about a chicken chickens are ruthless and then now think about a turkey turkeys are giant chickens well read it all together trees where my grandfather lived in the notice Asif Florida before he died there was all these feral cats and chickens on their property and he feed him he put this big feeder out it was amazing how they formed a little society because it would be kitten would be cat chicken catch they didn't have any interaction they just all came and ate the food that's amazing yeah I mean this is crazy I mean that the cats didn't kill the little chickens not even at all a little bit crazy there's just plenty of food that's super rare that a feral cat can keep it together I would have never thought that until I was watching him do it it was adorable you ever see the numbers moving ever see the numbers of birds that feral cats kill in America every year no it's in the billions do we need them to do that B no uh probably you know when you think about it we probably do cuz in Israel they're like rats my uh my ex Israeli she told me they're like cats or not same with Egypt I lost a chicken to a coyote last night I had to finish the chicken off with my chickens yeah I had a we had a coyote in the yard caught it in the yard while the chickens were out what do you jumped up on the top of the chicken coop and jumped over and it chased a couple oven bit one of them won't knock some feathers loose but one of them it actually got and killed it's wild there's coyotes here oh dude it's it's a crazy thing to be around man to watch that 3 New York 2 by the way jump watch that thing jump to the roof of this chicken coop like it was nothing I'm talking about a 6-foot jump and it's so elegant it's kind of beautiful and watch the way they did it it was a bummer that it killed the chicken and I had to scare it off and now we know that they're targeting the chickens because it's happened more than once oh that's time it happened was like two years ago keep coming back all ten once two coyotes a Fisher cat and a raccoon I believe so you guys are both chicken farmers dude you get an egg a day per hand yeah no not always but close you know we're so told now you ever cut open to get all the eggs at once 20 eggs right now if I cut this come on fuck this chicken yeah I feel bad about killing chickens it's like kill them but their pets to me I don't eat them roosters is for any around like I got videos of them follow me around cuz I give him treats so I walk around the the backyard and select I'm the fucking Pied Piper of chickens like it's kind of hilarious there's any of me carrying my daughter's bunny walking and all these chicks are following me I'm like a mini Beastmaster like a way you smash the rabo channel you feed them especially when I give them these little worm treats there's these dried mealworms they fucking love these things they go crazy for him second that's how I get them back into their chicken coop they have a big chicken coop but when they wanted the yard and want to get them back I take their their worms and shake them I'm running to me and then I give them a little treat every time so that they know that every time I shaky shaky shaky it's time for a treat and you know they're so carnivorous they've never seen something attack worms with the kind of passion and vigor the chickens do they just know I see I've seen it's terrifying they'll eat chicken or dinosaurs if you see oh the fighting roosters what's a Hawaii by the way roosters are way different than hands no I know don't rape the shit out of anybody yeah they also just say same thing oh my oh you have a different point they may well you know why there have been a hurricane and like these people had chickens like that that I got it so on the street corners it made me laugh it would look like a pimp they'd be like one rooster and they're like a bunch of hens behind him and he would just like he's got earners on the corner and he was a while chasing Hawaii every quarter I just see roosters like wow wild chickens but uh I keep fucking forgetting why you brought this up in Hawaii yeah well rapey roosters you know it's like when they go to rescue the fighting roosters I don't know they just kill them because that's all they want to do is fight so they just fucking if they bust one of those rings out they just put the root like just let them fucking fight if that's what they're into you know they get them adopted or something they just fucking well he doesn't think they're bred for it yes there's championship bloodlines like there's a reason why these things do it what is this saying if that's what I would say let them do showing us wild chickens in Walmart in one of these fucking shopping cart return bar things and they're covered with chickens this is crazy why inquire that's nuts man there's wild chickens now what's the word on killing those can you if you want some chicken soup but you don't have a lot of money and you a lot of just whack one of those I hope so look at all of them that's crazy they don't have any predators see Hawaii is a really bananas place when it comes to wildlife cuz they lose money birds they used to have these birds called noni birds and they were they were so docile people that need crack I mean like you think dodo bird when exchange is a time extinct because the birds had no fear right over there but they didn't bring predators for it so they have like these wild pigs I'm just running around everywhere they have them down but pigs are very because we're pigs like in South America that was not not just disease but the conquistadors brought pigs that fucked up the the crops the natives had everything locks everything up pigs turn you know we must watch all that pig shit right they turn wild and get tusks inherit Jamie pulled up here the last major contributed to the kawatche chicken population is always a shocker even to people who have lived here all their lives Kauai is wild jungle fowl is protected under state law like all birds of Hawaii the MOA is protected as an important part of nature oh god that's a terrible idea because that means nothing's gonna eat them so if nothing's gonna eat them they don't have any predators you can have abortions up until 40 weeks out there too but you can't touch the chickens if you have food for them they're just gonna keep breeding the quote the real question is do you have food for them because if there's there's just a law of nature if there's no predators their population is gonna miss the supply oh yeah that's awesome did you go to a secret beach then no one's supposed to know about but it's on every map no do that oh wait a minute which one's no I've never been to Kauai Oahu is Hawaii Hawaii is where I went and did that Napali coast to her that uh Marin told me that it buddy took a helicopter but I'd say Kauai no my cousin got married oh she lives take impossible to deny it's a it's like a rich kid that like drops out you do in Hawaii like right let's hear from here and you're some rich kid or likes going to Williamsburg or what it is Hawaii right because you got to be rich the the houses I guess it's expensive because upkeep because the houses degrades will run away people living there what a lot of cultural appropriation yeah South Park had a funny thing about it but it's look if you go there you rent a house don't go to resort but also like the natives kind of and it is the only place I ever go wrong like you know I feel like a white guilt like Alaska I was like there's no way this was better before we got here you know cuz it's I mean I couldn't believe it was I found out later cuz Java witness publications have like these paradise you know would you like to live in a place like this like right and I found it later they were based on Hawaii wet cuz I got there night and so I didn't know it looked like I woke up the morning and it looked like the shit that I was told like after Armageddon God will know so I'm like what it looked like fucking Jurassic Park is crazy like these birds flying and we were like on a cliff it was crazy dude it's so it's so pretty love you the only waterfalls are like in Maui it's a helicopter through it it's fucking insect I tell you something five days is plenty I'm like listen I have plans in life like you soon as I'm dead I'll come live here there's no but that's where you go if you like I'm gonna drop out of society there's no terrible there I used to live in Key West playing piano for tips like I got it was like that the island is do you know I'm like if I don't leave now this is Hotel California for me baby yeah real is like 23 just playing piano for tips and was just everything was going so stream ladies no no I don't cigarette breath I'm scared my life 42 years old still kind of hot it was too humid there's a lot of movement to humid that's true right humidity in hangs in real good you see a lot of really hot 50 year olds that's true Lord up yeah moisture I don't know why yeah you gotta moisturize moisture because dryness does fuck up your skin just sign my numbers Hawaii seemed different to like less powerful like where I was so dry like I'm 21 years old right now I'm aging really fast Hawaii's uh it's one of those places where you like wow how is this America we've flew five hours across the ocean to get here yeah is American right if you live there I think if you just if I'd live it would eventually become a kind of beautiful hell and my only joy would be showing visitors around and crystal meth what if for you what if somebody offer you a residency like the four seasons in Maui and it was serious cash what does that mean Kurt Metzger doing stand-up every weekend people come down there no let's do a three-year contract Kurt what do you think three years okay yeah you do like basically what camera Tony does some serious Jenner your three years yeah for three years I think that's more palatable than a job at SNL comedy stuff in Hawaii though because there's no pain dude I said the same thing in fact I don't know if you know Russman Eve no okay he's a funny comic but he is named Adam I got myself unlaid at this wedding it was like my cousin was about to get married picture uh and but but you know the press had a joke about dolphin's blowhole he goes you know he goes don't fuck he goes guys don't fuck them in that whole play if you do hold on just go ahead I mean it was like it was really touching my shoulder and shit and I said that and her hand like probably shot off it because they gotta you know they have to worship dolphins as a god there there is it's like it's like it tells joke it's a funny joke they got mad she got mad cuz it's like they're it's like the ultimate if you're a girl that makes her own jewelry is the best place you could Jade know with colorful seashells I got these seashells that are a gemstone they're like these rainbow shells that they're the only seashell you can ensure that Lloyd's of London which island was he on Kauai but they're like I brought I got my girl bikes the time I got brought her some necklace I mean because you know I brought back all this coffee you spend all this money they're like and you come back and rest shit you can't we're in society this is some but it's also there's a terrible thing if you're trapped on an island with a bunch of Lamers like they could try to get you to be lame like if you've got a bunch of boring people and you're stuck world yeah that show lost you girl bar it's all about locals and life that's fine if the locals are cool right if you get lucky and get a bunch of cool locals that must be awesome but if your locals are all dip shits you got a fine there's a bunch of local celebrities there like usually it's a fat guy that could sing and like he's real cocky that your Hawaii guy but you know I'm going if that comes in does all these covers are like four Non Blondes like it's a big fat guy singing that and I'm like hey good job man I was gay like I okay I'm like you know I'm just being nice time at your dumb cover feds all right we're out there act like you know this guy remember oh my god sake yeah guys gonna die at 50 you're pretty cocky whoa you're being really negative about this guy they're all either in the most beautifully the engineers from Prometheus right or 800 pounds with the Samoan is incredible because my in-laws are all that's a great description of like the perfect like because you know Joe's minuses and Mormons do it does very well in Island places Jobos witnesses and Mormons do very well that's why Brigham Young University has always big Samoan fucking blonde boppers cousin yeah and they have big family they're into big families natural right so it just lends itself to their you know and that's my favorite cult even though they're one of the most preposterous ones in terms of like what their background origin story is yeah when you find out about Joseph Smith being 14 and 18 20 and he writes about golden tablets that contain the lost work of Jesus and only you could read them cuz you had a seer stone I like it's such a great it's amazing it's not that long ago be the first person say this but the only reason you're like that is because it's like too recently well no well sorta but a 14 year old he was 14 yes I think of Biggie and Tupac I'm like they're like 23 they were kids well all 14 year olds are full of shit they're practicing what they can get away with and make mistakes he's like high level full of shit well he wasn't just high level full of shit he was probably like a compulsive liar probably pathological and it was ultimately a con man I mean that's what he became to people this is what you don't realize these comments like how do they do it's like people are so complicit in that and there's people addicted to that bullshit being conned and they will is something Franklin quote write about like quacks patients are the biggest lawyers or some shit like they it's such a bizarre drug dealer situation the con man and Connie a lot of times there's this drug they're after and I know people that compulsively have to be conned or sold or you see that with psychics and people who love psychics yeah they will convince themselves they'll convince themselves that this person has some secret information about them and they were so right there my god my dad Mike Epps has a great joke dude Mike Epps has never faded underrated with the silver suit he's gone on I haven't seen it that's one of the best hours he's a funny dude that dude that makes me a fool to write that down yeah it's one I can say the name again like underrated never faded or some shit he's in Detroit but on like old ladies um like a the past question played around too many times old ladies break out of catching the spirit like they're like they'd done sent that plate three times now that's bullshit yeah yeah I see I can't do it but he was talking about like these are old ladies that go to church I know that old lady like they go to church and they want to pay money to the Jesus man and but even they know what this is a little bit you know the guy's not doing his end of conning them the right way right they're not completely helpless they like oh I this is a bullshit what I want right that Marjoe that documentaries about that guy that Steve Martin made his preacher leap of faith is based on Matt and the dude is doesn't believe in God and he's making his move based on Mick Jagger and he's like they want him to hit no he's gettin resentful because he wanted to be a hack and he wants to try out new stuff and they don't you know that's how I took it if you watch it's very interesting I'm fascinated by TV preachers oh yeah man I know I think they're amazing I mean some of them are so blatantly ridiculous did you ever see the ones that were put together the Jim Baker who's the dude who made a bunch of Duncan's friend make a bunch of really funny videos with Jim Baker using all that survival stuff he had just had incredible edits of real moments with Jim Baker talking about a survival food and like how you can use the buckets of survival food as like look Jim Jim Baker yeah a bottom of a table so you eat there and you lift it up and the survival food that's where you store it your survival see I'd be sitting with that because you got people sitting on it like it makes a good chair you sitting on a chair filled with survived this video this is guy put together it's fucking hilarious because it's all like some of the most ridiculous things that he said Judas the other story cuz I got kind of run out by yeah because of Jessica Hahn well no I know but he goes set up it was a power grab maybe it's in the eyes of Tammy Faye that documentary oh yeah cuz they were they were con artists that also got conned by that fucking guy who is from the faith coalition or something oh really it's a I live down south it that well not Alvin Statesville North Carolina at that time when he was big that's not like this is for South but there's like a certain melody to get people to say like yeah like Farrakhan does it where's that gonna America sucks basta yeah well I figure that's different now Bob ball what does that mean what I'm sayin basta I'm saying it Oh are they speaking in tongues oh yeah it stopped in Italian he's got a bunch of videos on Jim Baker he's got a ton of videos on him I think he might homeboy my processed but he puts together these ridiculous edits of the jim bakker show preparedness and survival here it is this is like this is not a show I love when rednecks adopt Hebrew shit like it's their shit oh yeah I'm gonna blow it chauffeur now and like dude my religion we said all these Jew words we didn't wanna say and then I dated a girl who spoke Hebrew and didn't understand how off all my pronunciations were of everything oh that's hilarious so your was yours was straight from the Jehovah's Witnesses well my book of Bible stories where guys reading the tape so I pronounced these work it's just how Americans pronounce you know Bible words right this shit's not free for us it's for the people that just say who pronounces it right I mean these ladies were thousands of years old yeah well Hebrew thou that they recreated it when the nation Israel's form is kind of interesting they had to rebreathe it was like a lost language that had to be rebuilt rebuild it Wow yeah from the ground well I guess not from the ground up I don't know they they had to put it there but it now it's a fluently spoken language and it was like dead for a while yeah well there's two different Hebrews right there's an ancient Hebrew it's different right I guess yeah yeah ancient Hebrew the letters are also in numbers yeah numbers in ancient Hebrew it's real weird yeah I don't think they use it anymore but that's like the original Bible I mean like how many people use ancient Hebrew ticket see if you can find a video what ancient Hebrew sounds like well my ex's parents are Hebrew scholars so they love that show I want to hear what it sounds like I keep it sounds like phlegm noises it all sounds like weird you know can sound there's example is that about like that sound it's just uh you know but I mean think about it like Chinese has a very specific sound training is very Italian have you been a judge sniffing sound no I've never been to China but Japan though it's worth going it's a lot of like sounds me it is shit me Aerosmith's I am my beef our thee that sounds like I know yeah haha Elohim a Harry it sounds like what I paw I Wow no forget the fighting that's the crazy it looks too Munna the rings elf elf language does not like ancient languages like Sanskrit looks so crazy you're like if this was like on a spaceship you would think like that look at that if that was on a spaceship edged into the side of the spaceship you'd be like holy it's a fucking alien language look I mean I don't know what any of those things are I don't know what one of those numbers is I don't know what the fuck those words are those letters that's an alien language that's to me almost more alien than a lot of Asian languages that looks crazy well that's that's a reason to kind of doubt that somebody's translating it right just like oh you look at that gibberish and you saw the scholars you know the whole thing with that is that these ancient ancient ancient languages like all these stories came from these ancient languages like if you go way way way back it's so mer like the epic of gilgamesh there's all these Noah's Ark similarities it's alright there's a lot of stuff in all these ancient stories it's all probably points to some real shit that happened for sure it along the way just like what you're talking about with social justice warriors and how it they behave like it's a religion there's like a natural compulsion for people to be on a group and have that group have a very clear way up to atheism if they want it because that's like almost a luxury I think yeah I think and I don't know how to just I'll tell you what I will say the DMT shape I did get like more of a oh yeah there's more than there's something else there and and it's crazy because what you know I read about that shit in high school I read some more about that guy that was the big DMT guy Terence Mckenna yeah cuz I think he projects a lot of his own horseshit into it but that stuff that my camera does or the mechanic just I don't let me take when I I never felt the thing that felt so much like not making me hallucinate but like I'm is taking away a hallucination yes and that is such there's something so terrifying about that but it looks like wow that's great like where and uh it you just you feel like there has to be just based on this shit you would say even if just shitting your head you're like why would that even be in my head it's it's entirely possible that whatever the fuck consciousness is can pass from this stage into another stage and the only reason why I would hesitate to say that's exactly what happens is because there's no proof one way or another but it's it's a funny old gland shit is not proven they don't that DMT comes yeah the cottonwood Research Foundation they did a series of tests with rats and they prove that live rats have DMT produced by the pineal gland no it doesn't necessarily mean that humans do too but they're pretty sure that did you like also know that your your lungs produce it and your liver produces that's a fact really yes so your body's producing DMT 100% did you know that um or did you like like those HP Lovecraft kind of horror stories I love those and there's a movie made out of one of us all about his PI Neal and he's taking Sun makes his pineal gland swell up which one is that movies that it stars the guy for me animator it's not that's not reanimate er I'm feeling it now I kind of remember what you're talking about I'll tell you that creepy the thing is he has a creep I still think creepy because I was totally worth doing but the thing that it's but you know whatever people say they meet entities right but I don't know if that shit is meeting entity but I'll tell you the thing that just sticks with me that I'm like how in the fuck is that Boswell is the shapes that you said I could say yeah I was well aware that they were a bit more than three-dimensional shapes and I it's so crazy to look at that and perceive it and I'm like how on earth could I perceive this shape and when I can't and you can't bring come back with it like you know what you know you see it though and some ones are like have you ever seen Alex Gray's aren't ya awesome no you haven't seen it no what is a pull up Alex gray he's a psychedelic artist I mean all this stuff is basically trying mean based art because sometimes no no no no no no he's brilliant his stuffs because his stuffs fuckin amazin of them but yeah he draws the covers for two albums there's a ton of them like that one that is DMT wow that is hardcore hardcore DMT when you do DMT you see that and you see that in a way where it's so much more spectacular than any use anything you never see normal consciousness is your body they're like are you look around yourself if you open your eyes here's what's crazy because you so if you close your eyes it's like they're open somewhere and then we open your eyes you see reality overlaid over there's only this Russian influence the Egyptians click on the one your cursors on no I tell me that didn't influence the Egyptians what this painting or these kind of trip yeah there was one of the things that John Anthony West did was he was going over man the temple in man is one of the structures it's in in Egypt and it shows different parts of it are supposed to represent different quarters of the body like different chakras of the body and that there was some evidence that the Eye of Horus is really the pineal gland that's what that that symbol is like see if google pineal gland eye of horus they think that they're they're so similar in the way they're shaped it's entirely possible that that's what that's a very alternative thing but look how it looks how the thing looks on the right the actual pineal gland and look at the eye on the left well yeah see that wing off the side and the way it drops down right from the eyeball boy that's fucking similar it's entirely possible that they figured that out somewhere along the line that through yogic breathing methods or some sort of psychedelic drugs they found that they were achieving a hallucinogenic state and they were able to somehow another isolate where that state is being initiated and if it's being initiated endogenously by your body like through psychedelic breathing that's probably where it's being produced well this is but I don't want to sound like I'm a Schumer defender but that looked coincidental to me certain patterns we closed over and over again that but that pattern is pretty fucking close you might be right it might be coincidental but the fact that I drop a straight line drops down right before the I show it again the straight line drops down right below the on Egypt that's the thing they did they did surgery on people in Egypt first of all I thought Egypt thought them the mind was in the heart and that's why they pulled the useless brain out through the nose when they mummified you like they don't know their intent embalming techniques speckies Brian kept no they didn't look well I'm sure they didn't know everything about the human body the way they attach significance is something in the brain if they don't think that because I think through psychedelic drugs I think when they were doing these heavy psychedelic drugs which by the way we're absolutely being used by then by listen the cuz dude this is the thing we're really blue and white cuz I was look you don't want to even believe rumors that's what's going on again no I saw look you look at somebody while you're no I've always kept my eyes closed okay well two times closed my eyes and what time oh my eyes and look at somebody and they had six arms like a Hindu yeah somebody was just she was just saying tell you this at those who told me at the the great room what is it your time perception gets broken down and that's the craziness and so then motion looks like sick like Shiva look like a Hindu thing I imagine being on that stuff and you see some I mean it look that looked to me so much like a vision from the MT those six arm kind of godless dude I collect that kind of art like Buddha's and shit like that like this kind of shit because I saw this I saw this image this exact image mean this has a third eye and everything I hoped her made this for me I don't remember really name yeah I wish I could remember right now but it don't but yeah sculptor made that for me based on this vision that I had a high on DMT I saw an infinite number of those real I saw one hovering here and then in every direction out from him there was an infinite number of those and they were all hovering and vibrating around me so with a crackle is it like froze 100% frac wouldn't use geometric what do you think having done it like what do you think like what do you think now of DMT but after look you know I I think I saw just a couple things but I know how long ago they were of you talking about with people but you have what's your opinion of it now I was like you know what you're seeing well it could be anything you know it definitely could be some sort of an insane hijacking of your sensory nervous system produces this spectacular psychedelic effect that's so profound the solution to Jane a hallucinogenic effect that so profound that it literally is like a transcendent experience and changes your life its toll to me it's totally possible that it's just a chemical thing but also but that's also it's also possible is that life itself that whatever the fuck life is and especially whatever the fuck intelligent life is is not understood what consciousness is is not understood and the this idea that things can only exist in this realm that's not proven also the fact that when those quantum physicists guys start breaking down the nature of reality and they come up with I don't know how the fuck they do this I'm just talking about my ass but they come up with the idea that there's 11 dimensions right and that they literally I mean and this is all changing and constantly evolving and moving and they're constantly adding to this it is entirely possible that there's a bunch of other shit that's around us all the time that's just not here and we don't access to it and when you do DMT womp you go into that other place that's what's so fuckin unsettling dude it's like it's not like you're going it's like the shit's here well that's why you as a skeptic it's very important to hear from you like a guy yeah I'll tell you what uh because I drew a shitty diagram of it but this is what I felt this what feels like if you ever do it like this little point let's say this little point is you this what I felt like and these these lines I drew that's like space eye and you're this little point that gets stabbed into space-time and all this shit this is all the shit that makes you like it forms a point it's like closing your eyes and looking at all of ya all of the ship is in cross-section and being like everything being focused into making if you could like just reverse look at it so you feel like it's lessons I always feel like it's lessons I always feel all right time to go to school sit down sit down here's what's going on but one of the last ones more profound once was a bunch of gestures that were all giving me the finger really they're all circle around me like give me the finger like who knows you're winners negatively gesture giving you the finger like how do you feel of yourself are you in constant defensive mode and then when I sort of relaxed myself they started wagging their finger back and forth like yep that's it that's it that's good very very strange the the the these things that you see but you can't define are constantly changing so if you try to like say oh it looked like a gesture we did for a few seconds few seconds it looked like a gesture and then it imploded and became stars and then it sucked in and became geometric patterns and it became neon colored worms that were making love to each other in a giant infinite bundle of yarn like it becomes weirder and weirder shit all the time so hard to remember when you're done it's almost impossible even me saying I remember having bullshit because I don't totally remember what I saw I remember what I remember to write down I remember what I repeated so I'm like going back on like my repeated versions of what I saw but I just remember like flashes of the intense profound nature of the experience is there a motion to it like doing and when I came out of her the first time but this is on new years the first time I did it and I and I fucking I guess I was like weeping but when I came out of it cuz you just suddenly are awake and I I had like but I was so out of it it was like not I went from weeping like oh hey what's up like and cuz I've been staring some crazy thing that would like look so beautiful to me but but it was like that it was like coming off a dream I guess most one kind of quote that I think what I'd be scared of is unearned wisdom I think McKenna said someone be care like be wary of unearned wisdom where I don't know if I can handle looking at something that intense I was really in a low feeling state way I did it and I didn't give a fuck so I wanted to do it you pick up the slack you know I'm that unerring wisdom thing I think I know what he's saying and I think there's a real problem with people acting profound when they just learned something an hour ago saying I'm not a shaman is a thing that people enjoy doing and it's like like jizzing out their knowledge yeah and a lot of that is honored knowledge like there's a lot of people that don't really have a full and including me my balls are so full not having a full understanding of the topic at hand life just jizz it out but you look for sure you learn a lot about yourself when you do those experiences I learned a lot about myself learned a lot about how I interact with people I saw negative thoughts like expressed as like this dark green and black did sort of pattern and then when my thoughts went positive it blossomed like the most beautiful flowers you can go it was crazy it was a really a lesson in thinking toxically and then and this is probably like mm a dish somewhere around then that what that was this particular experience that literally changed Who I am literally changed how I talked to people literally change how I feel about people and watching a negative thought being expressed as this dark pattern and then the positive thought just I just let it go like oh I see I see I'm doing it to myself then BOOM right yeah and then you just relax and enjoy this is so beautiful and because you're looking at something so beautiful that feeling of seeing beauty makes it more beautiful and just getting more and my tears rolling down my eyes I'm just a stunning stunning experience how does a guy it's easy to do that now besides that but I I know what you mean I wish I could remember seeing no I remember it happened and I remember the dark green and black but it's so I remember so little of what I actually saw it's a total recreation in my mind yeah which is a real problem with memory it's a real problem with regular memory forget about something a spectacularly unique and odd as a psychedelic experience but just regular memory I mean I try to think of what I did yesterday I know what I did you ever get the information like the last time I did it this one really blew me away is cuz like over saying I was going I won't forget and by the way I forgot immediately it's like a joke I'm supposed to talk into a microphone like talk into a recorder like right away when you get out and then try to decipher that little sound like I can't talk I mean energy I feel like I can't talk as soon as you can though what you do is just use the voice app on your phone and as soon as you can talk hit record and just ramble first of all you're gonna go oh my god I'm a fucking moron because now if you're super stupid I feel like ayahuasca is an inner journey and better like yeah on the inside on the outside you're just puking and projectile shit yeah gibbering like an idiot that's a metaphor for Twitter would you like that shit like not being on fucking social media the the level because at one point I was I remember I would read like salon.com to fucking be annoyed I didn't notice it like doing on purpose you see you know I didn't realize how much I was like am I like it it's like a conflict addiction and it's it becomes like some weird Russia people get your are no masochism yeah no it's just a fucking thing of if you have a manic kind of personality it's easy to cortisol it's why I guess is why you to share you share this you you overcome this he's in the grips of it he's in the grips of doing battle every day puts on his fucking she goes I can't believe I mean the amount of energy but who gives a shit way baseless he has you you've had issues with it like what you and I talking about it where you like you'd get in these Twitter beefs and you wouldn't be able to sleep that's cortisol it's the same thing that a Dixie at at gambling is actually losing dude I don't yeah I can't that's not a smart thing to do with your time I can't see why that would be good for you I know you think like he's come up with material sometimes with battle and out with people do it show me how to like this yeah would show you like use Twitter to represent who you are it's just fucking hard to represent who you are it's hard in print its various yesterday because my tone is so key with jokes yes and most people don't it's not like your copywriting jokes going on there it's I promote where I'm gonna be make people fucking buy a ticket if they want to hear you look inside the angry dude I can't believe an idiot I was coming strong come on I thought it was like I was working I remember IX would be like we fucking get off fucking Facebook I'm like this is my job okay Wow like in my head that's like productive and sometimes I do write with it down like like I go through my Twitter and just be like okay what it is not copyrighted just so you know and also yeah also you just given people become accustomed see all this inside baseball shit they did with stand-up is making cities like you never heard that inside baseball the insiders terms no what do you mean I was working on a pilot like oh we need more inside baseball on yeah like it's like like Pete Holmes a show on HBO is about being a stand-up so it's like an insider's right right like that's how its put out all right which I'm against this showing the processed shit everybody does and that's why I would do on I looked at Facebook almost like a dot like I'm showing you I go very clearly nine out of ten of these will suck okay not be worth reading at all and one in ten I'll be funny maybe but you're not paying me for this so I'm just allowing you to see my process you know what I mean I'm thinking like it's a diary but you don't put your diary oh like Anne Frank even had to be dead for a diary to come out you can't just heavier shit up like that and I'm giving it away for free and then people are entitled to it and how these little shitheads our little entitled foodies so you're like how is this nothing writing about Dave Chappelle's hour that it's ho-hum because I was reading some dickhead rain by Chappelle no like where do you get the balls it's because they're they're being made to feel like an insider the same as Trump is like an everyman fucking dipshit you know Joe Joe fucking bag of doughnuts like Dom Eric oh that guy's like your guy like me to talk good finally everybody's about that now they're they hate like an elite or expert people we went on several let's let's bring it back to the people that are writing so these people that are writing these things a lot of them and they're in their 20s and we would all have done the same thing the exact same thing when you're in your 20s you're 20 that's right you thought just like that writer hold on when you were a writer and you you know if you were writing a blog for some sort of online publication and you decided to take an angle you know this Dave Chapelle special is not that big a deal and then just go run with that you would probably do the exact fucking same thing there's a lot of people who do that well know fathers review I told you I'm a sucker so I would review it and say what I thought about the hour right so that's not what's done and I know for a fact that's not how these people do it if you talk to them they go I got to say I don't like somebody's because I like their political reason right yeah I know it's insane it's not nothing is based on funny I mean it was always like that but now there's an added element of not funny there's a whole lala land section of it there's a whole section where up is down and right is left and whatever the fuck you say becomes doctrine well people like to make Dane Cook a punchline that I haven't and half the people that would do that I haven't they haven't made me laugh even a little as much as the in cook so I'm sorry shot it's a free shot it's like carrot top people who take a free shot at carrot top I don't even see these fucking punk Millennials now doing the work of it's like those props yeah carrot top is a funny guy he's funny like he's a good comic like you'd go see a show it's a silly funny show but it has punchlines and people think they literally there's a new kind of comedy that doesn't have set a punch beside a punchline is not only its poster but it is not a building block of the universe everything is modern comedy well you know what it is it's we just aren't good at it right that's the new way every shooting activist by the way will tell you they're a comedian but here's the thing every single one if they like that style and they go it's like it's like someone saying to a jazz guitarist dude you you can't play for shit because you can't play like Hendrix right you know but they don't want to because I don't appreciate music or whatever how I should appreciate it I totally get that but I don't think I could just walk in play guitar it's just a honor though because the whole thing is according to me it's all the lowercase I generation like right out of Apple products well there's also an applied snobbishness where the people that are not doing the punchlines feel like what they're doing is somehow another better than someone does classic setup punchline sort of joke writing that's ridiculous it's ridiculous cuz it's not better or worse and you know you don't get brownie points just because you're eclectic or just because because you didn't know your alternative shit was old Steve Martin bits well Dennis Miller this work it's really funny like Dennis Miller Dennis Miller was super alt in a lot of ways he would be telling these setup punchlines about shit that you definitely didn't know what the fuck he was talking about and you would laugh anyway because you didn't want to be thought of as stupid there was a bunch of people that laughed at Dennis Miller's jokes they didn't have a fucking clue as to what he was saying Mark Twain cancer no that is Mark Twain wrote a whole book is a joke which book was that I can't remember I remember this but I remember was like having everybody review it and stuff like it was real and he was just laughing his ass off I mean if you write the book it's a joke at that point it just sounds like it's almost like you bang a guy's a joke he wrote it as a satire people took it as fact yeah it's a postmodern comedy I was one my first jokes in college is I knock knock who's there pineapple who are you to say what funny is Oh God because it's true it's like a dot you know like a painting it's like childhood proudly util is if you paid to see me you can determine if I did my job or not well you have your take on it and people have their take on it but like there's certain guys that you know they're just funny right and you could you'd say like someone's saying okay like perfect example setup punchline Mitch Hedberg if you say that's not funny fuck you just fuck you right okay because he's clever it's setup it's weird it's not raisins outside of the when people tell you someone who's funny and they say they aren't funny or vice versa and it's because they're judging for things have nothing to do with the material or the fun right like I feel it'll say like I don't like a guy sounds jewy I had a fear that's a fair critique you know or but that's the case with music - right like you might not like Bob Dylan's voice like oh I don't want to hear it and that's a legit concern that's a legit concern no issues comedies not just what you're saying it's how you're saying it's how it sounds people destroy this is what I'm saying like if you don't like somebody's fucking comment it's fine but they don't know it bands though there's groups now that need to destroy they're like but I can't trust for you to enjoy it because I don't know how you know people want to take a but how is it different than shitting on people who like Nickelback don't shit on people like Nickelback well you're a beautiful person well it's cool it's like we just decide that's absolutely I feel like I just but I was pretending to enjoy the show you see people writing show I'm like are you bragging that you are that week of a person that you were just going with a crowd and like a thing you didn't enjoy to try and hurt your feelings and I think you know that as well as I do I'm just reading what it's not so much you're arguing with a nonsense person that's why these arguments of people that are my point I don't say I read the shaking government nothing like I save it for the Rogen show but beautiful way to go bring it to the Rogen show that's always a good move I love it it's you know it's fun as long as you don't get too caught up in it but the reality is if like I had a friend who got into something online and it went sideways and my advice was okay you you know what happens when it goes sideways right so if there's a situation where you feel like it's going sideways and a bunch of people gonna attack you for no reason step away just step away because if you engage you are essentially trusting your emotional state to a bunch of people that have no concern for your well-being like they want to attack you and hurt your feelings you're not gonna like plead it down to like well it's mildly upset with you though they have this idea and you are the target and you as a person who's in the public eye as a celebrity you know this person is you your thought of as someone who already has like some extra privilege your thought of as someone who's always right already stealing something from the rest of ya you already get some easy free ride because of your talent or your notoriety or whatever the fuck it is so they feel like there's extra license to fuck with you yeah I've been guilty that too or I feel like someone's so big and powerful like Jess I'm not talking about sure though I'd like to see him is successful now in my mind I'm like he is not even engaging with a person it's like I don't know I want you to send all your tweets to me first before you tweet 571 this is a delay you send them to me thumbs down no more tweeting just text I used to just send shit to Barry Crimmins directly for a while oh that's hilarious power of attorney like only he has my password I'm not listen we're friends I don't want your password but I do want you to send all your tweets to me first we should seriously try that I'd be so fun Barry because Barry was responsible for the environment I came up in yeah I came up in Boston Barry Crimmins that's right he didn't just create it he set a tone he said a no hacks good writing no thieves he set a tone and that tone was fucking rock-solid yeah right and they were all these big fucking men like Lenny Clarke is a big guy Kevin Knox was a big guy there were manly men they weren't like these neat like nerdy type skinny little comedians there were fucking savages they did coke and they were punching each other all the time they never played these fucking guys were animals and Barry Crimmins started the whole thing off he was so good and so smart and so well-read and so aware of what's going on the world he set a tone for the entire and everyone's scared of him I was terrified of him yeah and that guy started reaching out to me and we became friends online it was like way after I had already been on television everything I was so happy right I was like Barry Crimmins likes me yes it's like I think you're one of the good guys and I think you're a hero and to me it was like that was the dawn of comedy he did the fucking main guy that started it off yeah do you have that with people I felt that way when you wrote to me man oh that's not yeah Barry's like terrifying yeah he was terrified well he was so simply and so he was so well-versed in politics what was going on right he dared not bring up Guatemala or Nicaragua around him don't talk about the consciousness he was like the last progressive he was a left-wing dude right buddy please say there's no because America doesn't have that we have just reactionaries and that is what America is it's all reactionaries a masculine progressive right Matt he was a masculine progressive like an aggressive fuck you masculine progressive guy was anti-racist and anti-sexual harassment anti obviously anti sex abuse because it went happen to him to protect her he would go onstage and he would have like a fucking like a professor's jacket on he'd have reach into it and pull out a Budweiser every time he had a Budweiser in his pocket that was like half a stick right drank American beer and he put that shit right on the counter like right in front of you it was like half of like what he did was he was this guy that was sick of all this fucking nonsense around him and you know he had like this real clear intention of like this is what's gonna be tolerated and this ended his actors like that too and you'd go to watch him you'd you would literally like he was so powerful that you would change like you're politically yes if you were anyway I don't mind anybody's beliefs if they're like well thought out if you know so much of a trend of terrain to something and yeah if you and and it's it's disgusting to you and I'm like Aish like when you said that privilege thing you're talking about like where people are taking an acknowledgement privilege did anybody read I'll go read your scriptures when you tell me about these ideas so the privilege checklist have you ever read that the peggy mcintosh privilege was who's peggy mcintosh the one that kicked off this fucking amazing privilege concept of white privilege and he's no better based on her ideas on male privilege oh yeah what it's called the unpacking the invisible white privilege knapsack I love when they say unpacking I can unpack that for you first of all the first point privileges are called a knapsack that's top one but it's clearly just this rich college lady's privileges that she just sighs white privilege unpacking invisible backpack please go go and educate yourself look at hold on hold on please through the work to bring materials from women's studies into the rest of the curriculum I have often noticed men's unwillingness to grant that they are over privileged even though they may grant that women are disadvantaged I think she hates women in a way well this is a weird thing like no do you see that see this is a thing that's very important this kind of person thinks that your rights are fucking privileges okay so most of the list is going to be things that are your basic human right and that if let's say you're not getting because you're not white you should be getting that it's not that I shouldn't be able to move into a neighborhood I want it's that you should be able to also but they're framing it as right no you have undue privilege needs to be taken away like these are my stewarded way of looking at an actual problem the actual problem is real racism the actual problem is real sexism but instead of looking at that look at the people that are lucky that they're not discriminated against it's a real calling them somehow or another that there's somehow no perpetrators yeah it's a real fat check way of looking at life everything it's just a real young shitty young way to look at the world as long as you're not happy it's that well there's a great quote that socialists don't love the poor they hate the rich that's a good quote and it's also it's also a while some people I look berry to me was a sincere dude yeah I know and he didn't he would give you the shirt that's the other thing of that seems very would not really have a lot money cause he'd be paying into the comics he really was a guy it was generous generous generous guy you know in legitimate ly legitimately generous with his his adoration generous with the way promoted of the comics the way generous we help people but generous like you know what he did for that seemed unreal he made that scene I mean everybody will admit that there was a lot of great comics back then I mean there's Steven Wright of course there was a lot of great guy Don Gavin who's at one of the all-time my all-time greatest there was all these great guys that were in that area but this guy had something special and he was by far the most well read out of all I and I think like abused kids I have two roads you either like want other people to hurt or you want to protect people Yeah right and I think that like sometimes early trauma can make you like just so protective of the week where it's like when you hate when someone takes advantage of vulnerability Mary which is pretty had principle it's like somebody have a fucking principle the Jamie kill Steen thing I had people write write and shit this is like right around the time Mike ceased all Facebook it's because people like well I guess you're happy Jamie I'm like why would I be happy right all right do you think there's it's like I wouldn't wish that shit on anybody yeah fuck me bullshit me from killing myself Barry Clarence here to talk me down oh I do the shit that I had coming down me you can't even believe okay and what I'm not I'm not fucking getting into all the particulars ever again with people that publicly but uh let's if I say Barry fucking say my fucking the light he saved you with perspective he gave you a better perspective yeah I'm lucky I talked to him I am because I was in a fucking bad and it dude when you're ready to do it it's like this is my this is my ignorance because I thought that you were brushing it off like nothing operate dude you can't even asked about it I heard you talking to podcast well when I don't remember it was a long time ago a long time ways that I couldn't even believe okay and he was becoming maddening and then it was becoming like it's just crazy dude right and uh you know I still can't get I had to go for booking me I'd be tickle I have an agent I don't know where they went but it was like I was off the fucking uh I said no nothing I'd no work I had a job lined up that supposed to get that I fucking couldn't they yeah I mean I would have just really taken it to work for Shia anyway because I like Mike chadway I was cry couldn't believe the amount of shit for something I don't think is controversial but it doesn't matter once it's a slow day and somebody picks up and grabs it I can't believe it's a soft target someone would bring a me into it I can't believe that so first they did why do you say that that's ridiculous because for her well I didn't know there was no show by the show while the show was going on you work for and the show was done but you hadn't announced that stop but stop but it just happened show just ended so all that time before then you were writing for you know why they would connect you to her it's crazy to think you don't what I don't get is why that would be no no I get why these fucking social jihadis do it I don't get why normal people validate it ever north people it's outrageous to normal people what do you mean okay anybody fucking a kennel yes this needs to be addressed Amy will you please take the floor and address this adult man that's not your child I think they have to do that because she's thought of as a feminist and she's thought of as a powerful woman well that's a guy working for her I'm in the time that's what the differences because J we talk about a J cuz he's like I never get in any she's like I was in um now I'm in the jurisdiction of them because unless you're on that show these fucking people in this religion well it's like they believe that's they're like you serve at our pleasure okay and they and they get validated whenever someone and all these fucking dipshit liberals okay because I'm a liberal did I all right I don't know if I'm like the last of a fucking whatever but they all just pandered they're like well it's for the best you know your brother just you're not yeah there's a lot of people that are liberals or feel the exact same way they don't feel like they're really liberals anymore because of the far left has taken over like this space of what you can and can't say to the point where you're like really on the outs yeah I'm not one of those I don't get how they don't see Trump as their guy like that part baffles me like how do you even like just the stench be just based on these small hands and pettiness and like well I think it's hilarious that they she's president they tell you not to body shame yeah it's one of the most ridiculous body shavings ever because they're not even that small I mean they're not like outrageously small hands so like when they say it over and over again just to fuck with them with more clearly body shaming it's not like you if you make in front of his hair that's an obvious joke right you can't ignore it but the hands like you're really going after him if you're making fun of his hand even like if the hypocrisy was like if you seem like why scene it's like all these people were his best pal oh yeah he's like God and then he was like am I supposed to fall for this puppet like I'm sorry punch beat Judy this time people crying but like do you fault you tried pro wrestling this is couldn't be more they don't care though it's about power that's the thing that I had I had to figure out where it's like you can prove a contradiction and be like Meryl Streep just called him Godwin don't you do that you you engage with people online like crazy you go after people online and insult them like crazy you just did it we got started though do if you feel like you want to or blinds you yeah somebody blocks you on Twitter that's not an assault on you but you just go fight and have enough information stink but think about what you're saying people shouldn't do and then think about what you do and they're very similar right you can take his work or say he's a bad comic you can't be above it and in it that's just bottom line yeah it's the same thing everybody is just fucking attacking everybody like social war like cannibalism going on there they allowed to speak to me I did that just came out like you can't look they went after fucking Bruno Mars cultural appropriation Bruno Mars like was the coldest procreation because they're saying he's incorporating black music he's half Filipino so we should that the biggest videos and Omar attacking Bruno Mars for cultural appropriation and a bunch of black artists are defending him like what in the fuck the whole thing is so ridiculous it's not he's a brown guy getting that dude it's a new thing he's not brown enough he's not dark enough not from Africa whatever the fuck it is if you do you can't be liberal enough we're gonna get to like one state where some gender-fluid transgender like half black am Aphrodite but they're not left-handed you know a guy brought him I had on race Wars it was like very funny and got on the show and like he had the worst philosophy I heard on gnomes podcast I don't know how the cellar is like some white male Club and it's not diverse you know like if I had a riding in cars or comics it would be very diverse cuz that's just who you hang out with I think that dude just talks a lot he says it doesn't make any sense he went after me and who the fuck he was seemed very nice conversation totally out of context we were talking about how many when kids get molested how many of those kids become molesters and we were trying to figure out like that is a real thing that does happen also where you get ingrained somehow or another into homosexual being aroused homosexual right guys and his dream guy isn't having a uh what would he call it corruption a boner a boyfriend no there's people good like it's not the same as like we're talking about like young people with young people are going through their development if they get you lasted it is entirely possible or 300 but not even molested if they just have a sexual experience with a guy yeah that's right maybe if you need to shape somebody's entire fucking shape it's put it out that he set a bunch of tweets about like us wondering like two straight guys wondering how many gay guys became gay because they got fucked when they were kids like well that's not what we said but that is a study that's a we're not I printed that I copy and pasted the URL first an actual study on that like how many times people are molested and they wind up becoming homosexual or becoming a molester them so I don't know those are two real distinct possibilities when you completely disrupt a child sexual cycle who's saying it's bad or they're not me gonna just to get play off of your it's exactly because there's something that happens to people when they get sexually molested and most of it's really bad and hyper sexuality is another one people become very sexual there's a lot of weird so we weren't in any way saying that gay people are only gay because of that scientists yeah about that it's just get his name attached years to get it some new ID the celery thing I mean I gladly would have them on my body that makes me it makes me more careful with what I say though yeah I think that's the good thing about it so to leave I'm in the past have been way more careless with how I say thanks to think that it wouldn't be misconstrued especially a lot not weaponized well dude apologies are not to the people that hate you because they want you dead in there it's for people that like you or that don't understand that's what you apologize for the people are against you or get they're not comedy fans or learning to write so through this whole dark journey that you went on with all this bullshit you did learn that though so it's very valuable yeah no dudes Barry Barry's very helpful to me I know not just America but you going through all this and coming out on the other side the experience of doing it yeah dude made a lot of things that I kinda was told earlier that never made sense to me make a lot of slake about membership last night only out Patrice shit he said to me that I didn't understand of like kind of magnitude of what he was saying to me until then how so look what kind of stuff just about what a devil business this is and how easy to get fooled into the like brass ring it makes you a coward well they give you stuff to let you know that that's true that's the thing I think that's less the case now and this is my case I think because of the Internet I think comics essentially have created a network of each other yeah this is likely right think of the network of race Wars or skeptic tank our Joey Diaz is Churchill now we were all in a network together dude I learned that the main thing is that cuz I only really got work in his business of comics it was not the industry for us now which is really important more so than ever this is a noun thing yeah the network is a organic network instead of someone owning you or having a contract with you great they let go Owens fucking funny yeah like go see him Oh Gertz hilarious go see him you know make us like and so then people listen to your podcast or the lesson your specialist guys fucking hilarious and we've told them the truth so many times that they believe and then the other thing about podcasts that I think is amazing and then just the Internet in general with comics today is it everybody supportive of each other what someone has a special coming out I see other people tweeting go check this out all the time great about that so it was re but these people you know ideally ever did that in the past so much shit that I feel like if I like somebody shit I kind of go out of my way too confident to like balance after it's like Bitcoin it's like decentralized currency now a little bit yeah it's a little bit and there's less of this golden ring so that golden ring is just fucking acting okay that's what it is it was not anything it's writing about acting it's just like writing the script so the complaints are casting complaints yes not stand-up complaint it's not our world man the problem is we fuck up when we go to that world wrong world is inappropriate shit said behind closed doors making each other laugh I'm not a teacher here just help the class we're we're in the green room doing mushrooms smoking pot drinking whiskey and then we go on stage and talk crazy shit this is our world a world is not the casting couch our world is nothing to do with auditions or this whole fucking acting like the way actors talk to each other and actors speak that's not our world no we're not me too in it we're not trying to come up with shit that's funny so the people laugh because we like that because I the last things Barry said to me cuz they want to take his special awful Louis sight which he wouldn't do because Barry is like a stand-up dude that wouldn't like you know go with the crowds trendy horseshit like he had principles but he's like I'm so sick of the untalented hijacking a very real trauma to a lot of people for their dumb career he's dead on about that it's people Hajj it's like do people cuz you know by the way the staff thought when they got one in five people are rapes okay or women are raped I think that's probably just the amount of men that are raped and women could be double that okay I think it's so prevalent just based on the people I know in my life okay that something happened - it's weird for something not to have happened to you did you see what Tim Dylan wrote about all this after the whole Louis thing when no Tim Dylan wrote a brilliant piece I think he wrote it on Facebook but then he put it on Instagram and broke it up into pages so you could keep turning through it but he's explaining how this is an opportunity for truly mediocre talent to chop down someone who was head and shoulders far better than that of course they do so by claiming the moral hard ground by virtue signaling by like going after him in attacking him breaking down what he did or you could tell people's character by who wanted to get their little kick in because I was the same thing I watch happened to me wish I was but you know all my friends are my friends man I'm lucky like I'm not I lost respect for a lot of people during this whole thing and I'll tell you who they are soon as we shut this fucking show down 33-19 oh shit special you fuck yeah oh and Benjamin as long as you promise to believe Anthony Jeselnik Pianist dot-com it's called how dare me get it pianist like he plays a father it's my website huge pianist calm the name of it is uh how dare me shot in my town that I live in I got an hour cold white pressures and call me central I made a while
