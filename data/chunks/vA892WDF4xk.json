doo-doo-doo-doo that clock at all stop right we're live we're back to far to folks if you hated part one this one's gonna be worse worse worse worse fucking Oh fucking hate the show you know what my favorite isn't people go fucking shows change man you used to used to fucking be more open-minded yeah people change what do you want me to do man I've changed I changed over five years everyone changed you're not into fucking Legos and video games man I grew up I definitely don't think I'm less open-minded though I'm definitely less tolerant for stupid shit though I just think I've heard it too many times now I'm like stop stop it's not doing anybody any good stuff you cut out the bullshit well I cut out a conspiracy bullshit and religious bullshit it's like and it doesn't mean that I I don't know I'm not willing to consider people's points of view but certain certain things just at a certain point Tommy keep can't keep refreshing them shit me over and over again you know when it gets a certain point in time like for instance like like UFOs do I think the UFOs are real it's totally possible if we can put a satellite around the earth it's very possible that some advanced life-form can send a spaceship here from another galaxy have I seen anything that makes me believe that's actually helped prove no so when you don't share that opinion when you're absolutely convinced the government is hiding details and like okay what makes you really want to believe this because you're not saying this based on some hardcore shit like I know that if you take this plastic and you put it over fire oops did I fuck that up if you take this plastic how do I do that exit take this plastic but what the fuck you can't watch now Jesus Christ if you take this plastic and put it over fire right what they doing they're playing this again what are they doing here I didn't start this from the beginning did I no not the filler there ain't they're showing this fight again the old filler fight well we watched we already watched this fight we watched under the video was this on the prelims for the was it so I guess we watch this again can you do maybe I'm wrong is this a tournament it's not a toilet is is a tournament the heavyweight tournament oh that's right so this guy won yeah early he's the number one right and shake it oh shit look at that little dance below look at him go oh damn look at him he's feeling it good he's feeling it like he's training in the back awkward awkward yeah one of the music is dancing to white people and um II guess let me guess how bad the song is probably the worst song ever let's hear it what song is it I want to hear the song that I hear Quadros sounds like some rick ross really by the way when i called Quadro Skeletor I was just joking he does look like him a little bit but cultivate a spade I'm a little high I got goofy I'm not but he does look like Skeletor he's very knowledgeable though knows a lot of shit about kickboxing yeah a great man still looks like Skeletor how dare you oh dear here you get any problem 17 any problem I'd like some serious beef back in the day but yeah overall doesn't want to talk about it uh I shouldn't talking about I'll tell you afterwards is it legit beef though I swore shit it's all stupidity don't let it eat Oh stupidity no no no no not like that like not like I'll do that it was like gossip yeah I'll tell you I'm down for that you're definitely oh man hey people change people grow and they move on um speaking of growing and moving on what exactly in between the fight you got you might have mentioned something that you might wanted to yeah I'd rather come for me for especially on this platform than you're from anyone else things have just got too crazy man it's like the perfect storm and the UFC wanted me to sign the you know the license deal with Reebok and the random testing the vada test and where the fuck is and really I was just gonna write this out and you know I wanted to do one more fight but with the fighter and the kid how crazy it's becoming I never thought it'd become this and the live shows and now we're going on tour and I just this other gig I got this on a big network that I can't talk about til it's done and the merchandise and all this stuff it just I got to step away from the game and I guess step away from the UFC for right now you know what I love about fighting we were talking about this that you could just say I'm gonna retire and then you could say like in a week from now I'm unretired and then you look later you could say retired again yeah yeah you know you could go back and forth for sure but I think about Sugar Ray Leonard how many times does a coal miner retire usually once just one shit Raylan is no tired like a half a dozen fucking time I get it with fighters man but for me you know and I talked to my family and close friends and you were one of them and Kalin and you know my dad and going through it man it just do I want one more fuck yes man but it just it doesn't make sense III I can't see myself and when it comes down this I can't see myself in a fucking Reebok kit walking out to that octagon I can't see myself being like you know what cool man yeah yeah that's what I'm worth I'm worth 10 grand egos I'm gonna do this you know and I have other opportunities and everything I have and people think I'm this hater on the UFC or whatever I owe it to the UFC man I'll always be indebted to the UFC the people think I have a problem with Daniel I I definitely don't if Dana was in trouble and text me right now and said hey Schwab I wish you'd quit talking shit about Reebok or I need help you got it man but cool done I always be a supporter of the you see them whatever they need but for right now I got to take a step away and focus on this crazy freakin entertainment podcast career I got going on and I'm so blessed and that you you are and I think that there's there's moments like that where like necessity becomes the mother of invention like the necessity to figure out another way to generate income because the hundred thousand dollars you were making from sponsorships which is 100% real and legit and certified and authenticated proven that's a lot of goddamn money you're missing out on every time you would compete and so because of that it makes you concentrate and put even more effort into your podcast and into your merge set and then look how everything's going I mean it's it's insane how much money you guys are making and more important it's insane how many people you guys are entertaining and how many people you guys are reaching I mean it's insane when I did that live show the other night I dude I thought Kalin and never and our agent we're honey dicking me like this thing selling out and I got on stage with that Mike I was like oh oh man this is one minute did I love this yeah what this is insane man yeah now they want to do this tour and the things are selling out it'd be tough for me say no you know what let me go fight some monster who's been training full-time not telling dick jokes and you know I'm saying and selling fuckin brown shirts full-time let me go fight that guy I won't do the game a disservice you know I'm saying I want to do that so unless I could focus on it full-time there's just no way and in signing this Reebok deal it's not gonna happen man yeah I I completely understand where you're coming from and I completely understand the idea that if you're not a hundred percent focused on fighting it's just not something you should do I've always told people that fighting should be a singular pursuit I think it's unlike any other any other pursuit where if you're going to do it you have to make sure that all your eggs are in that one basket I really don't think you could have one foot in the game one front foot out of the game I think it's real dangerous to do that with fighting and not be good yeah because you're gonna fight some fucking guy who's all in and those all in those all in murderers they're out there those all in guys you know you went into a rumble Johnson who's all-in 100% man with no adop's and listen to me and people might beg to differ I feel like I've won man I you know I have no brain trauma that I know of and my body's in good shape I have this insane career right now with podcasting and live shows and this other gig I get going on with TV and I feel like I've won and honestly I owe it to the UFC man I'm indebted to him forever and um you know I'll always still watch every fight and who knows what happens in the future but for right now there's no way they could offer me anybody and there's no way there's no way I could put all this on Hold'em like yeah let me go take this fight well it would be hard because all this has been an investment in your time and it's also been paying off and it also is growing like considerably for people don't know like your numbers like I know where you guys were a year ago on two years ago and I know where you are now and it's it's this crazy exponential thing where every month it comes up and up and up and up and up and it's because it's good and you guys got a weird dynamic you know Kalen such a fucking goofball and you know it's like he's like a built-in joke all the time like you always say something ridiculous and you two together or funny like it's a funny group it's funny grouping it's interesting thing is what I'm doing listen man my two advisers are Joe Rogan and Bryan Callen what what the fuck I got the Mount Rushmore you um it's a guys who have have done shit who are saying for sure listen to me and not him no it's me right now real quick hey that's me being friendly to Callen alright let's maybe pretty town but the thing is some fucking goddamn horrible advice be selling use electronics fighting kid use electronics because challenge advising the second thing you want open a pawn store that's a different story but uh what store a pawn store a pond like a like like like a koi pond like a fucking one stars you know I'm saying o pawn yeah for real for reals wait a minute this is a warning idea here I thought you said a pond like you want to open up okay fine kids hockey's that's really uh it's a weird way of looking at things maybe people like pawns no you want to sell guys are going off dude oh my god blasted this fight is fucking crazy um but yeah so long story short I'm stepping away from the game man there's gonna be no Shabri bot kits out there I'm not finding one anytime soon did they ever make a strawberry ball kit could I get one like it's like a collector's item I think they did my kitchen week and then I came out and just talked all the shit like oh shit pull that shit down pull that shit right now did anybody buy one do you get any money from those I'll probably like 14 cents or some shit I don't know the deal but sure it's fuck not as much as selling my own shit you oh well no because then you get all exactly we just released shirts and I made I'm not yeah don't Wilma Barney I'm good I'm doing very good everything's nice there's no need to be struggling ah there's no instruction I sell more shirts than Reebok kids well here's the reality you guys what you've done is a real show it's a real show it's just like having a TV show and people don't think it's TV show because it's not on NBC or CBS or Fox but it's the same guy lb that's what we're filming new members you see that's what's the same no I can say that yeah that's all where you start sure November we have the director the production team that's what we're doing right naps those it's a it's a show like it's a like it's a successful entertainment vehicle that's what it is you know and that's what podcasts are and they don't they seem like they're horseshit and people used to make fun of them before you know Howard Stern before he got into that thing with Ari he made fun of podcasts when Adam Carolla came on his show it was like we are you are you hurting from Monday what's going on you know I'm Corolla owns a fucking giant warehouse he's got like 10 different podcasts running simultaneously so breaking it people are threatened by it right and also the thing with podcasting there's no there's no kind of standard to start upon yeah so if Joe Schmo would start when you can stone so there's a ton of them out there yeah there's some fucking awesome podcast but just like anything yeah there's a ton of shitty radius shows out there there's a ton of shitty TV out there yeah there's a bunch of good content out there man 100% there's some real good ones damn ass dude in the white he keeps landing those fucking leg kicks on this dude the other guy's name is willness too damn mutt will is willness on the right yeah basic ass basketball shorts he said fuck it huh he didn't get the Reebok Cassie give me those eighth grade basketball guys are kicking the shit out of each other's legs straight up it's hurting my legs just watching this Oh boom Oh uppercut huge left hook this is a good fight man because I but they're standing right in front of each other's it MMA fight for sure someone being half guard right now that yeah which I prefer you know it's weird right that they it's MMA really is the perfect sport because as cool as this is to watch guys go off and stand and strike the reality is they're so open for takedowns it's not real it's not a real fight yeah it's not it's a difference it's almost like a snail's like flesh it is a fight but it's a kickboxing fight it's a fight fight wheels with with a with a set agenda like a fight fight some shits gonna go down we might go to the ground whatever that's also love to UFC three minutes as opposed to five minutes it's kind of interesting because it's easier to stand and strike like cardio-wise than it is to grapple and strike at the same time the only different difference is if we grapple I can get breaks maybe what if you fight in cane there's no breaks that's how canebrakes dudes true breaks you because it's gonna break some breaks though I did like that sit around when he's balls deep in your chin with your head edie your father you're fucked and he's like taking a second off things going back to beating your brains in ya Islander dos Santos taking tiny little breaks oh no he's taking years away from your life oh he's definitely judo Santas like huh not the same dude yeah you're batshit crazy thing that was same thing that he's the same dude after the fight with our duty oh I've heard I've heard I've heard a lot of things where you know came to have the great camp you didn't get there you know I've heard technically didn't get there girlie enough correct still got his ass word yeah so but but it this is cane man so I've heard a lot of things that went on there so I think they fight at sea level you know we're gonna see but to say that fight took years off Kane's life no I don't think so not like the same way Junior dos Santos cane did do you think do you have any reservations about them fighting in Brazil if I'm caning I'm like what the fuck the fuck's wrong with you fuck's wrong with you man Machamp how long are you know Bay the wolves but he's doing some drugs bitch Fabrizio is the champ though still be drug testing would be Brazilian drug testing it should be fine yeah he'll be fine that works for everybody I think Vitor Belfort its doctors responsible for some some of that over there yeah for sure he knows what he's doing don't get me started I fought in Brazil's huh what I don't feel good you have the truck exhaust pouring into my locker you'll be fine I swear to God no way swear on my life like no truck exhaust boring in your locker back up trucks where I fought in the trucks were backed up and on in the exhaust coming in my locker room my come on we're all sleepy and my coach goes bro bro wake the fuck up or what oh I'm there six hours early by the way here's wake up dude everyone and everyone's like down he's like it's the truck fumes I'm gonna get out of here so we have to go outside and warm up outside no true story that's crazy that's like getting drugs are weird man you're Brazil you think you'll get out nobody striking coach you're sucking fumes and from trucks terrible idea there's a lot of things that could have gone better in that situation but I didn't weird how life works out though it all leads to this yeah it is how weird how life works out well you know it doesn't always like some people are defeated by setbacks and some people use setbacks to move forward it's like we were talking about Ryan Bader he's a perfect example a couple years ago people right and Ryan Bader off it wasn't that long ago III agree 100% now listening I agree now looking at beats OS p beats facial you know looks fucking fantastic against Phil Davis looks fantastic against Rashad do you know fucked I'd be if I don't have this podcast and these live shows and shit right now I'd be in training camp being ready for apply some black beast on fucking fight pass black beast he called me on that's why I said it I was it anything knowledge it yeah hey bro for sure picky I can actually fight that be a fight that I would actually encourage you to probably take yeah me too I do it i grip this Jay Leno denim shirt right off right now and beat him up my god what he's a tough guy though he's a tough guy he's very tough he hits a friend you see they're all tough yeah not as tough as be sharp what do you think about um uh the the steep a Miocic Ben Rothwell fight that's a really good fight that's a great fight man that debt that's that's a tough one to call real it's a super tough one to call oh really really it's in Dublin that's whatever so that's whoever ste paisa beepings a motherfucker coming off the the mark hunt fight it depends with Rothwell we get you know I'm saying Roth was confident as fucking his toughest fuck he has ha hard you look at that you don't you know more than anybody but he look at that Brendan Vera fight he beat the shit out of Brendan Vera yeah with with me through that spinning back elbow first one ever landed by a heavyweight but the thing is is I brought them heat and then I come flying in they listen with that left hook which is whatever this is how stupid I was back then well now for me Ben Rothwell at what I argue with my manager Joe Silva like it's too easy man I need something else huh did you really like those two yeah I was like oh this is such an easy fight Wow so did you underestimate him 100% I thought he's this big slow guy just right before we go in the cage my coach Lisa her Bolin who heads muscle farm now TJ Dillashaw is coach Luke's amigos brawl this is not a fucking sprint let's drag his ass on the third round and submit them here's no Jiu Jitsu drags us on third round don't go crazy you got it go in there go in there spinning elbow wobbled fucking go crazy it clipped a good fucking idiot man I liked how he fought against over him do the over Mitrione yeah he's on the scare in heat man is getting guy with experience like that it's tough yeah he's scary dude well see man still likes to see basil motherfucker he's just got to be an incredible shape for Steve Baker steep a is so fit he's so fit and you know he gained a lot of confidence in the Junior dos Santos fight went five hard rounds dos Santos in a war it was a really close war and then he goes from that to beat the shit out of Mark Hunt I mean Steve pays on a roll right now this is the this is the only I think X Factor in this fight is Rothwell is so fucking tough and Rothwell has knocked out power which sube really doesn't yes he pays more of a he's a volume guy look at that look at that tsunami on TV with the rock just yet tsunami technology fake though innocent dog the shit is out San Andreas this is you this is you here we go this is your breathing all day Marina del Rey having a little party hey everything's gonna be fine oh my god why is the ground moving oh my god I'm in a condo don't worry this conduct is is waterproof look see this shit that's what I'm talking about that kind of shit look at that shit that kind of shit that kind of shit ain't nothing the world brought hate to tell your fuck to where you're at if everything comes we're all fucked come on man can I just I just hate on down the road nothing new I got it all planned out bro I got water saved up the water is at least you fucking problems got real issues man it's coming uh what we're toast EPA wrong yeah steep a roffels a hell of a fight man can't believe let's not the main event um yeah who is it Duffy and uh Duffy employees are great that's a great fight off the same East Joe Duffy's a fuck Duffy's up boxing's ridiculous he's a very I love my boxer good chaos bootie Conor McGregor admitted him he's got good kicking too he's got a really good over like a game a game he mixes things up well since a monster to me especially at that weight class mm-hmm yeah poor you lose what you saying I can't believe it defy I just can't believe steep eight was here ain't no two in the world can't get a main event is he number two now what's Kane's got to be number one what girls Unidos lentils are steep what Junior is injured right now is he no he's fight no he's fighting over him in December right but he was just coming off a surgery show and he did surgery but then see baby mark but JDS beat mark yeah but Junior beat Steve a in his last fight I think he's got to be number one outs up beside Kane I think Kane's got to be number one and then juniors got to be number two know it would make sense T pace three yeah and then our last keys for versus five there's some fucking weird weird shit with ratings yeah they just want to I don't know who the fuck does them yeah some other ratings real weird man sometimes guys beat guys in there below them in the ratings you like wait it's super weird I don't understand how they work who decides that's what I'm saying who the fuck decides yeah like you're Raya Hall here's a perfect example Uriah Hall wears Mousasi above your rile Hall yeah Raya Hall just jumps spinning back-kick Gegard Mousasi in the face flying need them in the face and then beat them down for a TKO so you tell me how the fuck is your Raya Hall number 10 and Gegard Mousasi is number 8 with all due respect and gay guards a great fighter and people like he's a better fighter no he's not though they fought and he lost I agree Uriah halls the better fighter you might look at Gegard Mousasi 'he's background say we'll know you got to see gay gar Mousasi he beat Jacare in japan he beat my years ago dan henderson you know he mean you look at his victories in the UFC and you go well he's got to be the guy but no fine Rio all fought him and beat him he should be above them in the rankings those rankings are crazy and a hundred percent those are crazy rankings like what the fuck do you have to do to move up in the rankings if you can't jump spinning back kick a guy in the face and then flying me a guy in the face by the way in the second round I agree yeah you lost the first round he got taken down and dominated but so did Anderson Silva when Anderson Silva fought shale son in the second time we gonna still rank Chael Sonnen above Anderson Silva after Anacin kneed him in the body and and and stopped him in the in the third fight I don't think the second fight right have a rhyme or reason to the breaking madness like remember when they're gonna pay guys base up their rank it was like what what that's fucking insane crazy cuz they'll up for debate right makes that I need to know my face a bunch of dude how's that that is one of the most big but go back to where it was please hey good good like that Lincoln the lightweights yeah but that is one of the worst ranking system situations I've ever seen when you win in a spectacular way like your Ayala justdid and you are not rewarded by moving up in the rankings that's that's the definition of insanity doesn't mean you should that's goofy as fuck man there's Jason Willis getting a little Vaseline let me see those light weight rankings good luck how the fuck you rank all those wants to see that okay number one who do we got here Pettis make sense to Cerrone makes sense no Magomedov three all make sense Eddie Alvarez four okay Eddie Alvarez only has one victory in the UFC though right that's tough so they're going based off his building Melendez he beat Melendez Michael Johnson hmm Michael Johnson's very high level right now he's looking real good dude he just did Michael Johnson just lose to somebody oh yeah he lost no he lost not but he actually beat him but he lost in a cultural decision to a homeboy from cows great striker oh yeah but kneeled are you sure are you sure where's their use in the ratings he's down at number 10 that's interesting so Michael Johnson is all the way up at number five and he lost tuba neil darish is number 10 hmm that is fucking interesting as shit but get fucking welterweight man that's a weird one because that's one where a lot of people thought that Michael John's got a raw deal yeah hundred percent I could drop most people he wasn't at all I'm a Dariush fan and I think he lost that fight I'm a dairy huge fan as well big fan he's bad motherfucker miles jury number nine I thought miles jury and moved to featherweight now isn't he did he move to featherweight isn't he fighting someone in the featherweight division his next one I thought so too hmm have you ever watches ink master this is a good show I have watched it seems weird to have contests on pot yeah I kind of dig it man permanent artwork on someone's body Eve Navarro though fucks sakes bro easy on the eye makeup huh I like him beautiful man you know what don't you around my family heard he has a hockey with Carmen Electra however if you got a chill out on my makeup bro if I'm gonna continue to watch the show ah let's see welterweight welterweight sour motherfucker here's the dark horse in the lightweight division no consignee motherfuckin Ferguson that's your dark horse right there Tony oh for sure any Ferguson's the dark whore first of all he's the hardest hitter in the entire division he's spooky too there's something spooky about him he's so game it's insane he's a bad motherfucker dude bro how do you have Kelvin ranked 15 didn't he did Kelvin Windows last fight at 185 and then they allowed him to fight at 170 again that's what happened right beat Nate that's really shit out of Nate that's right and they forced him out yeah that was the sad fight I did not enjoy that fight fucking terrible and Nate's still fighting anyways how about Hendricks how about your boy Hendricks yeah are they gonna make him fight a middleweight now he said he's not fighting middle he's gonna go one more time at 170 well how's he gonna do that because Dana White said I consider him a middleweight now I miss wait fucked everybody up fucked up Tyree tell a guy what wait to find out yeah especially Johny Hendricks well you can if you won't give them a fight at 170 because you've got such a talent rich vision I mean look at what you got down there welterweight look at this you got Rory MacDonald tyron woodley you got Hendrix then you go get these are stars in that round but people don't pay to see Hendrix like they pay to see like a George st. Pierre or like a they pay to see you know like some of the bigger stars in the UFC because a lot of people thought that Hendrix like in some of his victories like the matte Brown fight they thought that he wasn't that exciting truly I disagree I'll pay to see that guy any day the winner but I think he's fighting smart I agree I like that he uses his wrestler bro besides Robbie Lawler who's the most sane guy in the division it's pretty goddamn exciting he's been gone for a while but he's exactly it's fun but he just knocked out Thiago Alves with a nasty elbow Matt Brown is about as exciting as a fucking human being can get I'm saying exciting I'm saying a bigger name Johnny Hendrix both near those guys are bigger than n dicks Condit you can say but he's been gone for a while interest Hendricks is a big name bro he's a big name but I don't necessarily know how that translates to pay-per-view buys which at the end of the day is all thank you jack I'm just saying a guy like Johnny Hendrix what is he a two-time champion you can't say oh you have to fight at 185 if he's like no no I may all but you do if he doesn't make the weight more than once and he's already missed the weight twice he's missed weight twice and barely made it for one of the Lawlor but he came in way overweight for this - like six pounds with him come on yeah he was heavy as fuck meanwhile Joe Schilling is about to fucking throw down let's do that shell right now stitch Mook this is a big big fight and hit the guy he's fighting Jason bonus is a fucking beast wellness is nasty really really hard striker man your voice chilling flexing there I'm not mad at it either he's flexible body does pretty oak body dub this is a good one it's a good matchup yes I listed twenty four yeah twenty four and nasty dude he's real good man yeah that that welterweight division stuff yeah this tough house Hendrix do at 185 how's he match up 185 it's true I don't like it how's he Mikey you got you got to go to the champ you go to the top of the leash go down to middleweight for me Jamie whenever you do that you go to the top of the heap how does he match up with the champ bad I do not so good other than that I like good I like a please how does he match up with Luke Rockhold not so good how's he match up with Jacques alright not so good how does he match up with yo Romero not so well disagree Yoel Romero I think he beat you all Romero oh my fuck god are you crazy that that one hurts my feeling are you serious the over Mara was a monster was never been a UFC champ yeah he's bigger see what he did to lyoto machida his last fight I did he did fuck my monster he's a monster he's honeychurch's on monsters how dare you he is but it 170 Johnny Hendrix is 5/8 he's small he's 5/8 he's small yeah I mean when I stand next to him in the Octagon and I've shoes on I'm taller than him if I'm taller than you you can't fight your own Romero that's just how the rules are bro you and kelan and this height thing well no I'm sure about DC I'm short tiny fuckin dudes up but DC's big in a different way I don't think Hendricks is that big I think Hendricks just carries too much body fat I think Hendricks had 170 cuz 100% be the champ again I want two percent hundred percent sure figuring out Hendricks when he's on I mean you got a look at his knockouts of Martin Kampmann and John Fitch you fucking monster when he's on I mean you always have to look at a guy though based on his last fight that's the unfortunate thing about fighting they always say you're only as good as your last fight well his last fight I thought he fought pretty fucking good but then his fight that was supposed to be his last fight he didn't make the weight that's where the controversy lies the controversy lies is lack of discipline coming in a training camp have a heavy more than once I mean not learning his lesson when he came in super fit for the math.round fight looked great said he got a hold of his meal prep stuff to argue at this fight he came into camp ten pounds heavier than his last camp according to Dulce 10 pounds is a lot man he didn't work with Dulce for this capital right but Dulce knows what he came in at then when he came in at this camp versus what he came in at the last camp everybody knows it I mean he they've all admitted it he admitted it when he talked about when his camp went wrong he talked about it and then he got it gets probably that's this level man laughing and this level what the fuck we do might have an eating disorder you know we were talking earlier about being addicted to shit he might be addicted to eating and I might be addicted eating he is I am for his discipline the discipline of being a fighter you know might be so overwhelming that when he's not doing it he does a Gor loads so fuck up dude you don't get to his level that humming discipline I don't know what's going on their discipline and addiction sometimes our next door neighbor it's not that middleweight division here we go there so showing Jason willness here we go come on Shelley how'd you get nervous me friends fight fuck yes fuck yeah -

he's a different animal when he's kicked box he's confident he's confident it's a sport his defense is way better with those big gloves like super used to it can all spend risk more yep and he's not worried about being taken down so he could do his shit do I have to talk him into fighting only kickboxing yeah give me an hour with him look at this man goddamn he's looking good boom bang bang one two definitely like I like how he's throwing a straight right and then a hard jab behind it - you know like after that right hand like a lot of MMA fighters especially they'll pull back and then look for either another right hand or whatever he's stepping in hard with that jab okay what I don't like that Magness arena not very full come on well I don't think this for I don't think the sport gets the attention that it deserves you know as excited as you and I were for this fight in this card like to me this is like an opportunity to watch high-level fighting like whether or not it's MMA or a kickball I like like I think the ultimate sport is MMA it always will be the ultimate sport but when I want to watch the best expression of striking technique there's certain shit that you only see when you watch more time or you only see when you watch kickboxing and this is it right here like these kind of Duke it out battles true I don't get like don't get me wrong I fucking yeah I love me some glory kickboxing but I don't get as excited or crunk or or crunk for this as I do for like a main event in the UFC well it's a different kind of yeah excitement well I do because Joe is my friend and I support him but I feel you yeah but if you know if you're watching like the very best guys in the world go out in any discipline it's fun whether it's boxing you know you watch Manny Pacquiao vs. Mayweather it's still fun hell yeah dude wrestling yeah the top world you know that's where the best wrestling is even fun to watch but I think this is way better than boxing I really do I think this is Oh big left hand from Joe Schilling god damn dude he looks so fucking good tonight he is on it man he is all over it tonight he left hook I bet he comes in well he just looks so smooth everything looks smooth is defense everything he's not wasting anything is it no no he's fight it nice and find it very nice very light on his feet never standing stationary mixing shit up very well to him I like always like moving out and in well what like he lifts up for a front kick and then punches you in the face then he's out yeah you know what the fuck is going on what's a Rashad's blaze corner that I roan spawn yeah what's his deal on stir I know he's asking Dana White for a fight he wants money you know he's like I want to be paid what I deserve he's one of the best strikers on the planet earth hunters I said if I'm gonna fight in MMA because I want to be treated like I get treated in kickboxing and trying to give that basic ass contract they saying to a FICO the kik Colo or something like that I don't know what whether offering him I don't know what they're offering them I really have no idea he just needs the exposure are they gonna take a point away here what's going on low kick nope no back in all right definitely warning they won't walk you around say one point one point right when they take ya they live oh shit he rocked him again I feel like Schilling got Oh Jason walnuts throws hard shots dude oh fuck oh shit oh shit Schilling's holding on man he got cracked that was a big big big punch by willness oh my oh my god again bro for oh fuck he got hurt he got a really right hand willness is all over him he's got a cling I use that mm a grappler yeah he's got a claim he's got a claim he's clear the cobwebs right now gotta clear the cobwebs that's the scary thing about willness man's @ko power Joe gets that clench dude he got hurt bad he got her bad in this round I see a powerful Matt Brown in the crowd he does his camps there no does he yep at elevation yep is everybody gonna go to elevation that mussel farms come with that cash you think so we rampage is one of the first guys to go there right he did like he did like you can't he did a camp there when they first opened up but he didn't like oh we got hurt again damn wellness it's hard dude someone lost their mouthpiece out your boy isn't pretty sure it's a tight move though because you get a break that move outside of the road I don't think so I don't think it's the end around dude yes he can get that break Danny we lost that room yeah did he thought didn't he knock him down earlier in the round though no not really was the first round was it boom oh fuck is that this round yeah the very beginning yeah that's tough man that's better that knockdowns bigger because shilling was it yeah that's bigger yeah he was wobble -
