hello freak bitches in the heterosexual world what percentage of strip clubs in the United States are for men well there's a lot more research they're only open on you know yeah make your reservations and shit the fucking like it's a different experience like when girls go to see men strip they scream they scream and they throw money in the air they get crazy and they'll rub their face on the dudes dicks like girls at bachelorette parties they go fuck it why is it because they don't go as much like as often you know agreement they go off on bachelor parties in they're not they're not gonna say shit it's like what happens at the bachelorette party stays there right I had a friend of mine who I used to do Taekwondo with that was a male stripper two friends of mine actually one was his young Puerto Rican kid and the other one is older white dude and the older boy was a really nice guy I'm very smart guy but he was like over-the-top strange big jack was he shredded though Jack yeah black belt martial artist he was a big jack dude you know but he was telling me he was like these women they go fucking crazy like it gets real scratch and call my friends the girls who were getting married we just suck his dick and from their friends cut to the guys strip club two dudes by himself in the clubs was dead as fuck I worked those Saturday day ships yeah that shit we should open up 9/11 and there's one girl and no dudes [Music] and then one guy walks in boom he said he's just it's Saturday 115 and I'm sitting there playing the orgies I'll just pick up man you're so lucky I'm like but then you end up moving up and getting good shifts you just wait for the next chain yeah when you first get in you get the worst shifts Saturday day Monday day Saturday David or darkness that's really funny you know I had a memorize me I used to have a pretty serious hard drug problem to which of hard drugs yeah which I I done you know which ones a heroin and crack and oh damn dude gotten through it the needle or the smart starting smoking smoking no needles no needles yeah stayed away from that but you know made it through and how'd you get on that how'd I get on it yeah pain no pain no emotional suffering pain lost aimless wandering the world aimless not knowing what to do and that was this escape was the heroin somebody introduced me to it about that period in time and it just was like oh wow you know heroin has the great ability of and it's really seductive and really fucked up of making you think that your life is okay when you're in the gutter Wow it has that sort of that Sheen that it does kind of bubble it puts over you you can be literally living in a alleyway hi and heroin thinking and got it going on Wow yeah it's really weird and perverse like that and at that time in my life yeah I mean my dad just died and you know when he died what with it what went with it was kind of my life up until I was 22 up until that point like my life was in that bubble you know he was larger than life he was famous you know girls came with that work came with that a scene came with that friends came with that and when he died that just I want to bang you because you were Oh son of course yeah really nice yeah it worked out for a while sweet did you put on like a guru attitude like at that time that stage in my life and try to do that now though on occasion oh but no I had a good story Mintz is really funny like you were talking about soliciting the government for money for being an acid casualty which was a good idea but I was really high on crack once and just kind of on a bender just losing my mind on crack and I thought in the middle of the night it'd be a really good idea to join the CIA and that they would want me me specifically being linked in Larry's kid they didn't want me because I have access to shit that they want access to right like I can be an insight I was a mall high on crack and I downloaded I filled out the form oh my god I got that deep I got that deep I spent hours on it it's really long complicated though the whole kind of join the CIA printed out sent it and you sent it in the mail you're in the CIA they're with Anderson Cooper he worked for CNN what yeah you're in there and never heard back but it was never heard back maybe never said so laughs and they just laughed and threw in the car bitch I'm sure but it was really funny and kind of a great delusional high end drugs moment Wow so what did you think that you were gonna do like operative are we gonna do we gotta fix it from the inside with crack like you can't fuck them but you can't kill them yeah you can eat them but you can fuck them yeah so you can't do a dual-purpose you can't kill them fuck them then eat them because then you're fuckin a dead animal and that's gross but I think that might be legal I think it's more illegal to fuck a dead animal than a live animal that makes sense because what are you doing then you're really just masturbating because there's not a living thing in your presence it can't be rape if it's dead but you notice how there's like stages of like how you feel about the dead animal there's like one stage one is the live animal right if you fucking a live animal you crazy asshole what are you subjecting that animal to yeah Stage two you're fucking a dead animal like what is wrong with you like why why do you want to fuck this thing forget about whether you should be able to do it but if you kill it and then eat it right everybody's fine with that because that's like what you're supposed to do but you can't fuck its body but what if you just jerked off with a chicken cutlet yeah you've wrapped it on your dick and someone came in the room like what the fuck you doing Greg like dude I'm telling you it sounds crazy but it feels so good and I just clean it up and then I eat it yeah dinner takes a bite what's this nice cream sauce now do you say fucking a chicken cutlet it's all I can think about because he's slippery Bri it's it was soft when those GMO chickens who would wrap right around your heart hell yeah and it's a breast you're thinking about it being at your tip fucking it you know what you would do you would take a bag like a one of them zip-lock storage bags yeah chicken cutlet in the bag and then heat up some water to about 99 degrees and then you dunk the chicken cutlet in the water it heats up its butt you know like a body skin temperature and you just cover that bitch with KY yeah just lather it in there and then you put an oven mitt on wrap that cutlet around your shaft oh crimes against humanity never felt so good you're gonna eat it you're gonna cook that shit because you've tenderized it especially like you don't have to use inedible oil you could jerk off with a nice avocado well you you know al-baqarah oil has a high flash point oil to jerk off with yes because then after you're done as long as you don't come on your chicken oh you know you fall out that's gross you don't - come on your food but that way would be like really green yeah multiple uses I love it [Music]
