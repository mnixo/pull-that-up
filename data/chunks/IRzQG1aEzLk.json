we r IE give zero foxy at the joe rogan experience i was a fascinating thing that turns me kinda one said about a mushroom trip he asked a mushroom how could he possibly how could anyone possibly save the path that humans wrong and they said very simply and very easily each parent each each couple should reproduce once you know two people they have one kid everybody relaxes the whole the resources relax everything relaxes like there's plenty of fucking people okay there is ZERO worry that people are going to go extinct right but then the problem is how do you go to those people like those crazy people that were on that TV show that had 19 children none of those people first of all what she was she in labor for like three seconds I mean what it would have liked that one time this does he actually have sex with her or does he just jerk off into the abyss like how are those babies actually fertilized that that woman how could you tell that woman she can't do that I mean I think it's a freak show I think it's I think resources wise like I have three kids it's hard it's hard to give them all the time that they deserve you know and you know me and my wife have discussed that when it comes to the possibility of having more children i said i think we should really concentrate on raising the ones we have like they're they're fun and it's great I they need a lot of time like children need a lot of time and I enjoy giving them that time but I think that if you have another kid around everyone gets a little bit less time and I think in that getting less time there's some benefits the independence aspect of it as long as there's love and there's comfort but I also think you can teach kids a lot of shit you know and you could teach them a lot especially if you really are into it and you concentrate on it and you read a lot of books on it which I'm really involved in the idea of raising kids like I'm raising a little human being so the conversation that I have with them are all geared towards that like it's geared towards enlightening them as to the world and it's sort of guiding them is how to how to treat people how to be nice to be but I would be nice to your sister like be nice to the people don't don't get angry at things for no reason look at it this way instead of that way and I think that kind you know you may going to miss a lot of that when you have 15 16 k so you gonna like do you guys just shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up organized teams you you're responsible few little brother you're irresponsible rare and that's what those people did those people have like every kid has a chore and every kid that's how you raise zombies I mean these kids they're not gonna know what the fuck is going on the world like they're gonna need someone to help them every day is spent doing tasks and and your life is basically religion homeschooling and these tasks that's those kids that's the the 19 people what are they dug ins who is that what they call things that yeah see if you find that I mean look I ki I don't think you can tell those people not to do that I think this is America but the Americans got its faults but but they but think about it they only neutralized like eight gay couples neutralized when you will I mean like if it goes 18 kids you average it out like you got eight gay couples and who don't have any kids like or adopt a kid which takes it out of the other pool and you're you know mathematically you can have out layers like that uh-huh because there are lots of people like me you don't have kids right you know and just I mean I think the way to do it is to remove the stigma around not having kids and to encourage doing it what Helen Sarah heard he calls a low parenting and this gets back to the hall and together thing like kids are raised by everybody yeah you know they say you know two parents are better than one yeah that's true but you know what five parents are better than two right takes pressure off you right because you get frustrated you get tired you know their mother gets tired and it also it's enriching for the adult I love being around kids yeah for a couple hours you know right yeah no I know if I can fully you know we had a party at my house the other day and there was a gank for halloween there was a halloween party and there was a gang of kids over and it was fun was fun talking to other people's little kids and you know seeing how they're different and how they behave different they have different ideas about stuff and you know it's nothing wrong with that this is the the family the 19 folks that live at home together nice house stuff for 19th guy must be making some good bank be paying for all those heads maybe just loves to fuck it's all this religion stuff just to keep them all around just love sending it in 19 Kids seems a little excessive but and I don't always anal not for really religious people I think it's in the Bible do you know that that was sarah palin she said that sarah palin had a conversation with a librarian in Wasilla Alaska where she said that on the internet there was a photograph of a human footprint inside a dinosaur footprint and the woman like the woman like talked about this when Sarah Palin was running for president or vice-president whatever and she was like what pause the pots fuck like this is a woman that got that heartbeat away from being a president and she thought she thought that dinosaurs and humans walk together and then you see people who are intelligent you look at that apparently pull that down burn like claimed dinosaurs of people coexist amazing to say they're about the librarian yeah yeah whatever well and I think that um what's the other one um not Sarah Palin Michele Bachmann Michele Bachmann's worse well her husband's gay right his gay is gay as gay as gay as the day is beautiful and long and flowers smell pretty and butterflies are beautiful that guy's gay allegedly he can't suck enough dick there's no way if you could just just give him a free pass if you ever got that guy liquored up and put a hard-on in front of him he would jump on it like Greg Louganis off the top here he swan dive on that day his head would be spinning out of a gainer and he'd still get some tongue on the shaft he would automatically start salivating to the point where it was like a waterfall coming out of his mouth which is pouring down a shirt just live a long stream would know where the pool started any up saliva for dick it's coming out of his yeah it would literally be like a saliva waterfall and like one but not when people have a backyard and they have this really like like fancy little rock formations where the water comes down into their pool really fancy shmancy that was mouth yeah if he he would say to a young man do you want to go in the hot tub with me and the guy would go okay they get in the hot tub the guy we go there's no water in here and he'd go just way who me see your cock yeah warm and gooey it comes out 96 degrees I'd let him blow me if I knew that I could take down michelle bachman but take her down from what tho just it because she will be an elected leader Joe you really feel that I know so look you just have to see who Fox News is trotting out and she is one of the first pundits they go to for comments on shit she is introducing legislation in Congress right now that is actually being enacted so what's to stop her me I will suck her husband's neck and release it on eat on the internet I'll take the hit you
