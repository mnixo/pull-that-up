are you doing out here yeah I tried a few times over I'm here to meet you and it just gets a conversation going because they want to know I think when him was more his celebrity booth it's just like you're white what are you doing here right what are you doing some small town in Nowheresville did you feel threatened anywhere um any sort of threat indict this is good question any sort of like threatening I felt was just me um it wasn't real it was me looking at people that don't look like me and going oh I'm scared hmm you know there are others hmm and then you find out like like Myanmar is I mean 97% Buddhist Wow yeah it's a massive massive part of their their culture is that what you want first mm-hmm yeah why'd you pick that place best weather oh I I got my ticket day before so I

you set this up do you set up like bigger region a region yeah it kicked out between South America and Southeast Asia you just decided like that looks like a good time in a year yeah yeah exactly I would love to go to Europe fucking backpack around Europe but non-genuine ah January February that's not gonna enjoyable whenever I think of Europe I mean even though I've been to Europe and I love it I think of world war two movies yeah them having like the buckers and people freezing yeah you know I'm eating food out of cans here bombs go off in the background yeah dust coming in from the ceiling wait you know I was thinking the other day when I was looking at all this crazy shit that's been going on in England these terrorist attacks yeah and what happened in France and I was just thinking how long that section of the world has been in in turmoil actually always fighting always fight it yeah and then I was thinking like America is one of the only places where very little shit has gone down like little things have gone down there obviously big at the time like Pearl Harbor that's huge at the time but very few and then 9/11 and other than that it's like oh boy what else and then you look at Europe like holy shit dude there's a part of France that's the size of Paris that you can't go into because there's so many bombs there there's so much munitions from the world wars oh really so bad that they have like a area the size of pepper mines and stuff just musicians just fucking missiles and shit things that were flying in there that landed things things that blew off or uh all sorts of chemical wings oh dude it's toxic see if you could pull that up really yeah yeah it's an occasional it's I feel like it's outside at Normandy I forget where it is but there's a section of France that is literally the size of Paris that people can't go into for like a hundred thousand years oh yeah just because all this like chemical waste just because of all the waste from the bombs and all the different fucking missiles and rockets guns and shit dude it's crazy it's crazy Wow but obviously I don't have the facts in front of me until Jamie pulls it up and I'm my shitty memory but I know that this is a real place and I know that it's just leftover like wings of planes I think it's mostly like things they shot at each other and unexploded some of them unexploded some of them exploded like the waste from them oh yeah here it is all these fucking bombs at all on the cobblestone streets look at those things dude these are all bombs that didn't go off but that guys there yeah well that guy knows what he's doing imagine if it went off right next layer water water area it says found it contains certain toxic levels of arsenic that were 300 times above the tolerant tolerated amount and abnormally high lead levels were recorded in some animals particularly in the livers of hunted wild boars oh so they they buried it all I think it's just there man I think it did just have this area I don't think they buried looks like they put it under under mounds of dirt is that what's going on and it should grow does it say that no but those mounds look like that let's see what get up - oh cool freakin no-go zone of France forbidden no-man's land poisoned by war dude I mean look at that guy with the gas mask on that is awesome yeah it was it is a dope picture but I was reading and looking at the photo dude I've seen some tattoos recently people on Instagram that's one of the best things instagrams for that's tattoo artists there's some people that have done these super realistic photographed tattoos that are just flat-out fucking freaky they can do flat out free 3d tattoos I've seen those Wow incredible golly yeah dude tattoo artists like all artists I guess are just because of the inulin yeah and then there's taken things to another level because they're seeing the level of all these other people and like a guy in Germany can compare himself with a guy in Japan and a guy in America yeah like Jesus Christ god damn that looks like his skin is falling off yeah there's a lot of I was great really good to artists out there right now really good some hot chicks getting them - yeah like all over the place and guys love that I'm one of those guys you know why why because you know she's dangerous that's a reckless gal she's guys Johnny Depp tattooed on

there's a needed job the inside of the lip wants weird and like it's weird right freak it's that yeah it's out of the way sneaky freak I had my freakiness inside my face there's no virgins with tattoos well I'm sure there must be maybe I'm sure there must be but not really though it's not even unusual but you don't think what would it about asexual people don't believe in asexual people yeah definitely right you know I've been a couple yeah some people just don't want touch don't touch me Thanks it's not like they just are antisocial they just don't want to fight you know interested it yeah so what about them oh they yeah I don't think it ever happens what's that Wow stick to a like commit yeah pi√±on yeah exactly that's enough I didn't research it a hundred percent sure man Wow doubling down interesting I like how you do that you've raised your voice yeah there's something about movement have you seen this fucking video I don't know if you know what's going on in Evergreen college do you know where Evergreen colleges Evergreen State College when the North it's in Pacific Northwest this crazy shutdown I had this professor on the podcast because they the kids had asked him to not show up at school and not know white people sure no wife's day because yeah they wanted a day where whites didn't and he's like that is the opposite of inclusiveness like this is this is not what we're supposed to be doing so they kick him out right he's come out instead of saying no how about everybody day well this is what they did they didn't really kick him out what they did is they protested they yelled and screamed and he felt unsafe and he left the college and then the college got shut down oh really threats yeah people call it in they even played the threats on the air we made threats with who's already gone no other people called in let's write in the college yes yeah well because like right-wing people they call them a bunch of commies you know they left like a voicemail saying I was gonna come I'm gonna come down with my 45 Magnum no that's no too far yeah 44 Magnum maybe 44 specified the round which I thought was hilarious like the exact type of gun I have yeah I know just a game like but anyway the college professor got in trouble like talking to these kids they told him to put his hands away because he was gesturing with their hands there was they were yelling out that it's a microaggression and they got him they got him too put his hands down and then they started laughing at him oh dude these are laughing like your hands up fine see if you can find it Jamie was I think who's matter of crush I think I'm trying to figure maybe Brett Weinstein had it queued up on his um his Twitter page he's the professor that worked by the way is dead on it's just the connotative meaning now has become something super negative so my microaggression not even a small aggression when I grow it's like the smallest possible thing you can think of in terms of regression okay sure whatever but if you watch the video this guy's just moving his hands he's just talking like this and they like put your hands down your hands are aggressive let's do it and then they laugh at him when he complies they openly mocked him and laughs like we're fooling with you we made you turns into a cook they're little kids these are little kids you're you know when you talk to people who understand how brains develop one of the big things that they always say is the frontal lobe the frontal cortex doesn't really develop until you're like 25 it's not fully developed they're just I was in college I understand yeah we're not our we learned a few things we don't know how to put into play yet and so you just say it and that's by the way that's my theory and why would people send their kids away to college it's because they're fucking embarrassing and they don't want them anywhere near them while they're trying to grow into real people oh wow yeah they're learning stuff but they're like yeah we know everything do you think that oh yeah a little bit also they say for the experience of going away but like now it's like hey if I can be an awful developing thing away from me hmm go embarrass someone in Wisconsin interesting yeah here this NYU girls talking all the time I stand behind them and like listen oh yeah you know other conversations girls in boys you know mostly girls you creep I mean you know put out are you creeping sort of sure super into that but like but yeah they're just dumb they're dumb when you listen to them and you like you're just well-read and dumb well there's a lot of people that I mean are 18 years old you have a very intelligent conversation yeah sure so yeah and a lot of them and there's a lot of people were 18 who are basically 12 mm-hmm they're basically like a grown-up baby it's not their fault it's no one's fault you know just take some people longer to kind of get how to you know sort of factor all the aspects of life together and make it some sort of a manageable plan for yourself yeah live your life but the idea of those kids being able to run that that principle and run that the president of that school like that it's just hands down and laugh at him oh dude they laughed at him I've heard a few smart people going about Trump when people like small hands you know I know on the left will attack that would take all your small dick or your rash in here I so want I think I forget who commedia I used to open mics with and you know writer now forget who it was but um she was like don't say that don't take their tactics don't say looks are an important thing here yeah that's that's not we believe it so stop saying that not only that you're gonna shame the shit out of all those guys that are out there that actually have small yeah exactly excite her point was like don't don't just cuz you know that'll affect him you're doing the same thing the right does don't do that yeah he's not amazing know that that is what we decide to do as a collective group of humans to find the thing that you can mock about him physically uh-huh like his dick is little he's got a small hands look at her small hands and then these people in the audience and actually have small hands like fuck Trump's a big giant guy thank you like six two he's probably like your height Wow he's a big guy like he's a big imposing guy like if you see that's that was the one of the speculations about Jim Comey well that um James Comey that the Trump didn't like him because he was six foot eight Oh cuz he's huge James Comey is like this giant basketball player why dude you really yeah and he just towered over everybody including Trump Trump's like get rid of that fucking guy I'm sure it was more cuz much because he's investigating but that's more of shaming people like I do that uh tiny little man yeah both sides love go ahead yeah it's weird because you you're attacking something that's the person can't change at all yeah you know like what do you care if you're small look how big Comey is call me as a giant wow it works everybody oh my god is huge enormous not everyone you know you if I was Donald Trump and I was in this sort of aggro I would worry about Comey running for president really fuck yeah yeah watch house of cards son I know how this game is played the next moves Comey runs for president a bunch people they get in the room with him there's his bankers and this was one dude who's an internationally successful businessman but he keeps like a humble lifestyle in a normal house and he likes to bird hunt hey everybody watching at home right here is when Joe Rogan explained to me how it works in politics not back to the actual show yeah they do a little too much of that sometimes the camera they get away with it sometimes should I get what I want here's what I want I want Claire Barnes to do those every now and then it was Claire Barnes I Claire yeah his wife yeah yeah I want his wife to do it and find your voice no what's an essay Underwood the second time but I said the second time senator who the hell's Claire Barnes the reporter I've run out of space in my head together Claire Danes oh that's right Zoe Barnes that's who it is that's right Claire underwood I want to hear what she taught and what she says yeah she's not allowed why doesn't she look at the camera she's mysterious they had that it's directors cuts they show on we network network yeah it's all the women only women's points of view if your chromosomes before they let you watch it if you hold on to your remote test to make sure you're double X yeah no why no why we network does anybody watch that anymore chicks yeah I guess same people like homer nobody really watches either those though right nobody really watches somebody watches but what really dude go to Nebraska but like they watch it more than like and BC day DVR the shit out of it David said he was trying to write they were buying like dumb scripts for a Hallmark Channel and he said he'd watch they researched a bunch of them and he goes pretty much every one of the movies at work it's about a pet a family reunion or a holiday so he had a lost my dog at Christmastime movie the hero started hitting on this he's like a philologist uh it's hilarious ya don't remember that billboard across the street from the store was always the Hallmark Channel yeah forever - what my favorite comments you ever made because it was this like cop show there's a woman in the front a woman behind her kind like Charlie's Angels - a little it took them tough guns and then like a dude way way in the back maybe three women one guy but I got hard-nosed detectives and you're like Hallmark Channel is sci-fi for women [Laughter] saying that on stage because it is right there is a fucking billboard across the street I need you to go out there and look at it I'm tell you I have this show looking at this job is gonna be better after the show it really was like C was like that is not possible the guy would be like give me the fucking gun where is he he's waiting for these chicks to save him why are you watching me and J went on a rabbit hunt if over this place of looking for videos of like women cops getting beat up oh god they're awful really bad that crowd it's like fuck is a huge power difference here so disturbing there's one I'll never forget this one because the guy's child it was his child I think or his girlfriend yeah I forget who it was I think it was his kid was screaming at him to stop stop to stop and he was beating the shit out of this cop Wow yeah yeah he got out of the car with her and it was a woman and she was really little and she was pulling him over and he got out of the car and I don't remember the exact chain of events but I remember he was punching the fuck he ko dirty on the ground he smashed in the face a bunch of times whoa yeah and his kid was screaming a preacher as his kid screaming to style hos oh it was so scary but it was like this is the reality of being a cop but this is why it's not sexist to think that it's a scary thing to have a 130-pound woman on her own out there driving around in a cop car with a gun trying to pull over 6 foot 4 the guy was a stacked looking black dude right like he looked like a big guy and once he got ahold of her and started punching her holy shit dude it was awful it was awful he beat the shit out of her and he did it super easy and you realize like once you got it on video yeah I want to show a little bit show it to us it's awful man so this is big dude right he gets out of the car and I think it's his look at that he just punches her in the face and don't oh that's all keeps wailing on her oh dude he beat the fuck out of her daughter's got old she's out cold and he takes her guy takes everything and daughters freaking out dude it is hard to watch it's hard to watch get back in the car oh yeah man there's a bunch of a man it's such a dangerous just sure of her like 10 times it's such a dangerous job it's such a dangerous job and to say that it's too dangerous for women who's to say I don't know that's I don't know that one will quit after that if she kept working I think she kept working I don't know I think she might have brain damage after that that's horrific it's a big dude and I bet she was swinging full yeah I mean he's really and I bet she was totally defenseless after the first punch so she's Italian clean punches right to the face boom-boom-boom-boom I mean the damage that a big guy like that can do to just a regular female face what's okay to do that this daughter too shouldn't grow oh my god it's terrifying to be around that kind of violence when you that little so that's that's what was why I think that the video showed the kid in the car run out of the car she ran into her it was terrible but I mean that's probably one of a hundred of those things that have happened by the way in terms of I felt unsafe when I was traveling that shit's here sure you right yeah yes no I was nowhere wasn't safe is like Chicago yeah that's what I say about Mexico like people like do you ever go to Mexico like Mexico is like mostly nice very nice people they're really nice people like Mexico is not the problem the problem is parts of Mexico border towns do something wrong yeah but it's also like that's the problem like you said with Detroit it's a problem with Chicago yeah it's a problem with a lot of places there's spots where it's fucking dangerous yeah even most of Chicago is good yeah Chicago's great 550 murders last year but seeing how many people weren't murdered do you write out look you're a glass-half-full kinda guy needs have non murdered people run from across Chicago really enjoying their freedoms yeah I mean if it affects you or someone that you love it's terrible for sure yeah yeah so in all this traveling yeah did you come out of this with anything you know a few things for sure cuz you seemed like to tell you from the outside no you seemed like almost like you had a different person you also Eve seemed I don't know man it was nice to see you when I first saw you when you came back you know but you seemed like a little different you seem like you I don't know you've seen another level of stuff you've got another level of perspective from this travel thing that like added to your your vision of the world your your whole overall world view yeah a lot of time to think also you guys are seeing stuff you know certainly as everyone would see out there like poverty levels where you're like oh I'm doing fine yeah you know but not even that it's more specific just like I don't friendly people and like yeah I'm just different versions over plus with travelers and Plus really getting to a place where you're like don't need to do anything you know after a month of that it's like okay you just settle into this like I don't know what's today gonna bring right you know you wake up and you're just like I heard there's this cool temple there we'll go check that out maybe there's get on motorbikes and go somewhere I heard there's a cool you just talked to other travelers and like there's a canyon if there's going to go check that out while you're here and so you just do it at some point like you know how when you haven't got enough sleep like a few days in a row you've got four hours four hours for us and you sleep like 11 hours and you're like I am completely caught up right so like not having any responsibility the stress level goes down down and then it's just like waiting in that zero responsibility life for like I'm three months in that level I guess Wow you know after the first couple weeks and it's just like I don't have anything to do just like oh I'm just like fucking relax man I would leave a city when I felt like the right time to leave a city you know it wasn't even like a regular vacation where you look more we got to do this then move right your reservation somewhere yeah it was just like relax and then I could just think about things my art form in general people in my life you know what I want and don't want I have like moments of just like yeah it took a 10-hour bus there's no Wi-Fi you know just like thinking for a while yeah tons of moments like that how did you know when to end it so I was gonna come back to this show but then I remembered my manager my friend Eric they wanted to do a show at Third Man Records in Nashville for their for the Wild West Comedy Festival and I forgot about that because if people ask me when you have to go back like travel is I mean I was like I'm open dude there were so many people they were just traveling open wow yeah that's really common I mean three months is like a norm you have some people six months or a year I met I'm in an Italian girl who's going on her five-and-a-half fifth and a half years just travelling five and a half years just travel hmm she'd find jobs every once in a while Wow yeah and uh it's just um she goes where she wants it's very appealing yeah yeah yeah very fascinating right that's like nobody writes books about a guy who stays in his town that he grew up the book is about the crazy traveler person yes all over the world in a backpack and yeah but there's three-month people all over America doing that I know there's a lot of tent people there's a lot of people that like they'll get like a truck you know like some sort of a gothic SUV thing and they drive it around the camp grounds and they camp and they use the showers of the campgrounds yeah they do stuff enough for money so that they have gas and they keep traveling around and hope their car doesn't brought jobs yeah yeah yeah this girl picked oranges and Sydney for like two months I had this dude on Chris Cage he walked the Appalachian Trail Wow yeah it's Georgia animals and stuff I don't know how do you survive you'll never make it you would never make it what do you mean well you'd never make it if you're just trying to kill animals all the way you'd never make it so how do you you'd have to be an elite hunter and you still might not ever make it cuz you're not if you're carrying that food around it's gonna go bad you're walkin through Georgia in the summer I'm you know critters critters do you not gonna get enough just go starve really yeah you'll starve it's way harder to kill an animal and people think of it in a movie that's that's really it's like let's camp get some dinner dude it's way harder it's way harder yeah yeah unless you're walking around with several high-powered rifles and scopes and you're setting up you know where the animals are they here you come and you're walking you're not gonna be able to walk all the way to Maine oh man maybe that's your experience I feel like they understand you forget the heads BAM they go to restaurants yeah hi food they stay in hostels you know they they have these little camping spots where they have covered shelters and people share them really yeah a lot of that to where it's just like forget about your like what you need in terms of like hotels yeah that's all out you knew that that's all you need so some people they carry it on their back there's a thing called a bivy sack you know that every sack is a bivy sack is like either a bivy sack or a bivy tent they're like essentially a like a combination sleeping bag tent oh cool it's superlight pull pull up um a picture of a bivy tent yes one of the reasons I didn't go to South America is because I was like there's gonna be more camping it seems like mmm up and down the coast and stuff yes like cities and I'm just like I don't know if I can camp alone for that long you might freak out yeah it'd be hard to get a good night's sleep around a bunch of weirdos speak their language this is what they look like no need so you keep that thing they wrap it up put it on their back it's pretty light okay that was the hook and ran off you yeah it's basically like just this tiny ass little tent and like if you were a minimalist hiker like if you're some guy was trying to walk 50 miles or something crazy like these guys they try to carry as light of stuff as they can go as minimal as they can and that's one way that they do that yeah and a lot of times I'll use like a little air mattress like that dude has a little oh wow blow it up don't take up any space yeah you just got to hope it doesn't pop otherwise you're sleeping on rocks it's hard but that's what everybody did to traveling for this backpack that's just gotta make it work space was like a UH that's another thing you learn to it's like I don't need much stuff yeah I'm good out of like you know just a backpack full if that's all your belongings right you buy anything I throw something out yeah man like there's a real movement right now towards minimalism or where people are trying to pare the life down as much as possible yeah I think people don't want to get involved with like banks and fucking having to like mortgage themselves and their lifestyle just for the sake of like having things yep they're like and so they get into like stuff like camping and hiking well it's also you got to think like what do you really appreciate what's porns you and what's really important to you you know because you don't have forever right so what is important to you because you only have 24 hours in a day so what's important to you find out what the fuck that is and do more of that yeah and then try to figure out like how to how to make enough money so that you're not starving that you're doing well yeah but don't just chase that chase what you're trying to do I did the the point system attached to it the monetary point system it can get you all fucked up because it'll get you to working like 12 hours a day 13 hours it's about what to get more stuff to get better stuff to get more prestigious stuff to get stuff that you know all your other stuff having friends or really jealous of your stuff yeah you're just gonna die bro and that's not anything in the long term I mean like what are you getting out of it now that's right that's what's most important yeah a ton of people that are like I don't want that shit so I'm just gonna do a job you know working on a tugboat in Seattle for a few months save up money and then go fucking enjoy myself yeah yeah there's a lot of people that are just choosing to look at everything that they can see experienced every new place that they can go to that hammering Rollins podcast man it's a world changer yeah that crazy fucker is fascinating yeah he's a fast I never met anybody like him he's really fast and he goes and like does stuff and see stuff it was just also his lip out look how he simplifies all the things that are wrong with him and all the things that are wrong with the way he interacts with people and so this is what I'm gonna do and this is gonna you know like he's like his his story about being given booze Ritalin was ritalin right from the time he was like 5 mmm who's a young boy they gave him riddle until senior year of high school so he was like I would just be on these pills I'd be like all day the other day like boom he will like crash and then they do it again I mean they were dead juicing him up with this crazy stuff from like he was an experimental case he grew up in from what I understand he's from Potomac Maryland which is st. counties where I grew up in but he that was the richer part of town nothing he's a rich kid but like Montgomery County is one of the richest counties in America and like that was just a standard thing like your kids not performing ideally he's learning disabled to give me some pills right crazy yeah that people thought for a while that was the way to go I just it just fascinating that he's so like Henry's so intense and he's so like is he's got like these rock songs and to fix this view of the world it's very egalitarian and very open but also very aggressive very intresting he started out though just like that would ever end is what I believe no matter what yes he's like oh yeah for sure I thought about this and here's the answer no I super enjoyed talking to him thinking that up yeah I'm glad it worked out I was going but I was like I I got back as a trivet link-up with him yeah yeah we did yeah I guess like oh hell yeah it was really good he's uh I just love when someone is just soaking in as much as they can get yeah just out there like let's go to Bali and he just goes to Bali let's go to Africa now we're in Tanzania Laur in Botswana you know and just meeting people and yeah going out on the fucking sand dunes and shit and with Bedouins yeah if you get away from like the backpackers path you know the tourist path mm-hmm and sometimes it would get like too much but you just go out and then you can like yeah really see some shit like basically what it is yeah my friend Jesse's going back to Liberia well December they left after urban Charles Taylor was taken over and so but now it's safe again is it yeah Wow yeah and they're trying to convince the world that it's like a decent like tourist place but Jesse's going back in the centre like dude I'm coming with you I'm staying with your fucking family's house Motel but like let's see what's just really like out there yeah let's see yeah I bet it's a trip yeah did you ever see the Vice piece on Liberia mmm-hmm vice guy to travel and they went to Liberia and my man Shan yeah he was over there in Liberia talking to this dude who his name is general butt naked this guy was famous for going into combat the war he would take all his clothes off and he'd run naked killing people naked Wow yeah dude he he admitted he was talking about how they would capture a child from the other tribe and they would kill him and cut pieces of the heart out and eat it to give them invincibility he was talking about this Wow he's free on the streets and they they exonerated him because now he's like a Christian minister yeah as pretty much the only Charles Taylor got punished everyone else was like you're all done go be part of the government it's okay this guy like openly talks about all the crazy shit that he did well about cutting the hearts out of children and eating them you know how Olivier was started yes I didn't know that too recently tell everybody slave thing freed slaves yeah they went back to shit president Monroe freed them and said we'll ship you back if you want and a lot of people like yeah I don't trust you guys so I'm gonna yes I'm gonna go back to Africa but they never grew up and so they called the Liberia for liberated and that's why they all speak English it's there is no they don't have any African language anymore Wow yeah Monrovia is their capital President Monroe the idea of it is so crazy I know use that expression too much what going to their starting up a free place I'm just taking them and throwing them on to a patch of land good luck yeah it's like setting out a zoo animal to the wild right it's like have fun surviving holy shit man and just talk about feeling displaced and confused you didn't even grow up there already lions and in fucking Georgia and you must be thinking of yourself like what kind of shit luck do I have I've double shit luck I have shit luck that I was a slave and then shit luck that I was thrown back to Africa and I think that might have been the way to go oh yeah for sure to be freeze better yeah oh yeah semi free of post-slavery understand like it's still bad yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah shit luck yeah yeah you only got three cars the best you can do is three of a college well this general butt naked guy turned a dude in because the dude was selling human flesh uh-huh and he knew because he had eaten human flesh so he knew what it tasted like so that's how when he was buying like shish kebab from this guy he turned him in he's like this guy was selling human flesh I could tell because I've eaten it before what the fuck did you just say you could tell what it tastes like if I give you a piece of lamb would you know for sure that was a lamb I have an idea yeah an idea but I could maybe sneak in like a piece of wild sheep or something you know that's him right there I think I know what you were flesh tastes like that's him right there general butt naked Wow yeah it tasted I got a taste it was human I called the police Wow Todd knows what human tastes like dude yeah fuck just said I'm gonna testing it when they were testing out like rocket launches to sell them to people there they would be like let me show you and you just blow up a dam you know and so the infrastructure is totally fucked cuz everyone's testing out there no we need that building oh my god that's so crazy yeah cool works I'll take 10 well maybe it'll eventually like calm down and be like Australia right because Australia was a place where they wanted to get rid of prisoners Oh huh now the best people ever yeah yeah maybe that's exactly what's gonna happen in Liberia I just need a couple of generations to knock the does I got rid of Taylor so there should be okay yeah maybe then be fine just takes a while to rebound from swish it like that yeah but Henry Rollins has that of like going to a place and like let me see what this is like yeah man I'm inspiring there's not a whole lot of people that do it that's forever yeah and he works like his work ethics insane mm-hmm like I'm talking about his writing and what he's doing and no he's always doing something he's writing columns and yeah you know he just he goes and does stuff then it comes to him and takes care of business yeah and then he's like cool took care of it go I think I would do this again after my next special yeah yeah unless he finished with work it's like God before I start building up again do a walkabout yeah I don't know see I see some of the world yeah do a walkabout I've had a bunch of people doing gap years what's a gap year yeah exactly what's a gap year it's all over every other country just not ours what's I mean in between high school and college you're leaving your friends you're about to make new friends Oh take it out for a year in between college and grad school or collagen and and your first year work now at the time well European countries have a point in this more relaxed approach yeah to like the future and your life yeah they really do this this conquerors mentality I wonder how many heart attacks we have in comparison to European people I don't know but it's like we're not living our lives you know Germans get off how many tell you familiar with the vacation time leave in America what is it it's two weeks pretty much that's it two weeks vacation two weeks sick do you paid vacation paid vacation oh yeah it's a standard yeah that's a standard okay that's 9 to 5:30 you know in Germany and most of Europe definitely all Scandinavia you get 25 days off five weeks and and if you get sick during those weeks off if you had to go to hospital in wherever country you're in and show them I was in a hospital you get those days back they'll kind of get your sick time instead hmm and they expect you to take this the vacation time to not like here with like c'mon you can't really use it you know what's fucked up sick time okay I've ran out of sick days yeah yeah why what do you mean like you're sick yeah like either you're a fucking liar or I trust you yeah now if I trust you you're just really unfortunate and if I love you and we're friends and we work together I want you to get back okay yeah you you don't have to come back to work because yeah yeah I already used up in 14 days exactly sick the same amount of time every year to like you imagine telling somebody late buddy you're out of sick days I'm gonna have to dock your pay you're dying but I can't breathe IVs and shit I don't care you're out of sick days the count doesn't say that doesn't back you up on that other statistics in order to keep revenue flowing we must keep you in the process yeah what you have a certain amount of days you're allowed to be sick that's fucking ridiculous like hopefully they'll be zero well I'm saving up my sick days what you save up your sick days what does that mean likes your sick days prepare to carry you over yeah exactly extra days where you can pretend you're sick sick days you can save up vacation days I don't think that up sick days should be able to move around like cards at least give you half of them back before I tend left over give me five for next year people with real jobs are so mad at us right now yeah you motherfuckers don't know shit about days our work days to be under the thumb of an impressive dictator I'm saying it's terrible yeah expectation you never take off it's a poor your whole life into that shit and it's like oh man let's do some okay let me play devil's advocate because if I was one of the people out there that likes to complain about you it's easy for you to say are you haven't had a job you don't have the responsibility so I have yeah that's true all right I'll be quiet in a podcast no no I'm saying though they demand better get it better in other places they absolutely should there's citation that you go fuck and see the world and go do stuff the 40-hour of yuk workweek is bullshit bullshit is about that level nobody should do it it just shouldn't be standard everyone has to do the same amount unless I want to buy something that you make then could you please like get it we'll do it over time put a night shift yeah give people time and a half for overtime so you encourage them to go overtime yeah time and a half you can get out of the mindset of having to work this time and just demand something better or more interesting for your life well it's just a weird standard that we've all accepted pretty much across the country nine to five nine five nine to five more morning Bob 9:00 to 5:00 it's night at 5:30 or 6:00 oh yeah if you wanna take a lunch break you don't get paid for that anymore you don't know it's not 9:00 to 5:00 anymore is that Trump did he do this no no it's been a long time 9:00 to 5:00 9:00 OSHA 9:00 to 5:00 could you imagine what a weird weird decision to make the most significant thing be the productivity it's pretty what a mutt where's that horn going off young jammy you hear that is it in the back just give it a little double-check go throw at the baseball bat tell him to shut the fuck up but like walk towards the Monroes walk out there with your dick in your hand that way you startle anyone you see and you have the first move yeah exactly they react this guy's crazy you know what his dick out yeah like if you if you're getting ready to fight and you just come out hold on to your dick people like whoa what's he planning a lot of people backed out from that fight a lot of people wouldn't she would be worried that dick would touch you but once it did touch you would realize it really doesn't do anything okay be the chief thank you people have to like lean back with their hands forward try to get like as if your punches don't matter but the dick touching her does yeah he's gonna touch you and give you cooties yeah this is a happy you like an electric yield dick okay right here yeah you gonna use a kombucha bottle yeah but as the healthiest you've done this twice really yeah we've done this in the podcast before great for sure I like the fact that you're willing to do that too I don't think we can show it on YouTube though so we'll have to have to move away up all right guys dick out great soup is a big opening yeah so it doesn't vacuum up how often DP do you piece everything you like one of them or healthy water drinker dudes I pee a lot do you are you a healthy water drinker dude interesting detail this just happened oh you ran out hold on say we go three cycling get me something it's all right I'm pitching I got a strong grip I mean you can move it to take it a cop not a bottle sees like oh man it's going back in though I can feel it starting to swell back in that's that's not healthy I'm pitch I've been pitching too long should I pee into the cup a bottle yeah oh you emptied it oh thanks man Oh y'all lock my back into my urethra Ari Shaffir couldn't hold in his pee ladies and gentlemen couldn't means wooden filled up one kombucha bottle here's a cap there fella and then filled it up again I had to go empty it out for him thanks for doing that pleasure front yeah I didn't want to leave you hanging there dude there was only one solution I almost went to the kitchen sink and then I better like you then we'd have to rinse that do that bathroom stick is nasty your ever cleaner in here no oh it looks like a bachelor we're on our way out of this oh man it's not that bad you just gotta do it you slowly seen again where's my gas station I should definitely have someone come in that's the fucking 409 yeah do you um do you like to in your podcast like the way you're doing it you're you just like have a subject yeah for the most part I mean you can deviate once you start talking but you have like a set thing you want to talk to someone about yeah it keeps me focused and then it's also like I get to ask real detailed question myself I want to ask about Brian oh yeah and usually I get it with somewhat a level of expert not like the best in the world but someone has experience with something right I got an expert on stand-up comedy you know I've been one right so if you were doing that I could tell you all about stand-up I know more than most people in the world you know about hunting more than most people you know not really yeah but you've done it more than like know what words in the average person whether they are people who actually know it I'm very novice right you're aware of it enough to be like yeah I know about that world yeah I know about that world yeah so yeah I like doing it that way but they like imagine it for five year comics are talking about what stand-up is shut up annoying boy does take a lot longer was the end of it so I see with hunting really yeah I'm I'm a five year hunter so I just shut the fuck up and listen to people to actually know what's going on yeah or parrot what they say it's too complicated I hunt hunting is super complicated there's a lot involved in that yeah but generally it's like like Theo von climbed Kilimanjaro Eddie really up to base camp or something I don't sound like that oh he's great yes so funny man yeah yeah he's really hilarious he's so funny he I was in the back of the hall the other night and he was killing me yeah I mean killing me the point where I was I was crying tears are rolling down my face I put that bit yes I did yeah yeah he's he's real funny really funny like if you get a chance to see him folks if you're out in the road unless he's in town Jason SIBO does an impression of him for punch-drunk that's easy I'll just come in sometimes human be Bill right yeah and it's like oh I'm talking to your dog doesn't so go with the accent it's Larry I know that's part of what's funny about accent he's just fucking great so many funny guys there man did he did he stayed at my apartment one month I think it was at Edinboro last year so he stayed at my place and uh he was like oh man all right I got heavy into coke fucking nuts hilarious yeah well that's it clean better than anybody else's stay there really yeah a duck had left it pretty nice - yeah that's the thing that kept me out a little bit what is it I was like Duncan you could say Mike because he was moving to New York right then there's another don't get near B&B just stay at my place hmm but I was like two days in when I got out there I was like I've made a huge mistake I should go back home two days I mean it was just yeah right away it's so different than him like what am i doing this is definitely a mistake well what was the initial thought behind it like what did you think do you think that this is what I need to recharge no I didn't want to see the world for a while I know I had I had one good this guy Turner brought me out to a tour tour of China and I just sort of saw some of that place and it was like just so like the really the meaning of the word foreign you know yeah just way different and it's like I just wanted to see more of that world and I went with with Petey Sita for Thailand a couple years ago what's one of those full moon parties and I just got more like I want to see things I did a Scandinavian tour last year I made sure to leave days off in between shows so I could really see some of the cities I don't know man I just get off and like seeing new the new versions of the world and new experience of what people care about well I think we love to to compartmentalize and to look look at our specific area because I think it's a part of being a human until recently like until you could travel like this we like what people liked was knowing the sort of security of their environment they know that environment well they're around all the time there's no surprises I got this place to lock down unsafe but it's not adventurous it's not adventurous so this new thing that people are able to do only really within the last hundred years where you could just get up and travel yeah and just I mean I guess there's probably world travelers before yeah before better but I mean how many of them did it recreation house yeah you can stay at hostels for cheapest fuck you know meet people and have them tell you what there is to do where you are where to go or not go when do you think that that was really an acceptable thing as far as no no I mean world travel Oh like when when were you an invader oh right and when did it become okay to be a tourist I think it was always sort of okay to be like some guy in foreign lands as long as you're by yourself and not like an invading you know force but if you want you to visit somewhere right I'm gonna just wonder how many people did it yeah I'll stink like so but here's what I noticed in Hong Kong and Shanghai which are banking centers and the people that will come to the shows expats Hong Kong you had more locals cuz they speak English there but in Shanghai let's say and it's like if you're an English banker from London or somebody from New York and you took the job in Shanghai China like you're have to have some adventurous bone to you instead of staying in New York or staying in London you have to be saying like yeah I'm gonna go with my kids or without my kids I'm gonna go fucking do this new thing yeah and yeah I mean just to want to go do that you can do it now there's jobs everywhere yeah my friend William Childress he moved to Myanmar he got a job offer he's an architect Wow she's building Mar yes ins yeah designing him yeah yeah exactly but like it just opened up the army just leaded people and he was like one of those first wave of people and they started doing stand-up out there dude that's got to be a creepy feeling building prisons something like that yeah designing him and now he's doing stand-up yeah you did all this time there he had the show I didn't Bank he brought me out there from Myanmar he took a trip there met me in Bangkok do you think he's doing comedy to balance out the building prisons no that's building prisons not that we don't need prisons not there aren't bad people that should be locked up yeah that's not what I'm but I'm what I'm saying is like you design them so he can make it more comfortable maybe whatever yeah exactly make it so they can't get out that's why it's a crazy thing when someone escapes from prison Wow Wow imagine getting out of present oh my god it must be so excited taking a tunnel every night or finding yet to find the way out how do you know the way out how do you escape how about El Chapo he walks down to the hole that's under his toilet that goes a mile plus the ground and then pops up at some goofy ass house and gets in a car and drives off Wow see you suckers is he still free as you know he's in he's back they caught him of trouble they did something he got injured too something happened to me like hurt his leg or something like that running through the tunnels I think it might have like broken his leg falling and they're trying to escape you know he didn't look like he was the most fit fella he's too busy running shit you know to actually be running well El Chapo if you can hear this July 18th my Netflix special comes out that's so amazing you wanna check it out El Chapo I want to check that out I'll chop oh do you think English and when he with the comedy translate to him I think some of it would show some of it would have subtitles on Netflix so right that's always wondered like that's one of the unique things about like learning a language the way they structure their sentences is very different uh-huh so it's you can't it's not just this word means that that word means this so just replace them no it's interesting when you talk to people from other countries when you're out there and you start to have been be able to translate their mistranslations like easy things like what time it is right they don't realize like that's a statement not a question right but like you just gets like when they say five years more it means like I've already been here five years they're not really see if like understand what they really mean sort of like that 72 virgins expression uh-huh what it means like a shitload oh really yeah that's what it means 72 is like a shitload you know oh right yeah it's like a specific number like when we see a few it's like technically it means the rate but really just means I know it's a mungus amount yeah 72 virgins oh my god yep so we all took that is like you think you're getting exactly 72 virgins exactly oh yeah we don't yeah I used to do a whole bit about that suicide bombers like what pages is for 72 virgins I never that written anywhere do it okay I just want to know why can you just tell me what page it's awesome what a crazy world to think that there are people that will go into crowded areas like in Manchester yeah and just blow themselves up and kill a bunch of people around them the halls are just like belief Oh belief for sure and then some sort of mental illness for sure there's a lot of issues hmm abuse maybe maybe this physical abuse maybe they're like have no idea we'll have an extreme desire to show their love you just think you're at war right who knows who knows what you think you would you know to break down the psychology if someone who's a suicide bomber would be very like you would you would have to do a tremendous amount of research before you started drawing any conclusions hard to find them to talk to them to problem the theoretical suicide bombers do not apply yeah I'm thinking about do you have two guys who do his best don't go off yeah okay we got talk to you even then like what do you you gonna get he's a recovered person they got out they got through that moment where they're gonna blow themselves up and it didn't happen now they've sort of had a chance to think about it how do you charge that guy yeah you know oh yeah I would do again I realize about today you know is a different in a deviant sociology there's a different category for people who attempt suicide and people who commit suicide real in the psyche of it oh I see cuz their thing is if you attempted it you weren't really trying it ain't that hard to do you were probably trying to cry out mmm and the people who do it generally shut up about it more they just do it without sounding people like I'm gonna kill myself I want to kill myself so somebody said if people say they want to kill themselves that's a good sign that they need help but that they're not gonna kill themselves hmm theirs is very different there's different mentality between also someone who wants to kill themselves and someone who wants to literally be the bomb mm-hmm that kills a bunch of other people let's say yeah if you really believe in heaven and you're going there though fucking great get there why wait Wow you're for sure going it's like you know the Catholic confession on your deathbed and then you got straight to heaven but it's hard to time it right yeah you give that's all your sins right before you die you're going shit you have no sins left you're going to heaven right but you have to time it right yeah and it's really hard these guys figured out the way to time it perfectly my after blowing myself up gets me into bites away all my sins bright one shot unless as he blew it up a part of him goes fuck right before he died that night then he goes to hell for eternity to Calais Jamie no I don't know anybody from Manchester I'm sorry just what if what if you do it what if you do it you think you're gonna be in heaven you know and you press the button boom and then also it's just you disembodied in an infinite black room it's just you forever in the blackness of infinite space with no stars just you alone with no body what's floating through eternity you just you you can experience the blackness of space but with no stars and nothing to look at where they're ever just you just you just use your consciousness and realizing how huge you fucked up forever that'd be pretty bad you crazy right then you come back raisi welcome back for crazy what what would even be crazy imagine if you have your consciousness forever you're nice to apply it to nothing to apply to and you're floating through infinity and and you'll have a body so I'm pretty bad man that's a pretty bad punishment that's pretty bad it's not good Wow that would be real tough still not good enough that's you should float on the edge on eternity while you're feeling like you're choking on dicks Wow for eternity because if you can exist for a second while you're choking on a deck you get exist for eternity while you choke it on deck yeah so that sure that should be the punishment for suicide bomb they have the Simpsons where they had a too harsh Homer going to hell and then the devil one of the demons was like so you like donuts do you try eating i'm million donuts and there's just a conveyor belt that keeps like shoveling donuts into his mouth and he keeps going more please more please and then he's getting out fat big is like please more another one please yeah you ever do the simpsons ride at Universal no it's fucking amazing there really it's crazy it's a giant animated ride you just sit in a car uh-huh it's one of the best rides ever so good yeah and it's all happening on a screen but the car is moving around so it feels real and it's an enormous fucking really high-resolution screen we're showing this huge cartoon or this whole thing plays out oh it's fucking great it's really good The Simpsons are a national treasure yeah they really are it's pretty great it's pretty great my whole adulthood I guess they've been on since I was in high school yeah dude they were one year something there's something crazy like that thirty thirty yeah me too high school dude it's forever has always been there I'll never forget it I remember like what a great show remember when uh Homer Simpson went to a chili cook-off and the peppers were so hot he started tripping yeah I had psychedelic trash those peppers were the Merciless the ghost peppers right isn't that what we're supposed to be deaf quit socket Onaga so this goes socket sunako growing a deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemala insane asylum yeah that was a great show god damn what a creative see that's the thing about like Bill burr show f is for family to even doing the others are great right here they're really good of course it's great bills hilarious yeah but um you could do so much cool shit on a cartoon that you can't do in real life decapitated they get blown up I mean how many times is South Park killed Kenny yeah and we didn't care that he came back he comes back I love how later they sort of like dealt with it but I can reincarnation sort of stuff and I said almost saying things yeah he remembers all his past lives it's so ridiculous yeah I love when F is family because there's a there's a real type character yeah and they look real yeah you know they don't look all like weirdo like like Squidbillies type it's like this is you can believe as a people and when the father saying to his son fuck you it's like real shock oh my god cartoon but in my opinion like if you gotta give Wow I mean I was gonna say like the all-time bastard South Park but I don't really think there's an all-time best but it in terms they're all awesome I don't want to like see this number one is number two but like South Park has had some fuckin my current like I won't miss that show is South Park I mean friend for years it's been that you just don't miss any episodes there's no falling behind there's no like oh yeah sometime I just stopped watching a couple seasons ago it's just like every guy gets so excited to see those posters in the billboard now on the other billboards on the subway yeah it's like oh it's back it's a fucking amazing show and it's been amazing forever you have Trey park around here on the podcast would for sure I'll you should I would I'd haven't both I'm at yeah you left Matt out how dare you you don't even care about Matt the ever see that show boy they show the making of states the air yeah that's great fuck yeah documentary it's great he's humbling right Trey Parker like his work ethic oh yeah the way he goes after it's like whoa yeah to get the fuck out of that guys out of his way it's pretty much that's that guy's in it and you come out for a second what can I do with this and this and we'll say something cool and I'm right back in yeah that dude from SNL working there that week and he barely had anything to do Wow my poor was his name it was dick yeah hater what's the name John hater jon heder Bill Hader who's John hater of Napoleon Dynamite hey let me ask you this we don't seem to Bill Maher I've never been at Bill Maher fan but do you think of this whole recent controversy of him just casually dropping an f-bomb yeah you know he was trying to make a joke exactly right yeah I mean didn't work but who's trying to be naughty yeah that's all but they're making it seem like it's something more its words or like you said this is I guess said said not did did is worse but it's he's not hire black people that's a major issue he's never hired a black person but I don't think I've heard that so it's like his actions aren't we were talking about before the podcast this thing were the where they were talking about the Clintons and Arkansas yeah in the governor's mansion yeah what what show was that what show was it did you see Jamie I read it I didn't see it on the show oh you read like really getting passed around the internet yesterday mmm it's gotta be Russian disinformation that could be who knows Bill Maher when they go like troubling from Bill Maher I mean I get it even the Republican senator they was there with it was like like I'm a little uncomfortable but sure be uncomfortable and if a guy watching a guy who uses words that make me uncomfortable all time I'll stop watching I guess you know Twitter erupts over news that Hillary Clinton used black prison labor while first lady of Arkansas news recom what does it have to do with JFK JFK pushed the Democrats to Democrat whatever connected to push them to the right and have an event resistor huh okay when we moved in I was told that using prison labor at the governor's mansion was a long-standing tradition which kept down cost Clinton rights she adds that most of the workers were convicted murderers and she became friendly with in quotes a few of them african-american men in their 30s who had already served 12 to 18 years their sentences who despite their alleged friendships with these men Clinton tells her readers we enforced rules strictly and sent back to prison any inmate who broke a rule despite having no psychological qualifications she later asserts that these men did not have inferior IQs or an ability to apply moral reasoning but instead they may have been emotional illiterate emotional illiterate no no that's what she's saying God says despite having no psychological qualifications ya later asserts no ability to say that she said yeah it's kind of weird though that slave labor yeah that is exactly what that is I mean no it's just tradition it's like yeah but that doesn't mean you should do it let's be honest like how much are they getting paid zero what the fucking one pack of cigarettes a week yeah what do they get they do not pay inmates at all oh Jesus Christ Clinton makes no mention of whether or not these men received any money for working for her and her husband at 2016 article for Mother Jones notes that when it came to prison when it comes to prison labor some state states include Texas Arkansas and Georgia do not pay inmates at all holy fuck on Twitter Jing wrote that Hillary Clinton was a direct participant in what Sam su sway Sam sway it's at Sam sway on Twitter I guess correctly described as modern slavery a hundred percent well dude that's a hundred percent slavery if you don't pay someone you make them work because they did a crime that's a crazy thing like it was a boat but you're making them work that's what's crazy about it it's like it's not just that you your your freedoms taken away and they lock you in a box but they also make you work saying your lives aren't worth anything we can make you do whatever you want yeah and that dude from Phoenix makes you work in pink oh yeah that that job a little guy yeah yeah he's uh he's a interesting case it makes you put pink on to embarrass you yeah did you get embarrassed when you were in pink I rep it sometimes I don't give a fuck okay I'm not a big pink wear I will occasionally wear a pink I'll admit I'm not a big think we're yeah but at the same time I don't care about it I'm not scared of a color I'm a rational person fight in high school like 13 14 wearing pink ties and stuff control being a little embarrassed but also been like this looks good and then learning to wear salmon makes it way much easier you know gene LeBell always wore a pink judogi really yep why it's clean and sober it's as an all of them clean and sober with pink shirts probably because they were drug offenders right no he gets upset he wants everybody clean and sober oh there's an A in quotes around a dad silly rascal and he's not taking out ever pink so judo gene LeBell was like one of the toughest men that's ever lived did his judo with a pink kion why fuck you that's why Google judo gene LeBell judo gene LeBell was uh he was a I know he was a national champion in judo and I think he won a gold medal in the Olympics dude I saw Clay Guida up see him once and there's no clay girders coming up so he wasn't like he was in the cheap seats with us right and he saw judo gene in like the section where you sit and he was like all fuck and he just jumped I don't know how he got past security just like ran past them just to go get that guy a hug what is gene there's gene the Bowens pinky what is gene LeBell zum his accomplishments he's had a shitload of accomplishments in judo but I he definitely did some training with Ronda and he's also the guy that exposed Bruce Lee to grappling over at joint locks and join me in that place

salute upon the fucker that's gotta be fake how did the biggest wing over you know man the real question with a guy like Putin is not like how much does he control it's like what happens if that guy dies oh yeah who takes over that power yeah the vacuum of power behind that guy must be stunning there uh democracy right Russia sorta totalitarian democracy no they have some sort of a democracy they have some sort of election process yeah yeah it's President Gorbachev right president as long as you're not running against Putin seems to function fairly well they just took over again Denis like he was the president then he went away just came back like fuck you guys I think he came back again in 2012 he's been back for a while not that long yeah he was gone for a while and then some other dude got into power and he's like hey man you're the president uh-huh okay it's it's look it's not admirable that's the guy from narcos did right he wanted to be just in government to get run shit yeah

done make sure on July 18th and beyond to catch my Nunez double special there's no sense of going back out to the Apple TV what day is that again July 18th Joe it's Tuesday July 18 all over the world fantastic I've midnight Pacific time are you going on the road at all no no just fucking around coming up with material in town in 15 okay you're having fun up there oh yeah was it weird not be on stage or did you go on stage at all no I went to one show Phnom Penh saw show itch and they asked me if they knew me they asked me to go up Wow and I said no I was like nah well while I was like I really want to see where they go the fully long break would do no sense of breaking it up right just for one set somewhere it would be cool to perform in Cambodia to mark that off a list you know I like doing that that's my like bird-watching kind of stuff countries that performed in Cambodia yeah Wow but I was like no also I didn't want to be going around for the next two months with the fucking bomb on my shoulders like you know I mean I don't need them if I could walk around with that that's like my last set oh so if you went up there and ate there yeah then I'm like if I started losing it about that people what do you do I'm like I don't even know anymore yeah what was it like the first time on stage after that long break a little weird I found a story so I could at least base myself in like in like things that happened mm-hmm you know Meredith yeah narrative less is expected but then the next day I did Nate bargatze was there so Nashville so that's when I came home so they wanted to do this show and third my records so I just wrote them a letter and I was like hey if you still want to do that add it to the website I'll be home I'll just come home I'll see it right I'll check it so I did Nate bargatze and friends the next day and that was just stand up and I was like a little lost it was weird yeah I was it was rust here on the edges and I got to like 12 13 minutes and I wanted anything from the special so I was just like what do I have knew and I tried something that I thought of then on the road which wasn't much I kind of shut my brain off to that a little bit like instead of like writing jokes like Linna a couple like topics and I was like but that's it what if you had an awesome idea they just came to out of nowhere just bother right yeah I wrote just an idea mmm like I saw this hasn't worked so to say it I saw two dogs at the end of fucking so many stray dogs out there yeah it's everywhere it's everywhere and eventually it ends up on menus - ooh just because it's like it's like fish man they're everywhere Jesus yeah why wouldn't you kill one to survive did you eat any dog I did not only because I would when I saw it on a menu it's called our W and he's Timor it was like they have this the Indonesian style of food which is water rooms just like windows with like food left out do you know how like pizza places in New York he point to a slice and they'll take it and warming it up right so it's like that but they don't warm it up and it's meat so it's like bits of fish or chicken or beef and then that was like dog so if it was hot out of the oven I might have gone for it but not leftover a cold cold dog over rice you look good though it looked good I'd ask her four times what she said I had to keep checking my like translator I was like no I think you're saying it wrong she was like yeah she had to act out like wrong no that's not a dog just do chicken try to do dog my friend Stephen Rinella was telling me that they regard it as a hot food not necessarily even just meaning spicy oh really a dog is like a hot food meaning like there's like there's something to it it's like there's a special energy that you get from eating dog yeah that's dark I can see that because they seem more like intelligent you know they have seemed got feelings Jesus hot food like human meat you gain their souls he did a show with the sky were they shot and ate a coyote yeah they cooked the coyote like they would cook like wild game and they opened it up they burned off all the hair and then they split it and threw it over like a great and cooked it on over coals just threw some seasoning on it it's crackling and cooking and they just cut pieces of this coyote off it's like and I was watching this going why is it so disturbing when we choose one animal or another yeah why is that so disturbing like why is that coyote any different than a pig which is totally normal it's just pet wise that's I think it's all boils down to we don't have that you don't have it it's even weirder than that because nobody's got a pet coyote did I saw something yeah it's close enough yeah to your dog that is like fuck your dog and get it pregnant yeah and like I don't like that yeah reminds me of its it's so close to a dog it's so close to a dog that if it fucks your dog it'll make puppies yeah I went to uh rooster fights that seems so crazy doesn't that seem so great yeah imagine a chicken can fuck your parakeet and make something opens the cake and gets in the parrot cage just fucks his shit out of him a chicken in a parrots cage would be hilarious yeah there are different species yeah but she looks like the same thing shaking just fuck that parent oh that all the time you thought you had a girl parent you know the chicken opis lay eggs chicken gets in there fuck - shit roosters are ruthless man I don't have any I don't have any roosters but we were really worried when we're getting chickens while we're stuck yeah that when I was growing up my friends had to go away cuz I read it so I had to bring him into the garage every night because wake up the neighbors it's fucking middle suburbs and they're just like what in the two hours before sunup yeah it's not sunup it's way before it's not up really it's tense it coming well it's cons oh yeah just screaming next year neighbor what the fuck yeah we were in Santa Barbara and some guy had one but he had it like a thousand two thousand yards away really yeah it was far but you could still hear it but it was kind of cool because yeah yeah it wasn't obnoxious like if it was right next door like it was way across this Canyon I was like wow that's kind of cool yeah like that won't even bother me I got used to it being out there all those countries they just had him around so wherever you're asleep and there were thin walls you just hear him dude I want to get peacocks cool we have peacocks I want to get pet peacocks I'm gonna go full Hunter's Thompson and have some pet peacocks I had to bury one of them teach you yeah the fucking reaches head of the latticework to try to like eat the grass outside and the Fox is just waiting for him took his head left the body inside Fox is a clever girl very clever I went to a rooster fight in a Timor Leste did you really yeah in terms of like what we accept what they will you know different things do they're doing that shit in Encino are they really yes so Ryan goes I know a place you can go to there's there's places I want to go Ali sure there's places in the valley that might as well be Mexico like you Julia roads I've never seen the actual fights but I've seen the fighting roosters I've seen pens as hunters a dude that I know who knows a dude who's got like a hundred of them in his backyard Wow yeah to fight fighting roosters yeah Wow in a lot of these like Mexican neighborhoods doing it's like super normal they don't view it as weird at all where I saw it they were like you're not taking pictures I'm like I didn't want to like you know get you guys in trouble like water it goes in trouble what do you mean we're outside right in those countries it's not bad at all the general owns the fucking ring where they all do it it's hilarious but then if you can do that then you can justify dogs like well what do we do about dogs well dogs are a little smarter it's a little different they're strays out there they're strays California authorities seized over 7,000 birds and largest cockfighting bust in US history well Jesus Christ three weeks ago Jesus Christ in the valley Valley see I told you I'm making this out that's nuts out anyway you say meth town I say rooster town hundreds of gaps of slashers yeah they put these razors on the back of their back claw isn't it I mean it's they give him steroids really for the animals were also recovered I didn't see any syringes and steroids they got juiced up chickens ready to fuck you up ki imagine I want to like do a vice land piece on that watch these dudes shoot their fucking chickens up with steroids and have them go out there look and Hulk out they went back to the same spot but here's the thing we're at ten years earlier it doesn't bother it doesn't bother you or me like it would if it was dogs no it doesn't but I'll be out yeah no right they don't look like us yeah not nearly but I was I thought it would be like really barbaric until you see it you're like oh it's not really that bad at all I've seen dog fights I was in New Orleans and I saw a dog fight you did yeah impromptu I don't know if I was open my friends it was a pit one fucking pit bull came in and another pit bull came into this pit and what's going on and they did it and it was I mean vicious it was vicious these cock fights are just like they fly to each other a couple times and then one gets like woozy me and then falls it's a cock fight yeah yeah that looks like one inside huh see the dogfighting famous the dogfighting thing to those people that mean the people that believe in it I'm sure they would argue with you that there's no difference between dogfighting and rooster fight probably not most people think there is because dogs are smarter but I was also bloodier oh yeah it was just like more like them ripping each other's fucking everything out yeah the other the father fights it's over 30 seconds and you don't need to see blood most of the time it's just it's just there yeah but but yeah in terms of animal tough I saw a dead end I'm on the side of the road would bother me more a dog or rooster it's on YouTube they have cockfighting on YouTube world oh the world slasher cops yeah dude I DVR'd this guy's gonna hit the weather one in the back to move him or he's gonna pick them up and throw them towards the other one is that what they did they're not going out each other yet so they have to really throw them towards each other so most of the time if they put a rooster near roost we've got it tied yeah they'll come out to each other they're probably like what the fuck is going on so in their back fuck here we go oh my god and the waddle start pecking the other ones soon so they're catching each other with these feet and that happens in the way of fighting to see the other ones fucked that one is fucked God yeah he's down it's dead there's thumper God they must be both mangled though oh that yeah he gets blood back Adam the ref has to choose when it's over oh yeah that rooster got fucked up now fast that is yeah so you don't even see really how it's like barbed air it's just quick and over do you think that well yeah because they're covenant one tonight today oh yeah so when I saw the winner the owner of the winner gets to eat the loser they take it home with them on their bike and they're eatin chicken tonight how weird and do you think that rooster fights again I saw them selling a rooster up oh Jesus yes they said he gets two months off gets to live a fun life for a while and then I'll be back in fighting but he didn't so somebody's the winners get nothing happened to them sometimes they get a little fuck - Jesus sometimes they both die wow these are the rooster houses Wow Kentucky hold enough shit the wait a minute that looks like a dog house that looks like what they do with pits cuz they do is that really roosters that's crazy you sit on top of it doesn't lease under if it rains yeah I guess so the places where they they fight dogs they'll have like a giant yard and they'll have like ten dogs plus out there on chains and they're all connected to these little tiny houses just like that it's really creepy because they're they're not really dogs I mean they're dogs in the sense of they're at the actual animal there are as dogs but there are these things like it all know there's no pet to them they're these things that have been true they're just bred to fight and I'm sure they can handle them you know I'm sure there's like a few commands they understand but their life is not about being pet and love like bad police's army what's their name what do they call Jamie was one of the tics cut off oh yeah they're just cosplay it's trying to fight their eunuchs but that's how they call themselves but something I don't know I can't damn it yeah fuck that show needs a comeback it takes a while this is our lead Unseld and Sully the unsullied yeah yeah yeah that's what those dogs are that icon Sully hmm yeah well they just they have their dicks and balls though the unsullied the problem with those guys is they've been neutered so you can't fight that good cuz they're on the testosterone yeah these dogs have everything they're ready to rock and roll they dis live to fight and that that moment they get to fight is like the only thing they're looking forward to and they're brief and like really miserable existence so the more they exercise them the more they just train them and get them ramped up they're just prepping them for this one moment where he gets to do what he actually wants to do what he's made to do it looks not his fault it's like that dogs bred that way they've encouraged that behavior like generation after generation by careful selection calling dogs that don't fit the criteria like it's one of the reasons why people love pit bulls so much like once you have a pit bull other dogs seem so dumb because they're so smart they're so tuned into you and they're like like I remember squeaky Fromme uh-huh she was like a little demon she was like tuned in to me and she would lock on to me but if any other dog got anywhere near her and tried to take my attention she would kill it in front of me real if she just want it dead so get the fuck away from him yeah they just they're very intense and tuned in decreases and a lot of people like it was I got her she was already she was a pound dog I got her she was like 11 months old and she was cut up she that she had definitely been in some sort of a fight whether it's an organized one or something but she was a mess from the moment I got her she's just such a cute little dog and loved you to death just couldn't couldn't leave you alone want to sit right next to him put her head in your lap just a big sweetie just the sweetest dog ever but like these eyes there's like the dad like ready to die for you eyes it's not the one you have to put down yeah I was killed my other dog yeah yeah it's not good fuck yeah they're um the nature is not their fault I mean they they they've essentially been selected over many many many many generations to be incredibly dog aggressive and incredibly prey driven and almost impervious to reacting to pain yeah that's what's so terrifying about them so they don't care they don't know they like to fight they're not worried about getting hurt they're looking forward to this they want to do it they're wagging their tail and they're biting each other it's crazy they wag their tails they're locked faces on each other and their tails are wagging back and forth like they're having the greatest time I saw think for some big obviously County Fair they train their dogs to do tricks and shit and they said they've gotten to the point where this reminds me of this where the treat they get for crashing the frisbee eventually becomes the frisbee so like they're trying to calculate cool I got to grab that frisbee thank you and I could throw it again so like I have to grab the frisbee again you know instead of like I get the frisbee so I can get this fucking piece of meat right right right so it seems like those dogs too it's like oh I did the task and thank you for letting me do that yes what I wanted to do they get those um working dogs you ever been around like a real working German German Shepherd no dude they're so intense they're like a live wire first of all they're like a real big German Shepherd is probably like I want to say like 90 pounds like let's Google what's a big German Shepherd it's not the hugest dog in the world they're not like a mastiff but they are so fast and they're so taut you know just like fucking ready Oh ready to go and looking at you and this dude was demonstrating different he's trains dogs for the police department yeah he was demonstrating different things 71 pounds is a big one Oh adult male 88 pounds so yeah close to 90 pounds talk about one of those wearing a suit once dude it's so strong oh they're so strong they just keep wriggling your hand through you're on the ground they're just so they're so fast there and you got to think they're so fast they're on you they let them go like jump now think that right that's a 90 pound animal now think of a wolf yeah double that oh wow double that and have it more athletic stronger much harder bite you ever seen a wolf in the wild no almost I think I might have but it was it was so dark I could only see there was some sort of a doglike creature that was running across the the dirt road ahead of us while we're in hunting camp waiting to get picked up whoa yeah nervous yeah a little bit yeah when you're standing outside in grizzly country and there's wolves so you can't wander off the go pit no fucking way you're off to be together you have to be together and you both have to be paying attention and you should talk and since it's out it's late at night you don't have to even worry about whispering like you're not trying to like you're not trying to scare anything you trying to let things know that you're there oh right so just tell my surprise by you're not surprised by you they hear you coming they can avoid you if they choose to but if something decides it's gonna come towards you look you the size these won't goddamn did if you saw a wolf and killed it I wouldn't even be trust a veneer trust that would think was dead I know I'd be like ah but the size of these things wow these are enormous wolves out the dead one to one of the top middle you know it's really interesting these wolves that you're seeing although they're all just wolves these wolves are wolves from Canada and it's one of the reasons why they're so big one of the reasons why they've been so devastating to elk populations and deer populations got the air in his mouth how can like a leg with a dude he looks then - they're so powerful they're just incredibly powerful incredibly cunning killers that act in packs and love the snow they love it they can do shit in the snow where other animals are fucked like they can run through the snow they thrive in ridiculous cold environments because that's when other animals are vulnerable and they can wreak havoc on them there are a crazy animal man but they look like a dog so we have this weird connection with them where we think of them as dogs like it's our friend it's mr. shape the same way exactly I mean they do look nice yeah and when you see him alone you're like oh that was you know with no scale off if I can remember I'll tell you this bit I'm doing about it about wolves there's a real encounter I had with a dog and a wolf or a dog met a wolf for the first time really yeah I'll tell you later okay but it's it's some data animal is not the same animal it used to be here they killed a bunch of wolves so they had to reintroduce wolves to try to bring the population back oh really but when they reintroduce wolves they brought them in from Canada I said wait don't like Canadian moose are bigger they're Canadian people are bigger yeah it's all polar bears it's a fucking Hardy you're climbing up there man you get a different different sort of an animal oh look at the wrong one they got a big-ass wolf it was way bigger so you can't ever just like go off because they'll see they'll wait for you to be alone well they definitely could if they chose to most of the time they avoid the fuck out of people they seem to know that if they fuck up and do something to people then a bullets start coming and then everybody dies like they're smart enough to kind of understand that they're not smart like they wouldn't you know they wouldn't do anything that you would think would be extraordinary for an animal it's not like to have like superhuman powers but they have an unusual ability to plan and coordinate well and they talk to each other they yell out and talk to each other and they give locations and they all kind of intuitively understand what the task is but when they're operating together it's like it's pretty stunning to watch man I've watched a bunch of videos I'm never never in real life obviously but a bunch of videos of them coordinating like an attack on animals yeah oh dude it's amazing we heard we're at a campsite Malibu cuca State Park we heard coyotes or wolves coyotes but I just like the way they were like sort of talking to each other to the we sweet we saw a skunk or first we sort of smelled one and we heard two coyotes kind of like yelping and we're like that hey they got sprayed by a skunk for sure we're just filling this and we have no idea but it's really seemed like that hearing the guard or like just a couple of them and then later we saw a skunk try to spray us didn't have much so we think that's the same skunk they're like sprayed out and now he's got nothing left in the tank does that work like that I don't know this is what we all think and then like a little bit later this account kind of like came at us but didn't like he tried to spray got the dog he's not my friend murderous as you know Mervis I think center yeah they got his dog but just like a little bit just bet it no just like with a little bit of like spray but like not much not enough where is like terrible it was bad and then we heard like 10 or 15 coyotes all howling w2 right a sconce a predator yeah he was coming out bared teeth and stuff I had a skunk trying to get into my chicken coop really yeah and then I read about him like that's one of the things they eat they'll eat chicken I make sense yeah yeah the sprays for self defense not offense Wow but to fuck you up I just fucked up by a skunk like you fucked you up and you smell like shit you got a fistfight with a skunk in your backyard zapped you and then bite the fuck out dolphin rabies he jumps over your fence and you run inside you're covered in blood and you're like oh my god this skunk bit the fuck on what things get out of here yeah get away didn't even care oh my god you have to wash yourself outside it's cold outside get out you saw it skunk oh my god I'm never gonna clean this up oh my god this houston smelly tongue forever I'm so mad at you you're mad if I get fucked up by a skunk I just skunk biting your dick yeah it's just ah oh you're like this you love fucking creatures so my trip I saw a komodo dragons you know flesh yeah out in the wild yeah you went hot enough I'd not like to kill but just like want to find them yeah your tail shit too but yeah what I found out later he's not supposed to do that but I didn't know man I was real close and I just touched one no walking away it was like it's so close and I was like just grabbed oh yeah these guys is weird pointed like V sticks like long sticks with like a little tip at the end that like can can like put on it's weird but this one guy would he have I was like way into snakes and reptiles and shit he's like let's go huntin let's go find him we went out in the brush I wonder if a komodo dragon was the inspiration for that thing that the alien would do from the movie Ridley Scott movie alien well it would open its mouth and all the slime and everything they have all this bacteria there man it's like a bit you're still gonna lose your leg we've gone over this at least twice and I always forget which it is that they used to think that it was a toxin and now they think it's bacteria or they used to think it was bacteria and now they think it's a toxin well I read that area yeah it's like a botulism yeah there's something along the different size of bacteria in their saliva and it's toxic yeah and they know it and so they'll bite an animal and fuck it up and then they'll follow it around so it's reading this thing about a water buffalo that this Komodo dragon intact they saw it bite it and then it followed it for like two days really just waiting for it the car this buddy this guy I met in uh somewhere deep in okay so it's the island of Flores is is where you can sort of like be and then that's where the Hobbit people were Flores yeah in Indonesia yeah really yeah leave me the Hobbit people there's little Hobbit people that they discovered oh really dude they discovered that within the last shit I want to say 14 thousand years ago is that what it was there's in the last fourteen thousand years somewhere at somewhere in that range humans shared time on earth with another kind of human being it's a little tiny 3 foot tall human being that are completely different features than us yeah really calm Florian SACEUR Flores that was a slore what's that twelve thousand years ago yeah okay that's nothing 12,000 years ago like I'm you know I mean I'm trying to imagine plus as long as they were those people were just like us twelve thousand years ago and they were a tiny little thing almost like like a cross between a human and a chimp they don't really know exactly what their skin color while they look like put it next to a drawing of a full-grown like now man yeah read it he's jacked yeah my fucking perfect muscle doesn't have any prospered Charles some dick in this little critter there's even there was even speculation that they had eaten humans or attacked humans through their get bread with us and that's why they're shorter out in Asia how dare you know that's what it looks like see that one the drawing in the far left Jamie with the guy holding the spear that's what they think you look there's a full-sized version and that see if you could find that oh Jesus so these were like almost like what we were lying I guess when we were on our way up the food and they just developed the chains they said yeah well a threat Australia Pittacus or something like that like one of our earliest ancestors is Australia yeah well Australia Pittacus is like a modern human but like they're one of the first versions I think I want to say a million years ago but I'm probably just making that number up but you know human beings in this form they don't they don't know the exact number obviously but they think we've been around this form for only about a quarter million years give or take a dragons have venom they do have enough thank you okay so the use of thing was bacteria now they think it was vent I got to show you the picture I was I saw one we saw one or a rock and you go like right behind like some brook like out like some leaves and like some some branches so you get up close to him and it's still sort of scary because if you probably get through the branches but probably not you know mmm and you could just take a picture from think that close all the saliva is coming out dude I'll show you this at the store one night you imagined the horror that you would feel if a komodo dragon was clamped down on your calf you felt all that hot poison going into your body and you were trying to get away yeah and you you broke free with a big chunk taken out of your calf and it's a bet about to leap on you and you're trying to run away with a limp hobbling Wayne screaming no and no and running through the bushes and you look back and you see it just taking its time walk through you're coming towards we're taking its time because it knows it doesn't have to chase you through structures you can't you can't go far you're all fucked up now so it yeah yeah and you know eventually it's gonna catch you sick and shivering and it's just gonna start eating your asshole for two things yeah they they just bite him in the legs and shit but they got to be careful they don't get safe up a smells with his with his tongue Jesus Christ I use a tongue to smell what a creepy fucking creature Jackie's buffalo they're not natural to the area they've been at it in so they don't know what the fuck this Oh they've been added in a feed up yeah they died they say go to the watering hole and the Komodo dragons know they're gonna go to the watering hole just fucking wait for him and so he jacked him on the leg and then he's slowly making his way towards them imagine if that was you and you had to see that thing walking up the bank towards you some guy I don't know I I'm a person you're not supposed to eat me I can think and I can reason and I'm progressive and I have health insurance I have two credit cards they killed the kid I have to call someone don't eat me yet I have to make a call hold on let me get this tattoo huh don't eat me eat me I'm checking Twitter look there's a bunch of them around that one just going asshole first and you're feeling all a blood rush out of your body while this creepy lizards chewing on your butt I eat everything except those those boars heads because of the horns really if they get I'm inside the third

into monsters like that you look that fine I'd be terrified around them man why are you around them I was so cool well I found out when I was in Bali and I was like I probably go to somewhere else from there and that sky man from Jakarta was like you know how you're right next to the Komodo dragons you do that I was like what that's here and was just a couple boats and you're fucking there wow dude fuck that no Manny what if they got love it they almost got Sharon what's her mr. Tate Sharon Stone Sharon Stone's husband really yeah maybe they almost got him he was a newspaper man he was a like a reporter and or a journalist rather and he went to do something in a cage with Komodo dragons and he had socks on and the fucking thing thought it's white foot it was a zoo oh really anyway gotta what do you mean bit his foot bit the fuck out of his foot dude went to the hospital crushing his big toe a thrashing its body around yeah what he had to undergo foot surgery Oh come on son yeah I was a shoeless foot oh I thought it was a sock crushing his big toe ouchie wah-wah Oh the zookeeper asked him to remove his white tennis shoes to keep the five foot long reptile from us taking them for white rats so hey yo dude take your shoes off you'll be cool don't worry about it as long as it knows I'm gonna tack that foot it's like watched everything shoe off keep bad I really still had a shoe on the feeling he must have had as that thing is biting his foot that Zook here must be like I'm really sorry my severed tenders they had to reattach severed tendons and rebuild his big toe that was crushed by the Dragons Josh Jesus you have to piss again yeah do you have enough room in that you want to empty that'll be a half come on many sure yeah but there's only a little bit left side the picture won't get over spill don't overflow I went over to paying a professional at this man but here's the thing about animals like Komodo dragons and wolves I love the fact that they're real yeah it's one of the things that makes life fascinating is that there are these ruthless merciless predator Jaime's shielding his eyes from far his dick oh the image want to just put the image on me for a second this is educational you don't want to show is Jamie did you get away with doing this on YouTube or Instagram we're taking might be in trouble just because we mentioned that European censorship with the internet no where's the deal dude do you know that if you whipped your dick out and took a leak in front of a school you'd be charged as a sex molester dude I do that all the time and thank you for telling me because I will stop yeah for real like you say if you're walking past the school and I take a leak and you just innocently walk towards a patch of trees and you piss there and someone from the school calls the police because you had your dick out yeah you're dissing guys you know I was doing I know a dude who got charged with that I know somebody who we both know somebody who got who was hooking up with a girl on school property late at night they needed a place to pull over so they could fuck in the car Oh but since who's on school property but it's fucking 2:00 a.m. you know yeah they're trying to discourage that oh yeah I get that a lot of condoms thrown out the window at the fuckin showing up for school in the morning drop your kid off you kid slips breaks her hip because she stepped on a condom those little shiny school shoes the kids wear with the hard bottoms don't get good traction what others like rules about doing stuff within a thousand feet of school yeah so many schools in Hollywood yeah of you so much should happening within a thousand feet of them wasn't that one of the issues too with pot shops like that's how they yeah fuck with them too yeah I can't be anywhere near a church the church parts hilarious it's like if that's really the case is that one if that really is still the case but I get it though if you really believed and you really believe that your church was sacred and important to you you wouldn't want like one door down yeah I made you one door down but you it's not all churches not they're not the ones I'm like that with the lawns like you see in the movies a lot of them in LA are just like in between two apartment buildings but also the question is who gets to choose who gets to choose that like what how much distance between a church and a liquor store well let's I want to know is sell them liquor ok is it ok it seems like it's ok seems like a lot of people were doing it seems like a lot of people are buying it it seems like we all agree okay so if it is the case well I radius radius of a church not even up the block girls in Detroit was the same shops are also prohibited from operating within a thousand foot radius of a church school park liquor stores or other dispensary or or a drug-free zone such as a library hmm Ellison was closed by 8:00 p.m. other dispensary liquor to store other dispensary okay this is all this is all just this is a result of people go well I don't want them right next to this while I'm doing that but this is saying that they can't be close to a liquor store like a liquor store is the same as a church that's we're saying we're saying a pot a pot shop can't be the alternative to a business that's already established Oh like a liquor store so that's what they're saying don't quit booze yeah well they say and you feel weird so the liquor stores must have lobbied to have that put in there they must have figured out a ways you're a liquor store Union there's obviously that doesn't make sense like the church makes sense reluctantly I get it yeah it makes sense the store doesn't make sense the liquor stores to make any sense yeah like why can't I just walk right next door after I buy some weed and buy a beer why do I have to go 500 feet further they don't have them here but know how this stuff drive through alcohol places you just have a new car they have them in Phoenix yeah Louisiana yeah this place is we can drive through and get they give you mixed drinks mixed drinks yeah that's like how you can justify I'm not a bar well it's my passengers drink Wow I wouldn't drink and drive officer and Luisi I don't think I looked that up your drink your passengers can drive can drink Kendrick while your only driver can Louisiana's on the another level New Orleans is on a totally different level yeah well you with me in New Orleans we had this driver you sure no we didn't know we had this driver it was hilarious funny fucking dude I wish I could remember his name but he was cool shit we had him for a couple of days and when we're hanging out with his dude he was telling me that he got pulled over outside of New Orleans because he was walking on the street with an open beer forget where he was some other city and they pulled him over and he had two beers in paper bag and when they pulled him over he was talking to cop the cops like where you from and he's talking to the cop he pulls out the other beer and cracks it open and starts drinking it yeah and the cops like is there something fucking wrong with your head he's like what he goes wait where were you from he goes New Orleans he goes oh okay oh you don't know that's not a lot of do that anywhere else and he's like for real he's like why I'm not doing anything wrong I'm just walking I forget where the truck was but he was outside of New Orleans for sure yeah but he was saying that they that he had no idea that you couldn't crack open a beer and start drinking in front of a cop when he's asking questions dude nothing that's the best about Southeast Asia you get a beer you walk with it like a fucking free American you're just like out there you're not gonna do anything have a good time man there's too many dumb young dudes that would bring drinks and splash them on people and be walking on the street with open beers and be goofy I guess so maybe just here maybe here but London's got a little bit of that they drink outside no maybe not the streets they drink like an outdoor pubs I've seen it in England would people boozed up on the streets yeah beat the shit out of each other oh yeah I mean that's gonna happen don't put yourself in position where you have to fight all the time drink I wonder what the argument is for it's not about drinking outdoors or not it's about like don't drink so much right yeah don't get so drunk decaf you can do that in one space or you can walk and do it that doesn't matter I wonder what the argument is for a 2:00 a.m. like cutoff time yeah it's over it's all Christians shit dude is it it's all remnants of Christians shirt who cares why can't we just be up longer Miami it's like 5:00 a.m. and New York it's 4:00 or later a lot of places it's not at that here they're gonna change to LA two

liking it a couple times it's been pretty fun man just outfielder like boos up and like not to worry about getting home yeah he loves it I walk home from the stand he takes a cab you know it's the normal yeah he's a busy living in Brooklyn to live in a Brooklyn course he is that fucking hit no that's right for him for sure that's the spot yeah yeah I mean he was a Silver Lake kid and then he went to he's doing the same thing same like Williamsburg right big Park Slope same she wins where's past like it's over gentrified oh he's gone dude she's with style can afford it move in yeah it's my style yeah I saw I was watching one of those house flipper shows yeah uh you know what is that some of the real estate million-dollar listing that's what's called million dollar listing some New Orleans birthday folks and they had a house that was for sale in Brooklyn that was like a they built like a Georgia mansion yeah in Brooklyn Brooklyn in like 1920 and they you know they were trying to like put mansions like southern style mansions in Brooklyn it's like eleven two thousand square foot house Williamsburg really yeah I thought I had to go there because I would be able to port Manhattan and then I found out when I got there I'm like oh no no man it's cheaper now the cool parts of Manhattan where I live it's cheaper Jesus and the cool parts of Brooklyn why is that it got it's this gentrification has his path at first you have bad neighborhoods we're not talking about warehouse gentrifying that's different but like you know ethnic gentrifying first you have actually both so first you'll have criminals or warehouses and then the people can have like our cool artists who have no money they'll move in taking a giant loft for basically nothing because you got to worry about getting stabbed or having nothing around you they start adding the art to the area making it more interesting then people like Duncan and me come in where we're like we like it I like to be the front lines of this shit you know I need someplace to go like you know get some food mmm but there's still criminals around or like lack of stuff and then the rich people who don't have style of their own they move in and co-op the other people style and then you start getting too many like coffee shops and then they start changing the laws to drive out the people who live there mmm like it is a park where they all camped out in Gowanus and every Sunday they would cook out there and they started saying the rich people was like ah the smoke is going through my windows so he started making laws about how you can't have cookouts yeah and that pretty much just drove out the people who wanted to have that as far as their life they were just like help shit you don't make the law saying it's illegal to be ethnic but you make laws around it dude there's a there's a park down the street from here yeah we could go to it's like only a couple minutes away yeah and if you go there on the weekends it's it's like a festival it's like people use those barbecue you can have out there that gets they set up picnic tables they lay out a cloth on the picnic tables and paper cups and shit and they got coolers or porn like kool-aid and shit and they're cooking all kinds of different things on these these racks and there's like maybe five six families spread out in these areas that are doing that and then as kids are playing and everybody's running around it's a lot of people that live in apartments that don't have a lot like they don't have they don't back yard so now they just go to the park it's great it's great and there's like this sense of community but it's laughing they got music playing people are drinking yeah are you allowed to drink booze in the park how does that work I don't know I know tailgating you gotta use cans you can't use bottles but if you're sitting there on a pie think you can can you I think maybe look the other way kind of stuff if anything suck every you gotta be able to have a yeah cut some beers you're having a cheeseburger in the park that's how I mean some of these freedom laws are like I'm not gonna do anything man let me have a beer with my family what this doesn't hurt anybody everyone did that you're gonna have drunks my kid but that's not me I'm not that well let me do it what kind of diseases can you get from one of them Park grills who's cleaning that grill do one of the best bar because I ever had was on top of in Vail on top of the mountain so we were skiing I was skiing with his chef and he had a bunch of fucking chicken in his back marinating in one of those sags yeah so he's kept shaking it up his snowboard hitting jumps he's just marinating this chicken and then he's like hey you want to eat with us like yeah sure he's like oh no I was there going into the restaurant party goes no no out here just use that thing and it's just made grilled fucking chicken up on top of fucking why the Rockies it was so good so did he have like a little grill and his pack to know they had the public grill up there oh that thing yeah got some wood and stones going I guess oh wow people like to do that up there those things are so nasty so nasty but like I guess the idea is once the fire gets going nothing's gonna stay alive on it I guess yeah well then motherfucker gets red hot to the point we could sear a steak nothing surviving on that I mean this isn't that the whole principle behind cast-iron pans like you don't really wash a cast-iron pan don't you just sort of scratch out everything's there throw some water on it but like that dark blackness that you get from a cast-iron pan you know I don't know why but when I cook on one of those I feel like a fucking man I'm grill master but I feel like a man cast-iron frying pan I feel like a man if you give me a choice there's a cast-iron pan and some bitch-ass fucking heats the whole to hell the same temperature it's one of those us ones that you could like flip a cheeseburger nonstick uh-huh those are so gross and me and Martha use knows not sick pans and a lot of that got into your food because they've been cooking that shit for like ten years

you're doing it now yeah are you incorporating experiences that you had when you were on this walkabout and are you the other things about I love at my foot spa are you physically riding them or you like having these stores you trying to work out on stage or I do some that but but my new hours not going to be that so those will be like side bits mostly I'm saying I'm kind of hearing what Rollins said to about how he does it and it's like some time to process it you know use it as like references and things mm-hmm instead of like bits about that you know right you know we have like just a tagline about something and not the whole bit about something right right so just in terms of like yeah I incorporate it when it comes up when I start thinking about it Bill burr said it once where it's like with Segura and a long time ago like how do you write into our like what what are you write about because I don't know what's on your mind what gets you angry what gets you like riled up when you talk about it to your friends yeah that is right about that burns got an interesting thing going on too because he does that podcast where he rants yeah so he just it's just him ranting so his his like ranting muscle is really good Ernst it's incredible I tried to have my intros of my podcast your intros are great thank you really good I really love the one about Tom Segura and the bat and expensive taste that left going like that tasted me out of here variations and those things are some of my favorite parts your podcast like you're breaking down things and getting excited about things your enthusiasm for these things yeah I tried early on to realize like oh this is where ads go so I don't want to make it just addy right but like let's make it actual more content mmm and then if you have to throw an ad in there to a fine but like here's gonna be some good times as well yeah sometimes I don't even have that they still do fucking 25 minutes yeah why not yeah why not if it's funny if it's not all they are funny and it's also it's a different thing cuz you're getting a chance to see you sort of unedited just ranting just just thinking about stuff and talking yeah yeah somebody told me one I had one after Anderson loss for the first time and was just part of a podcast about this girl cuts herself we'll talk about that but like in the in the beginning it was almost an hour on what Anderson silver meant to me as a UFC Fan Wow and how would he'd love it was just this weird way to lose and it's forgot about it now but it was like yeah yeah I don't know it's fun but that went on for like so long yeah well that's was something that was a real thing to you it meant something to you and that's why it's interesting he was at my first UFC he fought Chris Leben my very first UFC you know I saw him become a champ I was at the fucking five and a half four and a half round crazy ending you know to uh to jail I remember being a ring with you and Dana and and fucking Superman what's-his-name the one championships a heavyweight and light heavyweight Randy Couture Superman whatever his name was what they call the constant natural whatever I don't think out the wrong name but whatever it is I was trying to figure out a nickname like the nickname Superman yeah but we're all just a ring and it was like we're all talking about whatever stuff and then one at a time one of us you could see them like thinking about how that fight ended four rounds plus of dominance by one guy and a last minute fucking triangle out of nowhere to keep this one of the best champions of all time still in power yeah it was just so fucking nuts and you see one at a time Randy or somebody I remember Andy doing after someone else did it they were just kind of go off like you seemed thinking about something I never shake the head go whoa and you're like oh you're thinking about that fucking fight it was right in the hallway right after yeah god it was crazy yeah there's a unique feeling that you get when you're recounting like a crazy event where someone knocks somebody our children our like Jesus we got a look at your face how many times after the UFC's have we've gone to dinner and be like fuck yeah Jesus Christ and I saw Berg at that same look after at the commerce store in the front after the baby bird no na I saw him from far away talking I was like hey are you talking about the baby bird yeah I could tell I can tell the way you're doing it yeah yeah so that's all I'm working I'll just build in my new hour and then I can get the fuck out of this garbage dump again just a garbage dump los angeles-hollywood how dare you how dare you yeah this is the place where you've buttered your bread sir no I like it the business and it makes me a little mad sometimes business yeah I think but like be your friend and advisor yeah I would say it's time to remove your so whether the other side you no longer do negotiate so it's fun to travel and stuff is what I made I think you're right Oh hundred percent listen man you all get along way better when you don't need them yeah everybody will be your friend yeah so anyway yeah that's all good working a new ID you're gonna do it all about Judaism all about Judaism think so well that's a good way to alienate the white supremacist yeah yeah I don't even care what the people who hate the Jews yeah sorry sorry guys a bit culturally insensitive you not even thinking about them we never found that video of the Evergreen professor throwing his hands around how are ya there's one video I've been pretty shorts in but I need to like double check and listen to make sure it's the partner talk okay so I sent it to me and I they sent it queued up like right where it is and it's it's so hilarious there's probably you know what it's queued up in a website if you google evergreen what is he the president ever gained pro in evergreen hand motions are a microaggression google that hand motions over mic and they have it there's a website for sure that has an article where they show the video and they have it queued up and when it's chewed up you can see the kids laughing when they get the teacher to put his hands behind his back I'm just like well see it that's them not understanding what they really are looking for there's a part of it feels like haha made you do it another part says that's the mic regression don't do that it's like if you believe that and don't laugh at someone for not doing any more what they're doing is just enjoying power these kids have taken over the school yeah that's it give me some give me some volume walks up the presents I put your hands down butch was done with his hands to his side yes dude and they're laughing at him she's waiting for an applause yeah she seems to not know other she goes trying to get off and what does he do about that he's clapping as well he's clapping - he needs uh he needs to seriously stop he's clapping - like you had a really good point you can't but some she's saying something we know we are you know that about just okay that version of that that super liberal left is feminists you know that version of that this is there's a version of that which is just the feminists uh-huh like that version of feminists yeah this like there's versions loggers you know this version of masculinity - right there's not right I guess is it though I don't know I never really understood me like - alright for more than a lot of what they're doing is having fun it's nothing like on troll like some of its like straight trolling can't you believe it well maybe it was a job I mean like my about some of it my lo ye na + surely that guy gets it so mad yeah Milo is so like just so theatrical so much of what he's doing it seems like dude I love it when they get on somebody and just like shit on them a little bit they get like someone's our God to them all Beyonce after lemonade hmm things like that if you shut on them a little bit you could get people so fucking angry you know it's great it's great there's never been a time like this arch fear and get so many morons mad at you but yeah but it's what I've noticed is that of the super liberal okay you know how like American sports fans are kind of dumb how dare you more more so than other places we're not very thought-out rude political like analysis isn't that smart no anyway our liberal left our feminism is some of the dumbest feminism in the world like other ones are more thought-out and more interesting and more like just thoughtful in general dude I think you left America you know became a fucking turncoat I'm hearing a bunch of bullshit yeah so what do you think though you should hear people talking they're way smarter than the people we have like like so our people are just Dumber saying this microaggression shit right what is that that's us that's having too much fucking free time is that is you've left behind what's actually wrong and you're jumping on which is a lot there's a lot wrong yeah so like worry about that and calm down Mike girl got you guys it's not like this better shit to do so you don't shouldn't worry about what actually bothers you this shouldn't bother you right you know take that same venom and put it into something that's actually happening there's this forced okay well like that girl that's sorta the girl that's Ted up there and Slyke your ancestors were not slaves whoever brought in our mind were you know and slavery has repercussions and then everybody starts clapping and it's like you're you're right but what is the point a leaf or what are we doing like yeah it's all obviously ancestors like when do we get over this ancestor thing like how many generations in do we do just treat people as individuals and what do they want some people got an advantage for sure white people got an advantage for sure it's not it's it's it's more so but it's not a hundred percent of the time so if I came from a from a divorced household I didn't write you know and my dad wasn't around my dad with my mom you know that can be a way worse and harder experience that the Cosby kids right you know right okay yeah so it's like just because you're this it might make the odds harder for you but it's not a hundred percent but there's an origins thing and one of the origins that every black kid has to face then when they think about it is that someone down the line was a slave and they're not slaves anymore but that's why people who look like him are here they're all here because someone brought them over here in Chains yeah there's still remnants of that right and there's some there's got to be a weird self-esteem or a self-identity issue attached to knowing that everybody knows that your ancestors for slaves and there's no certain like there's a certain thing that people do when someone has something and someone else wants it you if you have a group of people that's different it's like really easy to almost think of them as not you like that's how they've justified wars that's how sure so many people I by dehumanizing the other you know and this this thing that has to balance out that I guess is I guess just the echoes of that is like we have to get so many generations away from the from people being slaves and any repercussions of it socially I cannot we have to get so far away that it doesn't factor anymore where we don't care okay that's well expressed for sure yeah I like that that kind of like calm way to explain something rarely gets put out and of course it's screaming its yelling you know what like you're not teaching anyone anything the biggest problem on the left and the right but the ones that are angry the angry mobs is they never seek to educate they only seek to like punish also grandstand they want to make this because here in that lady's voice she was going for audience the audience clap three times didn't get it and was like I'll keep going she's seen Oprah she knows how to manipulate a crowd she knows how to get those people riled up yeah listen man that's part of being a person like that's half the reward for saying something that's right is the love that you get from people when you say that it's right and they recognize it and they go yes so people get addicted to that yes so they constantly do things that they think are at least perceived as being right and they get very vocal with things when they perceive those things are going to get a very big reaction for standing up against them yeah and it becomes this moral high-ground sort of grandstanding peacocking sort of a thing where they just are constantly trying to let everyone even know how uncool it is to do this and how wrong it is to do that like settle the fuck down yeah like we just a weird a weird thing and then sometimes they'll see something that doesn't quite fit in like they'll say they was trying to make you know how they make rape broader and broader and broader oh yeah which is I really does think does a disservice to rape it does to be able to make it seem like small anyway they were saying coercion is rape or if you talk someone into it yes that's right and then a bunch of men was like oh well if that's true then I've been raped a bunch of times in the super liberal left it's like we don't want to make that you don't want to make you be able to victim so okay that's no longer rape yeah coercion was one someone under the influence of alcohol which was very questionable yeah that's a weird one because we all know that there's different states of mind and that a woman who decides to get how to get a couple drinks and then wants to have sex if the man is sober I was a weird one it's supposed to be that you're not supposed to do it because she's under the influence like that was that was the argument that was too black and white so it's like I know a lot of women who were like oh I can't have sex without drinking a half a drink before I have sex and it's like oh well so then okay it's a split since they don't all think the same thing of course some of them the militant ones want to say you're a rapist now right and some of the other ones like no no women could take control for themselves they can have some drinks and lubricate themselves if they want to it's also really the only time we're ever asking people to like we're saying like you don't have control right you're not even responsible for what you're doing as opposed to like driving yeah like if you're under the influence and driving no one says hey it wasn't your fault that you plowed into that school bus full of kids with your car because you were drunk that used to be the rule you couldn't control it well it still is the rule but I'm saying like it's they'll say that if it comes to sexual intercourse right but they won't say that it comes to driving like no one's gonna say you couldn't consent to being behind the wheel you were under the influence it's not your fault but you're supposed to know enough like it's supposed to be deeply embedded in your head enough that you don't go into that car and start it even though the rock but sex you're like no no yeah yes you can't handle it yeah you can't have it you don't know what's going on it's like yes for drunk driver you ran over somebody while you were drunk driving I'm sorry Bravo it's like you know self-defense I was drunk same shit right I wouldn't do it on purpose I didn't do on purpose I was drunk that's why I lost control the car obviously it's hard to control the car when you're drunk right so that's what happened to me when did it become illegal to drink I don't know I don't know very good question I look that up we're not to want physics ease my my my friends and whatnot like they did it all right in the 70s are boys on it let's google it find out let's take a guess I'd say 50s 50s 61 that's how late in the 50s I'm gonna go with 69 okay this is fun to say that I think I'm wrong though 73 73 that seems so late maybe maybe hmm I feel like I should stick to the 60s the first date that adopted any sort of law was New York at 1910 yeah I didn't know that cars that twenties people were drunk two years into having cars hook it on your horse it's hilarious I'd remember looking this up I think like if sometime in the 50s or 60s or maybe even is up to like 1980 when mad started that uh the states that weren't adopting it we're gonna get stopped get funding for federal Road in the 80s like that so they had to adopt all the laws that's like how they forced everyone oh of course people would drink it would be a bunch of you'll drive man have you tried driving yet like it's awesome and if someone's like have you tried to drunk and think wow that's a great idea see that's where a horse is superior because a horse isn't gonna crash because the horse is so bottle pilot yeah yeah I mean it's almost like a form this house out on top of it it's like a superior form of travel in a lot of ways you have a relationship with this animal you know you up to hey there mister flapjacks or whatever the fuck his name is you pat them your good old boy we get you some feed and give you put the feed bag on my chooses food like what the fuck man that's probably a way better way of getting around as long as you're not allergic to horses yeah it's way way so if you allergic to horse in the West to living here how the fuck is a person alert the horses this is how weak our gene pools gotten folks yeah that's sad I feel I feel so bad for people that are allergic to animals and people that are allergic to pollen and people that allergic to wool a lot of people close to me have allergies it's it's so hard to watch because it's annoying like that there's a thing out there that can do that too that just about what the fuck is that doesn't even make any sense and it's not that it's not the thing self defense mechanisms no it's dumb it's a grass some some kids are super types of grass there's kids that look like they have celiacs yeah my kids are friends with them and you know you have to be real careful that they don't eat anything that has any wheat I think you can say yes be careful it becomes too much friends with them they have to have very success yeah that's crazy real super strict diets because they have an allergy I've heard about you think it's all hot yeah things happen to
