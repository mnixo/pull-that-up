don't crisis crash as much I don't think that's the issue four three two this time we're live ladies and gentlemen we are live with the great and powerful Russell Peters high and one of the baddest motherfuckers ever get into the ring - Lewis don't mess with the best that's a fact that you know you're walking around on this earth one of the baddest motherfuckers of all time verified 100% feel good about it - its kind of feel good yeah don't get in the new fights but you know what else you have your wits about you a hundred percent you're smooth and relaxed you know how did you do that oh I started out that way it's like you know Apple don't fall too far from the tree type of thing I've always been that way collective thinker soft-spoken and what you don't know about me what you don't know about me when you do know about me you love me even more do you exercise it all anymore boxing wise do ya hit the bag and well not not hit the bag I'm more into like working out with the weights it wasn't you know like it was hard for me when I retired that was the worst part what was the hardest just you know saying okay you know I'm eating more so I need to exercise coming I dunno exercising but when I start exercising I'm training for a fight right so it's like okay training training what am I doing this I'm not gonna fight but I'm still training for a fight so mentally I have to say to myself well let me try to solve things you know and play tennis and all these different sports which I can play and that kind of helped me a lot better yeah that is an interesting thing with fighters a lot of times when they're done they're done they just get look at my guy he's got these back in training camp but Maidana go why cuz you probably got an Instagram people started talking Chet is kind of fat that's what made me want to lose weight yeah people talking shit they were like holy fuck did you eat your whole cast you do look like you losing weight though you look pretty slim I lost 21 pounds with our with our dear friend Jack well hey Jitsu we'll peel that weight off yeah that's a fact yeah that's some strenuous shit you ever thought about doing jiu-jitsu likes he's scared of me he won't do it oh let me tell you when I was growing up I had I had friends that did wrestling I had friends that did kickbox and all these different mediums and you know we would always practice with them where this wrestling whether it's kicking whether it's doing whatever play fighting you did all that stuff yeah yeah because everybody always wants to test the boxer right and say well you know how does he throw up against a karate guy house if you're up against a kick box house if you're up against a MMA guy yeah they always fair financially better so you know for me I didn't really throw my weight around like that you know it's like don't mess with me okay if you mess with me something's gonna happen and then they don't really mess with me I kind of carry myself like that right because I'm so serious that sometimes like you know they can take they can sense the seriousness of it serious but still easygoing so I've no reason to push you right I'm some silent but violent it is an interesting thing though about about fighters is that you're when you think of exercise you think of exercises you're preparing for a big violent event yeah whereas for most people they just don't want to be fat they want to look good they want to get in shape and you know it's a lot of people on Instagram they're just working out really hard every day but there's no reason right you had a reason yes yeah so when the reasons gone it's like hmm now what how do I maintain this shadeless and without maintaining that lifestyle yeah you think of another reason yeah like you you know you look good by the way Thanks does look good no thanks has seen me since I was 147 pounds really you were 147 pounds at one point down I first started boxing I was 147 how old were you 15 okay I met him probably when I was 16 oh really yeah you guys have known each other that long yeah I know his parents yeah Wow and his and his mom his brothers yeah queer deep realized that it was like you know I see him as a big star now I seen in movies and commercials rescuing people this is the kid you know he's grown up he's a little busy ready to sell a mixtapes in the 90s he was already world champ and I'd be playing the mixtape there we go sell me that mic I just made it he's like God give you 20 bucks I'm like you just made a hundred menos can't you give me a hundred bucks yeah well you know everybody who's making tapes back then those days when people are aggressively trying to sell tapes on the streets I wasn't even trying to sell it I just playing it in my car and he's like yo yeah yeah the new shit going on you know that was yeah the real shit so I had to get a get it I didn't I didn't have that contact to get the music so he had the music contacts look a lot of people don't know Russell's a little JIT DJ and reluctantly gave me mixtapes reluctantly yes good move um when you know when you see him wrestling with people on TMZ you see that shit where the man with the jewels trying to always twice see what happened after you didn't throw no punches go coach get his neck juice if you watch it you see I went for his arm to go down and to get his neck yeah and then the other guy in front of him pulled him down and I couldn't get the neck could you tell us what happened I mean I explained well all I seen was a guy walking out and you grabbed him no let me tell you what happens I'm there looking at a ring right yeah and that guy sitting down earlier had checked to see if the door was open he went out to spit and now he really he thinks the doors open so now he thinks he's just gonna get up and walk away with this ring this is where he makes his little move and then they locked the doors and then I'm standing there I'm like what's going on and I'm like he takes a swing of my friend's father and then I go nah no I tried to get his neck and that guy pulls him you see there's a lot of opportunities get the neck there so no but I'm trying he's a big strong fucking gun to that you got to go over the top trying but I had three layers on I got a jacket a sweatshirt and a long sleeve shirt and that is an issue and then so then I try to go for the arm but everybody sees everybody's in my way so I'm like give me the arm just let me get the I move dad move dad that's uncle David and there I got the arm the backward base now I'm pushing the arm down and you'll see I locked the wrist here as soon as I locked the army says he says okay mmm stops moving right there goes okay okay okay yeah I got the wrist you see the little wrist lock is invincible style that was my friend senpai shallow there you go wrist locks are legit he got up again no no this angle how different I don't know how far we was gonna make with a ring you see um see that wall on my cousin is hiding yeah when he was trying to get out he whacked his head against that wall oh no and and he cut his ear open the the thief yeah so whatever happened him got arrested it was this in Toronto no New York City no shit right in the do it jewelry district yeah so that's what a like ill planned out move you know that they know that people grab things and run away well there's that and he apparently Skye had been coming to store for six months scoping out scoping the place oh that's all he's cooked it up poorly that's hilarious yeah it's a silly do you have to go to court or anything but I don't know I haven't heard anything since do you worry and I just put him in all I was trying to do was hold him there cuz right all the doors were locked I'm like it doesn't make sense again to a scrap but the guy if I could just put him in a chokehold or a lock then until the cops come but the thing is like you could injure him if you injure him then they sue you well yeah not really yeah as ridiculous as it sounds right work well Russell's not really a law enforcement officer I could see if you had what it would've been dangerous everybody in the store if he was running wild true yeah so I mean looked he's lucky didn't crack him yeah you know I just locked him up and I said all right as soon as I lock the what because okay and I go kid good and then he had one knee one knee down and one leg up hmm and I kicked that leg out so he would leave people on both names get rid of his base yes right I was trying to move his brain moves the baby I got a question okay now if the whole thing happened again how would you do things different I would have told everybody get in my way so I can get him in a choke and okay would you just put him asleep yeah yeah it's put him asleep lay him down yeah lay him down no I'm in and went back home and obviously feel good about yourself did you kind of run the whole thing through your mind a couple of times like yo this could happen or what could happen no I started thinking after if he had a gun or if he had a knife but I'm like if he had a gun he would have pulled it out right away Wow yeah yeah you know he's not here to surprise you with a gun he's here to scare you with the gun well there's all that many dudes on him - good luck pulling that gun out yeah yeah one of us would have got shot but they probably my father's not if you do you probably got real urgent if you saw them reaching for something yeah would have changed yeah I think knees to the head would have kicked everything everything I know I what - all the cars different things you could do like if you want to practice karate you ever like don't want to do something different that's why I was asking about jujitsu you know when you're a world heavyweight champion boxer after why like what all this shit can I learn I kept arm locking earning I kept tugging I'm putting him in a car yeah you know great Bruce Lee fan I love fighting movies and you know martial arts has always been a part of my life and I say that because every fight I fought before I fought that fight I watched the martial art movie really yeah like Chuck Norris Bruce Lee that kind of shit I can't leave them and all the real shit yeah so you know those kind of movies Carter Wong and type stuff in hmm yeah I like that and that just got me in that mental state like you know do you watch MMA today yeah do you would you ever watch it and go if this was around when I was fighting would I do this um the only thing I think about that because you know like I said I was in the wrestling in in I did wrestling when I was younger and boxing as well so I didn't know they could combine them too until I got older but you know my focus was more on boxing but you know if they get paid a lot of money I probably would have done it mmm yeah that's how a lot of people feel I think I think it's like right now the money is not quite there it's not quite it's for some people at Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey for the other folks it's not it's not enough to get a guy like Earl Spence to jump over yeah you know no and then I see a lot of I seen some boxers actually good at boxing actually just win the fight on boxing cuz they're so good with their hands yeah and but your stance has to be different you can I have your lead leg out in MMA that's the problem you can't stand the sideways yeah yeah you gotta you gotta square up you'll get lit up I don't know I stand sideways even in the fight because I know that I stick that leg out there for them to come come at and obviously you know it's easy to grab a leg but to me I don't think fighting should start that way anyway nobody when you start fighting usually punches are thrown quick then it lasts a couple seconds nobody really just goes through your legs and let's say they say okay I'm gonna go for his legs and take him down nobody named I may kick your leg yeah they tell you can't walk the kick leg kicks are brutal you have been leg kicked yeah yeah it's rough a guy on the leg one time and it's like I couldn't move and I'm like thinking if we got in the fight kick him in the leg and gave me a dead leg like this I don't know what I would do so yeah and if it's a guy like your size like a Rico Verhoeven like whose glory world heavyweight kickboxing champion they just keep their hands up and chew your legs up one or two shots to your legs and it's a horrible feeling yeah it's like doesn't move right it just gives out I write on the side of your knee oh well you know what you know you guys look like you've accepted that I was like I go mad yeah some kicks me my leggings like yo you kick me my leg I don't think anybody's kicking you in your leg in him did you ever see when Shannon akin tried some kickboxing no Shannon Briggs fought Tom Erikson no no no he fucked him up Shannon got leg kick though and he said he you know chanted talk see Solaris it was champ he goes it hurt so bad but I try to play it off champ he got hit with one leg kick then he got a hit with another one but he touched him with like a jab to the body and Tom Erikson got a little cocky here it is right here he he fought when he was in like this transitionary period and they offered him a lot of money like right there he got leg kick by this guy and the guy Tom Erikson they fought is really more of a wrestler he kicked him twice and Shannon he actually broke it down for us on the podcast but he said his leg was hurting so bad and he tried to go the guy into thinking that he could punch with him see he got hit again he's like oh Jesus he's letting him hit I would knock that guy out yeah but he you think you would just let him do that but once you get hit with one of those things like that it's so crippling to your leg you don't yeah well you're right because like I said you know I got hit there and I was like well it couldn't move the thing is locked up huh you put Shannon to sleep in yeah it was a great fight to Ericsson tried to box of it for some strange reason he got into this crazy idea at like right there boom lipped goodnight yeah and that's it he's cut the one chill chill chill kickboxing yes kickboxing was there wearing gloves when know she loves no shoes aren't ya aren't you supposed isn't Shannon Briggs supposed to at least kick a couple times well you know if he knew how to but I think he went into there thinking you know I'll just crack him with a punch and knock him out what she did you know he ate a couple of leg kicks but it's hilarious when you hear him break it down he's dead how old do you know me yeah I'm under hundred under hundred yeah under hundred but you can't be any more than like wait 45 47 oh thank you very much thank you very much how you all doing that 51 say you're a great guy you're great you don't want to say people have internet out there so they'll just look how old is he 53 yeah you look great thank you you do right doesn't he he's always looked good but when you were like you were you're one of those guys who did the smart you retired and you've just retired yes you know which is I respect so much we were just talking about Marvin Hagler the other day man when Marvin Hagler retired he's like good night take care everybody lost a controversial decision to Sugar Ray Leonard he said he said okay I'm gonna go do some movies and that was it he just never came back it is so rare that a fighter does that well you know what Marvin was disheartened like a motherfucker fourth boxing though he hated it he was like I'm out yeah yeah you know boxers go through so much and it's like one day know when it's time when a boxer says it's time to quit they know it's time because gone through so much and they realized that it's a lot of hard work for me I've been boxing since I've been 15 so you know in training hundreds of hours training hundreds of hours working out resting working on technique sparring all these different things after a while you know you have to read you reach that height where you say okay that's enough and sometimes you know people managers and trainings and promoters they don't want to tell the box with us enough because that's how much they're making money off of that box or every time steps in the ring right so did you have a conversation with Emanuel Steward about it absolutely yeah and who made the decision did you guys make it together I made the decision he wanted me actually to go on really yeah because I wanted to you know Tyson was my main nemesis and you know he's he's a boxer that I would I definitely wanted to fight before I retiring and I didn't know if it was gonna happen or not so I actually stuck around for a couple more years for that fight to happen got him one throughout history people would be saying Oh Tyson we don't wanna know or Lewis were the one I wanted them to know who growing right and then after that after the Tyson fight you know Manny said listen Chris goes around that's a new generation you can beat the the guys from this generation and the guys from the next generation I'm like yeah that sounds good so he kind of talked me into doing that fight because I wasn't really gonna good do that fight mm-hmm and then you know that was a year after Tyson and I didn't really want to box him straightaway I wanted to bug somebody else because the main never insists was Tyson and you know once I once I beat Tyson you know I could relax a little bit I relaxed for a year and then getting back into box in a box Klitschko was my first fight which was a mistake to the fight 17 17 days notice and my worse I beat him at his best why was it such a short notice fight because the opponent that I actually picked to fight didn't fight didn't want to fight me he actually said no what was that supposed to be Johnson from oh yeah Kurt Johnson Novus can you were doing him a favor I think let's go felt that he was doing him a favor listen tape let me take the fight I've been training for two years for this guy I'm ready and then we'll give you the first shot after I win that's what was promised to him Vitali has such a weird style didn't he yeah he did and that's that kickboxing style coming to play a little bit because he would throw a punch and lean back like this and that's the first time I've actually seen that style yeah and you know if I didn't reach out with my right hand as far as I did I would never have caught him with that cut mm-hmm and it was that long right hand that caught and just at the end of my punch when he leaned back and he couldn't lean back anymore that made his eye cut yeah he was a very strange fighter in terms of his style just the way a hands were always down there's a very weird way of moving very unorthodox because he was such a big guy who sees what seven yeah there was he was part of the biggest guy you fought right yeah you never fuckin Zyliss did you Michael Grant was big Gonzalez are boxed in kneeling okay Luis Gonzalez that was named right yeah Cuban guy yep they are look at look how weird the way he fights is just such an awkward way of moving him it good with the right hand held I see me holding around the neck up and up from Muhammad Ali he said if you Hurley call a good guy around the neck you can tell when he's gonna move mmm Wow but he was he was good in the in the first few rounds after the first three rounds yeah well people don't realize about this fight I wasn't fighting for for 12 rounds I was fighting to knock this guy out because you had it in your mind yeah this is the first time you ever see me going forward in the fight this guy's bigger than me I'm coming forward and I'm throwing punches he's catching me but those were the early rounds although he's two inches taller than you you look bigger than him this is a fella simply physically yeah you're wider you know when when you look back on your career like do you have like a most satisfying victory yeah what is it awesome rock say that house gonna say the rematch the first or the second the second when a guy when a guy beats you like that and then you know you could have beaten him or you should have beaten them is that what bothered you so much no you know it really bothered me is the fact that I gave him an opportunity I gave him a fight when I'm basically waiting for Tyson and I have to keep busy I'm looking down the list of who to fight he's number seven I realized that he's durable he's not not one of these guys that get knocks out easy so I wanted to give my fans you know a proper fight box the best guy out there not bucks the easy guy that's easy to get knocked out I don't want to go home in two rounds so and then another reason a lot of people don't know I went to Africa to fight because Muhammad Ali went to Africa he fought in Africa so I wanted to do that I wanted to be I wanted to fight not for guys you know I say I'm a world champion so I need to fight all around the world so that's what made me go to Africa the only thing about Africa is I didn't know that it was such a high altitude up there and for me to have a fight I should have got there a lot earlier but I was doing Ocean's eleven at that time you say oh you were doing a movie I wasn't doing no movie I was sitting around half the time waiting for them to change the lights then go out and go out there for two minutes and then go back and sit there for another two hours well they changed the light so what are you training it all well that was happening yeah I was training but it wasn't like there it wasn't the conditions of training you know I needed a bag I needed sparring partners me up there a lot students so you just kind of exercise yes how many thousand feet was it above sea level higher than big beer it was Cape Town right so more than six wow I didn't know that yeah it was kind of weird because when I start working out I was like throwing punches then I found myself going so had to take two steps back on like oh no don't tell me this fight it's gonna be one of those fights we have to take my time so I basically went out there taking my time I realized he's dealing with the same thing I'm dealing with although he was there a lot earlier but you know I had a couple of things going wrong boxing at 4:00 in the morning they couldn't find a big enough ring then they when they put the ring together it was like eighteen by nineteen so and then the the punch that actually hit me I actually thought I was gonna block it but it came around this side I put my hat I put my hand up to block it but it came around hit me one of those things were a man threw a terrific punch which my chin happened to be in the way of mmm what is it like when that's over and you're sitting there and you know you lost but you know that under the right circumstances this guy is not at your level in fact you know my problem was solved before I got out of the ring I knew what I did wrong which was the the greatest thing that ever happened to me is like on another day he wouldn't throw a lucky punch like that he wouldn't hit me and he wouldn't have a ref that you know was on his side as well how was the ref on his side um when I say the rest on his side you know he called it a little early oh yeah I got knocked down in the second round I'm the champion right at least give me a chance not waive the fight strip right right you know you've seen you seen the Deonte like you know if that was the referee counted him out straightaway yeah that's what stopped it at the press conference fuckin 12th round that right left that Deon he landed the fact that Tyson got up and then won the remainder of the round that is crazy yeah I am so frustrated that fight it's not happening again man every you know I'm looking at the heavyweight scene and I'm looking at obviously Joshua Joshua from England and you know he had the opportunity to fight the ante and didn't take it I'm like if that was me I would have took that chance because you never know what happens down the road likes what's happening yeah and you know Timmy's being put on the shelf now he has to box somebody that nobody really wants him to box is he fighting next baby a baby my love baby baby Miller big baby Miller yeah you know big baby Miller I haven't seen too much of him I don't know too much about him but you know he's talks a good fight I knew you I know anyway waited over 300 pounds at one time Andy and yeah and you know now he's got an opportunity to fight Joshua so he's taking full advantage of it like he should but you know I don't see anything in his history to show me that he can beat Joshua you move you peek and he can he can bang now he can bang if you dare - bang - Joshua's got feet he's gonna move he's not gonna stay there and bang he's an excellent boxer yeah he's gonna be a smart boxer in this fight allegedly we'll see right I mean never know yeah I mean this these are one of those things where I think this is where Anthony's got to be extra careful because Miller's gonna train twice as hard and if Joshua doesn't train like he's fighting Deonte right he's gonna he may take it for granted make a mistake and you can do that I've done that I've done that it's a journey it's nothing it's nothing that he's done on purpose it's not it's like it's a mental thing yeah it's a mental thing like when you find Marvel vich yeah that guy wouldn't go home wouldn't go home I was at that fight gave me a lot of trouble Lennox barks this guy run the ring for 12 rounds like literally the guy's head snapping back and this guy's not going not really well yeah it was going nowhere that is that's got to be a weird feeling too when you know how hard you punch and you see a guy just eating them like some people just are built weird they just can't take a shot no I learned that coming up I learned that like you're some guys that are tough to the head a weak to the body ah some guys are tough to the body weak to the head and some guys just made out of rocks yeah yeah yeah it's almost like a ignorant bliss they just don't know they're supposed to feel I don't know I mean I really think it's a physiological thing I think some guys can just take a shot they just they're just built better sometimes I've been in fights were gone in the man's hit me on the chin first couple minutes and it's like II just glanced off my chinna it's like I hated a hard a poncho and it didn't hurt me and I was like what happened to a punch he was so hard you hit you on the chin everybody was saying yo did you see that punch you never felt a I'm like no and when I look at tape of it it's like wow I did get it mmm is it because like are there a bunch of factors like how much you got hit in training how well you feel coming into the fight yeah where you're at in your career yeah there's a lot of factors like for instance let me give you a good weekend factor if you haven't box for two years and all of a sudden you step into the ring and it's a title fight and you box you can the first good hit you get is gonna concuss you really because you haven't been getting those hits for that like two years now this man hit you were the two years and you're getting used to it and you've have you felt it and you've gotten over it you need to get over that hill is it a mental hell it is a mental health because even for me for me when I haven't fought for a while you know I go out there until I get hit once I get hit that wakes everything I was like yo this is not supposed to go like that you're not supposed to hit me I'm supposed to hit you so I guess I go in so the Hasim Rahman fight after it was over were you worried that you were gonna get a we're not gonna get a rematch yes I was very worried in fact we chased him to three courts around the world and he didn't want to fight me and I you know if I was in his position I wouldn't want to fight me either because you know I'm coming back for revenge plus there's a big money fight out they were Tyson brunch he so so happened to say after the fight no more Louis Tyson no more Louis Tyson and he actually left South Africa without visiting Mandela like why you go Africa and I'll visit Mandela mmm I did he just want to get out of there yeah that belt yeah and that's seven million dollars that he got off of Don King mmm so the fight got made again because after the third courtroom the judge says who signatures this Hasim said it was his you signed it yes well you got to give him the rematch this is you signed it to give him a rematch so you have to give a rematch so I didn't want to hear that so I was happy saw the Rema how long did it take two years two years and then was all that all those brawls in the remember the ESPN studio when him and Rocklin got into a fight the table and everything yeah the Knicks was wearing his big Steve Harvey suit let me tell you was this thief RBC too because I had this I have a slippery shoes in the world I didn't come there to fight right okay that's a lie you know do press slippery shoes are the worst if anything goes down you get those leather shoulder oh my god carpet you know let's just give up that's what you gotta learn jujitsu yeah now when you were in that time period I don't remember did you have fights in between yeah how many fights did you have after Rock oh no it didn't have no fight no fighting no I'm not trained for Rahman just waited yeah so it took you two years two years that must been so frustrating it was it was because you never know if you're gonna get the fight or not or you know these guys are running from you they signed to fight a rematch because you know now they didn't want to sign it I remember when that right hand landed I remember that I was watching at home and I threw my arms up in the air I was like oh shit yeah yes I went to sleep sleep sleep hammer let's just check this out man yeah I mean for a long time coming you waited for it you know for this this fight Rahman couldn't catch me because my speed was different you know in South Africa was a lot slower now he got kind of frustrated because he couldn't get his bone yeah oh man no at the top of the shoulder tears let him count still oh that was a phenomenal putt that was probably one of the most satisfying one punch knockout so I've ever watched yeah because I knew what you had gone through and I knew like everybody knew you were one of the greatest of all time and to have you get Kayode like that first of all it made it endeared people to you in a way because it showed your vulnerability but also your character and your ability to come back which is not easy man when you get stopped like that like psychologically it's got to be fucking with your head let me tell you the first time I lost everybody was coming up and shaking my hand and said well what are you gonna do now like me what am I gonna do now yeah well we need to know we can go back and win my championship okay you know they didn't think it was gonna be possible but I'm thinking Muhammad Ali gained the championship three times yeah so I've only lost it once I can do it again it takes a special person to do it and I can do it do you do you feel like there was like two stages of your career like pre Emanuel Steward didn't post yeah absolutely there's two sizes of them to then if you look at in service like he went from like a like a skinny a skinny kid to a man like a just giant fucking man out of nowhere yeah the pre the pre man used to was obviously you know me learning how to be a professional learning to fight pro and then once I got to Emanuel we just like yo he said hey you're a great fighter you know he used to move around a lot we've gotta bring that back I like it okay cool so the movement he brought back he taught me a couple crunk tricks mm-hmm you know that check hook and different things that the cron fighters do which works well and you know he was easy to understand and what I liked about him what he said I can do I could accomplish he just told me what to do I'll do it yeah if he said Linden we needs to win this round I'll win that round mmm yeah you had that kind of relationship right yeah he was really one of the great masters you know there's there's certain masters when it comes to like boxing training like when you would hear him discuss fighters like I really loved hearing him do commentary as well yeah because he would discuss fighters and what they need to do and he was always just dead-on he just knew things he understood boxing so comprehensively he just knew what a fighter needed to do so I was so excited when he started working with you because it was like well that's that's exactly what Lennox needs so was HBO because you know it's funny I'll do fights on HBO and they would say how he's doing this he's not doing this he needs to do more and needs to throw the jab more then Emanuel start working for me it's like always doing the job he's doing well I was like oh this is what you need you need a great coach anytime you go in on TV that the commentators respect and they'll talk good about the boxer but if you're not a good trainers like what do they need to talk about if they talk a lot of shit in boxing commentary oh yeah and they let you know whose side they're on yeah they always like you know you could tell about how they're guiding your brain to watch the fight well they also they talk a little shit it's more like sports commentary like mixed martial arts commentary yeah I don't I don't do that I don't really talk shit ever I mean like occasionally if something's egregiously bad I'll talk about that you know there's real issues here yeah but I try to I try to just very new both of them art I try hard at that because I wasn't always you know I've had and I've learned how to do it on the job nobody really knew how to do there wasn't a lot of people doing it before I started doing it what sucks for you cuz you're friends with all the fighters yeah it's hard when you watch a friend of yours fuck up another friend of yours yeah that's hard what about a friend of yours that's doing something wrong that needs to do something right do you tell him yeah I told probably ah mostly fun for me I would like to I wish I was like that I wish I could do that but you know people want more truth out of me so I try and bring it across in a soft way and not make it too harsh I would bring I would say there's issues like I see something if I see like a vulnerability oh I'll discuss that but if there's something that someone needs to work on adieu I'll try to pull my side you know but most of them know you know just there you know like MMA fighters I'm sure a lot like boxers so there's different kinds of humans and some of them are just fucking wild and those wild ones you know a lot of times they never become champion but they're the most exciting people to watch like like Micky Ward like Mickey Ward's fights with a Toro Gaudi there's some of the greatest because they were the way they matched up some of them I would never want one of my friends to fight like that two lunatics in one ring but God man those fights were chaos though everybody knew that those guys were never gonna beat Mayweather they're never gonna beat the best guys but god damn they were fun to watch yeah yeah some crazy like generations prior Arguello almost almost except they went back and forth back and forth you know who was it that uh had an arm injury and still boxed was it Micky Ward now wasn't it Bernard Hopkins when he fought Antoine Echols he might be wrong you mean a black a permanent like a broken arm someone got their arm broke in a pool though that was a it was Antoine Echols it might have been against Hopkins or was against somebody but somebody the guy picked him up and slam dislocated a shoulder but he and then the ref was like I stopped the fight like no no no and he knocked the guy with a left hook ins got slammed and they stopped the fight then he came back and won the rematch remember that uh yes yeah I recall I recalled them guy would knock it him out in the next round with his left hand only was that Hopkins it might have been Hopkins Eccles if you know I'll tell you what man one of the hardest fights for me to watch was Hopkins versus Joe Smith that wasn't that was knocked out and fell out of the ropes and landed on his head I was like man that is just first of all the fact that there was no padding on the ground this is God this is Bernard Hopkins it's one of the greatest of all time and this is how this is set up you know a nod they don't use they don't put them in the ground they need to have something there like knowing there's an apron know that little tables they have to put more people around the ring well anybody's comes flying out yeah that's how they do in Japan yeah I can pride they would have guys like waiting by the side of the ring to the stop guys from phone on the ring because they would use rings which I don't recommend for MMA mmm this is this pros and cons the the pro is that the the cage the cage kind of like you can kind of hold a guy against contagion you can't really hold a guy very well against against the ropes here it is right here see he I mean like you fell though like right on his head man I mean I think that's concrete yeah it is he went through and somebody's you up the fights over yeah you know you get disqualified the minute somebody helps you back into the ring oh really yeah you have to get up on your own and get back in on your own Oh little is interested details since the slight of ruin to fight for him if he was okay yeah well if he was okay if he fell and then someone helps him get back up yeah the tech no it's interesting yeah somebody be Sean Jenna get up but nobody knows if he's all right or not right especially when you see him laugh it's your nature to run and help well it's also he's 50 or fit in one yeah I was right yes he 51 yeah he was not young yeah in that fight when you see a guy like him like how the fuck does a guy like that defy the odds and defy time I mean it's just a skill level experience experience intelligence and Hopkins is an intelligent funny he's like you know you watching fight he's smart yeah it doesn't spend one day out of shape yeah he's clean yeah doesn't party yeah he to this day I follows Instagram he's always training he's always exercising still look slim still looks good yeah he's got true focus yeah it's interesting that that he became that way like in his estimation because of prison time you know going to prison turned him into a disciplined man you know like realizing like like this is rock-bottom I fucked up I need to I need to get my life in order and did and you know imagine the people out there that commit a crime spend three four years in jail because some stupid crime they could spend that time training and being the world champion yeah that's something yeah at anything will just just develop use that time to develop yourself develop your mind you know I mean when when Hopkins was they were already riding him off when he fought Felix Trinidad remember that everybody thought Trinidad was gonna run him over him for the shitty pulled in Puerto Rico and he had to make that like six or seven foot jump yeah to the ground and he was skaters gonna break his legs larious yeah I forgot about that that was crazy they chased him out of the stadium yeah well I'm sure Tito had so much on his mind in that fight so much emotions you know and then that was the mental warfare that Bernard went brought into that one for sure but then also he was just - good yeah he was too good I mean he was just any was too big he had to hard like Trinidad really was a lighter weight fighter than that it was a junior middleweight yeah Corona did that same thing almost got done - mm-hmm exactly threw it down oh man that was crazy yeah that was crazy and you know this was a thing Bernard was like 36 at the time look at him they're all swinging at him and shit that's that jump he had to do he was trying to get out of there for real if he just turned they would have stopped returning would probably oh what am i doing chasing a tiger chasing tiger and you catch it you got a real fucking problem you know did you ever have any thoughts at all once you'd finally retired like maybe one more did you ever have any thoughts like that well you know I told people like I'll take I take my pajamas off for a hundred mil serious come with the baby show me the paper hmm have to be against AJ maybe no but when you'd beaten Tyson you'd beat Tyson that was kinda at the end of his stage too right yeah I wasn't the same guy like I I looked at Tyson's history you know he's coming from the same history I'm coming from you know and he spent some time in incarceration while he was incarceration I'm still out there fighting and training hard he didn't have that grab in there so when when he came out it's like you know he's training again he's doing what he what what he knows not what he loves but what he knows dusk was gonna make him some money that's gonna put the food on this table so it's like I look at old-time fighters and say what made them stay in boxing so long that's the only thing they knew right they didn't they're not gonna be no singer or dance or whatever they only know boxing and this is where they get their money from so they that's what that's what forces and back into the ring especially especially olden days that's where they were called prize fighters because it they wouldn't make enough money to to make a living unless you were like a huge I get Jack Dempsey or Ray Robinson a Robinson Rob fought way way way passes yeah again cuz they were making good money at the time but not the money that they would have been making if it was today well there was not I mean you know you had to go see it live you know like how much did ya get paid for the radio who was it how was it fight on the radio was it Jack Dempsey gene tiny that was the first million-dollar gate I think so one of those arrear so did that fight I think and that create what is a million dollars back then Ted sets a lot of money back then so within the 1920s right yeah Jack gene tiny injections gene Tunney yeah um when when Tyson was in jail he must have been doing something cuz he came out jacked like he looked good like he came out looking different yeah and he ever looked like six-pack fully built when he fought Peter McNeeley he was terrifying but like physically he looked really good too look you look better than he ever looked yeah more whipped than ever so when he went any was a little chubby yeah well you know what is it a doing there yes nothing else weights yes oh fuck dudes how many dudes before it's enough time you're in there for yeah that was him when he came out yeah he was shredded yeah it was it was so much more muscular so he's probably he probably couldn't do any sparring I doubt they had a heavy bag but they probably had a weight room you know but you can fight you can fight in prison he was like 28 29 there it depends on what prison right yeah yeah no I'm saying even fight just fight I'll fight people yeah yeah yeah you know you know somebody would have tried to start some shit oh I'm sure I'm sure not I'm hard even you know yeah I bet I bet he had to listen to a lot of shitty things regard it's funny when I seen him be arrested taken from the courtroom and they got they must have got the biggest guy they could ever get to go put handcuffs on him or something like that anyway situation that yeah I hope a lot of people stay away from yeah when he went away did you feel like damn it like I'm gonna miss out on that fight that I want yes straightaway it's like oh no I'm gonna have to wait and delay my retirement oh so you were waiting you were considering retirement even before he was incarcerated yeah Wow interesting Thanks facing the bow fight bull fight chicken bull you know you figured that chicken bow so we get all the chicken you got them ridiculous but ridiculous bold shaking bow tried to pick a fight with me the other day Danny really the other day he did yeah we're out of fight in LA where they called all the great ones on Gerry Cooney me Foreman Spinks was there and what was he doing he wanted to stand beside me and take a picture I'm like dude you can't stand beside me god damn we're all understand I'm like dude you're gonna have to move so Gerry Cooney kind of helped us out there while saved him cuz he yeah he had a rough time yeah the difference between a guy like you who gets out who speaks perfect and a guy like him he's he's the the warning you know that's the warning to the young fighter you know you see the the older guy who you know I saw an interview with him and it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen it was horrible because I go back and I think about those fights with Holyfield those fucking crazy Wars insane and you know you see he paid that price man yeah he paid that price and you can hear it when he's talking now it's rough its rival is I think the good news is now we're on the other side of Fighters coming out that punchy I think with all the rules and changes that have been made well it's you won't you won't meet as many punchy guys as you met from back in the day like you listen to Pernell you listen to ridiculous and a Meldrick Taylor mm-hmm use a lot of guys now bad now yeah he's a little and pranaam we got hit that he was the best but anymore from you know cocaine makes you slurry work I don't know man you know you do enough shit you know what if he drinks he drinks a lot how's it drinking I got drunk with poor not once well they say with older fighters is what an even older football players is they become addicted to alcohol because like they're they're searching for something to try to like recalibrate their brain you know I mean there's a scientific explanation to it that people talk about people with traumatic brain injury often become Hawks it's like they're trying to get some sort of a dopamine rush could also you can also use the alcohol as a justification as to why you're slurring your speech well I know a dude who's a MMA fighter who is he skis punchy he's had a bunch of shots and this motherfucker will have one drink and you can't understand a word he saying yeah it hit so hard so hard it's like it's it's confusing it's like how would tell you that drunk and then you realize oh this is both things it's both things it's it's the brain damage and alcohol combined just the wheels come off the carry it's bad yeah it's awful but you you you've made it out perfect man you know for us so far so far yeah years will tell yeah yeah and worried about that not really like a I try and keep my mind active I play a lot of chess yeah how often you play chess every day really yeah do you play online yeah I play online yeah whoever whoever jumps in the bottle how good are you yeah they're pretty good as a bully you he is no I added me cuz I go to his house he like you want to play chess I go I don't know just play I play just beat me anyway let's get out of here move bring somebody to play do you study chess not as much as I should I just play often and you know when you play often there's you know people will come out with the same moves and it's like oh I've seen this movie you want know what to do right but you know it depends there's people that use their pawns to wage war mmm user Midnight's or the bishops in combination so it really depends on what type of player they're I'm a you right I'm a bully player I like playing yeah you know what he is the Joe Rogan of pool to Lennox of check well listen I've in my defense Lennox challenged me he wants to play I was to layer just people don't challenge anybody on their own table Lennox challenged Joe doe in a pool before the podcast and Joe fucking cleared the table before Lennox could get one shot up yeah it was good it was that was I'm still warming up he's got he's got time deficit that's a crazy game though on that table because that table that's four inch pockets that's that's my practice table you a four inch pocket wait a minute whoa I have a regular table at home well not a regular table a diamond it's got four and a half inch pockets it's still a little tight normal pot like if you go to a pool hall they'll give you a five inch pocket or a five and a half inch but yeah I got pull too much this guy fucking buckets I got the abyss yeah this table you can't miss and it's it's dirty right now too so it's it's even it's even like the the cloth is slow so balls don't drop unless they go right through this type of cloth is that blossom glass yes that's the best one yeah it's the best yeah it's a great table that's a 1972 pool table oh really some guy had it in his basement forever and my friend Donny sold it to me yeah the guy just had it sitting in his bait mean it's in perfect condition it's a basement find yeah man that's a hard table to get somewhere well you know somewhere in California I loved about that table what guess what what you don't have to walk around and take the buckets balls out look yeah yeah that's annoying yeah it's like ball return they're all there yeah those those holes when I got those it's annoying but you probably have like a decorative pool tape yeah it came with the house house but you've been invited many times yeah he's been in my house when I was with my parents he never kind of my house as a solo man now when you play chess are you like do you get ranked are you yeah look what it is is your your your points go up so I'm out 11 on 11 fat lose seven thousand eleven hundred right now sorry what is that like well the rankings are like if you know if you're up to fourteen you're a master so you're closing in on being a master well I wouldn't call me a master yet but you know obviously if I get that I'm trying to get as high as poss but if someone talks shit they're like Linux I want to please and put little some not pool some chess you'd be like okay you because straightaway whatever the most mentally intensive games it's probably one reason why you stay so sharp yeah I would imagine yeah there's a time restriction ten minutes till you play that that we hit the slap the clock yeah well on ten minutes for a move or ten minutes or the whole game for the whole game Oh game low on the on the it's a fast game yeah on the computer once you've made that move the time goes over notes resets so that's good now do you ever go like to Washington Square Park and play those dudes done really yeah yeah that's that was that was fun they talk a lot of shit huh oh yeah they're good too good the guy was playing was talking love shit yeah yeah did you beat him no no wow why did you have to ask that question it was just fun playing him those guys are masters good nothing else coming up well I mean that's all they want to do I mean when you get really good at chess and I'm not really good at chess but I have friends that are they explained it like it becomes your whole life like you start thinking like as you're walking down the street you're thinking about chess it just it becomes a thing where it's just everything it's all it's so it's such an intense game yeah I play like at least four games a day Wow online damn yeah what's your online name you said online lives yes I do you don't use your real name right I'm gonna get it right now it's oh I made this name long time ago yeah I'm Washington Square Park look at that playing some masters that MC supernatural those dudes love that game though man I mean there's those guys who are there if you go there they'll be there every day they fucking live for it you know it's um it's one of those things I really admire I really admire people that get her get really really good at chess trying to mm intr mm yeah what does that mean well it was supposed to be Interpol mm Wow whether it's just like the name Interpol it sounds official when well when people are playing planes into home think this is the government on plans right s CIA so if you're out there and you're playing enter mm you're playing Lenox motherfucking Louis yeah I was gonna put my real name but yeah I don't want everybody to try and beat the champ well now the contenders retired right now let it be known that Lennox Lewis is one of those dudes who walks where I'm in no case on his iPhone - and it's smashed is it smashed if I tell you what happened what happened I was doing something then all of a sudden you know my wife said do this and I went out of your hand but you have the biggest hands of any human being I know and and there's no say there's no phone that's gonna be big enough those you carry an iPad well let me tell you I don't know who makes these iPhones but they make him to slip out of your hands put something on that that's grips why don't you have a case that's the first thing I did was put a case on right and then I forgot what I have to do you have to take it off to charge it up or something yes the wrong case do you have it the wrong case who sold you a case whoever sold your case is an asshole I guess doesn't have a thing we could just stick a hole in it look at another one JRE case look at these guys yelling they're all challenging me are they now yeah boycott this game right now they're gonna come after you now now that they find out they can play I like that they're doing it while we're doing the podcast live look he's gonna get obsessed yeah the wheels are spinning the competitive drive let me tell you my wife's gives me problems on this he says you know he's playing chess they women don't understand you playing chess and focusing I'm trying to tell her listen I'm up to this score point don't interrupt because it affects my score but I need you now I need to do we need to do this just five minutes please five minutes and you know I should be worried but she's gotten better she's actually are you playing chess so then she leaves you long yeah that's good I think because I got mad a couple of times yeah big bully with his wife usually chess the people other than Lennox no I can't play chess I'm good I can't either maybe you and I play together we should really learn the game together something John a video this game do you have a bucket disgusting you know what you could coach the game no this is the first time I was I was I would ever see it a chess game turn into checkers mmm like I said we're fighting how rude how do you play this game again how rude all this coming from man doesn't really know how to play pool Oh fire shots fired you're right you're right I play billiards billiards you play three-cushion billiards you know what that is one two three and then get in the hole of the nose the holes is that the one of the bumpers yeah well the whole table is that no but I mean Russians play it it's a big it's real big in South America it's real big in Mexico it's real big in parts of Europe real big in Asia yeah it's a different game there's two two different color balls I know like it see the two white balls on a red ball or two red balls in a white ball and you got a or sometimes as a yellow ball red ball in a white ball and the idea is you make contact with one ball and then you have to hit three cushions and then make contact with the second ball Wow it's very complicated and is it good to watch it's well if you know how to play it it's good to watch but if you don't know how to play it it's the thing about what I like about pools I like when the balls disappear like you make a ball it goes away goes in that hole bye bitch now you sink the ball it's like it's got a finality to it it feels good but with that it just clicks it's such as ding ding ding click but the people love it love it it's a very intellectual game because it's all about geometry it's all angles and spin and you know I'm not good at that either yeah it's tricky it's a tricky game I'm not good at it I know it a little bit what about table tennis I can't play that yeah hi and coordination oh yeah I'm sure yeah yeah I one thing I learned is you can't do too many things it will fuck you up like I have a real problem with quake you know what quake is all right video game Jamie's been fucking me up lately mmm quake yeah we played we got a computer room set up in the back it gets intense yeah look it's quite what is this quake what is the answer 3d game where it's a computer game you have all these weapons you run around picking up weapons and you're you're on a map so it's just like every map is different but you do this in real life too I don't know why you're playing there hunting you know that's in the forest that's different I'm looking for meat that's a different kind of meat you hunting for elk mostly elephant ear yeah yeah you do you cut it up same spot well you butcher it you you you quarter it up while it's there so you can carry it out but you don't really like you want to protect the meat so you really want to get it out of the woods first and cool it off that's what you want to do what do you do with all the leftover leftover like what leftover the limbs and yeah leave them and leave the bones no you don't know the animals yeah if you leave the bones behind then nothing goes to waste in the forest oh yeah I mean if you shoot an animal in the forest and leave the bones behind something's gonna eat it if they'd only eat they'll eat most of it you know they they find it Bears will find it the ecosystem will take care yeah everything rats everything they'll do everything we'll take care of it now how do your children feel about you doing those bad things to this island me no way you're a vegan no I mean yeah yeah then my kids have used to it because I've been hunting since they were little so they've eaten bear and deer and elk they don't cook yeah all the time taste here's the question feel good do you wash your meat don't wash it didn't like my dick it's funny a lot of people take it that way it's like you know when you cooking it was like you takin the meat from the butchers you don't know where it's being right what kind of here eats the chicken or whatever yeah you rinse it or put some vinegar over in rinse it like that so that's not mean go wash it well when you're cooking it you're cooking the outside and anything that might be bacteria is gonna get killed um the real issue is when you have an animal that has parasites that's the issue so what if you're like cooking a deer you don't have to worry about that because deers are herbivores and herbivores don't really have parasites but you can get they can get some this some worms that they do get but most of the time like some pork isn't know that's what pork definitely can the pork you get trichinosis that's pretty serious that's pretty serious shit I do enjoy me some pork though you heard me the devil's beast Linux hmm this is why I am bridges wine you don't eat the pork no I used to be a Rasta kendry no that's right no yeah jerk chicken all day Lovejoy's a jerk chicken it's hard as an ox tail out so I find a real good Jamaican restaurant though No is there one in LA none that I found I've been here 13 years and I can't find it no you know where they have good jerk chicken swingers you know that that oh the camera Beverly or something whatever it is is it Beverly Arthur yeah I need Octavio your standards are higher because you're actually Jamaica right but for me it's tasty I'm off have you been to Jamaica no you need to go do i okay I think you would not get there is very important to go to Jamaica because everybody always tells you different stories and stuff but is a paradise over there is it yeah what do you like most about it that you can see different colors you know cuz I spent a long long time in London and when I left London to go to Jamaica is like wow all these different vibrant colors even in the water and others in the trees you know when you're driving around London it's great sorry yeah you know different cities they're gray so I like I like contacts with contact with plants vibrant energy yeah yeah you know that's the interesting thing you know a lot of people do forget that you were from England right and that there was a stigma with English boxers for a long time and you you broke that yeah you were the man because nigma because that I heard that was the British boxers are horizontal yes well they were more vertical they would stand straight up and they would have like that European style but it was like Henry Cooper remember Henry Cooper dropped Muhammad Ali and then they cheated records gloves gloves yeah but I mean he was sort of one of the last great English boxers before you came along and then for a long time there was guys that were pretty good like Frank Bruno pretty good but then they would get in there with guys like Tyson and they would always wind up losing so everybody had these like this is our guy this is the one in Frank Bruno damn that he looked the part yeah was there ever a man more jacked as a heavyweight boxing every ounce of fat on Jesus Christ he was a Goliath he was carved out of granite oh yeah I mean nobody who's there's never been a better built boxer everywhere you'd look at Frank Bruno you go how does he not kill everybody is so big let me tell you you should see Frank Bruno now Howard still chisel really really phenomenal genetics must be phenomenal genetics even at the age who's like 65 Wow Rebecca did we think Evander same thing oh yeah oh yeah well Evander you know people forget started out as cruiserweight he was a much smaller guy light heavyweight actually was he in the UFC I mean in a boxing yeah and then when the Ohno was no.1 the light heavyweight title from the white Muhammad calm that was no that was cruising yeah was a hell of a fight that was a hell of a fight that was those like his big fight like to to prove himself as a professional because Cowie was tricky five seven 200 pounds it was weird fighter man well that was the American Olympic Trials right mm yeah well no it was a national fight that was that was for the cruiserweight title no I hadn't been hit Davis well no let me tell you he had a lawyer at Frank Bruno seen with his shirt off is still caught but you could tell yeah skinny ass legs the one leg kick he's got a problem damn though he does look very good I one time he had big legs yes go to see Frank Bruno back when he was in his prime as a boxer he was gigantic man he was a sculpted as a boxer ever gets here look at him he really one has not even a good picture now it's not one of the best yeah he was so jacked yeah Howie was a Kray the Camden buzzsaw he was such a crazy fighter because he would pull his shorts up - laughs here right and he was five he was super wide and he would fight with that filly shell and come in real low you know he was a very typical Archie before she almost very difficult God to deal with don't see those thumbs anymore no no now when you watch boxing today who really stands out to you you know all the champions right now they didn't get to be champions for no reason yeah and you know each each one of them have different qualities you know even well let's look at the heavyweights all the heavyweights the top three heavyweights right now they're all over six feet five yeah and they all have a different style which is good because you know reminds me of when me and the Holyfield and Tyson were around we all had different styles which makes great fights hmm now it's to guess which now is gonna be which style you never know because they're all similar you know they're all about all three of them have knockout pretension and you know they're boxing to win so what we want to see we want to see who would win out of them Deontay Wilder to me is the most perplexing because he hits so hard it's it's almost like he's got magic in his hands he makes guys fly across the ring and he's any doesn't hurt nine pound and he does it off-balance yeah and he does it with both legs in the air amazing Olympic team and want to go a bronze medal a year and a half into boxing oh yeah yeah that my problem with the new new division is that they don't have the amateur pedigree but maybe these lower T's is great but our T's is much older than he says he is is he say he is forty something like 40 or 41 how old is he I'm hearing stories at Ortiz like 49 how do you know um somebody tell me about from the amateurs I remember seeing him in the amateurs in the eighties know like what I always say that about Cubans though yeah cuz they say that same shit about Yoel Romero 9 ah he says he's 39 yeah he just fought on the weekend or two weeks ago yeah couple weeks ago in one stop it right no it was a decision was it if it wasn't it I thought it was a late round stoppage unless he just fought again he just fought like last weekend or two we fight like two months ago - no no he just fought no that was a stoppage and this fight just happened also he's it's very he's being very active yeah yeah he's trying to come back what do you think about that like how active you think a boxer being what really comes down to you know this is how it goes if you're starting boxing obviously you want to have as many fights as possible to you know seasoning yeah get that experience level so as much as possible it's usually for fights a year and then as you get better it drops to three fights and then when you're the champion it drops to two fights so that's that's the progression of fall of fighting you can't like for instance how many fights did Deonte have this year maybe two great Brian you know before when he was starting out he would have like three to four yeah he's very angry that this rematch is not happening and I side with him it was a Tyson who pulled out Tyson got a deal with ESPN yeah yeah well it's a big deal because you know talking about chess match I think that's he's pulled off the greatest chess match move there is first he comes over from England he wouldn't he takes the challenge if with Deonte Joshua didn't he boxed he had a great fight now he's putting himself right up with all three of them were on the same line to me and then now for the rematch they wanted people want to see Deonte and they want to see Tyson Fury again because the first fight was exciting dad Joshua who's he fighting you know he's gonna fight big baby but nobody knows him where everybody knows Deonte boxing fans know everybody knows tyson everybody and especially after that fight because it was such a spectacular fight that knocked out oh my god the first knockdown was great the second knockdown was preposterous so the fact that heroes like Lazarus yeah I mean it was crazy and then won the rest of the round me gets tagged a few times then starts boxing and then even tag Deonte I still had him winning that fight it was close Oh Tyson I think by around I think boxing won that night every yeah both guys looked great and boxed well and made an exciting fight that the rematch obviously everybody wants to see the ring yeah so when the rematch happened that that put and from Joshua on the shelf yeah in my eyes now it's put him on the shelf a bit longer yeah with this ESPN deal and you know Tyson Fury is boxing in front of the public yeah Anthony Joshua and Deonte their pay-per-view right well who are they going to fight pay-per-view nobody wants to see no silly fight they want yeah you know it's it's a great move by Tyson Fury it's a great movie though the first fight the the fight ended in a draw right yeah yeah so in the draw Deonte keeps the title but at least Tyson walks away like saying look look I won the decision I feel like I should have won the decision there's a dispute there's a debate about it but everybody wants to see that fight I mean a draw is not unreasonable but Tyson could lose to somebody yeah you know I've been walking around saying oh I'll fight this oil I won't fight to make sure it's somebody might lose this is what happens and now none of them can fight each other because if Joshua fights fury and loses to fury Joshua's star goes down if sure we'll fights Deonte and beats Deonte the Tyson Deonte fights not that exciting right but if Joshua wants real respect he's got to fight either fury or Deonte right those are the same fights those are the big fight obviously gets respect he's a heavyweight champion the world but split you know just that's a weird thing to I'd like to see Joshua Ortiz I've been interesting fight it would be an interesting cuz Ortiz can box ya and hit ya but that was what showed how god damn powerful Deonte is that Ortiz went in that fight yeah and then I was I think it was the 10th round 7 13th I don't remember but I remember when he caught him was like even late in the fight that guy carries no power or tasers past his prime lets us know down there Louis yes past his prime is a good fighter but you know give him give give him like 10 years yeah and he would have he would have beat these guys he would have given him a good good fight mmm but right now he's you know he's obviously older and he's an old fighter yeah well they caught up doing some steroids a lot of times guys get older they try to yeah you need it juice up the old body yeah so you know when you reach that point where you need steroids mentally it affects you yeah you go into the ring and it's like you know you're missing something something that was there in the past and it made you feel good now I don't feel as good Brian when you were fighting did anybody that you were fighting did you suspect that they were on something yeah Oh a couple times yeah but the good thing is that I know is I realize they're right steroids can never get this strong your chin chin yeah so you can take as much terrorists as you want but I'm hitting you on the chin right you can't put muscles on your face yeah yeah and then you know these body punches you can't you can't protect around here so they'll affect you as well so that's where you you know when when you hitting when you're hitting guys around here body punches and hit him on the chin don't matter doesn't matter but don't you think that it does make some stronger physically gives them more vitality might make them able to absorb more punishment for a minute for a minute just for a little bit yeah for a little bit who'd you suspect was on something when you follow them I don't want to say you don't sir I think Evander was the first guy as far as I'm concerned was the first guy the fucking size of that guy in in the late 90s especially when he fought Lennox have you ever asked him if he's been on through it no I never actually hung out with Evander okay I might have met your victory party he did hang around with the guys that were like into it mark whatever his name was his he was the first kind of like a strength and conditioning coach and well you know that Stefan Spinks did when he fought when you fought Larry Holmes he same guy Mac ISIL stone yeah Mac ISIL Stone got him in shape for Larry when he was coming up from light heavyweight yeah that's the same guy that Evander used and they're doing it was really interesting because at the time the the conventional wisdom was that boxers should not lift weights and Evander was lifting all kinds of weights and he put on all this muscle but really he was only about 200 205 pounds when he first fought for traps oh yeah Jesus Christ he was built for me he was built it was perfect body yeah that's that's not steroids steroids but not necessarily you you definitely can get that big without it I mean there are guys the words alleged yeah alleged is a good word but it's also possible to get that big with steroids but it's not just steroids - its EPO there's a look at that one up there yeah but this is in the 1980s and 90s that the good stuff wasn't available back then wasn't oh yeah what are you kidding me man those Russians had everything back fat man I mean the Eastern Bloc women they made world records that was when he was a that was when he was a cruiserweight look how thin he was yeah but you can't call them women if they had moustaches penises fake beards and fat dicks there are they set records that still to this day haven't been broken Wow and because there really were not women I mean there were women with massive amounts of male hormones in their body flo-jo yeah she's I think still sets the record right now for what whatever it was and she was also someone that was accused of doing things yeah I mean look track-and-field according to Victor Conte who was the Valco guy I had him on my podcast he was a guy that got the clear to Barry Bonds and all those guys undetected supposedly undetectable steroids he said track and field is just dirty sport mmm just like Tour de France like just like cycling he's like disappointed in dirty sport you got car Louis trying to call out Hussain Bolt now right what are you showing us Janice at the top 100 meter times all the names crossed out oh wow steroids goddamn well that's like when Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France and they took his title way if you had to give that title to someone who didn't test positive for anything you had to go back to 18th place Wow dirty sport you know Bill burr said it best he's like euros are psycho was better than you're psycho they're all you were all dirty there's a dirty sport he was just better at doing that sport while being dirty everybody's dirty then it's fair what he won while everybody was cheating and I mean did he have so is it still cheating if everybody's doing it it is and it isn't I mean it is definitely cheating but everybody's cheating yes weird it's not good see you know they went off to the wrong thing you know people were looking for drugs to help them get stronger when it's natural food that makes you stronger that's what you put into your system so you know I know Jamaican food is great you know yams the plant ends everything belief bully beef you know it's better than that that's steroids that's a way better oh yeah yeah they work instantly so much better if you just stay on them like guys like Lance Armstrong I mean they proved it we just you you almost can't do Tour de France the way they were doing it without some sort of chemical help and I've heard it argued by physiologist they say it's actually better for your body to be on steroids while you're doing something like the Tour de France because you give your body a chance to recover because they're doing so much work over the course of this race that without having some sort of chemical enhancement of your ability to recover you're just not gonna be able to do it health off your body can't do break down you get that rhabdomyolysis that those CrossFit people get you know that's when your your body starts breaking down muscle tissue and it becomes toxic oh yeah yeah pollutes your I think that they work out so hard that people have died of it fighters have died from rhabdo Milos's well it's it's from overtraining you you over train you know you're like something you know which is a big issue with fighters right like the some fighters can train too much and a good trainer knows how to pull you back and so that you're peaking when you get into the ring but sometimes people are so mentally strong they push themselves through even when they're exhausted because they think that's the way to victory hard work what's up Jamie yeah your piss comes out looking like coke comes out looking like coca-cola that's what Rob don't want us it's piss looks like yeah wow yeah that's that's a southern iced tea your body's breaking down your muscle is your your proteins in your body are breaking down in your bodies getting poisoned by it people die a lot of CrossFit people get it what's your kidneys what are you doing this situation do you take a rest a leave of absence or do you go see the doctor and they can give you some pills to put more assists things that you need in your system I think you have to go to the doctor almost immediately I think they have to do pretty much your body go septic on your yeah it's very dangerous and a lot of these CrossFit people you know because it's a competition and you're competing against all these other people and you do these massive repetitions and some of them they're not really conditioned for it yet so their body's just the muscles not really acclimated to this kind of workload the shit starts breaking down what do you do these days like well exercise because you still look great yeah I ran ten miles this morning whoa yeah man where'd you go huh I mean um where I went on the road but where'd you run on the beach okay woke up and took a shower nice so you should yeah I feel like I don't know you anymore so you guys don't even catch the joke I ran 10 miles and I woke up and took a shower Oh meetings supposed to know that but listen kissin listen all right it's a bad smell sit down tell him tell him you know he used to do this shit to me begging there I'd be at his house and I and I was like I'm in his basement ago it start to rain a goal and I got to go outside and close my sunroof and he's like not hold on a second tell you story I got Len let me go close my fucking summer was like hold on let me just tell you story I'm like dude it's raining my sunroof is open are you gonna pay for my fucking car to get fixed he's like hold on you know there's this guy right this fucking long story and goes he's trying to get out this window on it and I'm pulling his leg and I'm pulling his leg and I go and it goes just the way I'm pulling your leg right now I ever do yoga yes you like a guy get into yoga I actually hurt myself doing yoga really yeah I'm so much harder than Alex do I'm flexible like if I stand up I can put them both my hands on the ground like that Wow with my legs straight but somebody told me oh you know what you got to move your bum cheeks a little back and that helps you get down a little more in my okay and cheeks a little back and hop after a couple of days it's like you know I'm walking around thin I hurt myself and it goes yoga yeah I say yeah I hurt myself to like I know you can hurt yourself in yoga you can hurt yourself in yoga yeah my doctor told me a lot of people come to him with injuries back injuries from yoga what is that mentally saying that you can do it when your body's saying you can't or just doing something wrong just doing something wrong especially if you do it too hard too quick like Yoga is like anything else I mean it's exercise you definitely can hurt yourself do you do the hot yoga or cold yoga I haven't tried the hot one I want to buy the new cold yoga I like hot because I feel yeah I think it's also torturous I like that aspect of it and also there's a Harvard study that's going on right now or they're trying to find out if there's the same benefits that you get from the sauna you get from doing hot yoga when your body gets really overheated like that it produces heat shock proteins and it alleviates a lot of inflammation in the body Wow that's why the the sauna is so good for you because your dry sauna yeah dry sauna your body get you get in there your body it's like what the fuck is this and so it produces these cytokines these heat shock proteins and it's fantastic for people just for my hands don't when I'm in the sauna you should get one in your house man I got one I got one oh nice right yeah just a man dude you should be in there everyday especially cuz you're doing jujitsu now hmm you know after training it's fantastic for you I feel really tough with Epsom salts that's good too that's good too I don't think that works epsom salt niacin it makes you feel good going to bed yeah I'm nice to relax I go to sleep you know aromatherapy a type of thing it smells good but it's not that it's there's magnesium in it no have some salts your body absorbs magnesium through your through your skin it's one of the best ways for your body to get me magnesium is actually through epsom salts yeah I'm gonna take more than yeah I have a float tag do you ever do a float tank is that the cold water one no no that's uh it's a tank of water that's heated to 94 degrees which is like the surface of your skin and there's a thousand pounds of Epsom salts in there and you lay in it and you float you like like your body half your bodies above the water and then you close the door total silence total darkness it feels like you're flying through space it's beautiful you would love it especially being the super tell me about this one for years I got one right here I know anytime you want somebody else's no no there's first of all it's only me I'm the only one and I know this is a massive filtration system it's like this kind of commercial filtration so I can just drop in and Mike Jones coming man just just text me and I'll have Jeff come by and open it up for you or do it while we're doing a show yeah when you do it yeah yeah you gotta be naked hey don't come after work everything floats or anything that's in there to be floating yeah I'll show you the whole system there's a ozone system that purifies the water goes through this commercial filtration system it's heavy duty stuff man it's pretty in town cause they've started these flotation tank centers now yeah they're everywhere yeah you're talking about this for the past 10 years more yeah I had one in 2002 I remember you tell me when I went to your house back in the day yeah doing that when you were doing this podcast out of the house yeah I had one in the basement yeah yeah what about the ice one oh that's great yeah yeah cryotherapy mmm yeah there's a place down the street from here about a couple miles away 250 degrees below zero I thought you would have had one of those too that's like you have to get like nitrogen tanks and shit and I worry about that stuff exploding you know some shit going wrong and getting maimed you know yeah so do you uh do you enjoy doing commentary - yeah I love I love giving my opinion you know people were say I've got a unusual opinions they've never heard that before I never heard it put that way so you know I can give you from a firefighters point of view have been in boxing for so long there's different experiences that I've gone through so um I'm happy to share them but you don't ever work out boxing wise anymore ya did but you don't hit hit a bag my son is 15 and I know he wants to box so anytime we get a chance you know I'm always training him how big is he now it's six feet Jesus yeah he's taller than you Tyson son tyson son is 16 on MacGowan tyson son was saying that he wants a box to my Tyson's like listen no Miguel's not like that but he's also saying listen you you you grew up soft and you know he's saying like you don't want to meet someone like me you know like the way he was yeah I know you want to meet some and I'm all like me you know like when he was fighting like you like he thinks of what he would have done to his own son don't do that like he was talking about on the podcast and his son Miguel's a really talented kit like musician wise could play like seven different instruments in Spanish wow the kids really he's a really smart nice kid well Tyson's a smart guy he's not like I think people mistake tight suburbia dummy he's very very intelligent well-read the boxing is in at least some levels a very very intellectual pursuit yeah this you have to have a strong mind to be able to dodge those punches get in and get yours in that you have to you have to be able to sort out that problem is a problem in front of you the problem is another man who's the same weight as you the same size as you he's got gloves on just like you do and he's trying to do what you're trying to do to him and you have to do that within seconds yeah boom yeah punches thrown at you what do you do what's what's the rebuttal if people don't understand they think just because someone doesn't have the best vocabulary or because they don't have a comprehensive education that they're not intelligent that's a big mistake no person's intelligent I remember going to the Catskills when I was I won the World Junior Championships in Santo Domingo Dominican Republic and I remember that American team was saying all war you never fought the best I didn't fight the best I thought Americans said the best team yeah but one guy it isn't like taking plans and his managers don't like taking plans either some like who's that and they told me was Mike Tyson customer so me and my trainer we left Canada and we drove all the way up there and while we were up there I arranged the erotic was up there and they said Oh raisin really came to inspire with us so okay I'll spar with you I'm here for four days so first time Tyson actually met me you know he was nice guy a really nice guy took me in his room showed me some old flicks that I've never seen before of all time fighters he would tell me about each fighter like he studied them and then you know this is where he got his old stuff is his style of fighting from and first day in the first day in the gym Bell went he came across and he was trying to kill me like you know I did my Muhammad Ali thing obviously stayed away from his power but the first day was really hectic and then the second day was lactic and it got better as it went along and the last day is I got actually the better of him the last day and I remember customers saying Mike you gonna meet him someday don't you do that and not always echoed in my mind that will we ever fight will we ever fight because cus D'Amato said that we're gonna fight well and it did happen and there's footage of it yeah Wow Lennox has the footage of it footage of the Train sparring how old was Tyson at the time Tyson was like a 52 no no how old was he at the time what time fifteen he was he was younger than me I was long 17 he's about 17 Wow I was 18 no he was younger than that that must have been nervous 84s before the Empire State Games and everything okay you were you went up there before you went to the 84 Olympics yeah yeah well it must've been crazy though knowing that you know you you guys were going to be a part of boxing history knowing that all the way back then being a teenager and standing in front and here in custom ATO screamed that out that was been intense it was intense because cus D'Amato wasn't that loud when he was winning all of a sudden he became loud and like everybody listened you know and then you know there's certain ways that you kill across the people and some people take the after out of them did you ever wish that you fought him in his prime in essence I did fight him in this prime and you know when you say Prime I was in my prime too you know you were definitely in your prime you were you were but I feel like his enthusiasm had waned before then you know oh you know this is my perception how I look at that whole thing is Mike Tyson was an early bloomer I was a late bloomer hmm so you know when when both of us meet you know there's never a perfect time perfect time for us is when we meet in the middle right right right and you know right and if he won maybe people would look at it differently right it's because you beat him and beat him so soundly right that people look at it like maybe he's time had already been gone yeah Lennox turned pro after Mike had already had to defeat Wow no planks turned pro in 89 Wow I never even thought of that and Mike lost in January yeah this is all something look at you like a Kevin Rooney wow that is crazy man god that's crazy built back then - you have a big neck yeah he well he was always doing those neck bridges but he also just had freak genetics I mean just a phenomenal genetic specimen you know I had Teddy Atlas in here and Teddy house used to take Mike to the smokers when he was 13 and Teddy was joking around about I said everybody always lied about how old people were they would tell you the kid was 16 and really it was 20 they always did that and he said he goes so how old's his kid he was 13 he goes what does he weigh he goes 190 pounds what the fuck Teddy come on he's like I'm telling ya he's he's fucking 13 what do you want you know nobody would believe it cuz he was such a specimen I watched that one Teddy was great do you think he should have stayed with Teddy should stay with Kevin and Teddy well he definitely was you know he was so wild like how how could you tell him what to do back then that was part of the problem I mean he was never no one ever prepared him and is one of the things that we discussed on the podcast was that he was a 12 year old 13 year old boy and he was getting hypnotized he had came from a terrible background it was there was no love he was abandoned and all of a sudden he's getting love and attention for something and this one thing was this man who was telling him you're gonna be a great fighter you're gonna be a world champion and he would hypnotize me saying you don't exist the task exists you know you're gonna work the body and destroy this man and he would tell he would put these thoughts in his head and my couldn't wait to just get out there and fuck people up cuz that's where he got the love that's where he got the attention from but he never turned never told him how to shut it off he never I mean he didn't have time to work with him cuz he was on his way out he's dying when he met Mike and so he only taught him how to destroy he never taught him how to cope he never taught him how to understand that there's gonna be a lot of shit coming your way and you got to know what that is and don't get caught up in that hype train don't just don't get wrapped up in Hollywood and you know he wound up marrying Robin Givens and you know and I think cus foresaw all that other bullshit no how could you know if course was around Mike would be totally different he would have been a different man if you've cost lasted another 15 years even if Jimmy Jacobs had lasted another five years maybe yeah I mean it would have helped but I mean it's like once you're once removed from cus it's like Kevin Rooney was once removed from costume right and then Teddy Atlas was way more of a hardliner you know Teddy Atlas you couldn't put any bullshit with you know and like those other guys who just gotta go you know then he got to aaron snowell and all those guys Richie Giachetti they just they just didn't they didn't they could have never brought Mike to the dance right they got there when he was already at the dance and they're just trying to like maintain things and he's not listening to anybody he's they also weren't boxing people as far as I was concerned when he was up with cus he was he was in a good situation you know there was a lady in the house cooking meals mmm they had cause cos there being a father figure talk to him every day and that's what young kids need they need that you know to be spoken with by all the people yeah and you know a lot of young people nowadays are not even respecting the older people but they can gain a lot of information from our older person you know how do you deal with this situation yeah well you know you hear from an older person it kind of makes your mind thinking's and you know you're right it works for them so anytime I get a chance to talk to kids about you know their life and we're there always take that opportunity well you're such a great example of a guy who has done incredible things but you've come out on the other end with with wisdom and lessons and honesty and you can talk about things and people will listen to you in a way that you know a lot of kids don't want listen to someone ain't done shit right you need to talk to some guys just some boring dude you want to give you advice like hey fuckface bitch but when you're Lennox Lewis you talk together go oh okay mister you know chess master World Heavyweight Champion what school you got in Jamaica now you got a boxing school there now yeah Lennox Lewis League of Champions yeah it's for young kids that you know learning how to box teach we teach him on the box we teach them life skills as well because what we realized that you know a lot of the kids just want to talk you know there's nobody around them to talk nobody listens to them yeah and when they hear other kids stories they feel a lot better it's like yo you know I was going through that and I liked how he dealt with it you know it's like it yes this is what what's missing nowadays yes the relationship with kids you know talking to them you know just ask them out there yeah some what they're doing what do they want to be right right right yeah and then have some place where they can go yeah and then have something that gives them a sense of value you know and that's what a lot of sports does do to children it gives you you know you you realize if you work hard and you try something and you study it and you get better at it you feel good like you accomplished it you got through whatever the sport is a lot of a lot of the kids that come boxing I've never tried it before but once they try it it's like wow they learn new things about themselves even the training of boxing yeah you know the fact that us run a mile Datta never ran in their life now they've run half a mile didn't make the mile but the next that next day they want to try them out and then you just it shows them that if you keep working at something you'll accomplish it you know don't give up don't all of a sudden you tried it in this icon ah it's not for me keep trying it you don't know it's not for you until you keep trying it and then realize it's not for your all for you what are you gonna do if your son wants a fight let them yeah I think your perspective would be very different than Mike's yeah I'm from for me you know I'm not forcing my son to box but if he wants to try it let him try his father used to box so why not why not try something his father did maybe he has the gene for it yeah you know right now my son's play the plays basketball he wants to be an actor he loves boxing it can do anything he wants you know all my kids are talented and I see the drive in them that I have and their mother has so I know that they're gonna be successful you know they've they're they're basically I'm trying to help them to become successful in the future and given the tools to become successful in the future as well good for you man what a lucky young man yeah I mean you know and young women too yeah well but a great situation that'd be your son you know I mean and your daughters as well but for sure but I mean to be your son if you really do have a desire to box would you start training you know talking to George Foreman the other day and he's dot one of his daughters were fighting mom was in her name George yes or some crazy shit he's got like eight George's in his house yeah I said and I'm watching or finals but they know by the tone apparently which one it is inflection on the jury I'm watching her fight and I'm like George you need to tell her some stuff I know there's some good things you can tell her or even get her a proper coach or you know help her I don't want to fight Wow so will you have to say yeah but if you don't want her to fight and she's fighting you're not gonna help her she's gonna get hurt as well I think she stopped already anyway my approach to raising kids is I don't I don't have any input under what they do I don't I don't know what I would never tell my kid I don't want you to do that cuz it's not my life it's their life I give them guidance if I can I'll talk to them about what they're doing if I can but they also have to go out and do it themselves and I really firmly believe in that like you got to go do it yourself but if you want to do it that's your thing try to convince my daughter to want to do digits really I said sweetheart I'll get you a pinkie if you might my kids were doing martial arts for a while my middle daughter was doing jujitsu and my youngest daughter was doing MMA but she got bored with it after a while which was cool too you know ten and eight you know who knows maybe they'll come back to it but yeah you know I kind of whispered to my son right now you need to do some wrestling mmm then get him in jujitsu Tonya thank you fight MMA um you know I don't know what the future holds he may fight MMA you know he's kind of doesn't if he's gonna fight he shitbox what just because the money factor yeah I mean honestly I mean but if you're a heavyweight you know if you're a heavyweight and never gonna be a lot of money yeah we sure certainly will basics like if you mat Lennox's brother heard it Lennox's bones but a heavy was like a child but holding a fish have a pretty big fist but yours are gigantic yeah you know a huge huge human being you know you kids gonna be a heavyweight oh he's gonna be heavy he's already a half his man he's six foot and he weighs size 15 shoes he doesn't need to fight you just keep a pair of shoes by the front so he's gonna outgrow me that's like a puppy yeah yeah yeah he's always gonna be enormous great day why do kids outgrow their parents I don't know I think it's food I think they get better food than us yeah I think you know you think about like how much protein children have now if you ever go back and look at like how big men were during like the Civil War period time like a hundred pounds yeah there were tiny little people cuz nobody had good food like everybody was like barely surviving everyone scraped him I was bread and water times yeah it's the people that made it across the West you ever see photos of those folks those skinny rickety looking people just tougher than we could ever be oh my god there were little wolves oh yeah they're up in the early in the morning working they had to survive yeah it's just but now today kids are getting you know massive amounts of protein and they get vitamins and vegetables and you know drinking all this milk and foods got shit and yeah oh yeah there's that too there's that too but I just think it's just an abundance of nutrition I mean when people were smaller a lot of it was because of malnutrition like look at asian folks like a lot of Japanese folks used to be much smaller now they're pretty fucking big you're getting some really big Japanese fighters like their larger guys are cute they're eating better you know what I wanted to ask you please conspiracy theories mmm I know you have some yeah I got something I was listening to you but was something about Martians the other day I was Jones Alex and Eddie oh my god I saw an amazing NASA shirt I was gonna buy for Hedy the other day yeah Alex Warren Asus I watch Eddie yeah yeah Eddie believe shit that even Alex thinks is ridiculous like what goods conspiracy theories do you want to know about no I'm like let me hear some well I believe less and less than I ever used to population control do you believe that no I don't believe that I don't believe there's any concerted effort like where there's a bunch of really rich people that have decided to euthanize a bunch of people to keep the population low I think that is that's paranoid I think that there's probably some people to go you know what we would be a lot healthy if there was less people but there's no there's no obvious effort the population keeps fucking growing imagine if you were the all-powerful all-knowing people that are running the world and you're doing such a shitty job of population control yeah I don't know how you're gonna control India and China you're not you're not here neither you're not getting these fucking dirty villages and trying to stop it you're not doing it anywhere any even in this country people are fuckin like wild animals do it now coming next month yeah I got three kids yeah it's just the way it is Matt people like to fuck you like to make me more in China you only loved one kid no I think they leave it they left it lifted that because a lot of people were drowning their daughters there was horrible shit yeah we're killing the minutes that this is the rumor was that people were they wanted a son if they had a daughter they would yeah yeah daughter was like the law the lose for you yeah and to me a daughter's a win because there's so much easier to deal with really I find with my daughter and we're we're like this yeah you know what man I mean just be happy I got I got I'm a boy coming next you gotta have the yin and the yang a little Joseph Lennox Lewis Peters coming next month I'm Josefa Lennox Rogan Peters he's gonna be amazing I'm so happy that he gave you my name yeah that's beautiful Keith at first I was gonna give your middle name but I didn't want to do that to him so what's your middle name whoa yes my middle name is Claudius Claudius sounds like a Roman Emperor beautiful hey man I know you you're supposed to get out of here two o'clock do you have a heart out no no you can stay yeah absolutely it's beautiful let's keep talking yeah yeah so back to your question I don't yeah I think there's definitely some people that are influencing the way the world works for sure but I don't think there's anybody that's really trying to control population what about this one okay do you think the Russians put Donald Trump in the president's chair I think the Russians absolutely wanted Donald Trump to win absolutely and I think they definitely undermined our democracy through various methods of manipulating people through social media in fact I have a woman coming on very soon when is Renee to rest oh this week next week she's on next week and she actually studied it and wrote this very comprehensive report about it was on Sam Harris's podcast and detailed millions of interactions with Russian BOTS and Russian fake accounts and that these troll farms that would create memes and they did a bunch of different things they didn't just try to pump Trump up but they also tried to get people against each other and and cause all sorts of civil arguments and all sorts of unrest yeah all sorts of unrest online they organized these meetings like they were gonna have one Pro Texas meeting across the street from a pro Muslim meeting I did it on par through Facebook to get these people to fight with each other they're doing these things to try to get people to take sides and to get people to be angry at the other side they did a lot of shit like that real sneaky sneaky stuff that we probably do in foreign countries all the time and you know we're mad that they're doing it to us because now they're doing it through social if you think about when we were growing up in the 80s 70s and 80s all the imagery we saw of the USSR was very dark and and it was very no yeah Aaron and it was destitute well some of it was true though yeah all we saw and then all of a sudden that lifts and these hot fucking Russian chicks show up so true you never saw the hot Russian laughter some of the hottest women on the plan they used to show us these big manly women we'll do you want and now you're like we were hiding yeah yeah I have two friends that are married to Russian ladies they're very happy another question because because you're American everything I'm not American so is this wall ever gonna get built or is it what's the situation I don't I think it was more of a campaign rhetoric thing you know build that wall build that was kind of thing with it I mean I think he wants supporters yeah I think he's got to kind of do something right once you say that you're gonna build a wall you got to kind of do something but they ain't shit been built yeah we're two years into the president they haven't built shit well is he your left and if we're and a half left and the president is some wall there's some wall that's up but there's also some big-ass gaps and the idea that they're gonna stop drugs from coming over from that walls right now the wall looks like Leon Spinks his mouth I remember my parents were hippies right but when Muhammad Ali lost to Leon Spinks and then there was a rematch we watched it on television everybody everybody wanted Ali to win people forget that Ali wasn't just a great boxer in the heavyweight champ of the world he represented people that were against the war yeah he represented people that were against all of the the all of the discrimination and all the racism the people had experience in the 50s in the 60s he was a different thing he was he represented the the hope of this new generation that this athlete would take a stand and he said no no Vietcong ever did anything to me mmm-hmm not going over there and fighting anybody and they took away his ability to earn a living for three fucking years primaries and he was a hero a real soci he could have given in he could have given in he got I got a cushy job like Elvis or some shit you know and they would have had him go over there and you know I'm just just to make it look like he was doing something mmm he's like no no fucking chance you know he stood up for it my parents who were hippies wanted wanted him to win I mean my my mom didn't give a fuck about boxing but when I was what he stood for him I was a little kid I never watched this on TV thinking this is crazy my parents want to watch a boxing match because what he stands for mm-hmm my dad felt that way about Joe Louis Robinson well when Joe Lewis beat Max Schmeling oh yes very similar thing he was beating Max Schmeling for the world like it wasn't I mean I feel terrible for Max Schmeling because I mean he was probably just caught up in all that shit but max even said he wasn't part of it he was just he was just a pawn in the game yeah I'm sure yeah I'm sure pulling about Jack Johnson that's my favorite that's the craziest I mean other than Lennox Lewis John Johnson my favorite that's the craziest of all stories right he was in crime us have experienced in the shit he said back then yeah he would slick talk you bad my favorite one there's a meme a photo of him in his car I don't even know if the story's true about the favorability yeah you got pulled over going 50 he had to give the guy $50 that was the fee gave the guy hundred because what's this for here's somebody coming back later that night yeah same speed then there's the story of him getting in a taxi and getting the backseat of taxi and the guy goes I don't drive Niger's and and he and he reached over pulled the guy into the backseat got in front drove himself we had the gut to and that guy's like where's my fare because I drove myself and he got out I wonder if that's true you know he could roll in his book you know he wrestled this video of Jack Johnson wrestling giving a 13 inch wrist so here's a gigantic human being for the time but I think he was only six too you know yeah buddy was they called him the Galveston giant yeah and people are GQ magazine rated him as best-dressed athlete of the century in 2000 it's wrong century well I know the 2010 hundreds all right get it oh yeah Oh in 2008 did it yeah the whole back track yeah well you know I mean I don't think any of us could even imagine what it must been like when he won the title and the kind of hate that he got all the people that wanted him to be killed the shit he did it was so gangster oh yeah he would hit you see your knees buckle and hold you up and say he would say think so guys not yet sir not not yet you're gonna have a longer night than this torture these guys you know this guy knows boxing did you ever see his fight with Stanley Ketchel yeah yeah the Boilermaker yeah Stanley Ketchel dropped him yeah it was just to be it was supposed to be a exhibition an exhibition Mountain Stanley Ketchel was a middle way yeah yeah oh yeah okay and then his teeth got stuck in his gloves I smashed him Wow yeah he had a fascinating style though when they had those little gloves yeah well you guys don't realize I was gonna say the little gloves horsehair yeah different world yeah close work your fuckin hands real easy to and what they made yeah it hurt well it's like in my meat gloves yeah and I made Fighters find out the hard way like you can't just you can open up with boxing and not even worry as much about what you're hitting you cannot do that if you're fighting bare knuckle listen have you seen that bare-knuckle boxing I should say what is there knuckle resurgence I think these guys are tough yeah she's got Pro boxers going in it now yeah who went in it somebody a decent name was in it recently well a lot of UFC fighters yeah nobody's are over yeah they've gone it's like a rugby or football you know rugby guys a tougher than the football players coming a percent yeah yeah the Italian guys in it I saw him doing the bare-knuckle thing Italian guy Italy no no no an Italian American hmm Oh Phil Baroni yeah Phil Baroni wasn't uncle yeah he did one yeah yeah quite a few MMA fighters Melvin Guillard did some yeah it's you know but it's sort of a last resort kind of thing trying to pick up a paycheck you know Chris Lytle did it you know it's just a hard way to make a living some what about one AFC's kind of not gonna deserve he's saying the time mm-hmm tell this motherfucker sit down it's your boy oh my god yeah he's not gonna do Eddie yeah the Mexican yeah now he's good fire him he's trying to get into the other guys talking to him so Lennox's fella is talking to your fella my assistant my assistant knows better well people get silly it's like a good meal you know once you enjoying this meal you just wanna finish you know what do they have you doing after this uh just more into these they've got me busy long-ass interview so what do you promote it promoting the fights which fights we haven't talked about any of them yeah the beating content talking about chess and get the fuck out of here you get the fuck out of here tell your boys yeah I'm good I'm good at he don't worry mummy I've already told them I don't have to be somewhere to 4:30 that's I'm gonna put some 2-way glass there we could see out and they can't see in that's a good idea yeah a silly boy I interrupt Betty Jesus said Shawn Porter this weekend who's he fighting you guess from Cuba or they said you gasps oh my god no who should be a good fight and this is on this is on Fox PPC oh nice yeah yeah Porter's a champ right now right um he won the title from Thurman didn't he yeah and or did he won it from Danny Garcia Danny cuz ya know don't you watch boxing yeah tell me I'll tell you anything about the heavyweights are you doing commentary so you're doing commentary in this yeah for Fox yes nice it should be a good fight I should be very good fight yeah yeah there so there it is right there now you grew his hair out every every time Sean pores that Murph opens Lennox every time Shawn Porter fights is always a the serious bra you know this guy reminds me of the old time fighters here the way out of this guy fights you know it gives you a lot of pressure he's on you somebody he now tries to either he doesn't he doesn't mind taking the shots a punchy so he mixes it up yes that's this Saturday night yes nice yeah there's a lot of great fights coming out the Mikey Garcia Earl Spencer jr. excite that's a that's a very good fight makes me nervous stuff it makes me nervous a great fight nobody wants to see it's a great fight but as i'ma like Mikey Garcia but it to me it's like I like both of those guys I like them both I I think I think Mikey's plus in this fight is that Spence hasn't had pressure like this and Mikey doesn't tank out on anybody mm-hmm he's not gas out and he's not afraid to mix it up with you what about the size difference that's what I'm worried about it's the size difference the weight difference I mean he had one more fight before he fought Spence but no he's they know what they're doing he's Reddy's whole family's coming at he walks in specialist you know and I've trained with his brother before with with Robert have you really are smart yeah really yeah no shit yeah look at you right Jim so a jujitsu with John Jacques Machado your boxing Robert Garcia and lo mishchenko was there training okay I want Sam yes Edie's up there right now working with that a light heavyweight Russian character oh the music yeah yeah yeah yeah music yeah yeah I trained with I trained over at goossens gym over the Christmas holiday how did you relay boxed in two years oh my god I suck fucking answer I'm like at fuck this sport so your your hands my hands were hurting after like did you wrap them I wrapped them I'm I wrapped into tight you got soft hands don't make me square up kid took it it's been two years look like huh and I do this I've gotta do it slow yeah you know what it was because he knew I used to train back in the day so I was like I wanted to look good and I'm like huh okay let me help you you know what you do see this is where the martial arts comes in but get this thing of sand ah and you just start punching it then to toughen you up a bit toughen you up with something you know I'm son when I said my hands heard I meant like the joints my joints were hurting well you know what people do you ever see rice bags they stick their hand at rice bags they do a lot of this I had rice bags that apparently is very good for your hands I did that by my mom got mad I was fucking up her rice so what did you do about it I went home and just so if you just get back to doing it a little come back yeah I know I figured that much but I'm like bring a tennis ball everywhere I'm just like I'm gonna stick with jiu-jitsu it doesn't hurt as much did you gesture doesn't hurt your hands no my thigh where those little Luda gear guards what Lou tech gear have you seen them they got these little finger guards that they actually help what are they strengthens they make a two finger and a three finger I with no idea what the where the three finger it's just like a little like a little cut off glove for your fingers really hold them together it's ninja thing it's nice does it give you more traction to Sara Lee but it just it keeps your fingers together piece from separating see if I can pop your finger out that's probably good if your guitarist or some shit probably my mom uses some too for a threat oh look at that that's it that's the two finger joint why I use the three I've never even fuck with those yeah I'm old school bro I just take my shit up yeah but you're also fucking gorilla strong it's weird was it weird cuz it's like playing with a fucking silverback gorilla even I watched your own with John Jack that there's like you go you wanna roll I go no I don't I'll do it now but van I'm like no but I've been doing a long time man I started you two in 96 we're rolling tomorrow right yeah come on call him now we're gonna probably roll around 8:30 in the morning if that's cool with you yeah that works yeah we could do that what's different about jiu-jitsu and wrestling what's the what's the difference depending upon whether or not you use the gay the gays a big factor because you could grab ahold of that and it's all it makes you more defensive minded because you can get caught in things get caught in submissions easier submissions are the big thing obviously but I do a lot of noogie I have a black belt noogie jujitsu engage it is who I put actually prefer noogie that's I don't wanna do tomorrow we do whatever we do ghee I don't care I just don't use it I just don't use the key you know I I let people grab mine but I try to use arm bars and chokes and things that I would do noogie that's how I trained from ghee to noogie so that I could do both I just decided I'm just gonna train in a ghee like I don't have one on like let people growl be I'll be I'll recognize that I have it on so people can grab me but I don't grab theirs I just use over hooks and under hooks and okay so I was trying to make a joke out of noogie Oh somebody having the key Joe segi Lord it is definitely a slower game like older dudes in particular they seem to like the geek as they can kind of control you and it's good for you and it could also be used against you which is bad well it's if you have a winter coat on man like I always said that the worst thing to do is get in a fight with a judo black belt when you got a winter coat on oh yeah it's great or even a suit sweater like shit's good yeah yeah we're looking at you it's all gravy yeah you uh you got your blue belt now right yeah when you uh when you think you get a purple belt you're on your way right I got to get some stripes I talked to JJ butter to go dude I'm trying to train more so I can get a strike good yeah you do for a stripe I go well come on I got a fucking train more so I can get this Drive I don't want the stripe I want to earn the stripe are you doing things other than your jujitsu training in terms of like physical training maybe a little dumbbells and and yoga ball it's about yeah that's it yeah she get a trainer did someone like it'll it'll make a big difference it's like think about your your body is like a race car right if you could just lift weights and your race car would go faster wouldn't you do that like if there was a thing you could do you know Dumbo's but dumbbells but my elbow firkin hurts lately so like this is the thing I was talking about he do a tennis elbow right I I was having a problem with my elbow you you hold it like that like you twist it like this and then you untwist it with your arm so you hold it like this twist and then untwist it you do it slowly and it works on these tendons the same tendons that you get but it's just so shitty how I got it fucking sleeping could we have him try that right now let's see huh damn it's a lot everything it looks so you twist it and then untwist it yeah like like twist it like that right and then level it out and then slowly untwist it that's good yeah just gonna be over and over and over again a little bit that's it's far more dense than it looks yeah it's great for your tendons it specifically works this part of your arm like down in here now you just look at your Jirga novel in that's good too you know what else is good a roller you know when you have one of those phones no accord with like a weight at the bottom of it and you got to roll it with your boy I used to do them box it was in the day those are great people just fuse to fabricate them in the gym yeah like a stick yeah those are great yeah I haven't one of those out there too it's just that's that's one of the best entries forums right yeah for your forearms and gripping just have that kind of strength good you would be awesome at jujitsu I guarantee you because you're a chess player and she just is very cerebral you know it's very it's like it's it's boxing obviously is very cerebral too but they're you limited in your weapons you'd only have a certain amount of angles you could punch from where it's jujitsu there's an endless combination you get some time to think some to in certain positions yeah I'm a teacher that did okay that Kido yeah yeah we're slot hmm that's what he did does that do the jewelry shop I have to have Aikido jujitsu he gave me he did something to me and I realize okay I gotta watch out for that it's where you know a person manipulates your bone and then drops their whole weight on oh yeah yeah that shit could break your hand yeah if you don't go with it you break your hand threads and frets and push out as I shit to people yeah marcelo garcia is tap people out like high-level people with wrist locks and jiu-jitsu tournaments yeah jean-jacques was showing me like how to wrist like a guy while you're dumb like him it's like it's not nice don't do it to people but you can do this if you yeah there's some nasty shit the things like there's no end to jiu-jitsu there's no end and there and yeah yeah there's no like these are all the moves and that's it the people keep inventing moves constantly I just found out a new move yesterday one rubber guard assassins on Instagram right they've figured out some crazy Kimora you do from a close guard that leads to a triangle Mike what tough like you somebody has to let you do a lot of those things to some of them yeah but sometimes people don't know what you're doing they don't even know you're letting my mom was concerned about rubber guard with your knees like fucking up your knee joints cuz you got to be very flexible to get that rubber guard in yeah just stretch yeah yeah get yourself rubber guard I don't know what that is it's where you put somebody in between your legs hey when you described it sounds so gay you put it put somebody between your legs and then you pull your leg over their head but their head has to pop through so you now you're controlling them you can hold their head this way it's a lot of fucking rubberiness yes it was invented by my friend Eddie Bravo but there was some guys who would play high guard before that he just put it into a more theory of this era it's a good example of it that's what it looks like so he's pulling down using his his leg and his arms to control a guy and wraps him up and while he's down yeah well yeah so he's on the pocket it looks like a Gracie move it is as well to jujitsu moves that's a problem of all jujitsu essentially Eddie right there yeah there is Eddie and Joe came up under my teacher and then Eddie took it to another level from there well Eddie just branched out and you know went into noogie he's much more conspicuous back bailed McGee as well much more concerned with noogie techniques because he wanted techniques that would work in mixed martial arts so it makes martial arts you don't have the collars to grab the sleeves to grab so he wanted to invent a system that you could use especially your when you have the ability to fight off your back it's very when you fight that's Ben Saunders who's like one of the best at it in MMA and if you get wrapped up you're on top of a do and he wraps you up with his legs like that it's very it's very demoralizing yeah you get so trap yeah human nature tells you when you're on your back and this guy on top you you're in trouble but in jujitsu you're like that's fine I got this if you got a good guard like John Jacques oh yeah yeah I'm even interested in that what do you live these days I live in Canada you see in Toronto yeah yeah I was in Jamaica for a minute yeah you living in Jamaica fuck yeah yeah it was fun I love Toronto was one of my favorite places on that's where you first met him I introduced you to him yeah I was telling him earlier at the nightclub yeah I took Joe a nightclub to meet likes and I remember that meeting though yeah that's when uh what's the thing was playing scratch scratch was playing and everybody was there Toronto is just such a perfect city it's like the people are nice but it's urban like it's very populated there's a lot of people but they don't have that asshole vibe that like New York has I think it's the fifth largest city in North America is it yes yeah let me tell you they're building like mad over there yeah all the condos made out of glass renters market uh but tiny little places well there's so much cool shit there and now the weeds legal mm-hmm it's probably booming in Canada but was never really an issue there if you got caught with a like just give me it - stop it but now it's like you go there there's stores you know the stores on the street like yeah yeah I think the necklace is awesome we same stores they're opening like about 25 or 50 in Toronto so the government's gave them some great place when I did that place that you do that of the square Shantanu Center yeah Scotiabank yeah call it Scotiabank yeah I just did it in November he came and then you were there I think a month before me when I yeah yeah yeah I was there before my Netflix special came out and it came out in October so I think I was there around that yeah yeah I fucking love it up there man that's probably one of my favourite cities to visit come on back I love it Massey Hall loved that put that together yeah that was fun man you mean big jack oh that's right that's right that's right yeah that was a good time at the UFC's they're always great - yeah good support they love it up there yeah well it's just Toronto just such a it's such an unusual city like Canada in general like I'll ask you this why people are so nice there's so much nicer than Americans it's uh I don't know it's different there's nice Americans you say nice you're saying they're friendly they're more polite like yeah more polite yeah I find that - I think Americans are nicer and as far as have you been to New York lately yeah here's the thing Canadians are polite and but we'll talk shit about you you're not gonna ever like take that but take that over being rude but Canadians can also get freaked out by people being forward which Americans are considered very forward and you know it's it's an outgoing thing hmm so where's an American like hey you know I want to ask you something Canadians are like oh why is this person so aggressive I'm like where's the Canadian be like excuse me I'd like to ask you a question yeah that's true it'sit's very similar but just different approaches y-you know as far as like stand-up comedy is there how good is the the community in Canada is it like the community in America where there's a lot of up-and-coming people or is it there's much there's a lot of comics in Canada a lot of great ones come out of Canada the problem is there's no the money's not there so no matter touring around ya know like the clubs once you get you know the club's tap out it like maybe you'll make let's see what that's six shows on a weekend I had a good headliner can make 1,200 bucks that's it I mean that's pretty fucking insane yeah it's rough especially if they're selling out and making drink yeah that's the problem is that the club it I I liken it to the UFC almost to a certain degree it's not about the comic it's about the name of the club like Yuk Yuk's yeah yeah Jack's is about Yuk Yuk's and doesn't matter who's there it's about Yuk Yuk's the UFC is about UFC doesn't matter who the fucking fighters they used to have that attitude at some of the clubs in LA you know that was one of the reasons why they had that big comic strike way back in the 70s yeah it's cuz people felt like the you know the comics were the ones who were providing the art form but the clubs and ones who making all the money and they were like hey you know you're you you're at The Improv where you're at the Comedy Store you know the pay scale at these clubs is the same as it was in the 80s which is fucking horrible like I take people out on the road with me and and the clubs will pay 50 bucks for an emcee for the weekend and 100 bucks for the feature and I'm like that's fucking it that's what it was I started in 89 and that's what it would have been that's crazy there's never like that and I'm like that's terrible like how are these kids gonna make a living well in a way it's a lot like boxing because like when people think that boxers make millions of dollars cuz Floyd Mayweather make 100 million dollars in the fight and that is true but if you look at the undercard like there's guys that are fighting for chump change I mean and they are going through a long camp maybe your first paycheck yeah well is your first boxing paycheck 5,000 Wow that's because I'm coming out of the Olympics babe yeah champions and even still that's five thousand dollars for a fucking professional fight but you also had signed a million-dollar deal oh yeah it's gonna add up after a while yeah I mean you're a you're an exception I mean there's guys fighting out there for like 800 bucks you know yeah try 500 300 yeah yeah so you know another thing that disturbs me about MMA as opposed to boxing is the win-lose bonus I don't like that I think your fighter I think a fighter should get paid what they're supposed to get paid no one's trying to lose and if you're trying to lose you're never gonna be able to compete at the highest level anyway these guys are pouring their heart and soul they're giving their body that they're literally sacrificing their health and they might get fucked out of a decision and because of that they lose 50 percent of their money so some incompetent judge which in boxing is everywhere and then delayed bird how dare you you just well there's a there was even worse in her there's people that don't even do it anymore because they would be out of the game every time I listen to the that's when you know you're a fan of the sport when you hear the judges names go fuck not that guy yeah I mean but imagine if 50% of your purse goes away because someone doesn't know what the fuck they're do so wait the win-lose bonus they're guaranteed a certain amount the guaranteed a certain amount but that's to show like say this right like say maybe you would get 10 and 10 so you get $10,000 to fight and 10,000 more if you win much it's crazy it's fit often times 50% and the idea is that you're going to give these fighters an incentive to put on a better show but I think I don't lie and then fight of the night yes I don't like when people fight any different than the way they're fighting when they're fighting the best and the smartest right I think you should fight intelligently you shouldn't engage in a wild brawl because you want some performance bonus you know because like they'll give out performance of the night or knockout of the night can you can you lose and still get the fight of the night boss yes sir Ronnie's got a ton of those ton of bonuses but I mean that's him though he would fight that way if you gave him a guarantee oh yes example if he knew he was gonna make a half million dollars of fight no matter what you would fight exactly that way that's how he fights I think that's how that's how it should be he's an anomaly though because he grew up with money didn't he like a decent he grew up but at these lessons now terribly poor he did wasn't wealthy I thought he had money I find it good grew up with with a decent amount of money that's why I was sold it I don't believe so I don't want to speak out of school though I mean but I I have always been at Mikey's PJ pen did you know BJ Penn is a legend BJ grew up with a wealthy family they're wealthy he just was a fighter he finds it I just saw somewhere he's fine he's gonna fight Clay Guida yes that's a fucking odd one I'm retired he did he got bored so I still wants to do it he actually looked very good in his last fight up until a very exciting fighter back in the day he's still a wild man yeah he's still wot but he got leglock by Ryan Hall who's just this phenomenal jiu-jitsu player and he caught him with a he did a imanari role and caught him in a leg lock and just fucked his leg up Eman re-roll yeah it sounds like something you eat it was an re roll em Inari is this very famous Japanese fighter who is a phenomenal leg lock artist and there's actually two moves there's two there's an Eminem Inari which M&R it comes from omoplata an omoplata is a shoulder lock I think it's a Portuguese word I think that's why they call it almost gets your it's from your leg yeah it's a shoulder lock and then the Inman re is while you're locked up in the omoplata you grab like a grip underneath the guy's chin and yank I'm back it's a nasty now I'll show you tomorrow I hope not friendly role weekend but if you catch yourself in a normal plot that it's coming you know you know what's funny is when a I'm a big fan of the in arm choke which I know is your favorite head and arm yeah yeah and and yeah and then you're on Jack now causes the Joe Hogan some would do it get the Joe Hogan and that's your move you've actually it's now your move at the gym well you know sometimes you have like techniques that you you hit so often that you just know when they're there yeah and you can close them up real quick yeah that was always my shit that's what I've been I've ever since then I've actually been working on that well you know some of you guys did it to me and it's such a suffocating feeling and when someone's on top of you and your arm pinned here next their arms across your neck and you like it's such a and you make that noise funny it's a horrible way to get choked out of the esteem alike I like when guys get blocks named after them how do you get out of it doubt you have to put your hand on your ear like you're answering the phone that's that's one the first thing is you're trying to create some space here so that you don't go to sleep you gotta you gotta give in to the fact that this guy's choking this side of your neck for sure so the arms coming under here and it's wrapping around here and if you just go like that and it's down or like that it's going to get smushed you're getting you're getting smushed right so you got it here trying to create a little bit of space then you hope this motherfucker gets tired of squeezing your neck and then you're trying to get in here and create a little bit of space that's what we try to do just give me a little bit of space at a time just a little bit of space it's all just a matter of little inches little tiny micro movements but when someone has your arm wrapped up like that and they have that arm across your neck and there's crushing you with their bodyweight and then they get their knee on your solar plexus and flatten you out and down it's horrible are their fighters in other countries that don't go in and I'm a but they're unbelievable fighters but they're not trying to show anybody that they're unbelievable fighters Oh like kung-fu guys no no those guys all get fucked up when they try to they think they do it because you start believing it and you have your students and they believe you're the master and the Shaolin Guardians tried entering mustard punch of those video my guy who'd wear the horns Shaolin suit and he would win and like these really hokey fight oh yeah and then he get into the big ones and he just get the shit beat out of them yeah he was kickboxing yeah he actually had some skills like heating nice to watch a show yeah he had some he could do a little bit but what I'm talking about it's like these Chi masters ones where you put seems really those are so sad yeah yeah McDo yeah Mick dojo what is the make dojo life on Instagram as a shitload of those hey let's make me laugh they're so sad yeah that's what he put you put seems legit yeah well a lot of legit is fuck they'll go and fight a real fighter and they think they actually know how to fight and they just get concussed they just get smashed open you know is it because you know why why does they don't get it yeah they don't get hit that's why that's why I love boxing you know boxing you spar all the time yeah it hit all the time so you know in a real fight boxers is being hit you know guys that do kung fu and all those things they don't get hit so when they do get hit in the real fight it's like it messes them up it's like yeah but don't see this coming yeah yeah practical application the difference between practicing and you know thinking there's so many of these this guys doing I haven't seen this one this is a new one I just picked one that that guy and the black he looks like he's gonna fuck this dude up it's a very key looks like the carpeting in my bedroom oh my god what did you see that I wonder why they weren't such weird keys and everybody everybody clapping everybody belts are in that class God dance silly fucks they really believe that I bet that guy could get him suck his dick the same way I know people who really believe that their teacher can do that stuff [Music] they're called priests yeah it's a it's weird that those people are still around in the day of video cameras that you can still have this but yeah what you're saying is probably even what you were saying that if you hadn't fought in two years and you would get in there and get hit you like whoa okay okay let's see I seen Keith Thurman do that really oh there's last fight yeah yes he's in Lopez isn't a banger by any means he looked a little little off though yeah well but Keith Thurman had to suffer through that one little concussion concussed I should say and he was all right after that if you hit him with that same shot he would have took it even better yeah because he got over the hump I still tried to Lopez oh yeah yeah a lot of people did yeah yeah it was a close fight there was yeah and you know it was Thurman's big comeback fight I mean how long he'd been out two years at least how it was he injured he was injured he had some sort of operations elbow yeah yeah so you know but that's also one of the things that makes it so interesting you know I mean when and when a guy does come back from a devastating loss and you go okay like like Manny Pacquiao when Marquez knocked him out out whoo I mean crazy that was a bad one that was a bad boy that was a bad one I got some slurring later maybe it's like you know you make a move good move but then you've moved into the man's power punch and he hits you and you know there's no second chance with that one yeah and Marquez I mean he's a he's an interesting case you know I mean he's uh obviously a very very talented fighter but as he got older he got like physically stronger he got bigger and stronger you know Mexican supplements Mexican meat lot involved literal meat monkey juice there's a lot involved here right I mean and he actually was working with Manny Pacquiao's old strength and conditioning guy and Manny was the guy was always accused of doing stuff oh you talk about Alex a reason yeah I mean Manny went up eight when I had housed Ariza trained me before yeah when I was doing my special three years ago look at him jacked is he still fighting no he's retired Marquez is done yeah good for him they're talking about Floyd they're doing oh they're talking about doing a Floyd Pacquiao rematch I'm not really excited about that you know what I'm excited about I want to see how much money Floyd Mayweather can make I'm excited I mean like the fucking the fact that he talked to everybody into that Conor McGregor fight and he made more than a hundred million dollars well isn't that tension kid fighting again he's fighting somebody else now nazo Kawa yeah he's a he's a badass you nobody's supposed to be fighting another another boxer yeah well I think you're right I feel a sore one but you know well tension is a hundred and twenty six pounds yeah so we should fight somebody that means the fact that he fought mayweather at all and people like oh it looks like it was a fake fight no that's what it looks like when 126 pound fighter fights one of the best boxers of all time yeah that's what it looks like they don't look fake he did fall very dramatically because he got his fucking brain rattled you know oh yeah this oh my god you want they can't make that weight anymore either try to make the weight is that now but they don't have a make weight that's the thing they just have a fight I mean Floyd didn't make any fucking weight did he would you like do you like the way one Fc is doing their weight that yes they're like a lot yeah for people don't know they they don't let them cut weight they do hydration tests so there's no dehydrating yourself so if you wait at you walk around 185 pounds you're gonna fight at 185 pounds you're not gonna fight at 170 or 165 I have like a lot of these guys do that's good yeah I'd love yeah that's good because the hydration aspect of even in any sport taking that liquid away from the brain yeah your your body needs liquid yeah needs it survives on the quits and it makes your bones brittle it's it's terrible for you in every way it's terrible for your performance your internal organs a lot of guys have kidney failure when they're cutting waiting for weigh-ins that's the beautiful thing about you being a heavyweight right yeah I didn't have to take off my clothes I can wait whatever but yeah there was always that fighting weight where I would be perfect that Manny was good at that yeah the way okay that we don't move anything don't move from there to 240 no 235 235 was perfect knew you were on yep yeah now what kind of what kind of nutrition did you follow when you're fighting did you you did you take specific vitamins or dying specific things no Jamaican food Jamaican food yeah Angelo Dundee asked me that same question yeah I said what do you eat I said my mother's food he said if it does if it ain't broke don't fix it it's a perfect Angelo Dundee quote yeah yeah he's another one man remember that in there with the Sugar Ray Leonard against Thomas Hearns you're blowing it kid yeah I think it's you shouldn't let her get fired up and goes out and stops from the next round there was a lot of good trainers back the handbook Georgie Benton air how are ya Georgie Benton yeah bless your soul good for a good train as well it's so important for a young fighter to get hooked up with the right trainer right you know we got on that for a second I think part of the problem with a lot of young kids right now they need to get good trainers yeah good trainers really help your game because even helps you with the with the TV because I was saying today that when a man you came into my corner HBO started talking about me what better before he was like oh he doesn't throw the jab enough he looks like he's tired the fight when I went with Manny they were like praising me no he's doing good now max Manny's behind him now he's a trainer of champion so trainer really helps you your game were you with Manny when you fought Mercer yes that was a war yeah that was a actually no I wasn't I wasn't that mersa fight he actually taught Mercer helped me out because before that fight I was always fighting guys that hooked hooked around body shots and hooks so I kept my hands like this at the side of my face then that and then I went into that fight got a fat lip I hated I hate getting fat lips in my fights that's like you know hey did you win the fight yeah it didn't look like you good to get a fat lip from you know so I kept on walking around with a fat lip and a good picture of you me and Lloyd and you kind of fat lips right out of money phrase from like 97 and then then Manny said you know it doing wrong he said you need to put your hand in front of your mouth I'm like okay so even if a guy throws in a punch which slides doesn't slide through he's gonna hit your hand and he said you can move your hand two inches to protect yourself from okay yeah I said yeah okay you're right nothing no more fat lips well I ain't getting fat lips boy everybody look at you funny mmm that's hilarious well having a great trainers it's so important in MMA as well I mean it's and there's not that many of them it's like you really have to find the right ones you a lot of good trainers too just former fighters now well there's that yeah but you know someone has to be a real stud you can't just be a trainer or just be a former fighter rather you have to be a student yeah to really understand the game like Emanuel was only an amateur fighter right I never fought professional and he was one of the greatest of all time unquestionably like everybody respected him and so soft-spoken you know and just but just knew just knew how to raise fighters and you think about all the guys Jeremy Cleland Tommy Hearns all the great fighters that came out of that camp the only problem I have with you know old-time fighters is like you know some some old-time fighters were bad fighters and now right now they're training a young kid the same way Ryan it's not it's not positive yes like you're teaching them about tricks yeah but then there's guys who are better as trainers than they were as fighters already runs 100% yeah like Freddie Roach is recognized one of the greatest trainers for sure alive but as a fighter he was a journeyman Kevin Roni was a good trainer in his death yeah and he got knocked up by a Oh in the second round well he was a good trainer with Tyson but he never really developed talent outside of time he's developed a lot of alcohol that's what oh well you know hangin around with Mike and gets high years on a leash and then what he had a good run for a minute buddy McGirt he's still training fighter yeah I've trained a buddy before Joe yeah he was a great fighter but he was a great fighter yeah great dude yo you haven't trained with me yet what afraid of me guy
