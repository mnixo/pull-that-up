drinking a water and I'm just wow go on the back and fucking toca fucking twenty two hits off a pipe and I love listening to music at night that's my hobby it's a thing to like when you get out of this it's a thing to sit yourself down and make yourself work and write you know cuz you're like I'm done I did it it got a good set in I'm good but that's the best time to write our thing everything's popping while go home and make corrections maybe I said that fucked too early or maybe I said that my shouldn't have said it but no I won't try to write at night I'm gone at night like

technique there was something that every time I was talking to Duncan about I talked to Ari about it I know she said something to us at one point that we were like wow something I was telling this on my podcast that there was a time she didn't like you doing that in a coal bin the man in the original fucking crazy is that that's to show you how genius and a way like she was like Joe you can light yourself on fire the original I don't give a fuck but in the main loop you can't do that because you're killing my room like the comics afterward just could not follow it like they could just not follow that was about it was brilliant but it think about it there's no good versions of that bit anywhere this one version that I did that's up on you it's terrible it's a terrible version that

and then you'd take him home there was two bricks yeah well he did the same thing to investors he took boxes filled them up with bricks and just stocked them in the warehouse and then he went public so he got everybody to come down and look at all his inventory and all these fact checkers they're checking boxes of bricks of him whoa he had I mean five fucking warehouses all around they were all

of those crazy and he had the best one he had Frankenstein Dracula and the Wolfman peeing at the peon at the men's the urinal mr. Imus thing cuz I came in like I remember I found out about ironmans is Howard Stern was talking shit about him and I was like who is this I'm a Scott I miss was around when I was yeah it was way late was already Imus was the fucking king of New York when I was 8 9 I miss will come on the morning and talk shit when I saw him he was wearing like a turquoise one of those weird ties those bolo ties that like Cowboys wearing he had a fucking cowboy hat on and his whole studio was done like well like the West it was real weird yeah he got weird at the annual rancher AM radio show from New York City poor this got fucked up nope and him I mean he was on for a while I'm he said nappy-headed hos no like cut that's it we tried to compete with Stern right that's what it was there wasn't it son it was definitely some of that you know he was trying to be outrageous even before a stern I believe it just wasn't at the same level Stern's outrageousness was nationwide but I must was really like a East Coast thing like people knew about him in New York I never heard about him in New York or in Boston but I'd heard about Stern we all knew about Stern but nobody nobody really knew about like it never made it there you know and then when I came to New York it was at the end like when Stern was already the king and I must was just sort of like this guy that he hated and I was like who is this i man like who is this I miss guy and then they had a TV show for a while and then during a TV show you'd see him in the studio and it was you know no disrespect but it was really fucking boring it was boring like there was no life to them like their opinions weren't that interesting was him and there was another guy there that looked like he was just waiting for there wasn't a ring yet he's waiting to go home and then there was a woman that was with them it was it was there was no life in the room like you do watch the stern show there'd be midgets shooting bottle rockets out of their assholes and porn stars riding dildos and it was chaos there was a plastic all over the grounds girls would be squirting it was just madness like no one had ever done not that that's good or bad but it was it was exciting like you're driving and work in the morning you're hearing some girl freaking out because she's riding on some fucking that sibian thing he'd make girls ride on and like that was madness so like that that like you had never heard anything like that on the radio before so then you would hear about Imus and I'm as a boil water without her this morning oh there's my beheaded holes like what the a try to just be at the end it was just it was in comparison it was so it was dead it was like it was dry Kennison on Stern was great fuckin flava flav the one time on Stern I mean there's so many great stones do party was so great back Artie was the best party was fuckin the may have you listened to an old Artie one when he had just gotten off the subway he just shot heroin glasses on yeah fucking insane and he said like that they encouraged him you know but man you could what are you gonna do when a guy's like that you're gonna help him have you help the problem with people that are that fucked up is the only thing that ever helps them is themselves the only thing it's like they have to hit rock bottom and then they have to decide they're gonna they're gonna do something about it but when you do get a lot of love for being fucked up that is kind of a problem because you do start to think this is my thing my thing is being a fucked-up guy people love me when

road with light and a hotel room look at his fucking hair growing out of my nose did you fight about the women with the most investments we can do Oh from Newsweek in July okay was it's a it's a great upper echelons of money and power blah blah blah according to Forbes the world's 15 wealthiest people are men women only make up 10% of top 100 separate wealthiest women in the world most of their money comes from their male relatives or husbands yeah the top 10 wealthiest men made their fortunes themselves know who the top 10 wealthiest woman that days they're from divorce so here the girl Oprah's gotta be yeah she's up there the first self-made woman on list is why I don't know how to say this woman's name zah oh you that's one word qu n Fei zu puddin fee who was born to a poor family of China dropped out of school at 16 she went on to found in an enormous Lee successful technology company but if you put men back in the equation she's only 198th richest person in the world hmm no matter how you feel about the concept of a few people hoarding enormous wealth the notion that women can only access money and power through their families or husbands Sims Medieval at best yet we see it occur at the very top of many professions outside of the business world most people can you read the next ya a recently high-profile examples Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign the first female major-party nominee she campaigned on a ticket of empowerment yet although she is accomplished in her own right she entered politics as the wife of Bill Clinton and is undoubtedly benefited from his prestige and connections yeah well that's true but you read that there she was a lawyer and a you know she was a senator now Oprah's up there as the world's richest women period like that amazing that's a weird thing because they're saying I'm not a big fan of Hillary Clinton but by saying she definitely entered because she was you know she was married to him but she was a lawyer I mean she's an accomplished person she's she's educated accomplished who's a senator I don't think that makes sense I hate when people say tip she like you know what you're at the right place at the right time bitch I know jumped and you jumped yeah you jumped bitch so that's the problem I'm not mad at nobody you can't say she got into BA yes she may be a little help or push here a call here but she jumped there's a great book I'm reading right now it's called outliers by Malcolm McDowell it's fucking great and it's all about what makes people successful and why they were successful and there are a lot of factors man there's a lot of factors in when you were born like wet like a out of it he goes on about hockey players about professional hockey players that almost all of them were born at a certain time so that they were at the end of the age cutoff so like say if you know you're between ten and eleven when you go into what is that fifth grade you are if you're one of the oldest kids you have a way better chance of being successful at hockey because your body's more mature then whether you're one of the youngest kids that goes into sixth grade so with your fifth grade or sixth grade like what year you were born is a big factor so the kids that were born later so that they're older rather the kids over there that are older when they enter into the fifth grade or sixth grade they're like across the board unanimously all the top level professionals were all older kids in younger grades so that they're playing against smaller kids they get more time they're better so they get more coaching they get more hours playing there's a lot of factors there's a lot of factors in like one of the things about Bill Gates that there was it's a good there's a whole great chapter on Bill Gates and about when Bill Gates was young the the school that he went to had a computer class that allowed him to do coding and then he got into the University of Washington they would let him get into their their computer room from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. they had this open block so him and his friends would sneak into that place at 3 o'clock in the morning so all these all these different factors that lead to someone being like super successful it's not just that you work hard it's sometimes you get these weird advantages in life there's a bunch of things like for sure hard work plays a factor if you don't do nothing you just sit around and and and what was me and cry and and think the world's fucked you're not going anywhere but the people that make it to the very top the Bill Gates the Steve Jobs they have a bunch of things going for them it's not just hard work it's also circumstance fortune where they are well you know who's around them who who encourages them there's a bunch of what time they were born in what you know what age they were when certain things happened world there's a bunch of factors but for all those chicks it's just marrying the right dude divorced I know a lady who just got aid from a divorced and she's just shooting shit into her face and banging 20 year olds now hilarious she's in her late 40s bagging 20 year old dudes funny man to

and saying you know London School of Economics yeah listen when it comes to bro when it comes to I met there's stories that you hear that you're like no he didn't like no he did not do you see him Joe Robinson in his rehearsal things do you ever see any of his video do you follow him at all I follow him yeah you see any of the videos that he does of him working on the afternoon December to his art man like dance he's still like Michael Jackson that's time that guy does not fuck around now and I still remember one particular story when he got the boulder they played there where the boulder buffalo was with a college place he walked in and he goes what's wrong with those seats and they were like well mr. Jagger they're behind the stage bitch you better get the sellin cuz I ain't taking the stage until those motherfuckers are sold out I sold the tickets behind the stage Mick Jagger's brutal they could pay for my ass they could pay for my ass Mick Jagger's brutal problem he's brutal and that was back before they had those giant screens there's no this is this is 88 they didn't have those giant screens this is 88 87 they don't give a fuck didn't have those big LCDs we could see them like if you go see like say Drake and he's at a theater and around and like you see his butt right you're gonna see his face on giant screens all around you he'll see it you know if you you go to see like a real popular person and they're a lot of people are playing in the round you know he's an interesting guy I don't think he's like very tight watches Jesus mmm tight you know he's just like much time as you have left though I mean he's like 76 right no 72 maybe 72 well 75 he's a 75 how much time you got left if he can you're lucky everything goes great you got 25 years but those last 25 a rough not what what he's got cuz he can just lay there all day have young girls misogyny big jagged dog they could just blow on his little nut sack and sing fuckin he's probably getting blood transfusions every day ya know he takes good care he's the back black look he's the backbone of the organization and just to think that Keith Richards is still alive and kicking and there's people out there doing Crossfit and didn't Keith Richards write a book where he's kind of shitty about Mick Jagger he just told you talk shit about each other that's how they sell bookstores yeah I know that's how they said Mick Jagger probably called them and said do this do this how the truth fuck it give me 10% and when that one I mean when I watch those little rehearsal tapes look at his fingers look at those fingers we're looking at a Keith Richards he's Richards fingers is every knuckle is swollen to the point it's like double the size he looks like he's got Megaton Diaz his hands he's like a jujitsu guy you ever seen Megaton Diaz's hands yeah big fuckin hey Kenzie Dern's dad the girl who wrote that made that video yeah but he was hilarious like that you have to you but her dad Megaton Diaz jujitsu legend all his life he's done the gay guys who do the gay all the time they developed real bad arthritis in their hands and their joints swell up like crazy see if you find megaton Diaz his hands that's not a good picture that's but there's there's some pictures of his knuckles there there they're crazy they're all fucked up and twisted like yeah it is tell a little bit there there you go zoom in on his 90 mil he was McKenzie turns dead yeah her dad is a fucking legend look zoom in on as much as I could go oh that's as much as it goes we see see how fuckin flamed out those knuckles are guys have done the game their whole life and they're always grab and hold on to that gig they get that yeah that's okay we get the point but that that's what Keith Richards fingers look like like he's secretly doing jujitsu on the sly that's 40 years of playing yes man that is crazy that's good too hot playing 40 years 50 years meanwhile he looks just as good as Mick Jagger he's doing blow everyday eating cockroaches he looks as good as Mick Jagger look they look great I don't think he looks as I think Mick Jagger looks fucking sensational but he doesn't in the face if you look at the two of them in the face make that picture bigger Jamie look at them in the face Mick Jagger looks older but that's just it's hard to tell because Keith Richards is smiling we should go I would love to see Mick Jagger still pull 21 year olds out of the audience I bet they'd feel so weird when he fucks him it must feel so weird like you want to do it like if I was a girl I was 20 years old I would fuck Mick Jagger just for the story but when he climbs on top of you and you smelled death you smell it coming out of his pores he's not he's old he's as bad cells you smell misfiring cells all over the place don't send me your people didn't look like that semion Apple we're not going on the road they weren't dancing like down on Tauron like that that's something that you have to and this is a new thing it's a new to all these people first for all these bands that are going on or in this if Isaac how about somebody called me the other day and they're like hey man I'm thinking about doing something New Year's Eve downtown you know I hate New Year's Eve right I hate downtown even more fucking

connect his ankles together with rubber bands so we can't make big steps never see how he walks is that truly beautiful you trying to pull a Mickey on me mamu Mickey made fucking Rocky is the same problem rocky had Creed for creed this the first feels good did you watch it yeah I told you I collagen said watch it if you have an Academy Award winner no but you know man for years I don't know I don't know I don't know how I felt about Sylvester Stallone I'm a fan I just didn't then I went to your house that time and your wife was goofing on you and she's like I think he's got he's in love with Sylvester Stallone and he like look at this look at him you had a picture of his phone he was 65 Jack he was just jacked yeah yeah like all that shit and stuff and then I was on a plane I said oh you watch this Crete and drop I tears of my eyes oh because I'm like this guy has got no respect for using you look at him now people goofed on the shit dog he wrote to oh yeah hold back done Wow look at that zoomin on his back wow I didn't know he had his whole back done that's crazy like this guy wrote a fucking two or three franchises yeah this guy started like when you yeah they had some things about facts about a guy like he was fucking bro yeah the sellers dog he had to do all this shit and stomach groggy that picture right there yeah look at this guy jacked 71 jacked fucking jacked when I saw that commercial for the first time like read I was like I'm not watching this shit and then AMC lately every Sunday or something they throw a Rakhi on and you say what the fuck I got 10 minutes before world lose tonight and you start watching it and you see the brilliance of what this man has done yeah it's brilliant it's just completely brilliant whether it's cheesy with three when he gets beat up and Apollo Creed takes them to the ghetto and makes them look at brothers and oh and now and then Creed is that kid by the way is a badass motherfucker Michael Johnson oh Jesus Christ he's very mad the other guy a fucking superb but this now like and at you looking at you I like me and you at the store behind it like you would say to me really Jody is he's gonna fight the Russian son I could have wrote that idea out of fucking it's still huge it's still coming out Thanksgiving Day this guy is not a giant it's gonna be huge I'll be there front and center at one o'clock crazies that franchise started it in the 70s 70s he made Rocky one in the I remember I watched it when I was a little kid I drank raw eggs and I ran around the block like I just listened to a David Goggins fucking motivational speech I just I read about about this when they first started shooting this he told him to hit him for real and he put him in ICU for nine days Dolph Lundgren he said try to knock him out what why would he do that I don't Dolph Lundgren was a legit kyo kitchen karate champion doctor Dolph Lundgren's a bad motherfucker like legitimate bad motherfucker like you know he did a bunch of those crazy action movies and he played The Punisher and all let's say but that guy is a was a legit karate champion he's a bad motherfucker Toph longer I would not want that guy hitting so what's this what's this one called London put me in the hospital during Rocky for well you know who else knocked him Antonio Tarver knocked Sylvester Stallone out when there when he was doing that movie where he was still boxing remember just a few years ago he was in his fucking 60s and he was boxing in one of those movies they fought Antoniou Tarver magic Mantar was a heavyweight champion light heavyweight champion knocked out Roy Jones jr. remember when he stood in front of Roy Jones Roy Jones go got any excuses tonight Roy and then he knocked him out Antonio Tarver is a bad motherfucker and apparently when they were doing scenes in a movie he clipped him and and Kay Odom here's a quick story he said he yeah for the first 45 seconds he tried to really knock him out he hit him so hard as chess started to soar his heart started as well his blood pressure went up had they go back on an emergency jet to America and he was in ICU for five days whoa and the insurance company would not say yeah now I'm intensive care for five days with nuns walking around insurance company would not pay out if they saw the footage of the incident once they did they wrote the check he hit my heart so hard it banged against my ribs it started to swell and that usually happens in car accidents so was hit by a truck that is ridiculous he witnessed it Sloan also talks about why he hated Lundgren from the get-go there Renne now Wow probably cuz a big handsome fellow from fucking Norway or where the hell he's from where's he from Dolph Lundgren with that name he's from some distant cousins cousins son Sweden I didn't know that he was a key location guy he's a karate champion yeah I think he was a national champion coke oceans no joke man those those those fucking guys it's a hard style very hard style that's just be awesome yeah isn't that GSP star low so Yap Commission I think mas oyama skill cushioned pretty sure I'm really hard-hitting motherfuckers it's a very hard time I choose my kicks a lot of wheel kicks what they do in the tournaments kill Christian tournaments had punch to the body full blast butt kick to the legs the head the body and there's stand right in front of each other and beat the fuck out of each other it's horrific it's like kind of the opposite of Taekwondo was a lot of kicks and punches only to the body - but Kyoko Chen they they threw leg kicks in there and it wasn't a lot of footwork with most of those guys most of those guys like stood in front of each other and batter each other but a lot of cool Christian guys went on to be really successful in kickboxing in fact a lot of a lot of the holland influence in kickboxing came from Kyojin background like they started out with Kyoko Chen and kickboxing and then they learn Thai Thai techniques as well but a lot of those guys had an influence of Kukushkin karate very big in Europe it's crazy left first started martial arts the big thing was a sweep sweep delay early 70s everybody swept yeah who do you faith - high kicks and even if it was a spinning back kick the third one was a sweep and that motherfucker was gone I used to go to all those karate tournaments and that was my shit I throw too high spinning back-kick so here I didn't even want them to hit sweeps helijet and nobody sweeps anymore no before you still do an MMA a little bit a little bit never made but not him as much as I expect well good sweep with a good fucking leg if you set him up a good old-fashioned to sweep I mean what's his name has that little sweep the leg push you back you know your boy here John Jones no the other guy John Jones has a - yeah all those restaurants does that all that little sweep I like that little sweet but I'm talking about from the fighters position to just come into you with a sweep and throw your legs out from under you it takes a bunch of fake so I'm here with you know it's basically off like bah bah bah and instead of the elbow coming around your leg comes around and sweeps that guy off his feet right he lands on his back and you attack with you laughs this still some some guys that are really good at sweeps the thing about MMA is just there's so many different things going on you know but in Muay Thai sweeps are huge and muy Thai it's a big part of the sport you know that's why goes when you know who fights in Bellator he's so high level and muy Thai now he's getting into MMA he's fuckin guys up not just with sweeps of spinning elbows all sorts of shit that is his level of Muay Thai like muy Thai involves a lot of grappling a lot of a lot of weird stuff listen to Kenny floor in one time he goes that you know Muay Thai even has a couple aspects from jujitsu and I guess not you too but sometimes Roman greco-roman clinching there's a lot of clinch work and those guys develop really strong cores and necks they grab each other by the back of the neck and they're moving each other around sweeping each other all the time there's so much involved in you know framing with your forearms and sweeping the legs out and twisting and and changing angles it's a great when when you learn the other aspects of wrestling when you learn takedowns and control and then when you learn jujitsu and all these other like having that background from the clinch from muy Thai is so gigantic because so many different things open up from their elbows open up from their knees to the body open up from there you wrestled in high school gee I wrestled one year in high school why don't you rest for because I was still doing talk window at the time and I had to figure out what what was more you know what was more important to me I couldn't do both it was just two examples like that wrestlers shit mr. Tomich you know he used to have that fucking weight room down to like 190 they were doing hatha yoga before hatha yoga was invented that room stunk and it was hot it was asbestos coming off the ceiling new mills like what is covering these pipes no one's checked these pipes I'm like I don't want cancer what's happening in this fucking schools had asbestos in it we breathe asbestosis I hate paint chips and kindergarten all the water had led didn't have led you like what I went to the park yesterday my daughter and there was a lady next to me and she asked where I was from and she goes her father was from Brooklyn we started talking she had a beautiful two-year-old and the two-year-old got caught on one of the monkey bars and the father had to go over and help her and she was having her going up to my father's neighbor to see in his play yard there were nothing like these like my stomach coming from Cuba and doing that you know in monkey bars but then you get so good that you put your legs up and you hang by your knees and one day brought in hanging right and I'd landed on that concrete there was no rubber in those days it was just straight-up concrete half the first grade I fucking twitched i twitch that the first grade I landed right on my fucking neck I never got on a monkey bar again you first break a lot of kids fuck around with monkey bars at all dawg I broke my arm in a monkey bar my daughter broke her arm in a monkey bar yeah my another kid in my daughter's class broke her arm in a monkey bar you breaking up with a monkey bar fall down try to catch yourself put post your arms snap yeah yeah that's real common monkey bars are fucking dangerous because you don't have the hand strength yet you're six years old so you grabbing ahold of bars and you're swinging you just don't really have the dexterity the hamstring and it slips and you fall back and you post and snap you gotta see my daughter on that monkey bar she gets it she does it until our hands bleed dog little blisters the mother's gonna put band-aid artists fierce does she know yeah like that about it I take it til I put a lot of time into that shit I've you know it's really weird because of the Cavanaugh situation and the Harvey Weinstein situation you're a dad I'm a dad it's different than how you gonna raise your daughter now this has affected me in a way the cabin loft thing was pissing me off for a few weeks because I don't like the idea that they could come back to you for something you did in high school that that's just not right in my world unless I fuck you in the ass in high school and covered your mouth I didn't do nothing I think that was the thing he did do though he did cover cover the mouth or whatever but who knows what really happened nobody knows and nobody knows nobody knows so 36 years ago yeah I know for a fact I've known you for 20 and I've seen you sweeten up over the years we all change you're not the same Joe Rogan I met 20 years ago please but he was uh he was a guy that was hanging around with a bunch of drunk jocks and we all remember drunk yes you know you know and that environment that that's sort of in the environment of like being around a bunch of drunk guys who were constantly one-upping each other that's a that's a sketchy fucking environment and that's the that's frat houses well the Yale thing scared me that's when I thought you know those guys at rich coin kids doing you know what happens when you have a little bit of money everything's been covered up all their lives everything has been covered up all their lives you know when I was a kid I knew this girl they used to call him in the head and I'm Friday nights they get in a car and they drive it to like fuckin Connecticut and tell her she had to suck all their dicks to get home God knows of that poor girl is today last time I saw it was 1993 getting coconut building in Harlem and she gonna save me I'm with some guy in the car he doesn't want to leave me alone on my listen bitch I'm walking to my car I never saw you before my life I swear to god you had bumped into her and a cop house on 180 first Street ten years after high school I'm in the fucking fourth floor with some Dominicans I'm walking down the stairs in his Mindi head and she's like what are you doing here the same thing you're fucking doing he obviously what's fucked up is for some people their experiences in high school define them you know I just watched that a Stephen King movie it the the most recent one with the clown yeah pretty fucking good but what one of the things that I was thinking when I was watching it was like how fucking mean kids are in school to each other I guess you kind of forget about that and then you watch one of those movies about people being mean to people you're like oh yeah I remember going around to get away from a guy that was picking on me that was fuck with me and like you would be scared of running into him at the bus stop and scared of seeing him after school and that's how I got into martial arts in the first place I got tired of being scared scared of people I was in martial arts when I was still fucking scared let me tell you something funniest thing about the movie it was that they fuck with clowns so two months later a bunch of clowns got together went on strike they went downtown and they had a parade like not a pariah what do you call when people get together and and they fucking have signs this is right after that movie was released 1017 whenever that movie was released a month later two months later a bunch of clowns in the in the California area got together downtown and picketed Stephen King because they were losing work as clowns because they had lost a bunch of clowns got canceled they lost all their clown season work or some shit I read the book a long time which won it I remember I was like man how are they gonna make a movie out of this and they made a movie out of it way back in the day with John Boy from The Waltons I'm gonna do with the mole on his face he's got a ponytail in it I watched it the other night on TV just flipping through the channels it was on and was after a couple days after I had seen the the most recent version of it it was hilarious we bad who was so stupid but it was john-boy with the Waltons and might have been how many versions of that it movie did they make that was it just - the first one was the first one with Tim the guy from the Rocky Horror Picture Show that without was who the the clown was yeah it was so stupid it was so it wasn't scary at all I mean that not even remotely but the new one was pretty fucking scary well Stephen King dog is a fucking crazy motherfucker we both read on writing yeah we both did you see my son's an together no he want me they contact from like we want here to be on sons of anarchy listen the only way I'm gonna get was like if I could ride my motorcycle they had to go back and forth like we don't need you sir well I just tell you if I go on son as I am aqui I had to ride my motorcycle so he played a creepy guy that makes you disappear after they kill you really like he comes in and measures you like you're on the floor dead and he walked and measure you and tell you what he needs I need a rope I need some gasoline I need a corporate car I also need a selection of 70s classic rock and then you disappear when you come back there's nothing there and they walk him out he tells you what you want how much 800 you pay in the 800 if you only have six he'll look around the room he'll just take like a statue Taizo statue on the motorcycle he was classic Sons of Anarchy you know the crazy thing about him was his battle coming back from getting hit by that guy in a car he was walking I think was in Maine right he was walking and some guy wasn't paying attention and fucking hit him in his car just destroyed his body like just destroyed his body like I mean he was fucked up for a long the motorcycle but a motorcycle yeah shatters no no he was walking he was just walking then we got hit by a guy in a van go could I read that I think you turned me on to it when I read that chapter on Kerry how he got written half a carry and threw it away and his wife found him finish it and it was about a girl with a paries of something crazy and like I was in shock great book Kerry is a great book right Kerry and Kujo my favorite Stephen King books who Joe till this day I have it I look at it and I respected it's like cocaine I don't even open that book I just look at it and touch it from time to time and I go oh I don't know if I want to get into that thing it was a great book that they did like the the movie version of it it's like was Pet Sematary Pet Sematary is a book there's some things about books you know I hate the cliche that books are better oh the books better but what is interesting about books is there certain things that you shouldn't really see you should only imagine they were they work out better in your in your imagination like there's something much creepier about them in your imagination and Pet Sematary think he was right about someone creepy you've done like will never have a hard time sleeping or something that that something's going on with me so instead of said to me better than having what's called insomnia I get up and I write it out when you read that back it's like when I write about something I did as a kid whether it's Robin Freddie at Putnam field when I was a kid I used to rob his gas station every eight weeks and you know like that when I was in West Palm Beach a kid showed up kids showed up from high school and when I was in West Palm Beach and he goes I will have something and he goes this is a map you drew of us were about to rob a gas station in 1981 he still had the map of me with stick man he grabbed this we would rob this gas station every six to eight weeks know what the fuck the point I'm trying to make was I forgot it somewhere along the line write about things that you did even when I write it down you read them it's different I feel fuck you reading is fucking phenomenal to build imagination that's why when you read Silence of the and you watched a movie you got to get all everybody in that room and give him a big hug because they kept it honest they kept it real when you read William Blakeley as The Exorcist and then the Exorcist has been on for the last two weeks on AMC and I've been watching bits and pieces of it and I can't applaud it more the priest that's Jackie Gleason his son-in-law is it really yes who's Jason stool's Jason whatever his father who he was in sleepers with with with Brad Pitt De Niro he played the newspaper reporter that's his fucking father but Damien Karras plays the priest that's Jackie Gleason his son-in-law he married Jackie Gleason his daughter and it's before me because last week it was in my office typing in my wife cause she was I'm gonna be home in 20 minutes with the baby so I don't know what you're doing all right so I wanted the living room I turn the TV on just to be out there cuz I don't watch cartoons or whatever and I saw the exorcisms and I like turned it on and dog it came on when the priest comes through the door which if I have a bump into that director I will take this dick out and suck it because that's what real directing is he scared you without showing you anything number one the priest comes to the door all you see is an image from the priest and you don't see what his face looks like and it scares you but when he walks in he takes this motherfucker and the guy says to him can I get you something how was your trip can I get you something and he goes do you want some coffee and he goes no let's do this and this guy is a psychiatrist you have to watch it again this guy's a psychiatrist not only is he a priest and he starts dropping in psycho and the priest looks on those knock it off the devil is cunning you know tacky is psychological like nobody else do not listen to him and he just breaks it down and then the guy says to him do you want to know the three levels of manifestation and he looks at me goes no there's only one Satanist same dog it's just right there you like so my daughter walks in bars on the five-year-old walks in and she sits on my lap and she's a Bible beater I don't know if you know this that Mercy's a Bible beater she loves anything with God and you know I got a little fucking and things she gave me with Jesus of fish yeah my daughter's a Bible beater even though she goes to fucking public school she'll come home and come here and talk about God today so she's watching this whole manifestation yeah of these two priests talking about God is powerful God's gonna kill Satan doesn't that doughnut ah and all of a sudden they walk into the room and she's sitting up and she's like hey my daughter caught it's looking like thirty Seconds to just look at me and she just ran out of the room like she doesn't know who Satan is nothing she just ran out of the room this is one of the scariest movies one of the finest movies she elevates herself comes down what about when they so they do the first thing they walk out and what about when they walk back in and he said he's a doctor so he's checking her heart and she turns into the mother in the hospital and start saying being me why you doing this to me and and the priest told them don't listen to him that the devil is coming you know in Austin what about when he comes into his father I'm not sparing five cents but on all off the board because the devil start I mean bro you have to watch it and while all this is going on you have to remember that there's a murder going on because the first night when she came down before the devil came in some guy was talking shit a Nazi was talking shit a Jewish guy was talking shit about a Nazi or something and she comes down and pees and says you're gonna die motherfucker I ain't gonna die up there do an astronaut wasn't it wasn't he an astronaut he was something downstairs didn't she say something like that you're gonna die up there no no he was downstairs they were in the living room and it was sounding like God I didn't she was talking to a guy was an astronaut she just said you're gonna die and then she peed the car bare and then there was a dinner party and then a couple nights later they found the guy in the bottom of the stairs but it couldn't have been a girl because they twisted his neck all the way around yeah so I had to be a man and that's why you you have to watch that movie when the cop comes to talk to her mother I was a famous actress five or six years ago its first of all it's a deep movie that girl got fucked up doing that movie you know Rose listen how can they make a 12 year old girl stick across my pussy yeah she snuck across the pussy took it out grabs her mother by the ears put her and said socket eat me yeah your mother sucks cocks in hell I just she told the one priest I saw that in the movie theater shame on them but if I could sue the Union City cinema today I would sue them I didn't give a fuck they took my two dollars and let me so they threw me to the fucking wolves but I also saw what is her name again Linda Blair and Blair she showed up 20 years later she started hanging out with Rick James um she showed up 20 years later Richard I wonder what Linda Blair is doing today but I hope they paid her a lot of money because she never really recovered from that now she never really worked after that it's tough to get work after you put a cross in your pussy I mean that's ginger it's something at a commercial for fuckin S&X yeah well it's also people never forget you or that person like it's very difficult for people to have a change percent when she walks down the stairs yeah backwards what about when a head spins around in front of the priest um oh yeah it's just too out there for a movie they could never they think of remaking that every once in a while they look like each other didn't Jesus Christ that was a creepy fucking movie and you gotta realize that back then there was nothing like this before this movie this movie was so extreme like there had been horror movies before but it was like Frankenstein or Dracula they were kind of scary but their worm bloody though there was nothing like this movie this movie was so over-the-top and people a lot of people at the time are like this the movie represented something you represented a changing of boundaries people these young kids these people today like what the fuck are they doing what kind of movies of them make a closed fist I remember being in Catholic school and they would just piss they were telling us not to go see it we weren't allowed to go see it I would bro that I was right there when the movie got released and I had to see it and it's how you can't see it blew my fucking that's where I saw Rocky where everybody was on their feet yelling for Rocky this was different everybody was young rocky and I also saw the long as you're out there the original and this is a movie thing that was basically Irish Italian and Cuban but David they talked they yelled at the screen you know they threw things at the screen and when the fucking long as yard when Burt Reynolds was coming back the whole place is on their feet this is a great movie Tina and they let you in that then they played the last movie at 11:30 I saw you know many times I saw Enter the Dragon in that the late movie my mother would let me walk up there this is on 48th street and my mother's bar was on 29th Street she'd go go dad I saw everything there fists of fury The Outlaw Josey Wales all those fucking movies I saw there anything they played I just go there as a Spanish kid and watch and learn the language and loved it they had limitations what they could do with special effects and so because of that you had to accomplish much more with even with American Werewolf in London right the original the original you was that made I want to say 81 if I'm gonna guess okay what year was it was it 81 the special effects even though they were groundbreaking for the time like when he's lying on the floor and his body stretched and I was like and he's turned into the wolf like that shit when his face is stretching out I mean those were groundbreaking special effects like no no one had ever seen anything like that yes I enjoyed this I enjoyed it's watching a movie now and 30% of it 40% of the season yeah yeah well fucking crazy i watch that shit drives me crazy the other day under with Kevin Costner no no that was what that the girl the vampire and the she's so uh she's just tremendous I fell in love with her with the movie when she got caught with heroin with Claire Danes at the jail in Thailand that's how long I've been in love with my goes with her and Claire Danes Kate Beckinsale something they both fell in love with the same guy and he put heroin on him and he put him in a prison so I was flipping through the channels while brokedown Palace oh there it is when I was doing that I'm doing this fucking Fitness channel this fitness challenge with Ari and Bert and Tom and I just watching anything I can on TV while on the elliptical machine or the rower or whatever the fuck I'm doing and I was watching one of the underworld movies and I realized there's like 10 of them I mean how many fucking underwear world movies is there Ben I was born that I mean she's been in all of them she's the main star they're so stupid the fucking one that I saw I mean it was like deep in she has a daughter now and there's five of them I don't know which one I saw but I think that's or the first two yeah I think a lot of control for me though is it I think I was watching blood Wars it was so dumb but anyway the CGI the werewolf's are so corny they show you too much it looks fake and the thing about an American Werewolf in London is they showed you a little quick snippets of the thing before would kill people it was just enough likely that they look so stupid it just looks fake like CGI just does not look and that was something that Pat McGee the guy who made that the werewolf out there in the lobby that's what he had told me he's like when you see your your brain can tell that's not real like even if it looks really good your brain can tell it's not real he's like what your brain look if your brain sees special effects like makeup like that kind of stuff like like a face that's been done with like prosthetics and teeth and fangs your brain says oh that's a real thing that's the thing that's right in front of you yeah look these worlds are so corny that wasn't it running looks fake their shadows look fake but pull up scene from American Werewolf in London like like the actual werewolf they had very very quick scenes you didn't see much of the werewolf it was like very fast like you seen running through the streets of London you see it's snapping at things like in that one that's in the beginning when they first got jacked by the wall Jesus yeah like this give me some volume so they're running [Music] [Applause] she didn't see much well you said it best a couple minutes ago that the thing that pisses me off the most is in today's the whole movie business I grew up on the movies I my fucking immigrant kid I love movies but more they have Tony Montana and the fucking detention thing that goes how'd you learn how to speak Spanish English yeah cuz I watched a movie circle Aneesa bro what Cubans anybody Felipe Esparza told me that everyone watching - everybody everybody so you watch TV the problem that happens somewhere between 85 maybe 87 and today is the disconnect of the director and you'd ask him me Joey what's the disconnected the director the imagination I just watched something on Scarface I almost called you because it was so interesting about the dilemmas they have a scarface when they gave it an X rating so Scarface came out Pacino said to have to release at the party of Scarface he just sank people were getting up and leaving 20 at a bunch they took John Collins aside and they said the jealous Collins what did you think of the movie she goes I left after no she goes I think a hundred fucks is enough fucks for a person's lifetime mm-hmm like they was so but they showed that's enough of persons like that I left after half they counted how many fucks he said and all this stuff but that's not my point the point is that when they the guy that directed had to go in front of a board it's a big difference about me showing chainsaw going through your arm then you seeing it and then seeing your face and you bleep you follow me yeah yeah yeah right that's why they had to go to that that was better that yes you know that the X rating you know when a that's a beautiful story this it's supposed to be me you and him and he's supposed to make the decision the director brought violence specialist psychiatrist without he brought 100 witnesses they were they're all fuckin that to prove his point that take it from an x-rated movie to an r-rated movie when you watch Once Upon a Time in the West Sergio Leone was the king of the directors because he gave you the decision to to decide are you with me he gave it to you when Charles Bronson gets off the train the beginning of Once Upon a Time in America and there's three dudes waiting in the train goes by and also it stops and also you hear a harmonica and hear Charles Bronson gone they look up and they see Charles Bronson but they're not they're not look it's not focusing on Charles Bronson Sergio Leone he's fucking with you he keeps showing you this fucking thing that keeps going like take me back Sergio Leone let me watch this gunfight he gave you imagination directors gave you imagination they gave you a split second to decide whether what was gonna happen now I know the story before it happens the director was something special that's why Sergio Leone those guys those spaghetti westerns with genius because they gave you are you with me I am you gave me a second to split decide yeah you had to think of what's going on I did I don't that scene I could have put it in his arm or showed Pacino's face well you remember High Plains Drifter tremendous is that always a ghost yes back there and paints it now paint that well no no it's a high put that song is that High Plains Drifter am I getting the wrong name one I mean I'm comes back as it goes right that's the one yeah High Plains bit was it hang him high I don't know if it's hang high what's the one we as the shield underneath and he knows they only shoot for the heart and they keep shooting at him he falls down and they shoot at him he falls down he shoot telling me fall down I don't remember Jamie put Google Clint Eastwood comes back at this room it is High Plains Drifter description yeah um part ghost story part revenge was the thing about that movie is like you don't realize it's like they don't spell it out for the dummies that he's a ghost then no like you have to figure it out at the end of the movie if I remember correctly it's been a long time since I saw it but at the end of the end of the film they sort of lay it out in the beginning the beginning they show kind of cooked I might be wrong here I feel like the beginning of the movie is them beating him and killing him and they whip him and at the end of the movie you kind of realize it's him coming back towards the end of the movie but it's not like specifically spelled out like there was a curse and he came back to haunt this town and kill everyone who wasn't that cornball so if you go back to like the older movies you go back to like you know like a Frankenstein or a Dracula type film they spelled things out like they treated you like you were a dumbass and they spelled things out and they eventually stopped doing that and they put mystery and imagination in films and then somewhere along the line at least with like modern blockbusters if I had to guess I would say part of the problem is there's so much money involved in these movies if you're gonna make a film and you know it's some gigantic thing with special effects and the studio is dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into it they want to return on their money I saw people discussing that I think Johnny Depp was just kind of kicked off as in the right word but he's not gonna be the next pirates movie I guess they were discussing under like in the comments section like it was the word last one was the worst one that of the of the lot and they spent 330 million dollars on the budget but it made 800 million and they're like that's a fit some people are saying like that's a failure yeah for them and take five hundred million is not good well Johnny's off the rails right now Johnny Depp he looks like he weighs 35 pounds he shaved his head he's falling out of his jeans whenever you get like two tattoos of a woman you only been married to for like six months these are all bad signs sure welcome this is a very rough town to live ego is a motherfucker people blowing smoke up your ass as a motherfucker sure I mean this guy's spending a half a million dollars a month on blinds yeah you know I don't know exactly don't quote me on that but I know that when the account I read he gets himself did they say they said that he was spending $30,000 and he goes it was a lot more than he was joking around about it was a lot more than that like these pictures of him now stay humble or be humbled he's wearing his shirt dude you're 55 years old why the fuck would you wear that shirt well who's walking up meanwhile I got a Derrick Lewis my balls was hot shirt on but look these these like fucking inspirational quotes you expect to see on some strippers Instagram page you're not supposed to be wearing those when you're Johnny Depp okay this is this is outrageous Johnny Depp shirt and I heard that this last movie he did mucho provide us Mucha what problemas which a lot of problems what was the movie the Tupac movie yes yeah but it's on shelves right gonna put it out is he there's a shelf yeah they're not putting it out no for right now it's not coming out yeah he plays the cop that broke if you were right I forget them that's a good book yeah though whatever I figure I have it at the house he plays the cop and I heard that there was a long little that when the word got out that's it well you know Johnny Depp in one point time when he had done that's that movie dead man do you remember dead man no interesting movie it was a weird black-and-white movie about a guy was riding a fucking train across the West he was talking in an interview about he wants to do interesting projects he was I'll never be blockbuster boy then he became blockbuster boy oh but he's badass in Pirates of the Caribbean look he's fidon't give a fuck with me busy but not on all phenomena phenomena for them he's good I love he's a great actor they cut him loose he made a ton of money for them they did 5 fucking movies but you know he's boys with Stanhope Ryan essentially Johnny Depp just fucking motherfuckers with their everybody thinks you're gonna spend money on their website guess what we're not we're not paying to breed your fucking website we're not Johnny Depp was a set and biggie Tupac movie abruptly pulled from release force Whitaker - it looks like mmm yeah like a month before it's supposed to come out they just pulled it well it must suck they don't pull it if it's awesome but the point is you know Stan helps boys with them and he's like he said that once he did those pirates movies he couldn't go anywhere it was over he can't go to restaurants you can't go anywhere he just can't go anywhere he he hit that upper echelon of Fame where it's almost there's no turning back when you you know you get like Michael Jackson type frame you just get crazy you your world is just it's no one can relate to you what were they giving him per movi he he was making like 30 million a movie would back end and everything I bet he was making more than more than that right yes he's got like 18 houses 14 houses you know I remember when I was in Colorado someone said he had a ranch out there I go is he ever go there he goes no no just has a ranch I'm sad for the guy that on TGIF Fridays he was on the board directors did you yeah when I lived on 4435 faraway Road in Snowmass Village Colorado I have set and the guy the two years I was there he came a week and a half he came for three days and his daughters came for three days they mm I'm boozed they all got drunk and they left two days later and I was talking to the door and she's like yeah this is my dad's got houses all over the place he had three in Colorado alone i crusted crest a butte Snowmass Village and he had that house on the other side to ski over there because he liked to different types about it yeah Jesus Christ ya know that's that world when people get that famous when they get that rich when they get that the point where they live in some sort of weird lala land he had a brand new Jeep delivered every year and part of my agreement was I had a driver like 50 miles a month to keep my sure because when he came to town he didn't want no problems with none of his houses right so he had a different fucking house sitter in every and if you don't know the background check on you know I listen to me I fucking grandfathered into the house because my buddy from Jersey had it and his girlfriend came out to visit he knocked her up but the guy was difficult to get a hold of cuz he was in England and whatnot so my friend just said to me just just move and don't say dick and when he comes in he'll see it's you and tell him I had to leave and shit keep my deposit so I stayed there for like two months and he came and he's like who the fuck are you and I told him what had happened and that we couldn't get a hold him cuz he was in England and he asked me for a couple names I was had already lived in Snowmass for about a year I left and then came back so I had a couple nice references for me gave me the thing and then left and I was not allowed in his home so part of the deal was I had an apartment over the garage I could use his car and it was 18 hours a month to be the shoveling snow Oh 18 18 hours a month of work or so it was essentially shoveling snow in the winter and mowing along in the summer he would give me a little assignments I paint the wall or whatever I would do keep the trim up in ship there was zero rent I think he paid me 800 a month and I got together day job and ski and she like that don't levitate was a volunteer fireman your volunteer fireman because all right so cocaine was 1800 announce at the time and snow mess and my buddy said give it to me for 800 in Jersey so I would go back and forth I was making all this dough on it the people found that the guy that they blew up they they they put a pipe bomb in this guy's car and they blew him up his name was Stephen Grabill he left a big gap in this fucking drug place so I was killed oh yeah they killed this poor bastard in Colorado in Aspen 36 days before he was to stand trial they could never get him for cocaine he was making six million every six weeks I spoke about this on 6 million every six weeks in 1984 they arrested him the first time in 83 they brought him to Denver they found 9 million altogether cash then in 84 was when he went every night he'd work out he was a good-looking dude that kept in shape he had 20 different cars and every night he'd given the guy at the door five dollars to start the car tonight the guy took the night off he started his own car they put a pipe bomb in his car blew him up he lived he made it all the way in the hospital but something went so deep up his ass but he just bled to death Oh so left this gap so this guy approached him and then he was like man these people are mad at ya they want to do business with you you're cutting them out so I had to talk to them and they said listen for you to bar we know we never do a face to face so they have an aspen Club and they have a place call to see if the Aspen Club is through you know in those days these places were a thousand a month to walk it and I knew a girl that used to go to the asking club and she said tell me she stay showers right next to barbi Benton I'm a Barbie button and they bet had a beautiful Bush she would tell me every night barbi Benton's got a beautiful fucking Bush it's perfect so is the Aspen Club in the Snowmass Club Snowmass club has golfing you know condos around the thing it was like 900 a month to be a member I couldn't have been a member so the only way I could become a member with my being a volunteer fireman and they give you admission in so for 90 days I had to train you know go up two flights this thing on a ladder carry a rope but basically he was putting out you when tourists come they don't know how to fucking turn on a fireplace so they clean out the showers and they put him in and then these people would put him in a dumpster so Ted and all you're doing is dumpster fires that's all you're doing but you got access to the Snowmass Club so basically as it was walking through the Snowmass club give the girl the $10,000 but I need gym clothes workout and by the time you got back to your locker the coke was in the locker it was all in they were all and everybody's involved everybody was involved so the girl that worked us that she was getting a piece the coke would be that get like a half ounces you know I was no dealer and I'd take it home but then I started getting coked up every time there was a fire I went to like two Phi's both dumps is and this is 16 idiots with a full fires is necessary they even gave me like a little fire truck like a little Toyota truck with like a bell on it to go to the thighs that's like the third fire stop showing up for two months they KITT where are you zero to base where are you listen go get my dicks like you I'm gonna go put out a fire in a dumpster go fuck yourself they came over and took the dumpster and then I went to work for this other dude dick there was three dicks the guy I work for was dick self dick Kali and dick Doolin was the mayor so I had a buddy used to go you surrounded my dick dick dick Thanks so dick Kelly had one of those snow companies and they wanted me to go and now I don't know what they call Joe Rogan so straightened yeah it's a hi-low that shovels snow what's a high low high low ball truck that pushes snow around so he was another poor bastard that made a mistake and hired me that went there and yeah I had to beat at 4:00 in the morning for the morning I'm on my second grandma block he'd be in front of my house beeping bad I'm bad I'm a little fucking myself I'm not working tonight he came in took his truck I was on a roll up their food snow guys with snow trucks when it would snow out man that was you aren't getting any sleep there was a bunch of guys that I knew in Colorado Austin Boston yeah that's that's that's a business you know those people spread fucking getting happy people who look out the window with the coffee making sure you're out there with the truck up the driveway pushing snow around my buddy Jimmy he had a there was one of his side businesses he was an electrician the side business he had a hit a plow on his pickup truck he would just fucking plow people out do people's driveways you know it's I was I went home this year March 20th I went home to Jersey had to do a show one night or Nyack and me and Ari hooked up in the city way inaudible we walked around the city in the snow and just started to snow you know and by the time I got up the next morning it snow like a foot I never seen anything like that like when I was a kid in Jersey if it snowed that shit was there like that shit stayed for stay there's there was no school stacked up side by side won't dirty snow from my town won't let a fucking ounce of snow man not an inch really hey fucking tremendous that night the roads would clean the he's color I'll never forget how when I left Jersey in 83 like if it's snow like let's say if it snowed I take the bus up here I would just call you and say Joe it's snowing you'd expect me at 11:00 and you know everything was late whenever it snows in Jersey he is this big metropolitan area knew York City and it snowed it's just crippled the city they didn't know how to handle yeah whose papers wouldn't come people get pissed off the New York Post I'm moving to snow mass and getting a job at Aspen electric and that meant they had to get on a bus and Snowmass go to the bottom of the hill transfer and shoot the bus to Snowmass I did this and I remember the first time I got I woke up one day you know in Colorado you wake up on one of those twelve inches is just another day just another day and I moved in 1983 they couldn't fucking clean up New York but I'll never forget that morning waking up and ask him like at 6:30 in Snowmass and going then I couldn't expect me to about 10:00 and I walked in there at 10:00 to people like where the fuck have you been and I'm like it's no not the buses are running late they go or we don't say he came on a bus and they all got here on time they fucking busted me right out like Colorado was that far ahead of the game well they just so used to it they were so but like here here I was living in this big metropolitan city right that for inches crippled in Colorado they throw down salt they throw down something yes they throw that on something because then you wash your car in Colorado they push to do the underwater carriage to the prevention because rust yeah rust travels fast in Colorado in Boston too that's salt salt opposed salt put some of them if you'd buy old cars and in the fenders you know in the back of the fenders like at the corner that's where the salt would pile up and you always have rust there he'd always have like these big pockets of rust the corner is that the most rock salt mm-hmm yeah that's what California cars everybody just wanted a rust-free California car if you were buying a muscle car like an older you know hot rod you'd find a rust-free California car Oh California and a salt big thing with salt destroy cars destroy the frame destroy everything that's salt get up in there and just sit there and just rot away the metal gotta take the metal buff it out we like edged it out and then you would have to spray rust-oleum on it and then you would have because I would see the guys in Colorado they would fix the cars and it would take like a missing bumper kind of strategically weld it in and then you bump that in you call it you buffed yeah you kept putting primer on it and that's how they got the rust out oh yeah I was in Colorado well it's not about Jersey bodywork man a lot of East Coast cars had a tremendous amount of bodywork if you wanted a constant job fixing cars bodywork was always good not just cuz accidents but also just because of rust work now is the rust of product of the humidity also Shelley's Colorado wasn't that humid I see a little bit of rest from yeah Colorado you getting it from moisture you're getting it from Salt I'm sure if they salt the roads for the East Coast you're definitely getting more you know there's a variety of factors that cause cars to rust out older cars both if you can find an old rust-free car now that is like that's what everybody wants you know you find out 1968 Camaro that's rust free like whoa you know it's beautiful think about Corvettes they didn't rust they were made out of fiberglass so you get an old Corvette most of the bodies were pretty good if it wasn't cracked was damaged as they didn't rust i'ma cut myself on one of those fiberglass quote that's one time when legis I'm I ran past them this is a 70s right yeah my 75 fiberglass my 65 Corvette that thing's fiberglass why didn't they fiberglass them to make make it lighter lighter right and because they can make cooler shapes if you look at a 1965 Corvette that shape I think I have an idea how it looks like it looks like a Sportster yeah yeah that's the one the 65 well the fenders have curves to them everything as curves it's like such a curvy car and if you had to do that all by banging out metal and there's mine like look at the fucking humps and the curves in that thing just the fenders alone like there's so much that's when I had my gross old wheels this I got rid of those stupid wheels mmm but the the the shape of those things meant that I mean I mean they could do that with metal but there's so many complicated curves to it just the curve or the door to the fender the back fender and yeah you're a fan of the car how does this car compare as it drive that's not a that's not a real I mean if you if you drove a regular 1965 Corvette they're sloppy the suspension sloppy the brakes at Dog Show this one here that thing's not a regular with that thing's what's called a resto mod so what that is is a 1965 Corvette but it has a 2007 Corvette engine in it that's supercharged and then it has an entirely modern suspension everything is modern coilovers modern brakes big-ass Corvette brakes big fucking fat wide tires with sticky rubber on them that thing doesn't handle anything like an old car that thing handles like a new car as much as you can get a car like that to handle like a new car how much do you drive it I tried that fucker all the time I take to the store all the time you've seen me take that thing this store you should go for a ride with me it's so fun I don't think I'd fit my little fella made for more people 65 fucking things you know no you fit in that I'm with Tony Soprano trying to get in Johnny sex what's the what's the Italian car line Lamborghini Ferrari or Lamborghini remember yeah any couldn't finish it most was skinny Italian yeah but those uh you know when you're making a car out of fiberglass you know it's pretty weird just to go back to that lady that quit high school when she was 16 that she was one of the most wealthiest people in the world like a Chinese lady yeah whatever name was we pronounce it wrong it's so weird how much stock we put in high school hmm how much stock is really in high school like right now you have children I don't know about high school like I don't know I'm stood I don't know about high school still and I don't know I I've met so many people have quit high school that have done better with their lives I thought when I quit high school I was done I was fucking done that was the one of the worst points in my life I remember wasn't they get a tattoo I wanted to get like an Ozzy Osbourne has Ozzy on his fingers I was only a Coco on both fingers co-ceo and I remember walking up there that dang-gone you know what pal so wait a second I got a nazia Coco tattoo on my fingers and I'm gonna quit high school like what I'm gonna meet my chance isn't really doing anything like I already quit high school and I'm gonna put that to his on my fingers I'm never gonna do anything on my life that's why I chickened out from tattoos you know cuz you're afraid you're gonna lose in 1982 a tattoo was not a work of art a tattoo was you went to jail yeah you killed somebody but he had that 69 he's had that 60 oh he was cooler than fucked he was Ozzy Osbourne I wasn't Ozzy Osbourne right I was just some fucking drugged out criminal yeah but I knew that if I quit high school and put co-ceo I was doing four Wow like I'm both hands I was gonna be doing shows story bro like this I've understood walking to the tattoo place it was in Cliffside Park and how much weight they put on high school and like I quit high school my junior year was I good at it yes I was very good at it I was very good at school I just had a quit school because of necessity and had no parents you know how to quit fuckin high school you know there's so wait how many people over the years I've read and the only reason why I got my GED let me tell you so I refuse to get my GED because if I would have failed my GED I would have killed myself like if you quit high school and then fail your GED you're really doing some life I didn't even want to know about the GED thing but when I got arrested you gotta have a GED because you get an extra point to your sentence like this is a valuable that adds to you not going to prison for that long so if you get arrested and you don't have a GED and you're not working at the time of your arrest this all counts towards your sentencing guidelines so the only reason why it took that GED fucking thing because I was petrified of taking the Joe Rogan hmm because once you fail your GED they ain't no coming back so I got tattoo on my fingers I fucking queer light school and I fucking failed the first GED thing like I would have died like I studied hard for my GED I bought the fucking thing I took a night class with a bunch of people didn't speak English I studied hard I passed my GP with flying colors but it's so weird how they put such a stress on it when I was growing up I know tons of kids that sophomore year said my father owns a fucking mechanic's garage or we have a fruit company or my father's in the stock market he's getting me a job I know these kids say they're doing fine I just saw one in West Palm Beach that he was one of the first guys to quit school and I was like worried about me how the fuck do you quit school he's gonna fire he's rich as fucking well quitting an education like getting quitting learning is what's really scary quitting school the problem with school is school like standardized education right the education that they would like you to get is you go through school get out of high school you go to a good college to get a degree and then you go to graduate school and then you're a real success but there's a lot of people that did that that there was no job for them they they have graduate degrees and they're not doing well and it's just it's not it's not a guarantee and especially in this weird fuckin economy the problem with a guy like you or a problem with a guy like me he said we're never gonna have regular jobs it was never gonna work we're too fucked up for whatever reason we're both fucked out for different reasons I quit every fucking job every job I've never had a job for days I was like it's all eight-ball make 50 bucks I gotta sit yeah I wash dishes like I wash dishes for four months but nobody nice that you had the potential to be an entertainer nobody ever says like you could be an entertainer you're a funny entertaining guy nobody ever brings that up as a viable job option meanwhile it's obviously a giant job option all of our friends that are like you or I that are comics they're all they were all fuck-ups in high school they all barely made it through whatever job they had they hated every second of it and they all thought they were losers that's one thing we all have in common we were all worried that we were gonna be a loser but none that no one none of us had someone who said hey Joey you're fuckin funny man you could be a comic try being a comic go to an open mic night give it a shot you how much comics make a weekend a comic what headline at a club in the weekend Mike made $1500 you'd be like what $1500 for telling jokes again $1500 they'd be like that is crazy you talked about what regular people were making busting their ass all week you could just show up on a Friday do two shows on a Friday two shows on a Saturday one show on Sunday and you'd make $1,500 you'd get home and a lot of times it was cash you would be like how do i how do I do this job well you gotta start off like night you got to become an apprentice it's so weird how I could look you in the face and tell you something I knew my freshman year in high school you ready yeah I knew one thing for sure what I did not want a day job no job me no no no yeah I didn't say that I wanted a job but not a giant with you in office no no there was no day job in our future how was he able to be a bartender a waiter I was gonna work on a warehouse like ah there was a company whiterose and Secaucus it was a frozen warehouse well you just got lobster tails and shit you gotta wear like bundled up they paid you 22 an hour yeah they gave you a thousand every 90 days to buy clothing like I was set to do that I had no problem with working 9:00 to 6:00 I knew one thing about my life that I was not taking a day job because the people I grew up around my mother did not have a day job my mother went opened the bar at 9:00 set the bar up beer boom and by 10:30 she was in Harlem picking up this going to a Met game eating Chinese food she didn't go back to the seven o'clock at night then she worked till three I had no problem with working my first big job was bartending from five to one in Manhattan I just knew that my days were mine I liked that I didn't I wanted to be opposite everybody else I wanted you to leave the fucking house when I walked in I'm gonna make my own eggs I'm gonna smoke a joint I'm gonna watch TV for an hour sleep till two get up lift weight defendants that's what I want I did not want a day job that I thought people want the opposite some people's personalities that they want to go somewhere where someone tells them what to do they want to sit in a very safe structured environment and do boring shit I didn't I was there's a company in my town named APA Anthony Imperator when I was a kid APA fed everybody the deal was you went down there 1982 let's say it was 1750 an hour so you shaped did you ever shape what's that mean shape is you just go down and they look at you like Marlon Brando on the waterfront you stand there like a fucking moron and they come up to you we need six people tonight you you look pretty strong you and there's 30 people get us calling shape shape up work you gotta go sign up at the hall so if you're a longshoreman and all that shit if you don't have work you go through shape up work so you just go down and wait for your badge number two because and then they give you work so I used to work at APA as a shape guy she's good on APA right and the first night Joe Rogan facing me he sees I'm a fucking mule I'm a meal but you ain't got a break be the shift started at seven and it went till six but sometimes at six a load of fucking Volkswagen engines came in and here you are with another fucking gorilla picking up Volkswagen engines so I used to what I used to do was you couldn't work more than six days a month or they had to put you in the unit so I would work a P a white truck rule whatever there was three different companies that you could shape for so what you did was to get into the union was once I found that Joe was cool and Joe knew I worked I drew joy yardstick I three a hundred so I have guarantee two days a week work which is still $18 an hour plus overtime so I did shape up work and then if you completed like twelve if they made a mistake and they gave you 12 days in the month now they had to hire you full time and your life changed forever APA that guy Imperator that old you know what he owns now the fucking fairy hmm make the fairy that goes back to New Jersey back and forth from Jersey in New York City that's imperatore he didn't stop growing but when we were kids his facility he took such care of his employees his gym when the New York Mets went from Long Island to New Jersey that's where they practiced the first year that's how good in the 70s his gym was like have you loaded trucks you were allowed to use that gym he already had shit that nobody had he had fiberglass back boards he had water weights he had shit that nobody had like at that time Wow but my point being that that was what I had in high school that I could do shape up work and I could still make a living and eventually somebody was gonna hire me I was gonna work like a fucking mule but I'd still be making you know 1,500 a week right when you're in 1980 which wasn't that's a lot of money back then which wasn't bad those are the guys that buy the boats and they go to Atlantic City enough they wear white shoes on the weekends they make more than everybody else you've made great money down there yeah so you shape you could also do that as a longshoreman you look down in the work and stay there and then after 15 days they pick you up in the Union don't charge you 5 mm for a book which is means that you get 5000 again to the enemy yeah benefits the rest of your life insurance and a pension yeah and you realize that you weren't gonna work on a cubicle I did not I knew that by like that night loading shit you know in nights I walked home three with no money I made days after loading a truck all night walking home on route 3 cuz I didn't have enough money for the bus I just had enough money for breakfast and I would walk up and get breakfast on a dime I go wherever I was sleeping and fucking go to sleep I didn't know anything Tommy didn't come into my radar till a month before I went to prison a month before I got locked up a month before I got arrested for the crime never mind prison there was a sale when they hired and I just we did not get along me and him his car so he had this he was American Indian a piece of him was American Indian and he even had that Charles Bronson look in his eyes and one day me and him got into a beef over a customer he said the customers was his and it was mine and me and him bangle up face to face and I had to break us up but about a week later I was on the point that means you're outside waiting for a customer to try to get a customer on point and he came out and he goes man listen I don't know what happened between us his name was Bret I'll never forget that bad if I was 25 he was about 40 something 44 or 45 and I had a fucking you know I was doing drugs and I had the tough guy mentality in that branch and I would never raise my hand to somebody old I don't know why I went after him that day but he came up to me put on his hand he goes listen man I don't know nothing about nothing but he was you know what I was doing for the last one he is right no I was the entertainment coordinator for a casino in Las Vegas it was I don't know man he make me fucking laugh and I was most shaking this angle and thank you the fuck away from me I made you laugh what are you stupid and he was telling me I had a career in comedy and I wasn't listening to him he said you should really give it a try I'll make you fucking crazy stand-up comedy I like Freddie Prinze I like David Brenner I love Richard Pryor but some fine criminal I can't do this shit not a month and I got arrested and then when I came out I didn't think about it and then when I fucking came out for reals there was a guy that lives in Pismo Beach now and he used to talk to me about he was your offense to the stand-up comedy and I'm good come on dawg leave me the fuck alone I'm a drug addict stand-up comedy I didn't know stand-up comedy was about work I thought that Joe Rogan just called the Comedy Store said have a camera in ten minutes I'm gonna be down on you tape an hour I didn't know that you had to work 18 months to get an hour of material my lucky night good what I thought that's how fucking off I was yeah I just thought that when I saw John Leguizamo that he just went down it he just went down into the now that's what I thought we're perceptions of it but you know the thing about it is that it's a possibility and no one ever says that it's a possibility it's not an easy possibility but it's an is an option but being a fucking physician is not an easy possibility either but if you tell someone you want to be a doctor they don't look at you like you're crazy the amount of work is probably pretty similar there's a lot of work involved in being a doctor but it's a path that's been taken by many people it's clearly established you go through school you go through Medical School you go through your residency there's all these different steps that you have to take that everybody's really aware of with a stand-up comedy career no one who's other than the people that have done it no one knows what it is you and I both know that in order to be you know say a physicist you have to go through a certain amount of education we you know if you had oh Tim's son he's really smart he wants to work for you know SpaceX want to build rocket ships like oh okay that's a possibility you can do that you're really smart you go to school you get a good education you follow through you you eventually there's a path there with comedy like no one knows that path other than people like you or I people that have actually done that path and make a living doing it we know it but for everybody on the outside it's like what is that and sometimes you need someone to come along and tell you like the guy who you were working with for me was my friend Steve dr. Steve Graham he was my friend when I was you know he was telling me this when I was like 19 you know he's like you're really funny like you should be a comedian no such funny to you I'm like other people gonna think I'm an asshole that's all I was thinking was that I just I wasn't big on public speaking what got me into public speaking honestly what helped me was teaching when I was teaching martial arts I had to teach in front of all these people though I'd never spoken in front of groups of people but I was really good at the time at teaching classes I'd learned from you know my instructor and I there's a way to do it I was very enthusiastic obviously it was my life so I was very intense about doing it and I got used to speaking publicly in front of these large groups of people but it was because I was speaking about something that I I was good at and then I would teach at Boston University and when I would go there and teach the classes I'd start off the classes you know and I basically said to them listen you take this class try hard you're gonna get an A it's pass/fail a it actually counts for your GPA so this is a easy a I don't want you to be fuckin Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan you don't have to do that I just want you to try if you come here and try you get an A that simple and so I would you know became friends with a lot of the kids cuz they were like my age some of them were even older than me and I was teaching them so that was how I got into public speaking almost the first time I want you to think before you even answer besides stand-up comedy were you ever ever ever on the stage before that improv troupe and grammar school a play in high school playing grammar school in college I took no I didn't do anything I don't think I don't think I ever did anything maybe if I did I don't remember but I in college I took a course on public speaking it was like some sort of it was some sort of course where we would do like little play it was terrible the teacher was terrible she was just sort little lazy lady she was so lazy like the way she would give classes which says it was a continuing education program at UMass she was just terrible and there was the people in the class where it was very loosely organized she didn't explain the lessons very well and you know we had to put together some little play I remember it was me and this girl and this guy we put together we made some little funny play we wrote it together it was around the same age I was probably thinking about doing stand-up I was probably 19 or 20 at the time I never was I always shunned him all that stuff I was always embarrassed and my sis when I got thrown on a Catholic school and the 6th grade I had this guy mr. Levite Oh on Fridays you had a choice to fucking he'll be part of the ecology Club or hang out in the class I don't know what made me I was in love with Frankie Valli all right my eyes adored you so he would make me every Friday go up to the front of the class and put my eyes adored Jean a record player and I'd sing it like not lip-synching I'd really sing it cuz I really have a good voice growing up I was in a band as a singer what are you you were in a band yeah the 6th grade you've done that fucking rock and roll show yeah what does that show called goddamn gamma jam yeah you've done

they wanted me to go to Aurora so but I couldn't go to rehearse that day see it no rehearsal no rehearsal I knew the song you know and it's not yes where does this mean held that this is that almost a couple years ago this is like a year and a half ago I love music I'm just I love all this shit I just can't [Music] whatever having a Rage Against the Machine we're doing these days they all want different there they're there right now today they're in that band would be real be real be real in the band with them Public Enemy what they're all in the renegade oh it's a fucking tremendous super band what band is this yeah something of please don't come on don't embarrass me not again yeah sons of Rage or something's of Rage and it's Tom Morello the singer from Public Enemy be real Chuck T

array who's in the band it's a couple of guys from Rage Public Enemies Cypress Hill yes the loans ex-wife had a baby she was 55 85 years old yeah how the fuck did she have a baby she had the last egg they found the last thing that was tucked up in a quarter the fallopian tubes listen man Mick Jagger's singing at 75 it's gonna dig a little deeper you gotta dig deep deep deep in that little monkey it's gotta be an agenda Jackson had one in 50 yeah yeah I mean there's there in there you just need a guy to give you a stab and to generate everything of a second I thought I'd be holding back a lot of loads just keep those loads for weeks no jerking off no nothing no wet dreams for weeks and then just release the hounds as a woman after 48 from what I've read 46 47 your chances of a child having autism a very high there's a lot of chance of a lot of little things going wrong the chances are with the male as well you know really yeah over 50 mm-hmm yeah with men there's a bunch of factors but one of the factors is also the age of the father that's why you see more autistic kids these days than before as people are putting off they're having children and having careers later and there's complications it's one of the theories as to why there's more autistic kids another theory is that there's not more autistic kids we just were just better at diagnosing what the issue is with children then we used to be before I say we very loosely obviously Brigitte Nielsen look at that so she had her first kid this is her fifth she had her first kid when she was young and vibrant and the fifth kid when she's basically a monster god bless her god bless her god fucking blessing 55 healthy baby good fur I don't know my little girl was born I kept her age was 55 yes incredible I can't believe my daughter's Isis issue stoned God knows how much TAC was in my rifle when I shot that load of death when I shot that stolen a load it's kind of funny man when you you just think about the window of time that you have to get pregnant and impregnate someone just so you know you look you run if you're running someone and you haven't seen them in like 10 15 years you see me like whoa okay time time is real just it wears on people you don't think about it when you see people day in day out I see you all the time you look the same to me you know if you don't see someone from 10-15 years like oh wait you look at a picture yourself hotel room oh yeah you go to a hotel room that mirror it online mirror yeah house is a fucking bullshit on is that motherfucker hides curves and hairs and your nose you go to a hollow Vegas and you walk past a mirror and you're good what the fuck happened there yeah anus a mother oh you watch it i watch a tape of myself a sound I'm like wow I don't get old but you mean I'm a monster last week I fucking took a red-eye to Cleveland I get to Cleveland was the only direct flight you know now that everything's fucking crazy to direct White's identically I always got a flight for safety 19 hours right so much my poor choices will leave 11 the more leave a day early which ain't happening or take a red light at night I took the red-eye and we landed at 6:00 in the morning which is 3la time which I've never passed fucking 12:30 anymore and I took a thing for the hotel me and George Perez you know and for a couple minutes I was a little bike look at my fucking life I'm 55 and I'm fucking taking a red-eye to do Cleveland and when I got into the hotel room I sat down I said my computer I'm like I'm fucking lucky am i I'm still doing spots at the fucking store I'm still going out and doing weekends I never dreamt of this past 48 and I'm 55 and headlining having a great time and laughing my fucking balls off we forget for a moment of time what happened was the card in the show and I didn't even get pissed off I just said George let's hop in a cup we walked 50 yards it was a cab and that was the end of that no I told you that well you know it's perception no I mean you know if you showed Brigitte Nielsen a photo of her today when she was 20 and said you're gonna look like this in five minutes she'd probably freak out probably be terrified but now that she's 55 she's like yeah that's what I look like we all we all become J Howard Marshall Anna Nicole Smith's fucking husband we all we're gonna go this so much time you don't stay beautiful forever this is gonna be a mount of time where your body just stops working right and your your tissue starts to hang off your face and just it is what it is and it's perception a lot of it is perception you broke it down for me with you all Romero your genes looky-look somebody like what's the girl we discuss a thousand times she was married to Richard Gere with the beauty mark you said you saw her somewhere she was still fucking beautiful what's her name who was married to Richard Gere Cindy Cindy Crawford it was but the end of that song and said you gotta be kidding me I ran to her six months ago there's two universe two girls in my Facebook they have not aged a year and they don't spell out kids and mm-hmm it's it's it's also how you take care of yourself to alcohol

for a week do you know let your rubber hump a pack of cigarettes at eight o'clock at night and smoke like a fiend and throw them out of the car on the way up the hill you know how bad I feel the next day you could see how bad fucking cigarettes are fear and number two is alcohol you know you just so when you say this like how many cigarettes were you smoked like in one night yeah twelve really I'll throw do they eat away in the garbage wow that's a lot that's a lot because almost savage like yeah one was when the last time he did this about two months ago really yeah and you don't worry is that it do it again no no no I could go all that shit is bullshit to me why do you think I said that shit to you last week about the ambien I wasn't fucking around where you trying to be cute I'd do everything I'm sober but I do everything I'm sober right now well I do everything I don't do coke I don't do heroin I don't do oxycontin's right but on the road people give you shit and sometimes I put it in my pocket me shit all the time take the shit people give you all the time I just took some acid fucking somebody gave me blotter acid and I put it in the Veidt I put it in the battery thing I have like a shaver and I took the blotter acid and put it in the battery thing so it became like battery acid my colleague and I totally it was Wolfman Jack acid he didn't know Wolfman Jack was roof

Jack just gonna get us kicked off YouTube 66w end by NBC New York first air check first night Wow how weird give me a little speed it up a little bit a lot of truckin theatrics back then before the guy even talks several minutes into the recording [Music] what the fuck [Music] maybe got better as it went along no no it was a different world back then all you had to do is have a big personality be loud and crazy and people got used to listen to a certain person on the radio radio personalities were a different thing man it's like you had become accustomed to listen to someone's voice and that was the person you wanted to hear I remember a certain radio DJs Charles Lockwood era on the big mattress in WB CN in Boston listen to it every morning listen do when I was delivering newspapers he was the morning guy and like every place would have a morning guy and there's still a few of them out there there's still a few morning guys out there but man they're cutting those guys back they're cutting those folks back there whittling away their budget taking away their money you know they have to do personal appearance at Wild Wings and shit like that and fucking shoot t-shirts out of a cannon and all that nonsense this is it's a dying dying institution the radio world is a dying world it's weird you used to be everybody had a car radio you listened to the radio drove around what do we got in the radio oh it's tuned in what's the good local stations you'd find them listen to some good radio such it's gone now man it's good it's gone it's crazy it's gone I was never like a talk radio guy I can't live here like I've taught people listen to that talk sports and people call it fuck you they love it the Yankee should've beat one last night it was a rough job that shit drives me fucking crazy by the way congratulations on the Boston Red Sox they were fuckin tough tough I don't watch baseball throughout the a lifetime but the Cuban one September comes I love the art form gyro and it's a beautiful by the way not only that I gonna look back and I got a GDL Holyoke I'm the only Cuban I couldn't play baseball I'm possibly the only Cuban that was the worst baseball player in the fucking world even my mother stopped going to the game I can't I can't you just embarrass the shit out of me I was terrible but during the playoffs I watch that shit religiously yeah I talked to my uncle and he fills me in my uncle's tremendous my uncle fuckin knows he's a he's been watching bay knows so I'm getting on the phone with him during the playoffs and he'll be watching and I've talked to him and he said he's ratting me off in Spanish look at the way he throws the ball me and me look at his finger how it's all I mean it just it's a different art and Boston was just too tough to see Joe Rogan had thieves a baseball player with thieves it's tough to play against them well there's my needs that's why I mean your old partner at the UFC with tight Goldberg we're both Cincinnati red fans what do you mean by thingy people will steal basis oh there's no basis I love thieves because they don't let the pitcher get into a rhythm mmm they get into the pitches head and they start swinging their arms and now the pitchers got to keep looking my shoulder and if you ever get a chance to watching the old since Haley read ballpark a good game if I find one I'll send it to you and you watch what that the piggy I won the rep the coach comes on he get takes the ball from the guy and the guy walks off and they call a reliever with the Cincinnati Reds the coach would come on the pitcher would go take this fucking boy I don't want to pitch again because they said it was the king of bunting getting on first then playing with your head starting they they would steal second and they would hit a single the Cincinnati Reds one those all those years up with Pete Rose Pete Rose was in a home run hitter Pete Rose was a hitter that means every time he came up to bat you're gonna have a problem and him and concepción and more getting all those people that were just single hitters those are the worst at least with a home run I know where I stand but these motherfuckers that Club you with singles and doubles that's a different game hmm and then I'm stealing from you to really get down like I'm stealing second and stealing third that that's that's it that Sparky and this in that movie I know you never watched it but that's what it was about the movie with Brad Pitt Ethan about baseball mm-hmm that's a great movie he explains to you that it's on-base percentage although this is bullshit but they don't like ya but this guy walks a lot did he get on base that's what it's all about yeah and that's the center and Boston played that same game they're thieves they still it was heart attack baseball you couldn't watch if you bet the last five games god bless you god bless your trial attacks I got back to my room and cleaned it 2:30 in the morning it was still playing 2 or 3 in the morning I went to bed the Dodger game was still on it's tremendous this is the time of the year but then I love playoff baseball when it starts in April I don't want I don't know nothing I don't watch none of that shit none of that shit I played baseball when I was a kid Tara I stopped doing it when I got into martial arts I found out about Taekwondo because I was waiting for a Red Sox game waiting for the T to get home and there was a big-ass line to get to the T cuz the Fenway Park would let out and walking back from Fenway Park to the train station I saw the Taekwondo school and I went up there and this guy named John Lee he was a national heavyweight champion and light heavyweight champion at the time and he was about to go to the World Cup and he was up there kicking the shit out of the heavy bag I've never seen anything like it in my life I was here in the sounds of it I was walking up the stairs I hear and lump Cinque Cinque and the whomp was him kicking the bag and the chink was the chain as the bag would go flying through the air and slam against the chain I was like that is the craziest fucking sound and I walked in and there's this guy who was just you know at the peak of his physical power he was just at his very best and he was training for a world tournament and machine - that was so terrifying thinking like if someone kicked me like that like what it would do to my body and that's how I got into martial arts because before I wasn't in the team sports man that's one of the reasons why I got into wrestling I'm Lisa wrestling it's me against that guy I hated team sports I hated the fact that we were losers because a little Billy dropped the ball like I think and I didn't play for the team either like they would tell me heartbroken go try to get a singer but guy yeah yeah get the fuck out of here I swung I either got a home run or I struck out every fucking time I was a bet I either cuz I got a home run once and I was like oh that is so much better than getting a single you can suck dick for the rest of your life for singles I don't give a fuck about a single I felt bad if I go on base and I got a single because I connected once cock Iraq and that ball one I could hit pretty hard nut ball went fucking for lying and it went into the stands and I was like oh this is what it's about it's about doing that it's the only thing that's any good about the stupid fucking dad and catching balls so many cracks went out there and catch it that's pretty fun I could never even hit a ball i never hit a ball my life I used to bunt the strikeout like I was just terrible at baseball I just had no nothing for it when I went to Miami I used to go to red berries baseball camp in the summers just for a week it was a week camp that you went that in like a basketball was my shit yeah basket we look real good real fucking good really real good what the five star basketball camp at Harvey Garfinkel

Village my roommate was from brown and he had another brother and that another friend and that trained them of this guy named IRA Wolfe where I grew up IRA wolf went to the Olympics to be a trainer and he's except for one guy two of these guys are still alive and these guys did not believe in traditional lifting they believed in slow motion heavy lifting 10 count on the way down and the tenth count on the way up a lot of guys still believe in that and the strength doubles his strength doubles like that the strength it's so slow motion no was really into that Einstein you know Eddie's uh boy felt Scott Epstein yeah he's really into slow-mo training so no slow motion lifting now these guys were really fuckin into it and today the one guy we were talking a while ago he has no injuries

kettlebell classes for a while too right weren't you yeah but the kettle see that the problem with the kettlebell is that if you read that that guy's book or anything about Pavlov he says that the kettlebells I don't even know if that's his name powerful powerful about Cellini it's supposed to be like lean 22:18 15-minute workout kettle most yeah what they do is they the quote the new CrossFit community has taken kettlebells and you just hurting people kettlebells are done for you to feel good and to enhance a different workout like when I do kettlebells thank God for on it how you I combined it with a club wall workout mm-hmm Alberto crane taught me how to do swings with club bats will you turn you inside you your wrists so everything turns well yeah I burn a lot of fascia on my shoulder because I do it that way so when I do a kettlebell workout I incorporate it with the bats from on it mm-hmm and I do it like a circuit training I do there's a straight one all this and even with that even cuz I before I went to physical therapy I wanted to try the club bats because they have all the weight on the end and it helps pull that shoulder yeah all the way the fuck down like for me to do way they have a stretch my shoulder before and after really deep I gotta go against the wall I don't want the knees I'm the guy brought on Hobart Oguz eeny Galina Nazgul Ozzy I do a lot of his little great workouts even right now on it's got that kettlebell 6 camel 6 waves of transformation they got some great stuff on there the guys send it to me the beginning they call it something else instead of warm up they call it something else dad's name is Josh wolf foot John John Wathan John Wolfe good he's fantastic fantastic clubs that they're not that heavy but they're odd so if you're holding on to the end of it but the weight is it the end of the other end and it's this long thing so it's very awkward and you could get a really good work on with 15 pounds I mean you really

Queens and three swings okay with E just do it a few days a week yeah three listen if I'm on the road most hotels not have kettlebells really most hotels are starting to come around I go to a hotel I check and I go up I roll a joint I go downstairs I smoking on the way back I checked by the gym if I see kettlebells I'm very happy but I keep it to that three three and three because over 50 it should just be three days a week it takes a lot for you to recuperate well it's also that you you can get in more reps over the week that's really what you want if you do a lot of reps in one day the problem is you destroyed afterwards but if you do the same amount of reps over the course of five days just do shorter workouts and do many of them you don't get ever get destroyed your body's fine you do all the other things you do too and I think you you become more consistent with it you don't need to try - I do - kickboxing Muay Thai conditionings - Jiu Jitsu you know my jujitsu incorporates my jujitsu incorporates the class doing the technique and three five-minute rolls I thought I'd get up and walk away because anything after that is defeat i'm defeating the purpose right I hit the Nova Thor bed twice a week especially on Sunday what the Nova Thor bed what is that - no the dog bed is the one I told you about the last time I think they sent you some information because we were discussing that last time it's the red light therapy oh okay yeah Nova tour bed twice a week right Nova Thor yes Nova Thor bed look it up okay gonna Nova saw bed twice a week especially on Sundays to take all the oxidation that thing right there yes thinner fitter healthier happier and then I go in the crowd there opee two or three times a week so what I did was I shortened my workout and I could do it more often me going to a jiu-jitsu class and fighting any to the death right there's nothing for me yeah I'm not gonna improve all right and I'm not gonna do that because I'm not gonna be able to roll for three or four more days now yeah that's the thing is we're covering I really want online and you right after 50 and ID number one you gotta go for you got over fifty strength strength oh gosh that's because that sarcopenia will fucking kill you and that's when you start getting hunchy and we all become our grandfather and when you do stand up it's it's you just got to be stronger so I went back I meet these guys twice a week and we pack it on how they know what you put on there cuz it gives me anxiety and we opened up with a squat to really get the system into a fucking into frenzy you be there's no jumping jacks there's no bench we open up we warm up first I will do a little warm-up and the first two sets I see the fucking devil it's on a stopwatch there's no sets it's on a stopwatch didn't mean so he'll go four hours four minutes go so four minutes a squatter I'm squatting for three minutes three minutes just a lot of time squatting but it's ten seconds up ten seconds back the last two I'm fucking I'm seeing the devil I'm thinking about getting the heart attack my whole thing and then right from that little pulldown machine right from there I go to a back twister it's really weird how he does it but I'm other than twenty two minutes that's a good workout I mean to him it's physical strain lifting some weights getting that uh bone density tightening up all your all the muscle grabs and my luke stick works that's the most important thing I don't end up on NBC doing commercials for IDI commercials you don't want to be you gotta get the Maluku stick and that's from lifting weights let bro it's day one yeah I don't care what anybody tells you give me an old guy that's doing lifting a little lightweight three days a week he's doing it for yzma Luke stick all that shit they sell what is the GNC with Frank Thomas high and it's good for your lady too that shit don't work does Frank Thomas there's a bunch of thirsty white people hanging out all those commercials are the worst we played those commercials 30 times hey Mike how are you ladies going I wish you would do that much yeah meanwhile Frank's a fat fuck I'm doing this that GNC shit don't work you want to keep the Maluku stick up oatmeal we did a study on this I didn't study it doesn't depend this study see what works the most wholemeal coconut milk in that motherfucker mm-hmm and some dead listening some squats you'll be stabbing people to you sure those things elevate testosterone and increase your hormone levels that's for sure deadlifts and squats are the kings of exercise those are so important because they work your whole chain they work everything Dolce loves the fucking deadlift Dolce me and him everybody does faster I read his book that's when I really I went to the Y one day and I started like I started light I got a coach the first time to go over the basics with me and like three weeks later I thought I was my coach and I went in then to the center a five deadlift bro I could feel it and my central nervous system like you it really does hit essential like it you just feel like this fuck well you realize oh Jesus this crazy fuck is it needs us to lift weights it needs us to carry heavy things all the time so you probably just get stronger and there's only one way to get stronger your body's got to increase testosterone it's gonna rebuild all that tissue that you're breaking down what place are you in right now brother your first place in this contest if I wasn't in first place I jump off a fucking building house Ari's number two I'm just just disturbed that they thought they were gonna win I'm ahead by like 2,000 points this is what I'll tell you why right now what is lacking is that right I mean obviously out of all these guys I'm the one who's been working out all the time I'm obviously I've been working out my whole life it's so I have 10,000 139 Ari's in second place with 8,000 299 yeah Tommy buns in third place Tommy has just recently banged out another hundred so he's eight to five nine and Bert is strong in last place strong talking all kinds of mad shit and then he's more than 2,000 points behind me that slob and I haven't even worked out today and when I workout today they're all gonna quit I'm gonna I'm going today even though I'm 2,000 points ahead I'm gonna go for six hours today is a day of death as many as I've gotten as many as a thousand points in a day no one has ever been gone close to that you just gotta fucking keep going the thing is when you're exotic and I can't do this anymore yes you can go broke we do four minutes I do a variety of different things break it down Joey I run the hills with the dog for a good hour you know I do about two miles in the hills with the dog so he's exhausted otherwise he's a puppy you know he's he's two years old he's a pain in the ass if he's not worn out so I wear his little ass out so we run for two you know two miles which is in the Hills these are pretty fucking steep hills turns out to be about 40 minutes ish 45 minutes close to now you back stretch out a little and then I decide what else I want to do yesterday it was kickboxing so I hit the bag for another hour and a half I turned on some old fights in the gym and just fucking went to town put on the ringside timer so it's giving me rounds and the ringside timer gives me 30 seconds - so I go 30 seconds hard 30 seconds not so hard 30 seconds are 30 seconds not so hard one-minute break shit guys water no no ocean ocean guards no to really kick the shit out of that fucking bag boxing class and I fucked up one of my fungi toes just blew up it just blew up and blood started coming out it I went home later on I said what the fuck I did nothing my tail my toenails are cut if you slam your shin into a bag for an hour and a half a full blast some tissues gonna break down something's gonna Mike like right now everything's sore my ankles are sore my knees are sore my lower back is sore I went I went whole ham yesterday but you know that wasn't a big day for me yes it was like for 430 something points that's a big day for some guy it's the most I've ever worked out is I did six and a half hours and I got a thousand points I did five and a half hours I got 900 points and then I did another hour just to sort of like at the end of the day just to loosen everything up but just hit the bag for an hour just I just because Bert was talking so much shit I was like this is like oh where am I gonna put the belt whoo everything Joe does I'm gonna double who like okay okay we'll see we'll see he went hiking with Ari and was quitting while he was hiking hiking is walking it's walking these guys are walking and they're getting tired and he's talking about beating me in a fitness contest it's outrageous plus he's enormous ly overweight the the one who's the real issue is re r he's a sneaky fuck Ari might try to pull it out even though he's 2,000 he might try to murder himself over the next two days get to 2,000 points and put another 1002 beat me on the third day he literally might try to do that but I'm not gonna let him we're here we're queer there's they're fighting for second place good luck boys I'd let them get close up into a while ago up until about a week and a half ago and then I just turned it on like okay here we go I had a plan my plan was to get you know first of all I was not doing this much cardio before so we're 29 days in stay for 30 what is today it's 29 39 29 29 days in I've taken four days off I took three days off because I went to Vegas with my family when I went with the UFC so we're gonna go on Thursday I'm gonna stay till Sunday I'm not gonna work out just go have a good time relax see if these guys catch up so they caught up to me and that's when birt posted to opens and loves please I really hadn't even worked out and so I said okay I'm done with that now it's time to kick it into full gear and then when I kicked into full gear I'm steady every day three hours a day three and a half hours a day four hours a day sometimes sometimes two and a half hours in the morning two and a half hours at night just 600 points a day seven hundred points a day eight hundred points a day whatever I got to do just to stay way ahead and the my goal was so the last few days to be so far ahead that they're fucked and they're all just scratching lawn for second place what's the wisdom what's the stuff to see you what you don't get anything I wanted to lose you to have to drink a goblet of everybody else's piss that's what I wanted I wanted cuz I wanted Bert to drink piss I feel like Bert has to lose this I don't see how Tom's getting tom was sick he was sick as a dog on antibiotics for like five days came back in one day and he ran 13 motherfucking miles for 600 points yeah yeah ran around the neighborhood 13 fucking miles the dude ran for three and a half hours just ran doesn't want to lose and doesn't want to lose to Bert even if he only comes in third place as long as he's not Bert as long as he beats Burton that's where everybody's at cuz Bert talked so much shit everybody just wants to make sure that Bert loses he's got the DiMaggio gene he thinks he could just half-ass his way through something that's an actual competition because he's just look he can push himself but can there's a big difference in pushing yourself and pushing yourself for a whole month that's where he's falling apart and he's been talking so much shit that we're all laughing at him so yesterday we're all everybody was going out is it today look at his tits bouncing what'd he say he's sandbagging Cenarion timers sandbag super aggressive I still love them but man sandbaggers bro sandbaggers what is it what's the sandbag that already like held on to this stats like a week he did return to men he did said Thomas lying about being said no no already held on to stats and he's allowed to do that look we're not supposed to do that you're supposed to look the manly thing to do is to put it all on the table and make everybody try to fucking keep up that's the manly thing to do that's what Ari is obviously a sneaky fuck right and he obviously is also the one who worked out the least out of all of us so he at one point I'm stored up a thousand points and had them on his device and then released him and Bert had went fucking crazy you fuck who cuz birth thought he was a head of re then all sudden re shot ahead of him that's how it works this is a competition that's a fight for lacerating all right between yes between them it's a fight for last that births gonna get he's gonna lose that fight he's gonna be last Tom's gonna work out today Tom's gonna pay tom I told you Tom got six hundred fucking points yesterday all they're fighting up there fighting in a group text well let me see what's going on here oh my god it's long it's very long oh boy there's a lot mmm there's a lot of fighting Bert's very angry very very very angry he's very angry because he realizes he's gonna come in last cuz he would say he was saying yesterday here's what Solaris he goes he goes in you're barely winning I Bert I'm ahead of you yesterday was two thousand three hundred points I go do you have any idea what the fuck you would be saying if you were ahead by two thousand three hundred points he was I'd be respectful no be fuckin liar man probably you fucking liar look this you know this is a rigged game it's it's if I don't get hurt it's a rigged game that's just what it is no it'll be drink at least now I really got caught drinking us now and nothing didn't you think that don't you think that birth drinking did you say you looked at you funny all right the fucking story can you tell me what you think okay cuz this is the fuck's update my feelings are even hurt every Wednesday I go to pizza after karate with mercy we go eat pizza and we're sitting at it's a neighborhood pizza Dre we're sitting at and I'm look at my wife like oh isn't that Bert and it's a dude walking through the neighborhood look just like Bert with a hat on I put my pizza dialing go on I go ain't cocksucker I see that you're drinking cuz it looked like he got a six-pack or whatever hold of it he turned around wave that mean kept walking this is Bert Kreischer right this Bert Christ this is a guy that you know I figured he'd come back and talk to me so the next day Lee tells me I tell Lee that yeah I saw a bird today yelled at I mean come on talk to me bleep puts down leaves tells me that Bert put down a tweet that one of his fans yelled and he didn't know who it was and he kept walking he knew the fucking dog if I yell at you you'll know it's fucking me if I say cocksucker at the end of the speech you know it's me look what else Bert does first of all Burton knows he's behind its staggering him out he put in the most bitch ass workout today he got what is this a hundred and forty nine points that is that is not enough he worked out for an hour and fifty minutes you got a 149 points because look at the end see the end all those Gray's maybe it stayed honor so no no he kept his he kept his strap-on he worked out it says an hour for them he worked out for 40 minutes and he kept a strap-on for an hour trying to get some exercise yeah because he's dying so his heart's elevated so he gets some points for having an elevated heart but look at this all this grace shit at the end see folks see all of this you can't I can see it here let me do something here I'll show people here all this nonsense you get for 80 percent your heart rate you get yellow for 90 percent of your max heart rate you get red I tried to go all red the first day I'm like I'm just gonna kill them I'm just gonna sprint for half an hour and just make these guys catch up there's no way they catch up then an re it is fucking ingenious and devious ways found out that you get just as many points for 80% as you get from 90% we figure it so that they avoid lawsuits so we said okay so it seems like the sweet spot is in 80% so just stick to 80% so you can do that or you could be like Bert and Bert barely gets to 70% mostly stays in the 60% range which is gray and then 80% which is well 60% is like this 50 60 and 70 and 70s green no yeah 70s green and then blue is 60 so he's mostly blue 60% is mass heart rate which by the way I might be at right now because I'm getting angry so if you got mad you'd be in like the blue and you get two points a minute for the blue you get four points a minute for the yellow when it goes see 60% to 70% you get blue Bert is almost all gray and blue and if you look at this fucking slobbery workout he's got look at all that shit it's 60% and lower most of his workout so that means most of the workout that he did for an hour and 49 minutes is him with a fucking thing on just sitting around it's an hour and thirty minutes so it's most of it is him with the thing on just sitting there being fat that's all it is now let me ask you this what is this well this is calm because I like to go on it's called this it's a my zone fitness tracker this is the thing you put on your chest yes you put it's a once I snap this in he'll start measuring my heart rate and I'm gonna put it on when I get out of here I'm gonna start working out and today these are the three days of death today's Monday tomorrow's Tuesday and Wednesday we'd go crazy Joey Diaz Wednesday I work out to 11:59 and then at 11:59 I popped that off and a walk away at 11:59 and then I go have a glass of wine cuz it hits midnight no wait qualifications on this nothing nobody no no there's no losing weight I probably fucking gained weight I haven't lost any weight I've eaten everything that moves I've put in zero dietary restrictions I eat a whole carrot cake the other day but the amount of calories and I'm burning is fucking insane like I mean I'll give you a for instance on a day like a good calorie day in terms of like how much like yesterday one workout 2214 calories one workout 3 hours 25 minutes and then the day before that 1930 calories the day before that there was two workouts one was 1876 calories one was 2,000 210 calories these are I mean this insane amount of calories one workout I had was 4910 what's that entail like when you get your heart up to 80 is that the running yeah well the lifting I can't I can't just do one thing I go crazy right okay so I'll get bored all right so I'd lift but the lift doesn't give me much lift is like blue and green that's all you ever get from lifting and then swings or chin-ups presses cleans and presses windmills clean press squats renegade rows or kettlebell all kettlebells yeah absolute them doesn't give you much doesn't give me how would you Jitsu fat jiu-jitsu would probably be pretty good but this thing we get in the way if anybody mounted you would crack this thing would crack you know if you lost this oh my god be deaf like I could break this in with my finger I'm pretty sure I could break this it feels Louie timelines a lot yes that's the number I did an hour you know because I have the the gym at home so right I went fucking hog on the put you I put fights on once I put fights on you fire it up you just start fucking wailing on that bag and keeping the party going but see if I if I got cocky right now these fucks could catch me especially Ari because he's probably gonna sandbag some more and and hide his numbers cuz he just wants a beat Bert cuz he got super pissed at Tom he's a group of fuck Tom because Tom put up all those points yesterday 600 points in a day is a lot of points but like I said dude ran like I'll tell you what he did he ran 13 fucking miles in his neighborhood and this is after being sick but he's feeling it today yeah today he gets 145 points that's not good you're not gonna win with that see they're not trying to win they're trying to beat Bert I know that I know that one day he was a us crowd therapy cuz I went over there like Bert's just left here so I know he was doing something but I know he hasn't been going consistently he Bert doesn't do anything consistently but he doesn't watch his diet either that's the problem with Bert he's not watching his diet he's not eating it's not him either it's the booze don't yeah that sure there's a motherfucker it is that shit turns into sugar at night beers oh kill you you know what else kills your house ie bowls people think that they're fucking help there's a ton of shit that fucking closer and I say yeah just stick to one apple in the banana I try you know I love acai bowls though they make them by my house with chia seed juju worries when I'm in the middle of like these brutal workouts I'll drink a whole soda and the really work I drank a cream soda yesterday in the middle of a workout I needed sugar I needed it how do you know you need it cuz I felt like I needed it I was fucking I'm burning up so many calories and I'm my blood sugar it's crashing so hard I'm eating fruit I mean I when I the one day that I worked out where I did five and a half hours I was eating boxes animal crackers I was eating everything I could what I do is what you told me to do I when I get home from time or lifting and I make a protein shake I put I swear to God I take the Hershey's syrup you told me just a little bit not even a second of it yeah and with the Mexican chocolate works perfect it tastes like fucking you know so I do that with the protein drinks but I try to avoid sugar nothing see what's happening with these workouts we're dealing with an extreme loss of electrolytes and extreme loss of glucose I mean I'm putting salt in all my water I'm drinking a bunch of these Nalgene you know the Nalgene bottle is like with a twist top it's a thick heavy plastic 32 ounce bottled water I'm drinking three and four of those in a workout in those I'm putting electrolytes and then I'm putting sprinkles of Himalayan salt so I'm putting like a little like a half a teaspoon of Himalayan salt in each one of them shaking it up because I'm losing insane amounts of water I sweat so hard I set off the fucking alarm I set off my fire alarm in my gym from sweat from my steam the whole room was like a shower from me steaming and I put it up on Instagram this is the kind of workout I'm doing I mean I'm pushing hard cuz this is they're not making it easy these guys are actually doing it that's legit those puddles on the ground that's not for me pissing my pants that's all sweat so I'm I'm sweating so much because of this all day I'm staying in the 80 80 % of your max heart rate range for hours I'm staying there for hours so my thought was there's no way they can do that they're not gonna do that there's no way they're not gonna do that for five hours they're just not so like if I did one day like that I felt like one day where I did I got 935 points in one workout and then another hundred points afterwards I'm like one day like that will separate me from the pack just one day just put your feet I'll ask you something if you're in there let me just ask you something just to be fair everybody here what about stuff of some of some of the stuff you do doesn't that kind of you mean like testosterone yeah a hundred percent helps I told them okay you say yeah I told them this is a fuck you should have made them shoot shit all those machetes I gave them my doctor's information I told them what they should do look I'm also at least eight years older than all of them right how old's Ari 41 41 I'm 51 no I'm older than all yeah but the testosterone yeah I got you side on this oh yeah you should yeah testosterone replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy I started doing all that when I was 40 so that's their age yeah it makes a big difference makes a big difference fuck yeah look listen everybody everybody listen to this there's a stigma attached to that in a lot of people like you know where do you get your testosterone from I'll get it from my balls mm-hmm all that matters is that you have it in your system if you don't have it in your system you're not gonna feels good it's real simple if you're fine with not feeling as good good go ahead stick with that but if you're not fine with it this is 2018 hormone replacement therapy exists for a reason and that reason is it makes you feel way better it makes your body work way better you can avoid a host of ailments and conditions that are related to your body breaking down due to age with hormone replacement therapy the key to doing it though is to do it correctly he's supposed to go to a doctor that's going to test your blood levels test your nutrient levels and adjust your diet first the first thing that happens is they want to find out how much you're sleeping house to house how stressed out you are what are you eating how much water you drinking are you getting the proper amount of protein and vegetables are you eating correctly let's get you off of this sugar let's get you off the booze let's get you off cigarettes or whatever else is before they do anything so they put you that it's this is a many many month process that I went through where they they get you off of all these different things and you make these adjustments and then they start adding a little stuff add a little bit of growth hormone add a little bit of testosterone first it was cream and then it became injections takes a little bit of time to figure out what works best and then you get to a point where you're you have the hormone levels of a healthy young man you don't want to elevate you don't want to be higher than that that's when you run into problems you don't want to be in like some crazy vitor belfort when he got popped from you know nevada and he was like some super bubbles anyone that was 80% over my mother sunday night against it was supposed to fight Rumble Johnson what's the I've been done with a Christian nice guy Nate Marquardt they mark wat level really high in Pittsburgh that night that's right yeah they say he's burg it was in danger he was like it was there is dangerous to his health the levels but he says that was his doctors doctor Farnum the the the whole idea well there's a difference between first of all there's a big difference treat someone who's competing in mixed martial arts obviously you have to worry about your opponent getting hurt because of the fact that you're enhanced and these are young guys that are doing this when Nate was doing this he was like thirty years old right when you are talking about just general health and wellness testosterone replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy there's a reason why a lot of older guys especially guys who can afford it they have money they're doing it it makes you feel better it just does and if you don't want to do it that's fine there's ways of elevating your testosterone natural they just don't work as well with whether it's dead lifts or running hills doing sprints they work a little bit better it works a little bit better than nothing but if squats are very good yeah they release but not not for what you saying no there's gonna be a difference I thought they could raise him through acupuncture I know that she's I've discussed raising well listen testosterone to acupuncture I would like to see Studies on that the problem is it's really painful Aksum painful for that real process it's in your feet yeah I'd like to see Studies on that I don't know if that's really been proven if that was really proven look this what there's ways to raise it you know the chick I was with for years told me different case studies that she had been involved in yeah she told me a guy came in once they'd found the younger girlfriend his wife passed and they found the yellow girlfriend he couldn't keep up and he couldn't keep up so he came in to see her and she did a bunch of stuff and put him on a tee and he came back a week later I said turn that shit off there's my dick will not shut down Mike but she told me she goes I can raise your testosterone levels but it has to be needling through your feet yeah you gotta find that a little bit uncomfortable and I was like I don't want to fucking walk around all this stuff that we're talking about whether it's hormone replacement therapy or squats or deadlifts or all these all these things will help hormone replacement therapy helps the most most the thing about this kind of a competition that we're doing though we're not doing anything that you need massive amounts of testosterone no this is about as willpower willpower for 30 days they told us but a lot of his discipline and willpower and if I have any advantage it's that I have a gym in my house and I have a gym in my studio and I run with my dog almost every day in the hills and I've been doing that for years I've been taking that dog running since he was six months old he runs in the hills with me all the time you fall in love with running I love it you know why I love it Joey here's a big thing because it makes me feel better in terms of like my mental state like I'm happier when I run all the time this whole month I'm fucking I feel great and I don't just feel great because I'm not smoking pot like I mean maybe that's help maybe that's good in some way maybe it's good and not smoke pot even though I enjoy it maybe it's not good to smoke as much as I do Oh No Thursday morning uh I don't know no Thursday I'm flying in New York I probably won't smoke I mean I might smoke a little over the weekend I'm gonna play some pool my boy Tommy jr. down in New York but the what the thing that really helps because I'm doing insane amounts of exercise hours and hours of exercise a day you don't give a fuck about normal bullshit like all that chatter all the negative chatter in your head that shit goes away doesn't exist I don't care I'm super calm no anxiety anxiety goes away I think I'm not a depressed person I don't suffer from depression but we I had Tyson Fury on the podcast yeah that's what he was amazing amazing he's a fucking he's a brave man the way he opened up about ready to comment some whatnot yeah suicidal thoughts and depression and think all that's it helps it doesn't just help it helps fucking tremendous if I if I found a drug if a doctor put me on medication I was like doc I'm fine I'm happy everything's good the doctors like I would just like you to just try this for a while and tell me tell me how it makes you feel you just put me on something and I had to take a pill a day and I felt as good as I feel right now sitting in front of you I'd be like wow you were right I feel better this exists but it only gets to you through discipline and know that you can't give someone something that forces them to work out almost every fucking day I worked out this month I didn't want to do it almost every day the only thing that kept me doing it is Burt going home gonna double with juncos all that that got me angry that got my competitive juices stirred and just the idea that these guys I've been working out my whole life these guys barely work out like they're gonna beat me in some sort of a fitness competition that involves willpower I'm like that's not going to happen I'm going to put in more time than you I'm just going to but all that aside when I did do it just doing it I feel fucking fantastic remember the tapes you made of me and House of Blues were you were concerned I was I got along with no more yeah I wasn't working out yeah now I'd do something four days a week minimum since I've been on Weight Watchers I didn't hit the plateau one week because I was on antibiotics I got a rash on my leg and so when I lift that I felt a little weird but I still did everything else it's hard to exercise antibiotics I felt it lifting yeah you feel the squats I had to stop don't stop so I in fact that one off the end I was like I can't live this very few things that will kill your system I can't about I couldn't do it and that one that's a real wake-up call for people that don't understand the benefits of probiotics those probiotics like taking acid Ovilus or eating kimchi or eating anything that's gonna help your your microbiome it's so beneficial to your your well-being to it the way you feel the way your health is your vitality all that stuff is connected I like Gilbert yogurts fucking grateful I love yo Greek yogurt a lot I don't like the Greek as much as the other one I get the low point one I'm a lucky guy I ain't that shit wants every day I love that shit juice but you gotta watch the sugar in that what you're not o kombucha wants to chew so we gotta watch the sugar in that that's I got a two point kombucha for eight ounces that's not bad no it's not bad it's not bad although very beneficial kombucha is fuckin amazing it's really good at avoiding sicknesses but with this exercise the amount of exercise that I'm doing I'll drink bottles of that shit I don't worry about nothing that there's a lot of benefit in that to me just to be able to eat whatever the fuck I want I mean I've been eating everything in front of me man this whole month I mean I've doubled how much food I eat just eaten like it's fucking it's crazy how much I gotta watch everything I get it I guess not sustained that night Sam is good I'd do a lot of chicken breast and my meat intake is cut just to 1/3 I don't agree with you on the me didn't take anymore especially at night I'll fuck with that shit at night no more if I eat meat it's maybe three times a week don't get me wrong I still crave a fucking steak but if I take my wife on the day to the steak the first thing I'd do a color than ass and I save it for the next day for breakfast or something nothing wrong with that trying to eat meat early in my day let it digest by the time man yeah I don't like it at night no more no much no more funny day we were talking when your mother was visiting and you and I were talking about Italians that they can be pasta after their 50 that they lose their mind you know as you get older you lose things you just can't eat them and I've had I think Sebastian told me that gravy bothers him and my buddy in Jersey was hysterical he's like I can't even walk past a pizza place doable well it's mmm it's also don't what do you feel the feet gout they get gout the jumpy bit that you get gout from sauce from the acidity and the sauce people get it from wine you know used to be called like Emperor's disease because people would just sit around and drink wine when they were rich like it's like it was a rich person's disease way back in the day it's one bad no lines no why it's not balanced good everything's bad in excess success you know I mean sugars terrible in excess you have you know like the rock eats like a fucking a plate of cookies one day a week nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with a day where you fuck off have a cheat meal so I'm wrong with that as long as the majority of your diet is healthy the majority your diet should consist of leafy green vegetables healthy fats healthy meat you know grass-fed I said why fuck you pussies ring motherfucker one of our sponsors was of the egg sponsor they forget the sponsor but they they give you they sell actual cage free eggs people say cage free but they're all fucking jammed in together they might as well be in a cage what has helped farms spell it vital farms vit al right vital farms and

right tomorrow Jesus Christ I put up a thing that our boy Michael Klein made from one by one podcast yeah can't play a man's looks good yeah it's funny it's funny yeah I'm very thankful of Netflix for giving me that file you know I just feel at times like I didn't do really well I'm on the show like I felt like I fell hard on yourself you're an artist no but you know I felt like and not to be trying to be cute it's funny like when you see Rana get kicked and she was sitting there for the first three minutes she was upset about the cake but you also said about the training you see all the holes in your training where you've made mistakes a little mistakes you made even two weeks ago and Connor went down for a couple of minutes he was just sitting there he's not thinking about the 30 million he made there's nobody he's mad about the mistakes that got you there you know and it was weird that I didn't think I did that well then Netflix special I guess personally I wanted to do better you know but it but ever since that you can't ever since you talked Joe I had June 30th I've been on a different level as a stand-up comic I went back to the mid seashore technique I don't give a fuck and 55 we don't like me I don't give a fuck well that fly offends you I really don't give a fuck this is who I am and that's it I've been having some tremendous sets of the original that's the benefit of doing these things oh the benefit of doing these specials is you grow you abandon all the material and then you forced to regroup and you forced to look at the material and look at your set see what you don't like some people never do that Joey and they never grow because of that it's but the growth I've had since June 4th I feel like Dustin Poirier and max Holloway together like I see

went back to my favorite I got all the vinyl from Richard Pryor then I went back and listened to it I came with the conclusion that what was I giving a fuck about I can't give a fuck about audiences this is what the fuck I am I'm gonna unleash it the wrath of fucking God on you and we come out of here and we'll see what the fuck it is you know the worst thing I did was a week before Jim Norton says something that kind of bothered me once and then I understood after he said it he said he didn't watch people's specials me I liked watching comedy specials I loved watching but the week before my special did the worst thing in the world I watched John Mulaney special who's a great writer was a great writer I'm not a great writer everything was me as my energy so I wanted to be John Mulaney
