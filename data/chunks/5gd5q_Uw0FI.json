I started thinking about it when people said like you know you think could you beat like twelve twelve year olds a fuck up twelve twelve year old okay sure maybe hundred percent what if they're organized I don't they don't have a chance they don't have a chance if they all come at you at once no they don't care about getting beat up first of all everybody cares about getting beat up you're talking about nonhumans now well I'm but if you start training them at a young age I'm gonna fuck them up you don't have a chance the first ones going to get kicked into a girl is getting a kick hard for sure and the only one we got to panic and then I'm just going to start smashing so okay okay I listen if I had a fight me and ten other dudes went to fight a 500-pound man that's more coyotes shit I was a weird-looking one yes I'll bury you bury I eat a lot of berries yeah if I had to get ten friends yeah and we had to fight a 500-pound hulking man yeah I would be fucked who'd be fucked we'd be fucked we didn't have a chance what about 12 like Duncan Trussell could you take that little bit bigger now his current form hurt more absolutely all up we'd have a chance by the beard one of them in front of me at some point the problem with Duncan is he wouldn't be able to really do any damage if he got close he could punch you square in the jaw you'd laugh it up like beard Baracus yeah you'd be like okay but if you had a deal with like three Bert Kreischer right I'm probably gonna get fucked up yeah even if he's not a trained fighter the first guy you have to take out immediately hard as hard as you can you also have to show consequences for everybody else well we smoked way too much pot for this pot I believe it was the right amount
