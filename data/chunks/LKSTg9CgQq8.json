fight it and we'll do it live well - alive fuck it we'll do it live that will go down in history right it's one of the all-time la hissy fits versus remixes - did you ever see the Bill O'Reilly remix the dance reacts I was amazed by that with Bill O'Reilly where he was going no I don't they're going yeah we're gonna that's what we're gonna do I don't know what that means to play us out know what it means to play us so angry yeah so angry yeah he's an angry man we were talking before the podcast started about some no no no being at Fox for years I can't I'll let it go talk about Moby though right yeah we could talk about moby moby says he has like inside information about donald trump that he knows that donald trump talked to the Russians first of all when you look at Moby with his fucking hashtag vegan t-shirt on do you really think anybody in the Russian fucking intelligence community is talking to Moby actually it would be a brilliant ploy from the Russians they just give a little info to Moby like you go you tell them and he's going to do it you know you shouldn't definitely leak this information it would be the downfall then they found out he wasn't Enya and they made a mistake hee-hee my mom was the wardrobe stylist so costumes on her first show called Lee Korea it's like the french-canadian sort of Letterman like kind of like Graham Norton in England so they'd have stars come in all the time and Moby was there he was just a head case the guy was just absolutely out of his mind nothing was good enough and he would want something and then say he wanted to change it like what kind of things did he want to change I don't know I can tell you this there were only two people who made my mom like come home crying one was Brett Butler and she's like they're from Chris under fire what she was all peeled out of her head yeah the 90s yeah she was - my mom she was the Wardrobe person you might have even if you did one of the galas and I never did the gals cuz I they wanted me to work cleaned they put you in the nasty show that was on my own shows after a while I do my own shows but the the Gallo they were always like you have to be clean like not interested yeah I understand being clean for Canadian TV for no money thanks though with a flipside is the nasty show like just don't market it that way just make make the show you know what they liked it like that was they would go to see it and it would be like the way that the festival would sort of differentiate I don't know I'm not the worst name for a show I guess it just seems like it just seems like like they're little kids in the schoolyard like we know comedians you know they're it's gonna be a raw show dirty people nasty speaking of nasty we are gentlemen today and we have pipes oh yeah because crowder had a router we just start talking steven crowder who's from louder with Crowder's internet show and he has a thing on his internet show we have like a little pipe rack I got trolley would you call the trolleys a pipe rack pipe rack okay I wanted to come up with a better name you wanna cover that her name Lisa so you went to Mister Rogers neighborhood right away so I saw it I said I always wanted to smoke a pipe man I just think they smell good yeah have you know that that's actually from my brother out there that's called a seersucker yeah your brother's a serious pipe he knows more than I do yeah so this isn't this like a seersucker is a type of suit I know that's what they call it oh they called this like all kinds of weird names like Lane one Q is really common it smells actually really it smells really nice and the English blends which he smokes that's we don't do that now super heavy nicotine but like a lot of Kia you get some Parikh it's very smoky like incense he barbecue II I have some done kill done he'll nightcap which'll it'll put you to sleep so how much do you put in the kite so yes no here's the rule so okay we're gonna do is put it up to the brim up to the brim just kind of the brim hack it in there no no don't pack it in yet okay the general rule is the first when you tamp it down with your finger the strength of a child then you fill it again the strength of a woman and you fill it a third time with the strength of a man okay yeah just barely now a little more strength of a woman well what kind of a woman man like a Chris cyborg man like a cyber let's not talk about that because that can go sideways in this show okay woman it's already gone sideways back when I said her name she's like candy man I'm gonna than a man what kind of a man like a Mobe man or like me I'm Sam well not gay Jared just is armwrestling Courtney who's like super CrossFit extraordinaire girl weak well she's really strong she likes going on 265 whoa that's a lot but I think he's gonna smoke her in the armwrestling so why do you think that I hope people can tune in to watch I think he's a man so yeah she thinks he's gonna win - Wow but the bet is like 74 yeah so you tamp that down tamp it okay like what you want us to be a little springy okay a little spring you there yeah a little springy running on Moss proud yes yes exactly okay and then what you do is you light at once and that's what we call the charring light so we're gonna do is you gonna see that already turning me on by the way only to the actual in that Piper it'll ruin the briar let's just meet me at first close we eat in there it'll fuck it up well you won't be able to taste the tobacco from there forward yeah because it'll taste like something around in a circle so I don't want you to do it gosh and then you're gonna see that tobacco kind of raised up so puff it keep puffing on it yeah and then you tamp it down one more time once it goes out and then you light it again okay so it's super involved I know it is it's it's not some one thing it's not something just kind of light and go and it won't last long hold up immediate head rush by the way really don't hail it just puff it do it well how about pot smoker bro well I don't want to heal that there's no filter on that what are you buzzer you well I'm saying that's like you'll get actual chunks of tobacco on your lungs there's no filter that's a big big maybe you will well not me bro probably you toss the mattress over you bro but smell that though that smell nice do I use a lighter can I use a light as long as it's not a jet lighter cuz that'll damage the briar so like I said it's not a I like it I feel like a distinguished gentleman like who's that uh Nigel fronts no no he's not distinguished he's an asshole but he's a lot of fun he's fun to listen to him talk to people I love when you guys had that thing when he was thug life yeah the thug life thing it was laris ruin not gay Jared came over and gave you a lap dance and none of the coin you guys are getting silly yeah we got word that no I don't like that show I don't know how true it is but well you guys are one of the very few I mean you're a conservative guy but I would say you get a bad rap dude you really do yes one of the reasons why I like you is because you are you're a pretty much fact oriented guy when it comes to a lot of issues political issues social issues you don't bullshit and you don't you don't like try to sway things toward one side or the other when it's not accurate well it's not v appreciate that and by the way these you know these probably will go out you have to relight it because it's just kind of an art so but I've had people talk to me about you and they give me this bullshit take on you and I know he's a smart guy I go he's just yeah he's conservative so yeah I know a lot of people that are liberal too and yeah and a lot of people that are in the middle but you can't talk to someone because they shit that and that's it not to kiss Ashley but people out there need to know that Joe has been incredibly fair and very kind mind the scenes you have like because they're you have every reason not to and I think a big reason of it honestly here's a good example the Young Turks and we've seen this transition with Trump or people who are really afraid to speak out now you're seeing that change online because the establishment has been Barack Obama so kids who were raised for eight years under Bush man a bush you know listen to no effects go to the Vans Warped Tour whatever it is and now they've been raised under Obama for eight years and all this political correctness is run amok and they're rejecting that so for the longest time you know I had a small youtube channel and I was on Fox I was kind of muzzled a little bit because I was there and there were certain things I could say or couldn't say on line because it was a youngish at the time as well take you seriously fresh-faced little lad not even that old now 29 yeah you're a young fella well and so what happened is they kind of had their interpretation from whatever the young turks said about me because when i had 50,000 subscribers it was like their day job to go after me and now when I've had Alex Jones and we've been doing proactive parodies of The Young Turks callin amount Aston and debate they will trash talk every conservative not named steven crowder it's like I'm Voldemort my name won't be spoken when I had 50,000 subscribers they would talk about me all the time and they you know a million or two million now that's changed and people are able to come here directly I feel lonely that you're not sorry well give me your lighter the matches are getting annoying yeah thank you so you know I'd like to think but you know there's also the real possibility that people just don't like me because I'm kind of a dick well you can be a dick sometimes but you're a funny dick like you do some funny shit like one of the things he did that was really funny was uh well what was that feminist rally thing that you went to he drives like the recent one where the tranny yeah and I actually interviewed Wendy Davis I don't think you're supposed to say tranny bro yeah I don't really that's why people don't like me sometimes but I think now you're seeing more people say that they don't care I think it's funny when they start making words taboo I really do like people said tranny forever and then all sudden it's like disparaging okay I even noticed in the new bill bird special he said like Oh what are you gonna do you'll fucking marry you know I was like he would have said fag four years ago cuz he did in his special and used the word marry talking about like a sissy isn't like that's not it that's not a word we ever heard him used before Oh bill uses that word yeah that's a Boston word yeah you fucking Mary yeah yeah people call guys Mary's well he's probably he's trying to be a little bit more politically correct you know what I do I use the word but I do it in character I didn't say Nigel said it that was not me I had this joke about tigers in Texas I don't know if you know my my this is a true story from my last Netflix special there are more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in all of the wild of the world in private collections in people's backyards there are more Tigers in Texas than the rest of the fucking planet Earth that is a fact that is a real step because they can have them just a bunch of dentists who carry them back just dude I know people that you know people that have Tigers I know people in Texas whose friends have Tigers they just you can have a type are you aware by the way what's the biggest cat it you probably know this but the biggest predatory cat you know well ligers but it's not they're not viable I can't breathe well I thought the lion at first during tiger weighed so much bigger I learned Jack in the Roman Roman times in the Coliseum this is what can't entirely corroborate us I will say it's been corroborated when you do so the lions and they said the Lions have to be on three points and can paw whereas the Siberian tigers would leverage back and pounce yeah said it wasn't even close not to mention that the Tigers are way bigger but they were able to just go back on their two legs whereas the lion has to have three points of contact which is like a dog even the paw yeah yeah so when I saw it I was like well that's that's something that's pretty incredible because you see a lion I mean you know your dice are the ghost in the darkness that's pretty scary well it's not even close the mountain lion will fuck you up dude like just a small mountain lion at eighty pound mount line yeah fuck you up but a Siberian tiger will fuck you up in ways you couldn't possibly imagine well I have a dog Hopper dog of argentino oh those are big dogs well my Google Sketch - they're not they're not trained him good but they're sketchy well he is he ran for president with Dean Cain and he had like a few hundred votes which I felt bad about cuz it was a gag so who knows if that changed the state of Michigan but by the way if it starts going out you put two fingers over kind of create a slipstream and suck it in and I'll give you probably not now you probably need to relight it it's not like a cigar it's not good to talk and smoke a pipe it's meant to be more contemplative mmm but Bertrand Marcille used to smoke a pipe Nitti was a trainee it was one of the things like he wanted to fly and he would only fly if he could smoke on the plane because he was so addicted to tobacco that he had to constantly smoke there is that's how he would speak but it is it is very relaxing because it's kind of like like jiu-jitsu you set you've used the term moving meditation mm-hmm when you're sitting down there outside at the end of the day if you don't focus on it it's gonna go out it's not like a cigar it's not like a cigarette so you have to sit there and focus on the draw focus on the exhale and all you're thinking about is is the pipe so it really is kind of a contemplative art no you're getting fucked up on tobacco why are you lying man you're lying to people what were you talking about before that Tigers in Texas there's more taller than me dude you're going all over the place run a youtube search on dog argentino mountain lions you will see dog oh argentinos Messing actual mountain lions yeah you know why cuz the mount line once get away it's probably true the mountain lion does want to fight to the death the mountain lion is a predatory animal predatory animals don't necessarily fight to the death it's one of the reasons why dogs are so fucking dangerous because dogs are bred to not feel pain not recognizing that's one of things that about pit bulls they're not the biggest strongest dogs yeah but they're bred to ignore pain and that that that drive to attack and ignore pain makes them very problematic right you just used the word problematic let's let's ban that word smoking a pipe but yeah they are that's what they're bred for they're actually really people oriented because they're bred to be protective of people and hunt with people so they're not bred to fight dogs right so a lot of actually people there was that's what we got Roe hopper he's a rescue out in in Michigan a lot of guys in the inner cities bought them thing and this is like a bigger pit bull they're gonna be great dog fighters they were horrible and they just got abandoned so there's all kinds of dogs out there in Western Michigan I know if there still are I'm wild dog goes well just our dog haha look that looks very much like our done good cute fella they're so big such a big dog well ours is a little bit of a runt he's about 90 pounds because he we found him with a broken leg roaming the streets alopecia a Lyme disease well you rescued him right off the street well no he was rescued in to a lady who specialized in dago's and then we took him from her and he's the most people oriented dog we've ever seen I mean to the point where he'll actually the biggest problem you have is if you stop petting him and you don't know him he'll growl for you to keep petting him so kids are and they're terrified huh well that seems like a Dicky dog yeah a little bit I have a dog called a Regency Mastiff oh yeah those are no joke yeah it's a Neapolitan that's bred with a pitbull so they're about 140 pounds to do with the calf this is great my kids ride him like literally ride him they get on top of him and he'll just watch it again PETA on you for that now they shouldn't be riding he's older now poor poor fella he's like 11 he's got some hip problems he's an walks with a limp well um thank you very Mak you know part of your audience doesn't like it but dude it stands now who don't be a defensive don't say that have you noticed a change kind of a new sort of Trump well culturally I think there's there I know this is sound sounds like a broken record but counterculture why's he have a lot of people who were afraid to even speak up even from the last time I was on the show where they've been called racist sexist homophobic transphobic is the new thing or anyone's going to know it alright fine let's go with that I think if you were to hold the election today Donald Trump would win in a landslide wouldn't even be close just music yeah that's because of how bad the behavior has been from the left all the rest of America I had that my uber driver coming here and she believed every liar name she was a Latino woman why ever talk to drivers about politics oh it always seems to end in a TMZ explain we have a 4.2 rating so I'm right at the threshold of losing my uber privileges are you serious yeah so like you get a rating as a customer yeah you get a rating as a customer what's a good rating of 10 you have a 4.2 no no it's 5 it's out of five oh that's not that bad no it's not that bad well if you go to the floor you're out no yeah you're out so you go like someone could find you right now uber drivers could be like unite yeah I'm blackballed you they could well my friend I can't say his name because it's illegal actually had his concealed carry with him in an uber and he forgot his magazine and that person rated him like a 1 so it took one bad rating to drop his score because he had to call him say hey I think I forgot something in the back of your car what is it like a magazine he's like oh like a People magazine he's like no just look and the guy was just in the phone with him saying what did you do in my car and he just said I was going to the range he wasn't he carries a gun on him everywhere everywhere he goes but um this lady Hoover la she decided to start talking about it talking about the women's March and stuff so I just it's hard for me to say nothing but we ended up on very good terms mister is a different story this is not the message not the magazine story and she talks right now speed or anything do drugs you're very quick that's going quick well into the show I had that some nitro coffee and I came from coffee bean Tea Leaf right or you had that is 270 milligrams caffeine so I probably got about five six hundred milligrams yeah that's that's like two grande Starbucks coffees seriously I think there's a garden in the middle of that go nineties 200 yeah its closing closing in on two Grande's um but she said she's like well Donald Trump called all Mexicans rapists said no she was Donald Trump is gonna ruin gay rights so what I do what what cuz it's because it's just in my nature and as it won't why she was because Donald Trump removed the gay rights thing on the website I said what about the fact that all presidents they remove everything from the previous administration and they put up new a whole new whitehouse.gov website and these people they buy in LA they're in such an insular bubble I don't think they realize there's a whole bunch of people who voted for Donald Trump and I wasn't a fan of him in the primaries but they didn't vote from because they're racist they didn't vote from because I don't want Caitlyn Jenner to take a dump at Trump Towers they didn't vote for him because they hate brown people they voted for him because they're tired of being called all those things and that's why I think you see a lot of these young people who just kind of want to be instigators and provocateurs but at the same time they're appreciating more traditionalism and some of the values their parents try to instill in them because that's kind of more rebellious and going along with the entertainment industry well there's always a sort of longing for nostalgia that people exhibit there's always like back in the good old days like back in the good old days is bullshit because the good old days you died of syphilis the good old days people got fucking plague from rats right there was no good old days this is the good old days right now so there's always that right there's always this longing for nostalgia but I think I think you're right with some people but for sure there's some people that are racist they're voted for Donald Trump just because some people are racist sure yeah of course but to try and paint I mean you look at the numbers a huge percentage of people who voted for Barack Obama had to a voted for Donald Trump particularly in Michigan and Pennsylvania there just aren't the numbers there well don't you think that they probably voted for him a lot of it is for economic reasons because they thought that he's gonna loosen up some regulations encourage industry I think it's the opposite a lot of the Union voters they thought Hillary Clinton was in the pocket of Goldman Sachs right and they thought Donald Trump was his sort of economic protectionism is going to bring jobs back to the Midwest which that's one like encourage industry that's monitoring I disagree with the idea of for example I've been in Michigan the unions have a stranglehold I would rather GM be able to move to Texas or anywhere they want to be competitive in the car market but I can't even get to that because as soon as we don't hold on Donald Trump made a mistake here I disagree with him because then there's a women's March where they're lighting hair on fire and calling him literally Hitler was lighting hair on fire what do you mean at the woman's Marsh girl got her hair lit on fire a girl yeah by some with one of those pussy see you know what man the thing about that stuff is it's always one fucking person or a couple people out of hundreds of thousands that are acting in that mob mentality in a violent shit incorrect oh come on man there's not that many people that do violent shit at those women's marches why there was no arrests no every well there were no arrests the Lansing protests either were they cut down a tent with box cutters there were little Lansing protests when I went right to work that was a big thing where I was there but even the inauguration Pro that was that the one you got punched yeah I did get punched yeah that wasn't so much hilarious that I couldn't punch well I know but when you're not expecting why throw a punch when you don't know how to punch like don't think about everywhere left us gather though whether it's Woodstock back then Woodstock 99 Woodstock by Wall Street violent yes how do you know you there there are reports of rape that's rapes that occurred with a rape rapes or were they like I think back then they were rapists back then Lena Dunham wasn't you know shoving fast-food napkins and her sister's couch claiming she was raped because she saw the condom in a potted plant so what Lena Dunham she claims she was raped because she saw the condom on a plant after she was drunk on muscle relaxers I feel like we always come back to Lena Dunham yeah I didn't know about that story I knew that there was some sort of a gross interaction with her younger sister yeah she was reaching in her in her in her in her vagina but the point is anywhere leftist gather there is always violence there's a giant exaggeration I mean when the woman's born to nail a rat you know violence there was no arrest there was no not a second you say there was no violence but people said there was no violence at all these other marches right with renze again it's like isolated incidents not when you have to look at a trend right I'm not saying everyone okay you've got a million people in LA a million people mark right it's 970,000 peep okay but you have way more than that with the Tea Party which was accused of being racist not one minute there's never way more than that oh yeah you never had a march in LA that had more people than 907 across the country part the first people yeah yeah more people across the country a party that's there's no way yeah hold on a second not a model the day of March when there were hundreds of thousands of people all over the country marching together in one day yeah there was never a movement like that for the Tea Party yes it was a day with the Tea Party the one day the one day at a hundred thousand in Washington DC okay that's less than was in LA right for the women's brought across the country because there were so many like in Dallas there were four or five different ones across Dallas you're the same in the same day come on yeah in the same day no not is how many different cities had a march like that for the Tea Party yeah they were one hundreds of cities hundreds of cities simultaneously in one day and it was bigger than the women's march certainly comparable well not a single incident and they left the place is cleaner than they found them you look at Occupy Wall Street over five hundred crimes including felonies you look at the women's March let's disregard the crime people up there with pussy hats bringing their two-year-old with the most profane disgusting signs you can imagine when leftist congregate it's generally not a peaceful assembly not in the same way as when people who are right-wing congregate look at Berkeley Jake Shields of vegan from Berkeley is becoming a vegetarian sorry vegetarian from Berkeley it's becoming conservative because he just said this was this was the rule not the exception in Berkeley well I know Jake he's a buddy mine and essentially he was saying that these people that were doing what they're claiming they're fighting fascists he's like you're being a fascist do you understand what a fascist means right using violence to enforce your ideology and you're tolerating no deviations from that ideology that that is being a fascist yeah this pipe smoke it blows bro your own takes too much effort but well we had him on the show and he was saying like you know I just it's changed where the left we need to call this out and we need to we need to take ownership over this and we need to we need to squash it because it's coming a real problem it's also a problem when you say the left the left or the right because it's not necessarily just the left it's these fucking idiots that go to these things and put masks on and want to beat people up and mace women I saw that girl with a make make Bitcoin great again hat she had a joke hat and someone hit her over the head with a stick yeah what that was holding up a sign and then another guy Meister you know face I mean and they think that they can inauguration you had people getting pulled out of cars getting punched you know Occupy Wall Street you get people putting bloody rags on tents that they claimed had AIDS I mean anywhere again just go back through history in the last decade it's very different and not saying all left-right we're speaking you have to speak in generalities to save time but as a general rule if you look at the right if you look at for example the Tea Party you look at the movement people who were complaining about the stimulus package you look at people with economic problems with Barack Obama they didn't try it they didn't beat people up in record numbers there was not a single trashcan lid on fire thrown through a window that seems to be a common occurrence at these leftist protests well it is now it is now it certainly is now because I think Howard well it's also these people feel like what Donald Trump represents is the worst possible scenario for the right they feel like he represents this like really arrogant businessman who promotes rape culture and grabbing pussies and you know that's how that's how they're looking at it so like it's time to act like there's some woman who was on Fox News the other who's the one that dude Tucker Tucker Carlson yeah is he a Fox News guy used to be CNN on crossfire right and he had some woman on and she was talking a little Asian yeah yeah and she's a fucking schoolteacher she's talking about beating people up and I was like this is crazy like she's talking about she called my low gianopolous who was a gay Jew by the way she called him homophobic and prefers prefers black men yeah I mean but how do you call a gay guy homophobic just when everyone's a Nazi now I mean I was not for Trump in the primary so I get called a cock right I was like well listen he's the most liberal Republican ever people don't want to talk he's the only Democrat most of his life he's the only president to ever take office being Pro gay marriage when he was sworn in Barack Obama can't even claim that it was the first person that's something that people need to recognize about Hillary Clinton she was anti gay marriage as recently as 2013 she was she was speaking in 2013 and she said I believe that marriage is a bond between a man and a woman in 2013 and she was making arguments too it wasn't like she was put on the spot and well I think she was out there arguing against same-sex marriage so um you know my point here is they're out of power and so they declare everyone or not see you know they declare me and not see they'll declare Milo a Nazi and so if you say hey there it's okay to punch Nazis in the face if Hitler walked in here you'd probably have a tussle with Adolf Hitler but it's acceptable if you make me or even you or Milo equivalent to Hitler and that's what they're doing now and that's the point that I'm making is I think because they behaved so poorly more Americans would would vote screw you with the lever and vote for Donald Trump now than they did end of memory that's highly speculative it is highly strict crowd hence the pipe we can speculate and Paul Riley speculative not sure if I buy it might maybe let me think people are also freaking out they're freaking out about his appointment of a golden Sachs executive they're freaking out over what's happening with that Flynn fellow who was forced to resign because he was coordinating with Russia and you know talking about removing sanctions before they got into office and all that stuff well that was a screw-up but you know I'm not here to defend Donald you'll always screw up we call it treason if I he's a whole new man it is delicious though isn't it it's good it really is guys fuck right now oh really he hit some marijuana after this probably like takes you to the next level but yeah then gets you high as fuck man that's pretty low in nicotine Oh an aromatic like that yeah but I'm a rookie all right you know I don't smoke any smoke a cigar yeah but it's pretty occasional like maybe once a month I'll puff a cigar yeah well yeah there you go you can keep that one no it's already broken in yeah keep this pipe yeah because there's a real break on process with a pipe it's actually you know you have to smoke it really slow when you first get it because the Breyer expands so I know Pierre faggotry different voice fuel faggotry and tranny them I don't know if that's a word transom you let me present this okay you take someone learning Sanders son of a bitch well you're 20 relax drink tea drink I drink you drink wait this man some whiskey let's get some whiskey up in here we need to do it cast is very we need drink drink real booze now what do you wanna talk to Sam I just want to relax a little okay you don't want you to be a human and one of these talking points these aren't talking we've fired up to fucking defend the right and promote your agenda well just cuz I know you said people like they think you're an asshole because your right-wing care what they think people think I'm a fucking meathead well I'm right there are I am in a way very meathead you're strong no well I'm fucking I eat meat I'm a cage fighting commentator I look like a meathead there's a lot of meathead qualities that I possess although I'm the kind of person you are open-minded and more probably more left than I am right if you looked at a giant spectrum I don't think so no no not anymore I just think it's such a narrow path on the Left there's so unaccepting of people that's why you've seen all this blonde very accepting in that way I mean I'm very accepting even of ridiculous ideas I want you to talk about them you know why I just think one of the real problems that I have right now with all these protesters and all these people that are going crazy and calling everybody Nazis is you're stifling communication yeah and you're stifling the market place of Freddy's I don't on real booze bro get out get out some whiskey what's that good even better make it hurt bring out some whiskey bring out that Alex Jones whiskey the stuff that makes you talk about interdimensional child molesters actually stop talking about pizza gate remember there was a big conscious oh you didn't when I had him on here oh really oh yeah Eddie was probably instigating oh yeah Eddie was out of his fucking mind drunk he doesn't know what he did oh my god I don't here we go it may not be true but what do you think about what Breitbart was saying like way back in 2011 about Podesta that Podesta like shields pedophiles and who come on don't be a pussy marketing I think he gave it to me for free fuck off gentlemen Jack Jack Daniels dead yeah I know I enjoy Jack King don't you never had Gentleman Jack have now well because you asked me about it and the first thing where my antenna went up with pizza gate as I said Jane James Oliphant this means I love kids in French and I know where they're trying to get it from it's Jim Lee's off huh that's not James elefantes hmm so right away when it's the print the first I miss that I read is a lie I'm going alright well there was a bunch of weird ones but there was some stuff that was like really odd like the pizza place that had that symbol that is the International fucking symbol for pedophilia and child molesting and Beyonce's in the Illuminati but no this is a symbol that the FBI admits that they use in these secret organizations when they capture pedophiles which they do all the time yeah they use that symbol I mean they agree upon that symbol it says there's a lot of weirdness to it and here's the thing it could be this is my take on it and I don't have a side and I'm not I'm not claiming that I have any knowledge but they're absolutely our pedophile rings they exist they've caught them before they busted him before like Jerry Sandusky's kid just got busted I know yesterday that was the beauty of Michael Jackson the guy was so clever about it think about it he screwed every kid in Hollywood except Macaulay Culkin so he's that canary in the coal mine Macaulay Culkin's no no I got a Neverland Ranch he never touched me that's what I was like - the other kids are coming back they still swear up no I would say it's like if you went if you went to a bachelor party and everybody got their dick sucked and your wife said hey what the fuck Bobby says he got his dick sucked not me I don't know I mean maybe she just didn't like me yeah but Macaulay Culkin has no reason to say that now yes he does really yeah nobody wants to know that you got molested by Michael Jackson you'll never get a girlfriend again we get one hell of a book deal come on you should be about to go down on you and she'll think oh my god Michael Jackson suck this dick oh right don't you think you'll get one of a book deal well you know Andrew Breitbart actually not Breitbart the the trademark Andrew bright part the the name is I mean he was actually I got my start and he wrote about that you know Neverland Ranch his photographer was a pornographer who specialized in European actors who looked underage and so once he talked about this the guy was fired from Neverland Ranch I think it was six months later he was back so my point was like the pizza except is there are things that are provable like that which people can go search Andrew Breitbart and find that story and because people are cocked and loaded to hate someone from the right online cocked well you really do go do a different voice was with net nasty words that was my beavis and butthead voice because of that I'd rather dwell on stories that we know we can prove or calm Terry because it's really easy to go oh router was wrong with pizza gate or whatever it is so we just there's so much there Neil that's right folks that's my issue with Alex Jones yeah Alex Jones goes super deep and I did not know before I had him that he was a Sandy Hook denier and I saw that and it's pretty rough he'd hurt my soul it really did yeah he's um he's been very his son as a fan he's been really really good to me and coming on the show he's done the Young Turks sketches with us I think he's doing less of the conspiracy stuff now it's it's less now get him get him drunk get him drunk and watch it come out well doesn't surprise me alex has been my friend for a long time he's yeah 84% crazy but he's he's he's like it's one of those things where if you chase death there's enough corruption and enough crazy shit in the world that if you chase it down you're gonna find it right it's there but you got to be careful what you call corruption and what you call conspiracies right is there a a fuck ton of them that he's missing the mark like the Sandy Hook thing I mean that that the Sandy Hook thing is so fucked there was a great article that was written about a guy who was a conspiracy theorist until his kid was killed at Sandy Hook right and then realized like holy shit like these people are telling me that my kid didn't die when I realized how dangerous this whole thinking that the government sprang shit in the sky from mind control and the CIA is a mind control organization right I've been told that I'm in the fucking CIA oh yeah they're people think I'm in the Illuminati hmm how do we get in I think two days do you think you could get in or we are you young and you too old are you young rather I have no idea I think you just need to have the all-seeing eye in one of your music videos and you're in like flint that is it you just gotta go like this like JC I think there's easy doing diamonds you say like diamonds or is he like doing a little bit well I didn't realize diamond is also like a black term for a lady's nether regions really I found that in risque songs smell yo dick you hear that song yes yes yeah my smell I was welding I wasn't clown like that he says diamond like that now was this feeling heard I'm like that like that I've heard of white people who were out of touch with black culture that's man was ridiculous welcome welcome to me I didn't know I have to tune to Jamie coz Jamie's on black Twitter everyday Jamie keeps he said totally but I was down a vine must have been rough for you Jamie's got TweetDeck and he sets up one hashtag black Twitter and it's just all blacked such as buzz it's all just black Twitter references and he tells me that like people steal from black Twitter and they make jokes on late-night TV cos yeah subculture yeah black Twitter they say funny shit and then people steal it is that true Jamie is that what you said I heard that's the rumor that is what he heard I've heard that too when did women it's being a witch like black is a subculture right we talk about minority groups I think you need another drink women more whiskey I'll finish that no come on doesn't work on me yet see you weren't any Illuminati you're treating my man like that see time is a stripper this whole thing up dude see you're spreading disinformation that's not how a bitch get her ice wall up that's just lazy song let's get her i swell up yes he's promoting violence against women because she'll just smell his dick she beats the hell out of her but that's not my fault song they didn't even introduce the character Diamond beforehand how am I supposed to know we can't know that's not a racism thing that's a bad song okay if he said I ain't even feel in Mercedes like that would you assume okay Mercedes is probably a stripper lapses to the main stage probably but I know I didn't read the lyrics so I didn't see a capital on Diamond I can't know this hmm I was trying to be understanding of another culture and it backfired I'm gonna be then yeah why doesn't he just wash his dick automatic hand cleaner doesn't he have hand sanitizer he keeps in his fucking Benz just spray thieves essential oil at your dick bro dirty bitch coming home with a dirty dick Jesus that's like worse than adultery on your wife dirty start that's not as why for sure first of all that can be not married this is not a marriage we're talking about this nothing oh look at this more booze bring it out both bring them both out this guy needs to get drunk talks too much shit you want to talk about everything okay life generally okay let's say this generally I've never been as mad as I was watching that Holly Holm fight why because of the here's what I think I think if you hit someone after the bell and it's really clear it should be an immediate point deduction and they should be given time to recover more than a minute that's just an opinion why you twice I agree with you but here's why I disagree with you I'm even more extreme I think that hitting someone after the bell is grounds for a disqualification yeah because you know you know you know you know BAM you know go down your whole mindset changes you're not expecting it she definitely heard the Bell the guy was stepping in she threw the shots it's grounds for disqualification you know I fought you know it's been a long time but I did and I heard bells and I didn't hit anybody afterwards you know what the fuck it is you know what it is well if you do the point deduction Holly wins that fight or a draw for sure Jemaine Duran to me is fucking awesome she's an awesome fighter I mean she's a 46 and Oh 10 time world Muay Thai champion and for that to happen with her it upsets me in in two ways one it upsets me because Holly got fouled and two it upsets me because she's a great fighter right for her to do something like that I was like why did you do that don't do that yeah and she rocked Holly the problem is when you rock someone who knows how much that affects them for the rest of the fight right Holly is so badass she not only came back from that she came back from that one up head kicking Germain wrapping her and then rocking her little hook that we first yeah yeah was it a straight left I thought was like a hook with gnarly rocked her yeah straight limbs a straight left that she was coming in was just really short then perfect shot yeah well she's incredible she's so badass and that question mark kick did she hit it with over the top of the shoulder drops down and hits her in the head isn't it funny though that she doesn't she doesn't fight like a boxer in the Octagon at all she fights much more like an American kickboxer well because she was also an American kickboxer and she's also trained by Mike Winkeljohn who like one of the best American kick boxers from his era yeah he was world-class in his time he's really good when he fought he fought Ric Rufus right he fought some really good guys he's a great striking coach man very similar to him you know when I'm in Dallas guy Mezger a very similar style to that kind of standard yeah not as much head movement yeah I met scores of a good friend of mine I love that guy he's really just an awesome guy won't get into personal stories but he's been he's done I know there's some really nice things for people and he's a really he's the exact example of when people say fighters are meatheads you just a really kind-hearted guy well he's definitely not a meathead I'm more of a meathead than him for sure he's uh he's not just a kind-hearted guy he's very intelligent soft-spoken you never hear guy Metzger yelling at people and he's he's also you know he's I worked really hard to mitigate some of his brain trauma and been really open about it you know I think is very very very important because it's like this silent thing that guys don't want to talk about the issues that they're dealing with from fighting yeah well um he also did you hear the story about when he got into the fight in a parking lot was like a bunch of guys who jumped him yeah well how long just one that long ago no you're probably thinking the one where the guy had a knife and actually stabbed him in the yes cuz he got in between an altercation between him you just don't do that stay home no this was something maybe he may not want me to tell the story but it was in a parking lot something happened I don't know how it started but what happened was there were three or four guys and all he did was he grabbed one guy just got him to the ground somehow and put him in a chokehold and he told his friend he said if you come forward I'm gonna choke your friend out and they just got back into the rav4 closed the doors he let the guy go they were gone that's a really nice person mostly was well he also he's a striker he could have really hurt him yeah that's kind of the beauty of grappling you can hurt them or not as much as you want to right my master is a very high level striker I mean he's not known as a grappler so that's well he's a grappler too he choked out Tito Ortiz and there's one of his first ufc's he just won worlds at brown in the senior division did you really yeah McGee that's amazing yeah he's still competing and doing that stuff that's pretty awesome guys that's a nice thing for people that don't want to strike anymore I know babalu Sobral he's been doing a lot of grappling competitions yeah if you know guys that just have like taken a lot of head trauma a lot of crazy fights long careers you know they still like to compete they can do that and you know and babalu has I think it's Baba lose iron gym I think that's what he calls it and he's got a really nice high level gym down in Orange County and you know that's an explanation every time parents taking their kids for lessons they walk in and see babalu high but they have to do that that kind of all right let me his neck yeah yeah parents are gonna be a little apprehensive great guy he's a great guy and he's a real pioneer babalu was in the early early days of fighting you see there's a fight with him and Brad colder it's one of the fucking scariest knockouts ever cuz its back when you can soccer kick on the ground yeah and he dropped Brad koltes babalu was one of the first Brazilian wrestlers mm-hmm which a lot of people don't know I mean he was a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and very good striker and all those things but yeah he also was on the Brazilian national wrestling team back in the day yeah and so Brad Kohler who was like this really beefed up fuckin just Jack dude could couldn't touch him on the feet and bablu eventually got him tired out and when he dropped him got him down to the ground fucking soccer kicked him into a Bolivian it was just those days when you can when you could soccer kick someone who was already tired and down yes sir those are dark play to put into context the Brazilian national wrestling team they'd be like ventures to Oklahoma State wrestlers it's just not even the same level maybe but a high level wrestlers a high level road yeah it is but it's like Sara McMann you know she was silver at the Olympics never when people said she was gonna beat Ronda with the wrestling like my aunts like in the talent pool and women's wrestling is nowhere near where it is a judo at that point you just have women in Japan and judo who are thermals Kayla Harrison to moon following her she was actually one of the first guests on her show she just a monster yeah there's no one in female wrestling no one who would even come close to her level of experience the same can be said about Brazilian jiu-jitsu you know Brazilian jiu-jitsu which isn't in the Olympics yet but really should be is there's some phenomenal like you've seen McKenzie Dern you've seen her compete in MMA I haven't well yeah she has what's the most badass choke outs that I've ever seen in my life she started with an omoplata work this girl's back she's got this move that she does well she gets a girl in Roma Plata and she rolls over onto her back and chokes this chick out apparently she hits this move all the time well they teach something similar to that at marcelo garcia school in new york where if ever someone's turtling you wedge your knee into their ribs and their hip crease and you kind of get around it not quite an omoplata but you're bringing your other leg around their front and you're wrapping and you're blocking if let's say coming in from your right side you blocked their left arm which is something we actually would learn in judo quite a bit a really basic back so you've lat you broke blockage by taking and under so you're grabbing in and you're gonna have and wrist control around so you're not putting a hook in and when you control this the way they taught it to me like if you watch marcelo garcia they'll just go for the choke straight from there they don't even need to get their hooks in right and you know then you have Clark Gracie you does the omoplata roll to the lapel choke I mean it really is omoplata is I don't think there's been a submission from that in a long time but well there's only ever in the UFC history then Saunders this is McKenzie Dern watch how she does this is also is that she's hot as fuck and so she she gets the she gets the omoplata to the girl tries to roll now watch how she handles this when she gets her from this position no no no you got to go back it's just a highlight video so she doesn't she doesn't need the hook no so what she does is she rolls and yeah you don't see it from that position well that's a lot like a noogie version of Clark Gracie's omoplata lapel tree let me see if they show it here what she does is she gets up and when she gets up on her hip she the girl rolls and then watch how she scrambles now she takes her right um they don't show it she takes her right arm and she rolls underneath the girl yeah anyway you know her dad is megaton Diaz who's world famous ya know very very respected Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt but there's one of the coolest things about jiu-jitsu is it's like almost like sentences and languages there's so many different ways you can go with things yeah there's so many different possibilities it's just it's almost never-ending well there's a guy like my dad you know it's in his 50s and hasn't lost a point let alone around competing up to purple belt and he competes against guys who were 40 and openweight cuz there's no one his age and you know played hockey U of M high high level athlete and he's not super flexible he's not gonna do a guard game he got really good at takedowns really good at trips really good at guard passing and side control a few chokes you know paper cutter chew things like that and he's he's diverse enough where he can protect himself in areas but that's one thing too you know when I was helping coach him for his first tournament listen in training you want to work these positions you know you want to work your guard you want to Warcraft guard but there's nothing that says in the competition you can't stuff the head get up and just come up on top and when you realize that when he competes it's just getting out getting on top and if he gets on top he's gonna pass you know what his level at a purple belt level the problem with that strategy is it only works with someone who's weaker than you like as soon as you find someone who's better at that game than you you have to have other options well if he's not good off of his back someone's eventually gonna put him eyes but he's pretty good in his back that's good but in a tournament the point is there's no unwritten agreement where we're working passing no I mean so he can try his you know scissor sweep which is a big thing for him as a strong guy and if it doesn't work he can do a technical standout and come up well house and Gracie has the best description of jiu-jitsu he said you do this then I do that then you do this then I do that forever yeah I love that because it's like once if you tried you just so you go yeah that is what it is until someone taps like you like Hicks and Gracie's always been famous for saying about other other athletes other competitors that if they can't keep the rhythm there will lose my really amazing meaning not like George same here but like meaning that he keeps keeps attacking and you keep defending and keep attacking eventually you're gonna slip up right he's gonna get a dominant position sure and then once from there I'm not saying he's world-class I'm just saying he's able to learn a game I know you want to brag about your dad thank you gentlemen Jack I guess something oh no that's normal Jack this is regular Jack hmm yeah what is this tough call this is a natural shit that's how you sell it if they were sponsored they were natural sponsor you be getting phone calls yes Sinatra shit and our PR representatives have a problem with that well then they wouldn't be a sponsor anymore nobody cares anymore man this people have to realize is the age shit you can say it you know it's actually a great whiskey that has world is Wild Turkey one-on-one that stuff's disgusting no no no no no we have some you want some no I'm good pussy but while turkey 101 is a fantastic drink it really is it's like Jim Beam advertises aged for years well while turkey 101 is eight years off the bat why is it better to be old why is it better for whiskey to be aged look what we've been saving this tastes like shit just be honest it always like shit no oh if the Rye you want it younger with a bourbon you want that you want more of that char kind of flavor in there it's a good it's a good whiskey the best whiskey can't fuck with kool-aid kool-aid tastes better than the best whiskey kool-aid what are you doing with Sinatra shit I like the pain I like feeling I like the suffering I like the suffering that comes with Jack Daniels that's what I like real like when you shoot that shot down ego you you know exactly what you just did you're not playing any stupid you know any poison like I'm here to enlighten myself I'm here just spread love and karma I know what people do what with horchata what's not with horchata is a Mexican drink I'm thinking rum chata yeah rum chata so chad has some shit we get with you get tacos in an authentic joint I was thinking rum chata I miss what's rum cha don't even know what that is they sell it's like horchata but alcoholic and they saw a white bottle and it's already pre-made and it's just got the spices and whatever the dairy filler is it's like a good thing to make terrible decisions on well not gay Jared loves it so it fits in perfectly well he loves wrong cohost not give do so fuck is not gay Jared he's my producer on my show um so you after this election I'm where where do you line up now where are you because beforehand you were kind of I mean you saw the black lives matter thing and he talked about I'm more libertarian than anything so did you but I'm Gary Johnson I did but only because he did my podcast oh really yeah I'm like you do my podcast I'll vote for you for president its deal's a deal pretty smart pot and doing your podcast she should have got him high right no we talked pretty sensibly I liked Gary as human and then I think he's good guy and I think that um the Aleppo thing sunk that fucking boat like a goddamn torpedo when he didn't know what a left like okay here's the thing plays good pool most people don't know about Aleppo when that happened every there was a spike in Google searches for Aleppo I know he doesn't know what Aleppo is no I didn't know I didn't know about Aleppo I knew that Syria was in a terrible terrible situation and I knew the Syrian refugees that are flings I knew the bombings I knew I didn't know the name of the city the problem is you know he got caught not knowing the name of the city and he should have known the name of the city like if you ask me you know you know how do you think Matt Hume handles mighty Mouse's career I'd be like who Fox man Hume if I said that I shouldn't be doing mmm commentator you ever again but yeah I'm an Eman I'm a mixed martial arts commentator that is part of my job if you're running for president it's part of your job though the name of the city you know so the worst when you try to cover it up like Africa's what is Aleppo yes yes got it got it he's at twice buying some time she said you know what I don't really know but I'm a libertarian so it wouldn't even be in Aleppo so what does it matter yeah but see I don't buy that either man once you've entangled yourself in the world of politics foreign politics and international politics the idea that you're not gonna be there anymore well we've found out what happens with that in Iraq we found out what happens with that in Libya you create a vacuum and that vacuum is filled by terrible terrible people well particularly when you give them a timetable of when you're gonna pull out yeah you know and everyone on the right was saying won't listen that's that's a mistake no no this is gonna work well trust me but in his defense what the fuck else do you do I mean do you stay there stay there and and if you keep putting in there it's not gonna light at least an hour well afterward I'll show you how to get it done really round we're already doing it like a man my starter farkleberry well you're gonna suffocate the flame yeah modern technology well here is something that I that I do think we've seen afterwards again I wasn't a big Trump supporter with that you want to go back tone you did say we can but I think just talk to jets I mean we talk politics let's talk Jack Daniels with Bernie Sanders or whoever it is you can't line up with the black lives matter you all the time you can't line up with the pussy hat economics the women's March all the time you can't line up with the anti-free speech protestors campus all the time he can't line up with the people online who want to ban voices of dissent all the time he can't line up with we want to tax the wealthy can you line up well the point is people like Bernie or Hillary when they do that until you realize hold on a second there's a line and I've lined up with everyone except for the rest of America and you see that in Los Angeles it's an insulated bubble people don't realize you know what they're a lot of keeps or New York whatever in the coding cities won't you relax didn't you didn't go to Colorado on point cuz you hated it no I wanted to live I D I do not like the population I do love the mountains right I got a straight off the mountain t-shirt on hoyt archery dot-com yeah they could be in Washington no fucking bow hunter on that thing I think that chickens yes right yeah I don't live in Los Angeles right I live outside of Los Angeles yeah I have several locations in which I sleep I think I think that there's there's a real problem with high population areas and that problem is there's two things one there's a diffusion of responsibility there's too many people you just feel like you don't they don't value you don't value each other because there's too many there's everyone's there if you see an accident you don't pull over to try to help because there's a hundred thousand people on the highway you just keep going yeah if you saw that same accident on a single or a Lane Road in the country and you know some cops worried you might pull over and help you know you might like New Yorkers care about each other I got you walk past the hobo in the street in New York for a lot of people they just ignore it cuz they're so used to it they did after 9/11 they did after 9/11 you know I went to New York after 9/11 we filmed a fear factor there and I'll tell you man it was a beautiful thing because there was there was a real palpable like a tangible feeling of community there that doesn't exist there anymore no it's gone also the New York that existed in 2001 is not the New York that he is here in 2016 no you know I've had some for like Judah Friedlander who's a friend of mine is a stand-up comic in series and he was telling me he's like dude it's all bankers now he's like there's no artists in New York anymore they can't afford it he's like if you you go to Brooklyn maybe well he's like what in New York City the rents are so fucking expensive and there's so much international money in New York it's like I can tell you that's flipped a little bit haven't when I they're the lowest New York City I live there when I was with Fox 4 well there are two different stints one time sleeping on couches and one time this would have been 2011 maybe 2011 2012 and rent was cheaper in old money Upper East Side than an East Village or Lower East Side because that's where all the hipsters and the artists were so they all wanted to be there now and the Upper East Side was seen as not cool so I got a place that was so inexpensive compared to if I wanted to live down you know downtown so that's kind of switched hmm but no one know the artists want to live with all the wasps this is always a problem when too many people have too much money and they're all congregated in one area because then they're just annoying it's annoying they're all trying to buy the same fucking Carson we're Bertrand Russell surf and pipes and stomp on a little man I am yeah I think you're right and I think I think it also I mean there's obviously this is where leftist tend to Congress ideology in big cities right they want you on public transportation they want you to do that and they want you riding bikes bro no they want you well bikes public trans public transport but certainly they want to limit what kind of cards you can drive how far you can drive them you mean any big city they definitely wanna reduce independence and there's a real I think that's what it really is no they want to reduce carbon emissions I don't want to reduce independence no I think I think it's both say that people want you on buses and dependent on government just like they want well the transit people don't maybe some percentage of the people do but if Tesla came out with some car that you could drive across the country on one charge you think people would be suppressing that they would welcome it a zero emissions car that you give you total freedom no one's gonna try to suppress that yeah the issue is is wasn't anyone I don't think so how and why they would do is remove all the government subsidies that make Tesla even remotely competitor who is they this they shit I'm not crazy I'm talking about the United States government in the subsidies that go into a Tesla right Prius could still be losing Toyota on everyone sold but you look at the government subsidies the government incentives to people don't want to buy these cars oh that's not your Tesla yeah but not a Prius that's not true either I know a bunch of people bought praises my premise is a Prius Brendan Schaub as a Prius my buddies have pretty sure he's got a fuckin Priya hasn't even fit in a Prius in a Bentley well there you can't barely fucking big gorilla he barely fits in a Prius I would say those things handle like trash their shit cars bill burr has a Prius how about that in a Jaguar it's the white guilt symbol in Los Angeles you can say I got a Prius knowledge of the car really say that but it's people that don't want to spend a lot of money on gas they borrow a lot of them bottom in 2008 here's well you don't want to spend a lot of money on gas you would do the cost savings estimation you would see buying a used car any used car especially a Ford Fiesta which would get more mileage in a Prius anyway it's a white guilt sim um no it doesn't it does there are no Fiesta give more money or American small cars it will get over 40 miles per gallon yeah but a priest gets over 50 no pull it up Jamie its motherfuckers right let me say let's say it's an eighth mileage difference yeah but that's not why you why you know what an old car is gonna break down you want a new car that's a reliable that gets really really shouldn't even house with a Prius way that's a fucking no seriously you don't that's gonna beat are straight into your lungs if you inhale I'm switching the weed you drive me crazy so much better well back to the well there you go alright so what's that a Prius is Ford Fiesta alright so 40 Highway 29 City Sun 40 Highway now pull up Priya's gonna have way more in a city because there was a battery work you because it's better son of a bitch you have a Prius your point sucks no no that wasn't the point though that was a that was a side no you're trying to say that if you really wanted to save money on gas you'd get a fucking shitty old Ford Fiesta and that's here's the truth you're wrong no no no miles per gallon you are incorrect if you look at the actual price of a Prius versus the best thing you can do for the environment is buy an old beater car buy an old Camaro this is poorly who said that it's $24,000 it's cheap as fuck for a car No you'd be better off buying an old beater car recycle than buying a Prius listen it's not even close big Euler your heels you don't see the other side you know you like everybody helps them try to giant non-recyclable batteries take your heels your giant non recyclable non recyclable for now but much like nuclear waste it's making a comeback you know that they can make diamonds batteries out of diamonds with nuclear waste now the last thousands of years yeah but why do we want diamonds oh they make batteries out of diamonds yeah the nuclear waste nuclear diamond waste batteries there's not thousands of years nuclear energy that we could be using but we can't be using because people thought it was worse for the environment wow it's we're using it whether people thought it was worse or not the real issue is like the old plants like Fukushima that they have huge difficulties with shutting down someone told Mishima is not you know we're talking about the other day that someone had said that the radiation levels are growing they're saying it's not growing that the real issue is uh aerosol or something that's the old global warming but not aerosols what was the airborne airborne radiation is an issue with Fukushima that they're monitoring it yeah it doesn't surprise me but you know my point on that one is why wire left us for example against the sharing economy why would Bernie Sanders just abandon the okay why is Bernie socialist Sanders against the sharing economy you can't you give him a nickname yeah you son-of-a-bitch of socialist yourself about European socialist why would they be against the sharing one a thousand dollars a year let's let's let's stand around what you telling me no I want you bring up your fucking dog again what about your dad is a Jitsu guy you said you would not talk about politics appendages say I don't want to talk no Jamie uber and airbnb shouldn't everyone be on board with that why do you have people like Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi banning them or poor Austin politicians and constituents banning them from their city if we're talking about sharing do socialism yeah you can't do Ober in Austin Bernie Sanders doesn't want to over know why they're being why do you think they're doing that do you think they're doing that because they want taxis to survive I think they're doing it because just like people like to throw out this big conspiracy about big bankers and their own self-interest which is true I think that people don't want to acknowledge that the left is beholden to giant cabby unions who are punching people in the face in New York because eibar removes their surcharge and decides to ignore the Trump travel ban I think they're against Airbnb because they're beholden to for example the culinary Union whom I usually meet him in the side about the Trump travel ban we're talking about that was people were protesting an uber in New York City right he went in and they were still going to the airport the cabbies unions in New York said we're not gonna go and so people were punching over drivers people getting furious about it saying you're scabs you're coming in goober actually removed their surcharge because remember all the airport protests right it was a quagmire I don't I don't oh yeah during the airport murder the Trump's travel ban there are protests at all these different airports right about that yeah what does that have to do with uber the point is in New York cabbies unions went on strike they said against the travel ban right Oh supers going in weren't clear and they're moving their surcharge well if we're talking about the sharing economy if we're talking about bringing in refugees and resettling them against people's will right because we want to be compassionate right well just take that and say okay instead of resettling refugees against somebody's will because you want to share what about somebody deciding to share their car at an agreed upon service or share their house and the the left the political left has fought against that vehemently it is remarkably inconsistent proverb and who is this they okay so borders Pelosi Elizabeth Warren what they want to do is either get uber banned in cities as you see in cities like Austin or in cities in Europe or they want to make sure that unions that cab unions either get first right or that uber hires these union workers okay well I have a hit I definitely am an issue with that yeah so let's pull up that pull up that story that Bernie Sanders is in favor of banning uber Bernie Sanders uber and let's let's break that down and unpack it because I think when something comes along that's better and it fucks with a business that is worse right the better thing should win because that's progress sure I think uber is progress I think lyft is progress I think what lyft is doing and what these these programs are doing where you have an application on your phone you can turn it on and off anytime you want you can work any time you want as long as they certify and test you and run and make sure you're not a crazy person as long as they know where you are at every time they can actually monitor your location through GPS which they can and everybody like saves money and the people who drive the car make money like you can make like thirty five bucks an hour doing that well wouldn't you rather do that if you have a car like a Prius that gets 50 fuckin eight miles to the gallon wouldn't you rather do that so I'm in favor 100% in progress and I think that anybody that opposes that because somehow or another it's going to challenge other people's jobs right when it comes to something like uber versus cab in my opinion this is pretty black and white this is a new technology a disruptive technology that benefits a lot of individual users hence it's good what also benefits the middle class more than anybody and there's no union for uber drivers there's no lobbying and there's no money that goes to politicians well that's the big problem so I'm not aware of this you're more balls-deep in politics than I am so let's Jamie's gonna pull up a story and we're gonna figure out what the fuck is wrong with Bernie Sanders take on it from an individual point of view yeah or you can look up I mean you can you look up european cities that have banded or auslan let's say I know it was a huge issue in London I remember watching those cab drivers that had decided to block streets they decided to shut their cars off in the middle of street and literally stop cars from passing people had to go way around them and it was a huge issue the reason the term political left and right matters right now to me anyway may not matter to some people but the reason it matters to me is because you do look at one side of the political spectrum right now and I think the lines been pretty clear in this last election where there's an ideological divide and where one is deliberately looking at marginalizing and targeting and dividing victimized groups and they do so and ignore other groups of people who are victimized as a result of them complaining about victimization okay like what this is that's very vague so okay so I give you you want a concrete example let's find this with Bernie Sanders James guys like then what he I find I find a quote about what he had problems serious problems with it serious problems with popular mobile ride-hailing service uber speaking with Bloomberg the Democratic presidential candidate contender rather called the service unregulated wait into one of the most closely watched economic debates of the 2016 race workers on demand at on-demand economy companies like uber Airbnb or lyft are considered independent contractors and therefore do not receive the benefits and protections afforded to full-time employees okay so I could see that but they do make more money right is that correct yeah well they don't they don't have to pay a huge Commission to the cabbies union and they're totally independent and they have their own car and they make more money I mean is that true maybe let's make sure that that is true it doesn't matter what room but let's just have the choice - delicious Google uber drivers make more than car companies versus how much uber makes from their drivers because that's the real issue like say lubbers a company okay and they're pimping out all these drivers and they're making shit tons of money and then they're not given the drivers enough yeah they're given the certain emotions I think they take a much smaller Commission on it than the cab drivers I reiterate I'm Pro uber 100% I have a friend of mine is actually a bigwig at uber I think it's great I think even if I wasn't what's mad at this how Oberer fails to prove its drivers more than let's be able to prove what does that mean I don't know there's a claim and Huffington Post can't disprove it but they're saying uber has failed to prove it so this isn't gonna calm that crowd or read the fucking crazy and defend your slow right wing I am very right-wing hand me that beer son time calm Oh Reuben reveals how much this drivers really earned sort of uber has long said that drivers get paid more than traditional cabbies but do they really drive or surveys strikes and class-action lawsuits suggest otherwise most recently BuzzFeed is that okay is it okay if it's but is that too left-wing you fuck yeah BuzzFeed is fake news I mean you're fast estimation by speed you fake estimate that terrible trauma depression the drivers in Denver Detroit in Houston make less than thirteen point two five cents an hour $13 25 cents an hour after expenses using calculations based on more than a million well that's not good this spring uber was hit with Q's class-action lawsuits from drivers in Florida and Illinois who seek to recover unpaid overtime wages and other expenses this is after the company this is our thing - shitty no we have one shitty TV that can't handle an HDMI cable it cuts out every minute now we have one of those who seek to recover unpaid overtime Jesus Christ unpaid overtime wages and other expenses this is after the company paid 100 million dollars to settle similar lawsuits in California and Massachusetts okay yeah California Massachusetts big unions if they have lawsuits and if there is a law suit that does make sense enough where a judge decides that they they're gonna rule against uber yeah but this I mean I don't know the law do you do you know if it depends on a right-to-work state but wouldn't you assume that the lawyers and the the judges in Massachusetts would make a strong enough case where they would show the legality of it to the point where it wouldn't lose $100 100 million dollar lawsuit no I wouldn't assume do you know anything about the lawsuit why here's what I would know whether it's a right-to-work state or not and that would determine the lawsuit and that's why people like Bernie Sanders and that's why people oh jeez what happened there you open that too fast just go do it I got scared it's good enough and bro so what depending if it's a right-to-work state or not I don't care right okay they make less than cab drivers I don't care well let's salute illuminate people what is the difference you know right-to-work state in fact it means you don't have to join a union means you can work without being a part of the rubber Union it's just for example that's when we do hidden-camera videos we have to make sure that it's a - about one-party consent state as opposed to a two-party consent state right like Nevada when they used to do those prank call shows they would do like remember Crank Yankers yeah yeah they would do it in Nevada right because because for Nia is a one-party consent state no it's - well Nevada nursing for Nia's one what do you mean California when I dens in a definition wrong and I'm thinking as we both have to agree is that true yeah they would do it Nevada instead of California right that's what I'm saying Yeah right Nevada you only like you can call me up and prank me and I'm doing I wouldn't have to agree right that might have changed it might change for example in Michigan it was really controversial it was a one-party consent state that depending on the judge read as a two-party consent state so that's really scary because you can be in the clear right we recorded a prank call or we found some kind of corruption and it should be legal but there's a little wiggle room where they can say actually this isn't legal and you committed a felony oh okay so in these right-to-work states yeah when you have this uber situation is the issue that it's taking cabs out of business or is the issue that they are not paying people enough and they're taking cabs out of business so people like their cab drivers if they switched over to becoming Ebor drivers they would actually lose money because these companies aren't regulated so they don't have to pay insurance health insurance I mean that seems like what the issue is right that's what they would say the issues are so not true well no it's not necessarily true and again that depends in the state so first off I would want to clarify this people listening would not be the right-to-work states the right-to-work states would be fine right right-to-work state means I have the right to say hey do you want to work for this amount and you have the right to say yes non right too long it's above minimum wage everybody's cool yeah as long as I mean as cool as you can be right yeah and what is a non right-to-work stage is when profession if there's an established union in that profession you can't work outside of that Union right that's is that the case with trades like like plumbing being a carpenter general auto repair yeah generally speaking auto repair do they have a union it depends on the state it depends on the state but she'll Sonnen actually would have some stories about his dad being in the plumbers Union he has some stories about that Vince Vaughn had some funny stories about that he's told actually when he worked at his dad's like paper mill but but to go back to it again first off I don't care someone agrees to this price and this service I believe that's a marketplace of ideas and services and even the ring to do it and I have the right to provide those services now if Ober is doing a poor job thank god there's lyft right because there's some competition there but if the government steps in and says no you have to use the cabbies unions well even then you can artificially increase wages at the expense of the taxpayer who now has to pay more for a taxi ride so I don't care I think that people should be able to make their own decisions if they want to do uber if they want to rent out their house an Airbnb and I don't think that Nancy Pelosi in the Bay Area representing her district should have any say and whether I can rent well I agree with you 100% on that and I think there's also a real problem people resisting change because technologically influence change is coming at such a high rate there's no way you can put a finger and all the holes in the dam it's just you can't do it yeah there's too many things that are happening they're gonna change the way we communicate change the way we do business change everything from top to bottom you're not gonna be able to stop it so any any time you're trying to stop something like an uber the only thing that I think is that who you got to figure out where is the house the money being distributed is that fair and if it's not fair what's the what's the solution because it's a solution alert people to what the actual numbers are and let it all sort itself out or is it passing regulation I am a firm believer that the less regulation you have the better right and that's what as long as it's not like environmental pollution type shit invisible hand right the mark that moves the market I certainly believe that the market is more efficient at regulating itself than the government creating a monopoly well also because unions can be influenced and when you get large groups of people together I think it's good because like what a union can do is they can say you know hey we're gonna stand strong when I let these people take advantage of us like some sort of slave labor Factory in the Middle East or wherever the fuck it is we're gonna we're gonna figure out a way to McCann if you work here you're gonna get an honest wage and I'm a hundred percent with that problem is that you get giant groups of people that you can't go against someone's gonna be in control of those giant that and that's no different than being the mayor of a city or the leader of a country no different than being beholden to goldman sachs or JP Morgan right and if you look at the top political donors you can bring it up on from open secrets if you look at the top 20 it's like 16 out of the top 20 are big unions so this idea that it's big banks and the Koch brothers and energy companies no one wields more influence in American politics today than big unions particularly cuz mystic party because its power and because they can influence the people that also take dues from you give it a hundred percent Democrats you have no say well it's one of the big contributors to the war against drugs one of the big things is happening in this country is the prison guard unions have spent money to ensure that innocuous things like marijuana or they stay illegal because if they stay illegal then they keep their jobs like they've literally fought for that like fought to keep more people in cages because that would earn them more money I mean that's really what it is we break it down to black and white and it's did you just make a joke about the discriminatory prison system in the United States that was cold I didn't say black and white because I met black and white people I meant could be black and whites matters the reality of the situation is that prison guard unions are spending money and using their influence to ensure it didn't work as an influence influence and like from South Anchorage to ensure that marijuana stays illegal and the reason why they're doing that is cuz they profit off of it so that's not an altruistic ideal that's not some runners cares about the people that they represent that's not someone who cares about the community as a whole that's someone who's looking out for their best interests in a way that is negative right towards the general population with you and I think that's where the wool was pulled over people's eyes with people like Bernie well he's from the people he's never gotten big donors that's actually not true if you look at the collective donations from union members and from union organizations and when you look at that and what bothers me is when people follow the money trail and only one side and act as though the political left is unbeaten two people that's the big point what you just said on one side because I think you can see the benefits and unions as well you can see the benefits in protecting wages and making sure that people get insurance and making sure that people live a good life that like if you're going to work for this company you're going to be well compensated and you're gonna there's gonna be an agreement between the workers and the people that run the company well so the problem with that and the problem with this is but there's not always a problem with that there is occasionally sometimes know there's that that's the rule rather than the exception I talked about this what the Walmart CEO for example makes 19 million right people are freest about that well Walmart employees 2.5 million people 1.5 million people full-time so yeah that he's getting less and then well if you add up all all the workers not the full-time workers would be less than $10 per person he's employed providing an active living so when you have workers who say well he has 19 million that's more than I have I have no million 19 is 19 more millions these people who pick an arbitrary number that's what Bernie Sanders are doing the debate was Ted Cruz whether you like him or not it was such a floor mopping because Bernie Sanders dealt with these phantom fears and again tried to victimize groups and marginalized groups in my point that I was talking about there is for example we talked about the victimized groups the marginalized groups who don't have insurance in the country right it was 40-something thousand most of them were young people who chose not to buy insurance so now you can stand your parent's insurance until 26 there you go we bought some votes but you talk about them and they're getting more affordable insurance now and now the play is we're gonna take all these people off of insurance okay so we're talking about that victimized group people who didn't buy insurance but what about the people who've seen their premiums go up hardworking Americans 40-something percent twenty four percent on average in certain states 46 percent sometimes sixty something percent their premiums have gone up why don't we talk about the ramifications of the everyday Americans who now can no longer afford health care insurance and don't qualify for a government subsidy and if you look at the trend I will argue this and I'll dig my heels and if I feel I have to the political left seeks to divide and conquer and find for sure the most victimized group of that day well how so what do you mean the most most victimized group with that day to do what well I think well like right now for example I'm just using that as an example because you said a concrete example with Obamacare so right now it's these people aren't going to be able to afford insurance well let's not go too far away from unions okay we're way out into the Obamacare pool well no because deep and long no it's not it's really not Obama cares you subsidize health care subs cost other taxpayers right who couldn't afford it and no they can't afford let's let's start from the beginning cuz you went way out there and you started out with the CEO I went out there named Alex Joe and I went out you went out there in terms of you covered so many different things before anybody could address either one okay you have to like slow down and like take it point by point you wanna you said this guy makes so much money that if everybody gave him ten bucks like why should they give him ten bucks here's the thing like what is this guy doing GLE big letters lawyer of people in moment what he's just a guy who works for them he doesn't even own it why is this guy makes so much money I'm not saying he should I'm not saying he shouldn't maybe he should make that much money right but why defend that why defend that why not well I got him see that's like that's like you say can I get a raise and they say no and you go away that guy makes 15 fucking million dollars a year and it doesn't even work what does he do is there a lot of punch that's what you just said there are a lot of assumptions he doesn't work why does that guy make that much how much the guy who sees this the factory this guy's right have a real job that much driven around a fucking limousine he gets 15 million we can't get a raise that's my point well you can just tell them this is too much but don't you think and this is what I think if that guy really does make that amount of money he's probably like how the fuck am i pulling this off always he doing extracting numbers from some system by his choice at all ones and zeroes and moving things around and making sure the profit margin trees and he gets a piece of that and he just living like a fucking baller on a yacht a golden bikini with a bottle of fucking dumped a crossdresser now having fun 19 million dollars is here you do whatever the fuck he wants but there's there's room for debate as to what job is worth there's no job on my show of having people on a disagree in engaging in those debates we don't just say there's how do I make an assumption there's room to your they do how much a job is worth yes there is room to debate so but it can be determined by the value of a company and the services rendered not some arbitrary number because Bernie Sanders throws at a percentage point I'm not saying that he's right I'm saying well I think it's totally within the interests of all the people that work for a company that are critical to this company actually working to figure out like hey how much should we get for this how much do they get and well one guys getting 15 million bucks and the other guys getting $15 an hour and you got out like this guy if this guy doesn't work this guy doesn't get any money like these people have to work if they didn't work the CEO would make $0 right because there would be no profit so someone has to work so I don't think it's outside the realm of rational discourse to discuss how much a person should make to be a CEO no I don't think it's outside the realm of rational discourse I do think people are wrong when they say for example to take your argument how much a CEO should make I think that's silly you shouldn't be able to determine that just I don't think should either just like I don't think you should to say $15 an hour look I think if somebody filets if some super baller you know fucking Steve Jobs type character comes in and starts running a company and all sudden it goes blockbuster through the roof and becomes Apple I don't think you should be able to say that guy doesn't deserve way more money than the average person because fucking of course he does yeah that guy is an obsessed genius who's making this country which okay exactly who does determine I think the market does but isn't in a relationship between the people who are this is Bernie Sanders point of view I would imagine right the people that don't have a say the people that are there making the least amount of money they're the easiest to replace and they're the ones that are worried about being treated fairly well first off I would say if you know therefore you don't care about poor people well I was sleeping out of an 82 Datsun when I first lived in Los Angeles so um I cared about myself let's put it that way I used to be in high school but I want to talk to those folks say it's right attribute motive and I think and I think we both might I think you don't do it I don't do it I don't attribute motive I don't say well you do this because you hate poor people or you do this because but you do have to look at the numbers and you do look at a certain point when people say they're underrepresented they have no voice well that's not true with union workers they have a huge voice they have huge political influence these people don't not right voice came an industry they have you know the entire music industry has been so far left for so long pushing for the same idea that country a lot of those people are actually pretty fun Kid Rock just talking about how most come on sound very far left country music is not far left so you take an extreme move country the fuck out of Dodge let's stop you remove country it's one of the biggest shaundra's in music in this country not only that I bet they sell more fucking albums than anybody his country going out there and making redacted and Lions for lambs and rendition and avatar and all these these design anti-corporate screens the point is I don't know what you're talking about what do you see as countries having one of them movie is that what you're saying yeah fucking movie about aliens bro avatar the movie is possibly the biggest piece of neo environmentalist proper son of a bitch he's a fucking amazing mom I got blue aliens just out of boredom that guy fell in love with that blue alien he became one of them bro he was paralyzed they put him inside the blue alien mind if a James Cameron could buy an island in paint people blue and have them run around for the rest of his life if he wanted instead he decides to print them out on blu-rays using petroleum bro it was a dolt movie and you're a fucking communist it's a fucking great movie enjoy no I hated it Christ dude is great really fucking flying dragons badass Marines what else do you want what kind of a pussy in my talk you do what happened to you you've been up in Michigan too long it's too cold in the winter it's too cold in the winter therefore I need to like it bad for your brain you don't think straight you just want to stay home you like do you actually like avatars of sex wait can't wait for Avatar to really heard it's underwater even better they just stole that idea from Mario level two let's make a school Turin is a bad motherfucker he's one of the best directors of all times sure he's a classic he's a great director I don't care about his politics he makes tea I was talking about the media the entertainment industry the backlash for someone who I'm not even a huge supporter of Donald Trump neither one of us are so they're gonna be relatively objective so let's remove country but if you look at the energy have you turned on CNN recently drink slow down have you turned on CNN raise yours cheers Cheers well oh good drink it this is literally like relax if you love me brother drink it that was a dope movie it was horrible the guy in high school if you love me you'll drink it who the fuck were you partying with apparently Kid Rock being considered as potential Senate right now did you see that that I hold the fuck on is that true it's a bow hunter I'm with him I'm voting for him actually I saw his interview with Dan Rather last night was pretty interesting yeah he's a lot smarter than I think you'd I'd give him credit for it he's not a dumb guy he's not a dumb guy have you ever seen him alive no I have not I like what he does you know what he does he put against of effort extremely low ticket prices like 20 bucks or a guy like him that's huge sells out these places and he gets a piece of the booze he's smart he's a smart guy even he's given his audience like a good deal yeah makes a good deal with the venue's like look if Kid Rock's showing up this fucking place to sell it out so let's just make a deal let's make a deal and his deal is is really smart I like what he's doing well that's a good example of a guy not being forced to do it Yeah right he's just doing it because he wants to do something that helps people plus he's got a dope Cadillac you ever seen his Cadillac I haven't had one of them West Coast Customs custom made Cadillac is this shit man where do you goddamn impressive that he did it remember that so I think if you got started okay sorted a beer company was called like badass American badass or something beer I like Kid Rock there I said it these music dude no I like him and some of his music is not bad I agree with you some of us music is really not better than popular to crap on him I like him for that Cadillac he's unabashedly friends with Ted Nugent now you said the cars I love cars because I remember I was listening your podcast once and you said it's only to the point when you make so much money that you no longer care about money and you use your car as an example you said you know for example like I crap I got a dent of something in my car at one point would have lost my mind because that car meant so much and now she's like okay it's only a car so that was a good point though that you made that when you have enough money it's kind of like that's what I call guerrilla Buddhism okay like the idea of this is part of Buddhism that you should not be attached to items you should not be attached to objects and you you know I have a friend of mine who became Buddhist monk and he wouldn't even have sex anymore it gave up on sex all carnal pleasure all pleasure all attachment to women attachment to relationships and the idea is that you don't want to be connected to that because what you are connected to owns you and my take on that was okay but how does it have to own you like can't you just enjoy automobiles can't you enjoy an engineering you say that you can't have a you know you can't own a thing can't possess a thing I feel like that is so ignorant of the world that we live in it's so ridiculous you pretend you're choosing to act in a way that you're ignoring this amazing technological revolution that is going on right before your eyes and it is going to fucking happen whether you ride a bike to work or not it's gonna happen it's what people do we are a part of this cascade of electronic progress of electronic innovation and it's never gonna stop and that's and that's Santilli killer so want to go back to that point the car but you know that would be a good analogy business because of iPhones or we put you know there's nothing wrong with appreciating things that people make whether it's an automobile whether it's a painting a sculpture I feel like cars are like people look at them as just transportation and I totally appreciate that because the works of art if you get a Prius it's just transportation those are their works of Arts if you get a 1969 Mustang that is a goddamn marvel of time you know it is a moment where people decided to just create something that just looks inherently like like collectively badass there's no no one looks at a 69 Mach 1 and goes that's fucking gross if you do fuck you know what that is if you do fuck you right if you look at a 69 Mustang you don't you don't say wow that's crazy-looking that's amazing isn't that a big irony that you're able to appreciate it and not be attached to it because you've been more financially successful well that's what I say this is this is the whole point of this whole thing it's it's not a rational normal position to take as most people are behind the eight-ball all the time and always need to pay their bills look at that car look behind you sir look at that guy yeah the ball cuts it and now we talked about that earlier before you were drunk yeah it looks nice that's a fucking amazing car man that 1969 Mustang is a marvel it all came together it's just they figured it out they just figured out some way to make something that just is incredibly pleasing to your eyes and doubles as transportation now should get one right there's a company that takes them and this is what I like they take the the inside of it and the engine all that stuff out and they put a 2012 be gt500 inside of it so you get like anti-lock brakes you get airbags you get everything yeah and then they you know they put it together and so that's the way to go it's it's this was actually my experience with very nice cars I want to buy a car and I had very little money so I went and I looked there was a 2003 Ford Taurus was like 60,000 miles on it an old guy had cataracts so they took away his license you know I can drive and like no they took away his license so I wanted to buy this tourist the guy took like four grand for it not a great car is getting you from point A to point B but I had to walk through cars one from George W Bush one for I can't remember the singer there was one that was the exact same model of car that James Dean died in apparently they're only like 13 horses Spyder you had a Porsche but no no I didn't have it I walked through it here's the crazy thing wasn't this guy well let me assure this guy who was selling this old 2003 tourist what are you a ghost this is what he drove right but you know what his business was his business was customizing cars like that Porsche Spyder and doing high-end cars people like George W Bush the nicest cars in the country and he drove a 2003 Ford Taurus that I bought from him it's the most it was just the surreal experience walking through these cars that I mean you don't even want to touch right you want to put a fingerprint on it and this guy I found out later was a multi-millionaire it could afford any car that he wanted he'd a 2003 Taurus well some people do that because they want to stay low-key and they just want to just kind of chill yeah you know there's there's that there's definitely that like Henry Rollins drives a Mazda 6 he drives like a regular car and the reason why does it is cuz he's just like he's not he doesn't give a fuck Henry wants like sit in front of his gigantic $200,000 speakers and listen to records yeah he doesn't care about his car so like for him it's like he doesn't want a ball he's on a floss he wears the same t-shirt he has like a hundred gray t-shirts he wears the same thing every day said well he's a fascinating character in that regard because he's a guy who has financial means like he's very wealthy guy right but he chooses not spending on things like that yeah well it's like my dad gave me this analogy one time we're talking about cars or the ability to appreciate it but you don't need it it's like air right if you all of a sudden you stopped breathing you don't have air all you can think about is breathing right that's the first thing we'll just lean you're being suffocated by a 300-pound guy inside control well same thing with money if you take away the money all you can think about is money because you need money and my point was like we were talking about earlier we don't want people in those positions determining exactly what I have to do with my money firstly personally as soon as you get money you get this stress alleviation that's palpable I mean I'm sure it's happened to you cuz you've been really successful over the last few years when you all of a sudden don't worry about whether or not you could pay gas bill this month right it's a different feeling until I was 25 years old every day of my life was checked to check every damn I was barely mean fucking barely you know lying to the landlord I scented what happened you know everybody who's been in that situation where you're like literally wondering how much can I spend today to eat you know and I've been I've been there and then we all been there the moment I got a development deal way back in the day with Disney of all people yeah of all people's I'm a Disney show and they saw your set like no I was boy pretty where you wanna be on TV well it was you know 1993 or something like that so I got a development deal because it did an MTV half-hour comedy I remember those shows I do I did one episode of the MTV half-hour comedy hour and I got a development deal from Disney because of it I got like sort of thing and there's they sent me some money and as soon as they sent me some money it was like literally like someone just took a weight like lifted it like I was carrying around a weighted backpack right my whole life and they took it off and it wasn't enough money where I was wealthy where I could say I don't have to work again but it was enough money where I didn't have to think about money for a year right and so all sudden I was like wow this is what it feels like to not worry about your bills like I've never felt this before and then I became obsessed with maintaining that position okay once you realize that I was like oh my god I'm a bulldog I'm gonna work constantly I'm gonna wear I'm gonna do stand-up I'm now I'm not quitting anything what could this why was that because I realized how important it is to not be dependent on anyone yeah to not to not change like here's the thing about look you're talking about Hollywood the way people behave in high it's in many ways it's a self enforcing ideology in that you you know that someone like Meryl Streep who gets up in front of the Golden Globes or whatever the fuck it was and says crazy shit real arts but right but when she's saying that what she's doing is she's like it's a war cry for for the like-minded yeah you know there's no reason to say that and for any other reason she's she wants to rally the troops yeah she wants to enforce her ideas and she wants to make sure that everyone is on board and the reason she said something she's royalty is but she's Hollywood royalty because and because of that she would say something that stupid that was received the way it was because she probably ran it by a bunch of people beforehand the point is not a single person there they all roared and cheered come on a single person there goes what of quarters surrounded by people but what I'm saying is yeah that those people that are reacting to that they may agree with it or they may feel like they have to agree with it yeah I don't ever want to be the guy who feels like he has to agree with something right I grew up in a weird way where like my parents got they broke up when I was really young and we moved around a lot and I didn't have roots like I didn't live in one place until Massachusetts when I was 13 right I lived there for a long time that was the first place I lived for a long time and I got a chance to see the way people cling to ideas versus actually believe things and I think it's very important to find out what you actually believe and it's almost impossible in Hollywood yeah because in Hollywood people have to audition for things right and I've been there man it's gross you go in this room and some person looks at you and they have a clipboard they're judging you and they have power and the same power and unions can control groups of people the same thing can happen for really self-righteous ideologues who happen to be holding that clipboard well then there's also the throwing out the baby with the bathwater we're calling anybody has a worldview an ideologue and I do think that you're susceptible if you don't have a framework from which you look through the world if you have a prism where you go okay hold on a second if you're a hardcore do died without any exceptions whatsoever you're an ideologue if you start going us-versus-them I can I've had conversations with people in Hollywood where they've talked to me about the Democratic Party they go we have to win the house in the house then we get this I go what is this we man yeah you make a fucking cartoon but then you have people who just go minutes left in the right there it's all the same no it's not you do need to determine a prism through which you see the world for example there's a very clear decision you make do I believe in choice do I believe in freedom and personal liberty or do I believe in equal outcomes and that doesn't mean that you line up with either party the same on every single issue but it is a filter through which you will be able to see it explain those options again you have to make someone else to make a decision right now why these three options you said no I put two options and personal liberty personal liberty and choice right and choice freedom of choice or do I value the idea of equal outcomes oh well equal outcomes is ridiculous because I can't play basketball but you can't understand that unless you have some kind of it people don't like there's an ism there don't you think the line things people need to play dodge ball do you need to bring back dodge ball you're gonna realize stay away from that big fucker that guy throws that dodge ball it's gonna hurt when the little kid gets hit Russian that's really agent kid with the glasses that's reading as soon as maybe that kids a bad motherfucker maybe he's from Thailand maybe people wouldn't fuck with him since he was little pretty rare catch him outside I'll kick you in the dick how about that guy possible that's entirely possible but the point is there there is an ism and people don't need to shy away from saying you know what I do hazel there is an ism what do you mean by an ism there is an ism where people were conservatism leftism liberalism I don't think anybody's ever said there is just like to act as though what cuz liberalism you the first person is he left ISM I know been alive for 49 years never heard a single motherfucker say left is well because today's left is not the same as classical liberals the word leftism you don't skirt the issue yeah that might be the first time anybody's fuck I don't think liberalism describes the current you know movement but people are people say well I I'm not an ideologue well actually a lot of people they don't realize they are to some degree and you just have to determine to which degree that is and recognize that about yourself everyone has a leaning well everyone has a MUX it easier no it makes it easier to get along if you subscribe to a predetermined there's no predetermined set of values or ideas if someone says ok I'm looking at the world through this lens do I look through it where we need to ensure fairness and equal outcomes or do I look through it in the idea that people should be free to make their own decisions that doesn't mean you're subscribing to the Republican but are you talking about your first initial sitting well I'm talking about we're talking about really recently yeah I agree with you yeah yeah I mean I think what we should do see I think a big part of the problem with human beings today is that it's not a fair hand of cards that we're all dealt and some want to pretend that it is it's not mm-hmm it's just not and you know it and I know it and we say well you know what you got to deal with the best with what you've got and I agree with that yeah the real problem with that is the people that got to fucking ones those people more than a problem well because for them the guy with four aces just got Donald Trump jr. you know he thinks you lucky motherfucker by the way Donald Trump jr. is a very nice guy he's a sportsman and a hunter you have to do now that he's in a no I like him I use my friend I mean I yes I mean I only text him but he's good buddies so now we're gonna the forms are gonna go nuts Joe Rogan Illuminati Donald from said before I've said it before I'm a very friendly guy every single person that I know that has come in contact with Donald Trump jr. said he's a lovely man nothing but good things about him he became more wealthy when you became more successful do you find yourself being more generous I've always been a generous person but he never I could be yeah because I realized the importance of camaraderie I realized because I didn't have a lot of friends because I was constantly moving around so when I had friends I valued them greatly they were they were not disposable like my friends to me like they are as important as my family a bunch of my friends have lived with me yeah you know like when they've been broke I like when I was single especially like Tate live with me Duncan live with me they were like I got nowhere to go much fuck you do come on man so money justify your character didn't change it well it it helped me help people right when I had the opportunity to do something look if you see someone and they're a good friend and you're you're you have a bounty of wealth I could say a good friend is hungry and you have all this food you would have to be some kind of piece of shit to say don't eat my food that I can never possibly all eat myself right you would want them to eat so you feel better but my point is that's who you are right and I said Joe has been generous but you've been generous with me in the sense of actually allowing me on the show supporting content whether people get mad about it or not and I appreciate that but the point is the money didn't change you at amplify it's like alcohol it amplifies your character you're not a racist and well I'm not an alcoholic so it amplifies right and so that's important people to note because you have if you if you take that and you believe that again as a worldview that money doesn't necessarily it can doesn't inherently change who you are you'll find that you'll see just as many greedy poor people as you will wealthy people and that's important because when we're deciding on some arbitrary number and we just toss it to democracy you can have just as many greedy portions of the masses as you would big bankers and they can just vote in their own self-interest and that's not right either do you mean by an arbitrary number like well I'm saying what should a CEO make right what's the fair minimum wage and if you understand that there can be people making less than minimum wage who if they got the Joe Rogan they made their break you worked really hard but all of a sudden have millions of dollars they're just as greedy as they are making $13 an hour again it's no human condition questionably you're correct yeah that there are people that don't care about other people's feelings no matter what they make but I would say to you give kids now you don't know I would say to you as a parent that a big part of that was how they were treated while they were developing sure and there's genetic variables there's people that have illnesses mental illnesses or Zyzz there's all sorts of there's all sorts of variables when it comes to who is steven crowder at 29 years of age who are you how did you get to this point or Who am I at 49 years of age how did I get to this point 949 moisturise thought I was watching the day where he lifted a kettlebell I'm a strong motherfucker I probably didn't say that you did say that you said those exact words oh yeah oh that's right he was talking to me about like we're only talking about 450 pounds like deadlifts I'm like dude that's not that much yeah 450 yeah yeah yeah I am I had a knee surgery recently and so for me I know you went through the jujitsu drawbacks and you got back in and blew your ACL out well actually I tore my LCL and the ACL was slightly torn but they were like actually the guy who does the surgery in the Red Wings he came out he goes do you wrestle I said yeah he goes okay we rarely ever see an LCL that torn without a blowing on ACL he's like did you do anything where your ankle was going towards your face guard pass yeah but the problem is they went in and they fixed that but that wasn't the real real problem the real problem is my kneecap I guess whatever it is the tissue that holds that in place is gone and they said it would be easier if you had a torn ACL to fix because we know what it is like with a kneecap take it out do a replacement there's really a fascia kneecap I mean they said so he basically said there's no reason to do anything with a kneecap because we don't know what save their place it replace it with an iron one yeah just start rich Franklin versus Anderson Silva and just rearrange his face that was so nice to watch you know a lot of dudes wear steel cups I don't necessarily think there's a law against it in the UFC they started making laws against it in Brazilian jiu-jitsu jiu-jitsu because he talked damn I can't talk no no here's the deal I had a buddy of mine did it to me once my friend Amir Rena Vardy he got on top no he got on top of me mounted me and he had a steel cup on and he was essentially fucking my solar plexus it was totally uncomfortable because in a match well it's it's metal I mean you have a metal piece and it really affects arm bars in particularly it creates an unnatural fulcrum well a back take to is really uncomfortable exactly it's going into your lower regular cup like I use a diamond MMA cup you know what those are does it their completion yeah they're in compression shorts and the outside of them is like this rubberized thing and the outside in the front is all like a really hard plastic like there's videos of them showing people taking like full groin shots on purpose you know with their advertisements I can kick it really does protect you in an amazing way but it doesn't hurt like a dot like one of those steel tie cups so these dudes who are fucking real sadists they give these steel Tyco up it's definitely an advantage and is that what you think oh yeah well I think I'm just gonna say Kenny Florian fought with it I'm pressuring me pretty closely if you fucking mess up and you kicked Kenny flooring in the deck you break your foot kid that bar fight hey why are you walking with a limp I kicked Kenny flooring in the day I'm sure he doesn't wear it to the bar I'm talking about it in a cage you don't know that's a judgment I wouldn't kick judge Kenny you know but he wears tight pants there's no way there's no way he's got a fucking crowd the local dive there's no one that he's looking impressed as a married man you son of a bitch I thought you were conservative any floor and dare you go there I'm gonna take more tobacco and packaging I don't ask that - kiss-ass they look Joe Rogan so generous but I do believe in again it going with the isms general this is a message to people that like wonder whether they should be generous or not generosity makes you feel better it does it just does like it's not a selfish thing to like the this idea that or not not necessarily not a selfish thing this idea that to keep your money yourself you're protecting yourself you looking out for number one it's not true right it's little it's the wrong way to think because when you're generous especially when you're generous to friends it's super important the people you actually love that you express that to those people when you do do that it's good for you too it just doesn't seem like it's good for you because people are so survival or there's a great book called who really cares it's about famine mentality Brooks or David Brooks but he went out kind of seeing who actually donates and whose generous and kind of going by political persuasion by geographical you know by just let me guess conservatives to number one yes so but but especially just once yeah yeah yeah that is actually true fucking Michigan first off my home state especially with jihadis out there you know you've seen the Muslims but there is the the ISM this is one thing that I do that I do sincerely believe and this is why I don't shy away from saying listen I'm a conservative you said something was pretty telling you said because I really I wanted to work hard I never wanted to be beholden to someone again right so you made that decision well you knew that if you did that and you worked hard then you wouldn't be beholden to someone else that was that was the the assumption okay the assumption that that is free enterprise free enterprise or capitalism to use the term right it can only work under the under an optimistic society under people believing they can retire and do better socialism collectivism can only operate by appealing to people's most selfish nature by appealing to be able saying listen the cards are the deck is stacked against you you can't do this there's someone else out there was an ace in the hole you've been born without the leg up that they have therefore I need to help you that is the big difference capitalism can only survive an optimism whereas collectivism requires the worst of human nature to sustain itself maybe I believe that but what wouldn't it be nicer if people just if someone figured out a way to say hey how much do you really need instead of saying you have to do this and put people's what I'm saying is can you contribute a small amount that's not even affect you but it's gonna help other people and do you do that and if you do do that how do you do it do you do it in the form of generosity like do you tip waitresses more than you should do you do it in the form of giving out to charities that you feel are very worthy and you know you research them and you know the people that are behind them do you do it in terms of you know social work you do do you do it in terms of putting out informational videos that help people figure out how they can advance their own lives we all do in certain one I know you do too and charitable things amongst people we care about when you address causes that you care about you go out of your way in a non selfish way right try to illuminate certain things or add to the coffers of certain organizations that are doing we think are good good things I agree but that should be enforced more than the idea that some people are fucking you right right well I I agree with you and that's again that idea like you're talking about why are you giving to this cause why are you why are you donating your time right you're either it comes down to either donating money or time really at the end of the day it's some sort of material goods or time because you're doing it with the belief that you'll help people it doesn't work if you're being forced to because you know there's some people to do it for a tax break no that's silly no one gives away a hundred thousand dollars to get a forty thousand dollar tax break the map doesn't it might have to if you want run some fucking LLC you might have some weird GN LLC aren't you an LLC pipes smell good that's um it's definitely way better than cigarettes which shows you how much the FDA has been fucking you well actually they've now pipes are controlled tobacco product which they didn't used to be but it's all the chemicals that are actually added to cigarettes what does that mean does it mean hard to get there's there's something ominous because with pipe tobacco's a lot of these local like a local tobacco shop they'll do their own blends so they'll buy pipe tobacco in bulk like that seersucker from someplace in one of the Carolinas and I think that's changing so it actually removes the artistry where a lot of people like this is this is the blend I can get in I don't know you know Holland Michigan you can't get anywhere else it's amazing that's going away and what that does FDA steps in is what does it do it favors the big boys who send out their tins from one centralized company the smaller tobacconists can compete that's the worry about marijuana well right if it'll go legal you don't need these dispensaries anymore right isn't that kind of what'll happen they'll be out of business exactly it's a problem well what about also people it's okay to possess it it's okay to sell it or your friends can give you some someone satisfying weed ever got my yoga teacher gave it to me sounds about right how about every time my wife goes in there trying to give her some kind of weird incense their newest every time she goes hot yoga oh yoga there's always a difference between essential oils and pot no not pot but they're always got something you know they want to put on incense or something there's this my point my point is you're beholden to the yoga instructor so they use it sometimes the salesmen sense my yoga instructors pure and she's my friend what's what's opposing with the pipe fuck you can't see when Joe just said fuck you it actually blew out his own lighter fuck you right-wing listen I mean I sit firmly in the flip-flopping position of the middle you don't know you're pretty you're thinking you're pretty fair and I do like to think that I mean it's really hard to get leftist guests on her show that's just a reality we try and book them and then after a couple of times well you know what's the most leftist guess you've ever had well we had imam Chaudhary who actually said I should die on air whoa yeah he's the guy who now he's in jail for for giving to Isis or something from the UK so we had to we had to create a whole new sky so you shouldn't die on air why buddy say you should die well because I did a Three Stooges routine dressing up as maja three old wife yeah it's not amazing you should die for that you can die for dressing up as a guy outside of that you know Sally cone is pretty far left Christopher Titus Michael jr. we tried we wind them on the Christopher Titus debate was one of the most painful ones I've ever watched was it painful for you it was because I felt as though I usually do try and get into an engagement of ideas and he was just screaming so much um it was more pain for him for me because I'm a dad yeah and I think no something went wrong somewhere along the line to get him to that place where he's arguing about something we really doesn't know the facts yeah it wasn't it wasn't just that it was when you were throwing out laws regulations and he just didn't know enough you know kept arguing about it you know when someone's arguing about something and they don't know exactly what they're talking about yeah and they've down a dark road instead saying okay I can't really talk about this because I don't I don't have any facts at my disposal instead of doing that he kept arguing it yeah and I was like oh Jesus and I contacted you after all this bro this is rough well you know you were very nice about that you were very nice to him while I was going on cuz it was fucking ugly and you were very nice afterwards we didn't gloat we had him back we had him back one time Kevin chance and some Commons antics he just gets so mad yes Sally Kohn well he's saying you don't care about dead kids that's the motive thing that I'm talking about you think I don't shy away from an emotive thing it was it was it was a conversational debate ploy he's like he it was a crude debate the main point he's trying to box you into a corner I want to say this because I appreciate this fort Edison we talked off-air he's a nice guy whereas someone like a Michael Woods jr. who refused to come on the show tried to leverage coming on this show to debate me is dishonest and someone who's afraid or Michael Ian Black where recently got into it with hopefully he'll come on the show a lot of times get in there with him literally I was on air and all he did was we talked about this last in my video and rape culture you saw it with the Lena Dunham thing where it's one in four women are raped and in the video I literally say I'm not saying rape isn't a horrible crime and those people should be buried beneath the train tracks okay okay I'm also not apologizing for I literally say that in the video okay okay and then I get into the stats as to why rape culture doesn't exist in United States and it does in the Middle East so all Michael Ian Black tweets out is a portion of that video a snippet that is not the statistics that I presented but that's a sketch cutaway it just tweets out holy shit and this is the thing that if someone sent that to him if he got a clip it goes for they're just treats out holy shit and this is the constant thing right that often people who disagree with me politically who identify as a left go Crowder doesn't think there's a rape culture and so if they say it as though it's absurd enough people go yeah that's silly but I say well hold on tell me why I'm wrong and so I said well come on the show tell me why I'm wrong and he said well I wouldn't want to straight white guys debating rape culture I'd rather you talk with someone who's a victim of rape or a woman would have a better handle on it so I said okay how about you talk with one of my two head writers Casey or Courtney they disagree with you they'd be glad to debate it no I don't think is going to go and then I had to call him out on air to the point where he's agreed to next Thursday but again the point is holy shit this is absurd why is it absurd tell me why it's I don't want to show up if you have to ask then you don't know and that's the position today that we see on cable news that we see from in this election but you particularly see from people trying to silence dissent I love the idea of as a white man you shouldn't be able to talk about this certain thing you should be able to talk about bugs on Jupiter okay it doesn't fucking matter what your sexual orientation is what your gender is what your race is you should be able to talk about things right just because you talk to somebody about something doesn't mean you the premier expert of it right the premier you're the premier expert of it no you should be able to talk about things I think you're right and that's a silly that's a silly whether it's a plea to the left yeah that that really is that's what that is is you're saying things that you think piece people could possibly criticize you about right and you're cutting it off at the pass before their preposterous ideas get to you in your Twitter feed well to me I mean like you said you you disagree with people on certain things but you're not a coward ideologically I'm not I'm up physically but you'll allow people on who you disagree with and you'll change your mind I definitely changed my mind I'm not married to my ideas as much as I get criticized for that no I think I think you're pretty consistent in that and I think on the flip side what we try and do is I say listen this is my bias this is what I believe what's your bias oh my god you said I'm right-wing what do you serve but if you had to like if you go god a minute and maybe I went too far down this road if I could just relax one aspect of my my dialogue what would it be maybe my pipe smoking your pipe smoking I probably you know I probably wouldn't talk about the marijuana issue that I wouldn't care because you're something I don't care about it whatever the other but my issue with it is when and we saw some Montreal I talked about it when people lie about it and they're dishonest with their voting constituency like how so well saying you know it's medicine for a B C or D it may be medicine for a but not for B C or D what are the B C's and DS example well you're asking me what I wouldn't talk about and I asked me to defend it the point is I don't really care about it but what are the B C's in deep well yeah you said yourself answer there has been shown it helps with cancer about as much as american ginger CBD has been shown with seizures tremendous tremendous benefits for cancer and non-psychoactive yeah and surely with seizures i havent zero problem CBD okay but much use of cannabis yeah i feel the need to call people out and bullshit when they say well the reason it's not because of big pharmaceutical companies go on a second there are seven patents on chemical compounds from marijuana right now right the people who stand to make the most out of marijuana legalization or pharmaceutical companies that's why they mess not true well it is if you look at the biggest supplement no only by the same pharmaceutical go you can't patent the one way yes you can they patented seven seven and leave hand her trains of GMOs no no seven active chemical compounds in part that have been patented as drugs they've gone through the process yes one that's really efficient a point where you can't grow pot how would you stop someone who's legal it pots legal how would anyone stand if they if that's the truth then that's a real problem if pot is recognized as a medicine right if pot was recognized there is no one who would stand to gain more than pharmaceutical companies by providing it is not necessarily true of people allowed me really true I'll give you that but I also think it's not necessarily true that the reason people can't smoke up is because big pharma is sitting somewhere you know Martin's correctly going let's make potty illegal yeah well not that finally but there are absolutely people who have lobbied as we talked about how the prison guard Union has lobbied to keep marijuana illegal there's absolutely pharmaceutical companies have done the same thing it was revealed in the WikiLeaks memos this is where I would say was told don't interrupt me fuck where Hillary Clinton said that she's against marijuana in every sense of the word right remember those those came out yeah is he he said he would leave it up to the states yeah that's actually a constitutional approach but he's pretty he wants to beef up the war on drugs you know why I bet someone slipped him a pot cookie once and he looked at his hair in the mirror and he's a teetotaler he's even drink sold vodka doesn't drink Donald Trump it's great yeah ever no he says he Colorado topped 1 billion in legal marijuana sales in 2016 good holla yeah holla Colorado yeah but another thing that we just wrote about and get people mad with the window shoes well no no traffic fatalities regarding marijuana have skyrocketed Google there cuz that's a nonsense no drunk driving arrests have dropped what do you mean you've what first of all you wrote about what the sources just because someone gets in an accident and they're hi see you guys hold on stop you just rocked way too much the new stuff you talk no no I don't talk about address I make full points if people are high a lot then the same amount of fatalities exist but the people that get checked once they get into these accidents happen to be high it does not necessarily mean that marijuana caused those fatalities it could be that you have an increased incidence of people doing marijuana and altercations that could not have been avoided it could be it could let the statistical change is measurable well what is free and you're talking about in Colorado in states where it's been decriminalized what's Colorado you said let me make my point again my point I don't care about it yeah you do no I really don't you don't care about it so touchy about it cuz someone says you know what if we want to smoke up fine I just don't really buy the arguments that everyone is in some big conspiracy to try and snuff it out no there are yeah and the idea that the drug war will end and the idea that it's it's it's cures cancer I just don't buy that I'm so upset well we'll listen studies have proven that it shrinks tumors that it helps people with cancer much like tumeric lot much like any things that reduce inflammation in community tart cherry right but it's not necessarily they're all legal and there's no issue because they're not psychoactive right but they are beneficial so all these things are good marijuana is one of the things that are good and free don't sure man just like you don't sure tumeric you don't sure ginger you don't sure a reduced sugar diet all those things that reduce inflammation or I don't I don't buy that smoking marijuana would be as beneficial as a reduced sugar diet and my point is that people might owe offending that and saying but if you want to smoke you might be correct it doesn't matter because it's not a fucking contest to see what's the most beneficial if the question is is it beneficial and is it damaging it is it does matter what's damaged no no I mean let me finish my point it does matter you said would you not talk about I said probably pot because I don't care well what do you think about it and your eyes light up and all of a sudden we're ideology and world cares discuss like a tractor beam on the most important issue of the day that I said I don't care you're the guy that thinks people should be able to do whatever your market got so if you're free market guy why wouldn't you be in support of some thing whether it's the most beneficial or equally but you're not necessarily because you're friends I'm just joking since marijuana legalization highway fatalities in Colorado are bringing up the source that you want to flash the study right there yeah Washington Post bring up a study that we were we weren't about on our way look I don't care about your website you fuck since marijuana legalization highway fatalities in can you do this with the crazy lady in a comedy club funny you think if you scream enough that it makes one my point is I don't think that it would be enough and you just said it was interrupting your interrupted screaming because it's as valuable as a low sugar diet and the fact doesn't have to feel as though you can't have a conversation about this as civilly as you did every other issue tells me that there's a huntress a problem this is a TNT powder can this humans I get very Defense and when people start talking over me and you started it first but the reality is that a low sugar diet is fine it's good too but why is there a competition between a low sugar diet and tumeric and marijuana and CBD oil why why why does one is making the claim regarding legality that it cures cancer illegal no my only point is the other ones are already legal they don't have to fight but no one's prescribing no one's dishing out dispensaries for tumeric or ginger they certainly are if you go to these local juice shop anyway you go to these juice shops people are like crazy couldn't care less people wanna smoke joints you're an ideologue buddy really that's an ideologue position by saying leave it to the state yeah you're locked in man really you're locked deep into this fucking thing man I was raising a socialist profits of your bread is buttered buddy a socialist profit and once we're over here in America fucking just as much of an immigrant as some dude who sneaks over the wall Trump just built porn in Detroit so and that remains to be seen it could be a next mmm so horrible Detroit have you seen that thing where there there's a guy who is making a an urban farm in Detroit oh that's very common in Detroit now well he's kind of the largest urban farm and he's bought up all this land and as he's bought up all this land he's taking these like dilapidated houses they tear him down he's building his farm really cheap land and people are getting pissed off of them they're getting pissed off cuz this one guy now buys all this land they're like well what about us yeah and this is this weird thing that's going on where people somehow or another are mad at this guy who's trying to do something positive if I'm not mistaken on that story I could be wrong but urban farming was a real we wrote about that when we did this report in Detroit I was telling actually Jamey about it beforehand we did a real-time ride-along because people said we selectively edited the worst parts of Detroit so went back was my producer not gay Jarrod we said okay we're gonna start dead center downtown Detroit where all the hipsters drank their coffee and talked about how it's being revived we will drive out in three different directions we put a GoPro on top of the car GoPro in the car a mileage tab and a timer clock and it never took more than about I think point nine miles out of the city to certain death an unbelievable urban plight the crazy thing about Detroit is you'll see downtown Detroit and then you look to the left and it looks like the Upper Peninsula there's nothing there it's so desolate and if I'm not mistaken with that story everyone was doing urban farming but there were some problems with the soil and sort of the guy who probably found out he could make money if he improved the soil and he got it down to a system that was more efficient and people didn't like that aspect of it because now it's the big Herman farmer right there always a wealthy guy who bought up a lot of land right and he's a white guy and he bought it up in this you know really urban area and you know the buildings were all fucked up and somehow and other people felt like somebody was encroaching in their neighborhood that they had watched deteriorate no one there there's no one there and though some people are there but the point is they felt like that should have been somehow another part of their world which is weird you know it's weird to think that you deserve something because that's where you live I think like we were talking earlier about uber and all these things change is a real part of being an organism that lives on a planet right and whether it's changed because of nature like the fucking shoreline changes the ocean Rises tsunamis hit the coast earthquakes change the landscape with volcanoes whether it's that kind of change or whether it's economic change or whether it's technological change there's gonna be change and if you're trying to stop change you're on the wrong side of history it's not gonna work you're gonna you're gonna try and it's eventually gonna overcome you yeah I think you know my view is you should allow people to be the change they seek as Barack Obama put it and shouldn't try to force change if you live in a shit neighborhood and some dude wants a breakdown the terrible house isn't build a farm that's not necessarily a bad idea no it's not at all yeah I mean when we did our video in Detroit packs of wild dogs roaming the streets in box real yeah that's real and we got fact-checked on it because we did a video on this where we said you know packs of and then I made a joke where I said apparently there have been grizzly bear sightings so hopefully this will be our next National Geographic special some of those black bear sightings right but I got fact-checked I don't know if it was backed in it I don't know remember if it was Snopes or something someone saying steven crowder made the claim that grizzly bears were in detroit fact check reveals that only black bears have been the action they're like okay well you should fact check them because black bears are more likely to be predatory on human beings than grizzly bears because of more common interactions though statistically you're very smart you're right that's right kind of like sharks it occurs in three to four feet of water people are swimming exactly but that is the case with grizzly grizzly bears are way more aggressive yes to say but they don't necessarily associate human beings with food are you supposed to play dead or run with a grizzly bear you wouldn't know that problem it depends entirely on why the grizzly bear is attacking you the reality is if a grizzly bear is attacking you because she's with her cubs you're better off playing dead you're better off covering up me I mean correct acting your vitals getting the turtle position and taking your beatings and she that's goodbye she's gonna fuck you up but she might leave you alone if you just lay still and then she feels like she can run away she's gonna fuck you up no matter what she's gonna incapacitate you but if an old male or a predatory male that has killed another human being and recognized as human beings as food yeah that has happened before where hikers have disappeared and hikers disappear all the time to the tune of hundreds of people every year just vanish I read that actually polar bears will stalk people well that's a different animal yes polar bears are completely predatory which means they don't eat any vegetation you can get lucky with grizzly bears where grizzly bears can have a fucking field of blueberries and they don't want to have anything to do with you because blueberries are delicious they don't run and they can just sit there and eat and they don't have any hunger pangs really yeah how many blueberries would it take to feed a grizzly well this you know you're talking about Alaska like a mountainside like in the spring or in the fall rather like before they go into hibernation that's what they primarily eat because all that sugar just gets like straight into the fat their bodies and they store it up big thick fat layers yeah but an animal that has already killed a person is where it becomes a real problem it's not that animals are evil or animals like no target people it's they recognize food sources that they've already eaten did you see those those people who are protesting your meal really mad the Rangers at Yellowstone Park so they're very strict that you cannot feed the Bears you can interact with them and what they do is they had a bear that wasn't necessarily aggressive they do this all the time but there's some specific instance that piss people off wasn't necessarily being aggressive but learned that people would throw food at it and so well not only do we not have that bear doing it but we can't have other bears seeing that bears an example so what they do their first step is taking the bear far away you know somehow transporting them sedating them and if it comes back either a second or third time they euthanize it they have to yeah and all these people were furious no go no no we're doing this so that the Bears don't become dependent on humans for food if you euthanize one bear that prevents the rest of them they no longer can forage can hunt for themselves because they realize these people gonna throw us a sandwich and that's a great example of just people not knowing not being informed enough on an issue and instead deciding to be outraged like I don't know about grizzly bears I assume the Yellowstone Rangers kind of have their crap together on it well that's also like PETA people that don't want to admit that PETA kills thousands of cats and dogs every year and their heads a diabetic who uses insulin which came to you courtesy of animal testing yeah but she feels like that's okay because she's she's skinny fat but there's a great podcast that's available right now the most recent meat-eater podcast with Steve Rinella where he talks to a bear biologist who discusses the history of Yellowstone at one point in time the dumps where people and restaurants used to dump all their food it was places where people would go to watch to watch bear we did it at a campground Wow it was like that year was this gosh 90s but where were you not in Yellowstone no it was in Canada okay they'd already made it illegal in Yellowstone I fear no bears when we went we just drove by there was no one but it's like if you go down into this area it's really cool you get to see the Bears foraging one thing the hosts own it was one of the main like like mortality like you look at like mortality events yeah it was a huge mortality event because they went cold turkey they stopped dumping all the trash there and these Bears had become acclimated so much so that they'd stopped learning how to forage food and bears died like unmask yeah it's really kind of crazy that's also the flipside you know with a rescue dog where I tell people like we have a rescue dog people get so fed and willing to say but if you have kids probably better to go from a breeder you know because for example hopper on the road we don't know you know we don't know what happened to me happens to be the most affectionate loving dog that we've known but a dog like that that starving can learn to become much more of a wild dog you know that can be trained in them cuz they're scared there's they been scared and you bring him in for example he gets recall any gun ever since we've had him any handgun rifle pull it out goes nuts so he's seen gun he's seen something in a negative conversation with guns you can't know that so if you have some kid and he pulls out a squirt now he's not aggressive he's just to bark if he doesn't look like something and people I don't know if was ptoo some animal person got really mad well there are so many dogs I need homes I'm gonna listen I've rescued a dog I think if you know what you're handling you should if you're able but if you have kids who don't have a lot of dog training and you don't know where this dogs come from I place kids higher on the totem pole than dog how dare you you're a species I know I have a species this that's a new thing there's speciesism when we were kids Jamie you younger there was that film species where that blonde chick that's different where'd she go she quit I know she's probably doing stuff to pornography well how dare you maybe she's writing books well the the the grits oh I don't know I've never thought of black bears as being aggressive toward people yeah man Rinella the same guy who has the podcast I was talking about told me a story of a guy who went on his very first hunt and while he was in his tent a 500-pound predatory grizzly bear attacked him his friend shot the bear and hit him in the wrist the bear takes off out of the tent goes to another dudes tent and they shoot it in that tent to kill it so everyone's covered in blood and hair and it didn't kill it yeah they killed it but I mean the guy had a bullet wound in his wrist he had been mauled by this bear I mean this is his first hunting trip ever could you see that the Reverend yes you know there was a rumor before that film came out that no Leonardo DiCaprio gets raped by the bear did you mom that was front page and you are on the wrong web it was front page drug exactly people wrong and I remember thinking about that never watching it going this is an example of fake news whether it's the right or the left is going this is clearly not a bear rape scene but it was a huge rumor that was going around poster don't don't go see the red wasn't huge enough to reach my twitter page well you have a big Twitter page he's just too into it man you're too deep into the news of the world I told the story Chris Leben at the Reve reverent revenant revenant in so we're there this is I swear this is true and Chris Lee even thought it was faking faking so we're watching the revenant and it's right up that scene where he cauterizes his wound with a gun powder on his neck so we're sitting there and we're watching it and he's screaming and so for a second we didn't realize it a few rows down a guy's all of a sudden starts projectile vomiting while the Leonora's on three one and we're looking and we're gonna oh my god we think he starts shaking we think he's having a seizure my wife being a sweeter goes okay everybody move away someone call 9-1-1 and his his wife or his girlfriend there's like sweetie Arizona and it's going down to Rose we I go I wait for the ambulance they come in the guy has vomit all over him I think someone who's sitting front of my bottom on on the back of his head they thought for sure he had a seizure turns out he had fallen asleep and inhaled a popcorn kernel hmm and he was just choking a Norfolk time and then aspirating on his own vomit so we're watching this film the revenant one of the most graphic scenes in cinematic modern history what the hell is going on Wow and a coincidence yeah and it was I mean the guy was embarrassed he just fell asleep it was a scene like remember that movie what was that movie with not Matt Damon Matt Dillon well it was the movie where the two girls are making out by the pool oh yeah what if he watched that movie what if that scene was going down that popcorn kernel got stuck at his mouth he started projectile vomiting why would that be worse if you way worse just because it makes sense like the guy's scared there's a bear he's killing Leonardo DiCaprio no don't kill Leo you know don't do it to him he's a king of the world he's in the front of the fucking Titanic don't don't do it you know people freak out and like a bear attack but if you're freaking out like a lesbian event it turns out just coincidentally just pieman the story people gonna tell about you for the rest of your life yeah Bobby saw these two broads making out there were choked on his punch alone he's lumps by himself he just starts hurling changed his life bro said he took them popcorn but we know that never I've never seen like I mean from here yeah that like to go to static taking up the kid in the pie-eating contest and that Stephen King boom we stand by me remember that oh yeah yeah very pie contest because it wasn't like a Oman flow it was pressurized it's funny because he was also holding his mouth so it's coming on through a crack you know like this where it's going at squirting so we fell asleep with a popcorn kernals mouth at the revenant in the middle of that fucking really exciting movie in the middle of that scene right where he's cauterizing his own ass neck fuck I felt bad for him and imagine that if that if that wasn't his wife that was wasn't his fiancee there's a good chance they're not together did you think that movie was based on real-life events we have no idea was it supposedly but incorrectly oh really yeah it's not somebody sounds like I already have oh really didn't happen in an environment anything like the environment they filmed it in they filmed it in this like tropical rainforest in British Columbia the the guy never had a son when Leonardo DiCaprio son is killed in front of him the only thing that was true is guy got mauled by a bear made it back to camp he actually survived he made it back to camp that's and he's like what the fuck bro the guy's like sorry I thought you were dead that's it that's the movie the entire teaser was the lead up to the bear attack and it was him going back and killing the guy who left him behind who also held his son there was no son nobody killed anybody they fucked up by a bear and they left him alone that's interesting when you think about that you know you go back and do you like Weston Price you know at Weston Price foundation or did he like the fermented cod liver oil and stuff and they their big catalyst for like eating real fats and stuff and the guy claiming aware of this was yeah I think was less than a price foundation and we're advert advocates traditionally or DeLong's around for a long time yeah guy I think his name is Weston Price and because I always watch those movies like the revenant I go could you imagine how much it smelled and imagine what their teeth were like and this yeah but this guy claimed he went down to like you know third world sort of African nations where they didn't brush their teeth but they had perfect smiles and he claims it was because I don't know how I don't know if it's true at all but he says it was because they a lot of organ meats they were getting a lot of vitamin K natural vitamin D as opposed to kind of the sugary lifestyle which refined carbohydrates in the new world and that's a big part of like this whole kind of high saturated fat organs bone broths it's called like Weston something price foundation but remember there were these pictures side by side of people in the new world were in largely grain fed diets and these people were basically third world sort of tribesman but that these beautiful white teeth that make sense in some ways that people that live natural lives with natural foods than anything processed would be healthier yeah but the teeth now there were nice white teeth well for sure definitely deteriorates your teeth we know that we know that kids we eat a lot of sugar and don't brush their teeth and I think a lot of that was also that stuff getting caught in your gums and your teeth and just not good causes sugar it causes tooth decay we know that yep and the worst thing is sugarfree gummy bears you read those reviews on Amazon God what do they do to your asshole that's exactly what the reviews are on Amazon I swear to you if you just google sugarfree gummy bears just like my Apple has never been the same size since it's just a bunch of people who trolled the Amazon afternoon read the Amazon reviews for sugar-free harrybo gummies remember olestra there was an additive to like potato chips olestra just makes people just rock it shit well trans fats are now they're illegal but you have there was a grace period until 2018 I believe or maybe 19 right where companies are allowed to still use that stuff and their potato chips or wherever the fuck they sell up until like then like that's it like you poison people for two more years that's it well you know why we use terrible for you because of the same environmental vegetarian lobby who you know back then McDonald's use beef tallow from their fries there's no no you need to be using vegetable oil hydrogenated vegetable oil so that was a bunch of lobbyists no that's why we started in trans fats and now they're going actually margarine as not as good for you as butter and they've changed but that was a huge powerful lobbying group where the veget you know the San Francisco kind of hippie era that's why trans fats became ubiquitous well it was also a byproduct of the sugar industry arriving scientists to lie about the beneficial qualities of their sugar they just pretended the church fine its saturated fat that's the issue and everybody wants shit we got to get some margarine yeah these people went out and bought margin because it terrified of saturated fat because the sugar companies had bribed some scientists weird that when we were kids Country Crock margarine we didn't help so bad for you it's interesting now that that's been revealed and you find out that those people didn't even get that much money they got like the equivalent of fifty thousand dollars today right - literally lie to everybody about the the the they just made up a bunch of shit about saturated fat yeah and they they just diminished all the negative effects of sugar and people just started drinking that the milk from Captain Crunch remember that milk we get that fucking sugary Captain Crunch milk or salacious hops it's absolutely delicious you get the chocolate milk out of Coco Pops yeah oh my god Count Chocula oh my Jesus good we grew up on sugar I know and in Canada we we had a whole different I didn't realize I moved to the states corn pops in Canada are actually like spherical Captain Crunch they're not at all like corn pops in the states there are a lot of little differences because it's such a silly country where you'll be raised there and you'll coming up like the Oreos aren't the same super sugar Crispin's sugar in the title that's the sugar crisp here right yeah yeah was enough of that sugar Chris that's right super sugar crisp you imagine you have a goddamn drug in the name of your shit look at there you go that is crazy it's not even good it's illegal you go to jail if you even sell that super sugar bear does the sugar bear um yeah I mean sugar Chris yeah I'm a strange Mongoose then I'm a mongoose with the t-shirt ah then there was cookie krisp remember that cool cookies in milk but then there was Reese's puffs cereal look at that one smacks they have an Indian a cultural appropriation today look at that what does it have to do with a Native American what smacks why it's like Latinos selling cars they just put tits on it because it sells in their culture Oh inside is a free Indian car that's a special Indian some of them make an acceptable they created the Indian card so it's just as bad no it's fine frosted flakes go down to frosted flakes over there they stop there right yeah 1950 vitamin D yeah throw it in there there's no natural smell in there yep milk pussy the kids gonna get sick from sugar what kind of fucking shitty kids are you raising Reese's puffs cereal that was a big one everyone Reese's puffs lose his penis in a cup cereal yo that's you never had that no that was a little later than you I guess you might have been illegal in my country they might have been looking out for our best interest by the I remember because there was a there's like a fat black kid from hanging with mr. Cooper who did the commercials in Canada for reasons that Reese's puffs cereal who were sitting there as this kid he was in hanging with mr. Cooper and so as a kid you're like well we watched that show on TGIF we have to get Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Series gif up there that was doing that was a sin thing ABC you know hear it's a fucking place at Soldier yeah yeah bad wings too they're pretty bad in Kansas you're on the road it's true TGI Fridays what's the big deal banding in is is coming back to Bennigan's is back don't you remember they were gone away because it was like well okay Bennigan's we can do without notice I mean they went under and then they came back you up they were gone now they're back I don't know why huh whole new brand probably investment bankers probably some dudes from Marin County it's the globalists wires wireframe glasses those fucks skinny jeans well we're trying to do is bring back a really recognizable brand it's really important to America have you read we shall feel and we understand people try to come in and be like listen we can take your show even bigger we just think there are a few tweaks you ever get those people who approach you Oh which is interesting really everybody's like no no no Adil Kroll they got him though huh they did no no I did I did his show once and it was uh it was the most awkward thing I've ever done in my life why was it so awkward well cuz the Booker's I was doing Prager University it's like oh hey I know hook you up and um first off he's like I don't Crowell is he's not like you like come in and you talk off fair he kind of like doesn't doesn't really talk to you and tell your on-air mm-hmm which I can respect its professional but I wasn't on the Adam Carolla podcast it was Adam Corolla and dr. Drew had reunited to do like it wasn't it's not love line but it's effectively the same thing right and so they still do that back and that was their first week now is there for like the first week they brought it back and so it's him and dr. Drew sitting there doing their stick at a table and I'm literally at the end of the table with nothing to say like yeah that sounds about right they're taking callers from people didn't and bring you in a little bit but it just you know I Adam Carolla does his podcast like this was an interview and that was just it was really weird and I think what happened was they didn't realize he wasn't doing the show that day and they brought me they were very nice dr. Drew and and Adam was gracious afterward but it was it was clear like it's a two guy show taking phone calls and you were just there yeah I was pretty much today they say your name no no they did they did but it was like hey I want to take phone calls well Adam does essentially does an internet radio show that's what his show is right you know I mean he was he had his radio show that was a big hit radio show and then the station went under in LA and I think he just decided to do the same format and just do that same format online yeah that makes it when we started our show you know it's syndicated and so we had radio and so we had all these commercial breaks we used to do at 6:00 a.m. on Friday mornings out of Detroit and what we do well no one really cares about these commercial breaks nationally so we just did a bunch of sketches and fake commercials and that's what created all these characters that people have treated these Twitter profiles for because we just said well we're not gonna run an ad for a local car dealership we're gonna do a fake news break and we would do like fake tornado warnings and stuff like that which is highly illegal by the way we learned that one later on because they kind of work with the format online and now we just took it off took it off radio yeah fuck radios much dying market that thing is not gonna last it's stupid was last time you turned on your radio I have a never yeah I found remembers another person I think in like all the cells in your body except your neurons switch every 7 years that means every cell in my body's never listened to the radio that's fucking real man it's like if someone said to me when was the last time you watched a VHS cassette I was another person yeah I wasn't even me I don't take responsibility for me of 14 years ago because if I did I would still be pissed at shitting my pants when I was a baby okay cuz I would take it back to when I was three and I bit my sister or something I don't know the fuck I did but you know I mean figure I'm I don't know I don't remember three is my point it's like if you go back to the things you did when you were developing individual yeah so I feel like every seven years I don't even want I don't even want to know yeah what I did 14 years ago three it's pretty rough years I called my dad's pastor a little bastard three you're probably right well cuz my grandfather called me a little bastard right I thought it was a term of endearment and somebody is like this is Esther Kevin butcher hey how you doing little bastard well that pastor should have known this little kid is getting fucked over at home no you know what happened actually he got outed and this is actually a point gay no no he got out from the church because there was a his pregnant I think his pregnant wife bomb which wasn't a Detroit Lions game and there was a guy with a bullhorn behind her right up against her ear where this guy was a pad but a really good guy regardless of someone's you know religious affiliation but a good guy and he's like hey man could you stop my wife's here you know whatever she was either pregnant or something guys looked into it and kept doing it right next to his wife's ear like got it right up on her ear and he ended up kicking the guy's ass getting into a fight with him because the guy was getting up on their space and get didn't exactly turn the other cheek he did not he did when he asked him to and so there was a whole vote and I remember that was that was when I was pretty young I thought well so they outed him they got rid of him meaning I could be wrong there was a hole up there was a whole controversy over it and I remember learning about it as a kid thing well that's that seems pretty reasonable the guy getting up and his wife's grill and bothering a pregnant woman yeah it's like what do you do because human nature is definitely to hit the person but do you just leave you know because your night is ruined yeah period well I said kick his ass I mean I think what happened was no no I don't think he kicked his ass I'm saying but you got physical and he got physical with the guy and got the better of him so it could have been a shoving match could have been a punch he didn't beat him it was an American History X curb stomp I'm just saying no one expected a pastor to do anything to Bry his wife I get it yeah and that was a big deal I called a little bastard hmm that's the end of that rabbit trail well you were right once he got kicked out the Crowder kid he's got vision he sees the future there's no one places he's knew that guy was a brawler he's in fucking bleachers brawler gets up there get slick it up fucks his wife gets her pregnant tension to the game that crowd has gone flat he called it he's gonna go to Fox News for four years hey most four years of his life I saw him on this show once with Amy show me I get with it oh I took your side yeah I get with it what did she do she you guys were on some show and she was trying to like diminish you as a comedian yeah she was trying to say you weren't a comedian yeah and then an interesting thing I said there's like a thing that people do in the world of stand-up comedy where they just say oh he's an opener he's a middle act right you know like there's like there's just weird sort of a thing and someone like if they're looking like shit on you all you do time you do comedy yeah are you do comedy yeah what are you done he'd do a few open mikes like you're a fucking comedian yeah I really it's very very luminous like that yeah she did that right off and I knew it because she was asking me questions in the greenroom like where do you where do you do comedy what do you do and she was like she asked me what do you perform at churches I said no I said no I never have and she but she was so inflexible an argument she was old women maybe 20 to 23 probably would have shit on you too dude probably what I would write next to that changed if you look at the Rihanna Amy what a fucking dog tag do well no I don't think so it changed round things so what do you think would happen you would one that well I think I think if you to bang your head it done really well yeah yeah I think I think if you watch that thing her argument was you're not a real comedian I would have never said information and Schumer's a thirtysomething year-old girl who bitches the people on twitter now and is unmarried and miserable are you comparing lives I am I am and I think I was right well I think that whenever someone announces she's funny by the way okay good for you I think whenever someone says that you're not a comedian thing that's yeah that's an issue I have an issue with that because we all started out as I opened my curse and when you're talking to someone who's 22 years old when I was 22 I was an open mic er I was doing open mic nights like this just for laughs at that point so it wasn't open my career yeah I mean and you know I had okay were you getting paid you will you have factional community your making your living off of stand-up comedy I've only made my living ever off of acting stand-up comedy writing since 18 years old Wow so when you were 22 years old all your bills were you live on your mom what's going on how you paying your bills at stand-up comedy we're 22 so I was I was I would do stand-up then I had some pretty relatively successful acting gigs did some films commercials some TV at that point I was a Fox News contributor which paid me a retainer I did freelance writing where they would pay by the word so you were doing stand-up on a regular basis see you were stayin up calm I don't do it much anymore I would readily admit like now I don't because the show and everything is a 14-hour day right now I would never claim to be as good of a stand-up as as you or Nick DiPaolo or a builder by the way but Nick DiPaolo asked me to plug he's doing his substantives but yeah Boston yeah his stand-up special is going on see so this Thursday so please go he's probably the best for my money one of the best living comedians certainly one of my favorite Nick DiPaolo was goddamn hilarious and he was here yesterday and he fucking killed me he's a he's a very fun in a very very very good dude and another weirdo right-wing fuck yeah he is but it's pretty common Christopher Titus did the same thing that was the same thing we started losing the gun issue I get paid first oh well you know what that's he what he was doing was trying to save whatever was going on in his mind or there's a conversation where there was a competition whatever the little battleground and his mind was going on he was trying to save his his patch of land well I think and I think it would work with most people I think you would probably go there's a lot of stand-up comedians they they have a void and they're funny this has becomes their identity and so for me it was never my whole identity wrapped up and stand up I mean I had been doing acting since I was 12 years old and I was tutored on set with a lot of things you know I did kids cartoons that show Arthur's how I started out so I did stand-up and I'll be the first to admit I did it as a means to getting to other avenues and then I turned out I fell in love with it but I never plan on doing stand-up my whole life so if I were I'm a stand-up comedian I'm a road coming I love being you know waking up for leftover drugs and being unhappy and bitching about my manager leftover drugs have you ever heard of such thing yeah yeah Turkey Oh drugs yeah whose charge this the pride and stand up of barely getting by kind of like New York right you're in a shitty city in a two-bedroom apartment with five roommates right and you're proud of it because you can tell everyone how miserable you are so just that's not real oh yeah no no it's real once you become successful it's never real while it's struggling and people try to act like it is right like oh man I couldn't do anywhere else it's the energy of this city it's like you literally shit in a drain in the kitchen you know and those in the Lower East Side you're seen as what's that Lower East Side it's like so saturated I am NOT small right wing right wing people are always exaggerating I look at mentoring in the East Village cuz they'd have like nineteen polish family members per apartment and the toilet was right in the middle of the kitchen because they weren't designed sometimes you have to dig a shit there's one for mom while she's making spaghetti they're multitasking she could squat it's got one of those little squatty potty things you ever seen that one sign like you go to some places it's freaking did buy too many people from Asia you'll see signs that show like person standing on the shitter squatting down it's like I got a red line through it don't shit Raceway yes pull has it become that popular squatty potty I've seen it I've seen there's a squatty potty yes I do and I would assume so comes the caveman thing the bowel movement well if I prefer to shit in a hole in the ground in the kitchen time to dig like look at the guy no no right that would just isn't joking one this is a joke one but I have literally seen that that's real that is an actual real for people in Asia Ari Shaffir went to China and he has this fucking hilarious bit about it and I don't want to I don't want to do his bit that's that's real but in China he went into a restroom and there was literally a hole in the ground and you were supposed to squat over the hole and they had no toilet paper yeah that is real and he told me that when people from Asia who were used to that environment as the norm come over to the United States sometimes they actually stand on the toilet seat and and shit that way so the toilet seat is not designed for the aim to be accurate if you're if you're sitting on the toilet seat you'd be crapping on the water tank they don't know any better bro they're from another country without Trump without Trump leading them they don't even know anything man tossing defending Trump I think do you think he's a good leader are you happy that he's in office are you is it good this shake up I will say this I I I think that again the left has behaved so poorly and with this like yeah yeah I think that Ron Donald Rome has been a lightning rod I would disagree with him on some policy issues for sure but I think that because everyone has called him a not seeing a racist and a sexist in a trans folk that's removed those arguments from the table for for at least several decades because people going yeah but you said it about John McCain and Mitt Romney everyone you disagree with his a racist I think that cards been played too much and because of Donald Trump it's been overplayed and I think now we see with our channel granite it's not as big as you know the outreach you guys have but it's grown pretty substantially and a lot of our audience are self professed liberals going you know what I used to hate you I used to I used to watch The Young Turks and then we used to watch them crap on you but actually some of these points make sense and I used to think everyone disagree with me lose racist and I think because it's so overplayed it's left such a bad taste in people's mouth I do think that Donald Trump has served a real purpose to shine a light on that and you know that may be the most important point of all at this point in our culture what's political correctness yeah I think when things go too far one way people get upset with that and when people get too biased whether it's towards the left or towards the right it tends to balance things out in the other direction like Robert Anton Wilson called Lyndon Johnson the pacifist president you know I called him the pacifist president because he was such a cunt that he created so many pacifists because of his atrocities that he ordered in the Vietnam War people were so upset that more people became pacifists during the Lincoln or excuse me there during the Lyndon Johnson administration than than ever before you know by the same token he called Reagan the intellectual president because more people just went oh my god you gotta fuck god damn it it's important know things yeah god damn it its support to be smart like just say no bitch what are you talking about just say no you're him you're bringing heroin in from Vietnam just say no you're selling coke in South Central to pay for the fucking country this is really stirs obviously you don't know though Oliver North story story dude the real rick ross not the rapper but the real Rick Ross has been on my podcast twice was a drug dealer in South Central who they put away for a life due to the three strikes rule yeah but became didn't know how to read okay went to jail was a drug dealer made millions of dollars selling coke okay did not have any idea who was bringing him the coke Holly was getting and where was coming from the profits that they were making was literally paying for Oliver North to arm the conscious versus the Sandinistas I mean it was literally it was all proven in court I mean this is what my current reconstituted in front of what was the I forget what the gathering was but on television on c-span Michael Rupert who was a narcotics officer for the Los Angeles Police Department who was also been on my podcast for he committed suicide he was the guy that was the focus that movie collapse remember that movie collapse where he's talking about remember he in that he it was just him smoking cigarettes sitting there talking about what he knew about the economy what he knew about all these different things that were in our society and how there's only a certain amount of time for its gonna collapse it was kind of a crazy doom and gloom documentary but the point is he had caught CIA agents rogue cowboy CIA agents in them in the middle of selling drugs yeah in South Central Los Angeles reported it and was in trouble because of that and decided to go public with it and they were selling these drugs they were making shitloads of money and they were transferring the money like to arm these rebels well Rick Ross was in the middle of that and didn't know he was in the middle of that he was literally selling drugs and funneling this whole thing went to went to jail as an illiterate person who could literally couldn't read learned how to read in jail became a lawyer jail like leg learned okay yeah I think figured out that you can't charge him for the three strikes rule if it's one thing if it's if you're charging him with a bunch of counts under one incident it's the three strikes law doesn't apply and that's how they got him in jail so now he's out like all of this came because of that well I knew about Oliver North and in the Contra thing I didn't know about rick ross specifically well this is this there's been proof there's some elements of our government have sold drugs in pravesh neighborhoods in order to fund black ops like this is a fact and this is one of the things that Robert Anton Wilson was talking about when he was talking about the Reagan administration became the intellectual president because people were so frustrated by how fucking crazy and chaotic and movie like you know things had become that they had decided to arm themselves with information I wonder if a big part of it that too is the backlash with Ronald Reagan because everyone said again he had no chance he was a moron and he won in a landslide if he'll go alright screw you we're gonna consider him an intellectual like with Donald Trump listen I don't think Donald Trump's intellectual no one was considering an intellectual they were considering him a great American Ronnie had slicked back hair and his wife stood still and everybody was happy well being between seances at the White House her astrologer make a change but I think people might have just been like you know what you called him a moron for so long and everyone in voted him a moron de then well they didn't really call Reagan a moron yeah they did well no they called George Bush yeah they did yes I did the PlayBook with with anyone who's conservative Republican is if they can make you a moron they will if not you're evil right Cheney can't be a moron he's evil I think you're confusing the narrative a little bit cuz well Reagan might have been simplistic but he was a wonderful speaker like he he gave really articulate well-thought-out speeches that spoke to Americans again longing for this nostalgia of a time where the Norman Rockwell painting made sense right and that's what Ronald Reagan represents it to a lot of pedia a lot of people they were you know they were coming out of the chaos of the Carter Administration and the fucking Vietnam and yeah gas lines and the Iranians taking the American hostages and all that crazy shit and Ronald Reagan came along he's like I'm gonna fix it I'm your dad never he's like we're in yeah but the media treat him like a real moron if you go back and watch that and right before his landslide election win they made if you look at the the electoral map sort of the polls and predict predictions they give him no chance of winning and then full of shit about Colorado and traffic deaths should we go and fuck you up with this - yeah what do you have a guy looking to feel bad about the Colorado thing at all what I never said Colorado I said states that legalized what other ones are there well you didn't bring up the source that I wrote about I can but the fact that you're still hung up on please hope please what I got the article I've been looking at it for like last few minutes on your website yeah there's a couple statements that are really bad just off - just off the gate like this right here if you want to get higher or more on hold on please that's a common battery hold on but fine after all things like Coachella wouldn't exist is this your article yeah I think it's an article on my site Wayne if you can want to get high you're well you're a moron yeah thank you is it you're a moron I think who's Courtney she's one of the best writers I think I've ever dare you not read then but so the next article links to a couple like this for instance is one that says it has deadliest year of traffic fatality since 2008 yeah this article doesn't say anything about marijuana not one one thing doesn't mention me weed at once it does say that it could be attributed to crisis people driving people in the state sure etc etc I'm gonna defend myself here because you have someone here at the ready and what you do is instead of bringing up information this is what happens with Christopher Titus right you don't have information that you bring up you have another guy look up a source that you specifically want him to find I didn't ask him to bring that I brought up Washington Post and goes this is what's wrong with your article taking enough talk you didn't have a joke the joke in there about the things that Coachella wouldn't exist if there weren't pop that's a joke right to try and go do you think people who smoke are morons no it's a joke okay and no pots not comparable to alcohol there are tests that determine how much alcohol content is in your bloodstream we can't you do that with weed so it's impossible to handle these incidents in the same way that's okay but there have been tests where they showed people but go back to what he said would have been tests where they've shown people drunk versus on marijuana and the people on marijuana drove far better okay that's true so this is also anecdotal no it goes that's a your point right let's say someone has alcohol these tests well I don't haven't read your test okay so why don't you arguing against them no I'm saying I agreed with your point earlier so why are you saying there I mean what is anecdotal if you're saying some people drive better on maro I'm not saying that I've said there have been tests what they've shown that people draw it better on marijuana than alcohol what anecdote my point is if you looking to be really good at this argument settle down you said you wouldn't pile on and you got two people on the show when someone comes on the show Jared can not enter congratulations you're not on the show and all he did was pull up and some fuckin to mention bringing up information me without a laptop no he brought it you said what would be the one thing that you've changed your mind is your problem with two people are correct and you're incorrect does that bother you I don't agree that you're correct what are you talking about you just pulled up some statistics that showed the Colorado has less traffic fatalities in statistics though he did and you can you can track what is the issue that you would care about the least that you've changed your mind I said probably wouldn't even talk about that's that's a long ver of what you said well if there been more fatalities since marijuana has been legal in those things we've discussed not true why are you so obsessed with the pot because you're not right and it doesn't matter if we've talked about it for four hours in this instance you are incorrect you know you're correct in that instance the traffic fatalities of increased in areas were part of increased we did the same study in Michigan where pot was legalized and people were actually selling more marijuana and underage kids I don't think we have anything to do with it it doesn't have anything to do with traffic fatalities unless you can prove there's more traffic fatalities and underage kids since marijuana has been legal yeah there been several articles that have made that claim made that assertion what's fine written about it let's find them they all come from one article mostly and it's from the triple-a stats and this is the stats that they said and I suppose almost all the articles you're talking about come from this one article okay okay so this is the percentage of drivers involved in fatal crashes who recently used marijuana more than doubled from 8 to 17 percent from 2014 their 2013 to 2014 one in six drivers involved in fatal crashes from 2014 had recently used marijuana which is the most recent data available now do you understand smashes involving marijuana pinion it's an opinion alarming well is that is that a matter of more people smoking marijuana because it's legal or it's a met is it a matter of the marijuana causing these accidents is this you know what else is true do you know what else is true that all these people also had alcohol in their system do you know that well no and we don't know that a lot of them rewind the tape a lot of them well you made a list let's find out it doesn't say anything in the article about alcohol though and for sure this should have tested that makes a point that you're gonna have an obvious position that would disagree with this one single article so if I can finish a point you've talked about interruption let me finish the one point that I'm making well you read through marijuana you a chance for marijuana roadside right can we absolutely can you before you do that as you said how many of the how many of the marijuana related fatalities also involved alcohol because it's a massively significant percentage yeah so you can't necessarily say that just because they have these new tests for marijuana especially roadsides now the problem is you can't okay I'll tell you what I'll give you that what do you give with me let's say you're correct but here's the thing let's interact physiologically it doesn't have an effect on motor skills the way alcohol does or it doesn't slow down your response time well I know we've had several doctors in the show two of whom had differing opinions on that they don't have to be right we have Iranians of it do they do themselves do they know what it's like CBS News caught blatantly distorting cannabis study says the signals from doubles fatal comes from mini press news mint press news so again we can go into questioning sources all day long if you have someone else bring them this is a good source maybe this or something else one issue and you said what's the issue you don't have your sources right here I've looked them up there's people online also sourcing them they are skewed you're skewing them to make sure the Washington Post study that you skewed but you're not the Washington Post you're supposed to be the answer to the Washington say that someone's evil so I'm evil too you just said there's that way you're so that's the argument that you just no I didn't mean you just said come on made that argument and all of a sudden when someone mentions pot you put on the rear world view the lens of we know shit has nothing to do with we but you have an argument I haven't made an argument you said increased we showed you what have wrote what have you shown me we showed you the statistics that show that marijuana and traffic violations the more links to lay not because of accident right okay so what else is causing the drop number and why can what your reason number what increase this fake increase from your brain it's not real it's not real calicoes it's not real so where is it real what was it comes from as triple a study that was dressed your glands right counsel Triple A is owned by the Bilderberg Group Oh God you don't even know this so now we're gonna go to we'd cures cancer and people having meetings in grams it's got one one article that says one thing and one article from Colorado that says there's been a decrease in traffic fatalities right you're not willing to recognize that I just said let's give that to you because this entire conversation started with you saying what issue would you change the mind on no it started a pot because you know this argument started with you saying that it causes more fatalities that's not true you said which issue do not care about it I say pot and then she said causes mortality what's your opinion on pot and I said I really don't care if people want to smoke pot I think it's a state issue I honestly don't care I've changed my mind where as a kid I thought it was harmful I don't think it's harmful didn't you say that it caused traffic fatality you said well let's expand on this what issue do you have with pot I said I don't like the dishonesty where people just say it cures cancer it'll end the war on drugs it's it's completely harmless and I have some arguments to not harm I know it's not entirely harmless well it's not without consequences well consequences because there's so much leeway there how have you have you started from me saying I probably couldn't care less about this out of all the other issues that we discussed and you lasered in on that and go where do we disagree no because a huge blind spot no it's not huge blind it's deaf don't have that if you say that marijuana is in some way or another a dangerous thing yeah I can tell you that it's no no I didn't say in a dangerous thing what did the consequence okay what is what do you believe marijuana does for example well no I'm not gonna get baited into this because you're gonna you're trying to force me to say that I don't think pot cures cancer and there's a big forum now listen smoke pot no that's I will ask this I'll try to say what the caller you come on my show right now you're in front of me right now were stationed you and I right now oh that's not good to read snores it's I'm here to have two people let's face like before you swing in a room with no think of Amy and I gang up on you think you would've done well in that argument come on man cuz I want to find out how you feel how you think wife see if you get defensive for some reason you said you think if her and I work together you think you would have done well on that yeah because I want to see if you get defensive well in a conversation why wouldn't you do that right no but you've made it to hall about the pot issue know that another do it pod Amy shoot you've gotten into this pot issue because the issue and it's the one area you're adorable you're adorable and there's something you're so used to not a real comedian no you're adorable you're someone on an open territory without someone else to back up your argument it's never happened if it's back up when someone pulls up information realize is he pulls up evidence to the contrary if I was wrong he would stick it right in my face and we would laugh about it and that's what he does that's why you pull that for the contrary and I've given it to you what evidence you ever give me shit no I've given you the argument what I'm fine let's say there's no there's no causation let's say that wasn't backed up well enough let's give you that argument okay what's this Jamie to decrease in traffic me doing this stuff we don't do that this is what we always do it's just talking about facts solicit your poll please there are some there are also some evidence that medical that doesn't make any sense there are also some evidence that's naughty that there's also okay I'm wrong that medical marijuana laws may contribute to decreasing traffic fatalities one study published in the Journal of law and economics 2013 reviewed traffic fatalities in the nineteen states that had passed medical marijuana laws by 2010 and found that legalization is associated with an 8 to 11 percent decrease in traffic fatalities for the year after the laws took effect the researchers from the University of Colorado Denver and elsewhere also found the decrease is more significant for alcohol related fatalities at thirteen point two percent a squash the interest I can ask a question please do why is that study from 2010 considered completely valid to you in the study from triple-a in 2014 considered completely in this triple A's got a fuck biased in there you go because there you go yes company different in charge well what are they basing it on what so your argument this is this is the only valid study because Triple A is but this is a study you ignore it do you think that's right I think they're lying be right I think I'd be right so if they're right if that studies right then you were wrong right if that what if that studies right then they were wrong right I could be wrong you were wrong right when you outing it out so we proved that in Colorado you were wrong you didn't hear that study is true well you didn't asked one question and then you get a you'd like you doing this don't you Joe you lied early said I'll give it to you win the argument and you bring up another thing about pot well it's because you don't know you don't really give up you relax yeah I said I'll give it to you you're right let's assume oh yeah you're definitely wrong let's assume I'm on okay so what else would be the problem with marijuana if it wasn't traffic 15/0 right no not zero what's your buts come on man we're talking about real issues what would be the other problems unfortunate Alec before you go oh man just loosen up let's talk about life in jiu-jitsu then you're gonna want then let's talk you're upset I just want to get you away from your left versus right talking points omni cuz love cyclists cuz little people with conviction or left-right paradigm Bertrand centrist I kind am Joe you Brad Joe here's the thing and I started off very and I still mean the the company things I said but you can't bring people on and call them pussy and dumb come on bro I can't and then continue going back to an issue and with with someone who agrees with you entirely and act as though well someone will not your defensive well of course some defensive well I think that you were spewing a little bit of anti marijuana propaganda about traffic fatalities I want a pair of propaganda that's right I'm not thinking you're paid by anybody but I just think you had a point of view what I push the propaganda inanition means I have to be pushing more necessarily that someone is telling you to do it it's just that you had a point again you had dug your heels in it's not propaganda it's proper to wrong it and you are spouting it out but that statistics proved different well okay then I would say it's propaganda or someone saying insane you're yours cancer I'm not saying you're promoting up again okay pull that up then yours can find out with not saying cures doesn't make you worse cancer nothing to answer and that was what I was talking about literally nothing chores anything I mean things type of your listeners will tweet me say they're seniors Rob that cures anything think street things your immune system system fails play traffic here okay what what trolley Oh cures things polio vaccine okay polio vaccine doesn't cure things you fuck it prevents you from getting polio the diseases a few understand what you just said you just yourself no I didn't just know that disease is not effectively cured the person who has polio we're talking about marijuana curing cancer on people that don't have cancer yet that's not what you signed up faxing for cancer what you're saying is marijuana cures cancer with people that have cancer there's not a fucking drug you proved yourself no I don't like medicine that proved right that you can't fucking cure polio with a medicine you get so aggressive right now you have a blind spot I'm pretty sure there's drugs out there that cure some diseases I'm sure I never heard of him well lady you know their name one not offhand if I had someone who could bring it up no you don't have to bring it up man you're gonna argue for it shouldn't I do argue for it I don't think you think that's incorrect your in your immune system has to be in place if you are fuck if you're you like dying and someone gives you some sort of a drug how many drugs are there that cure a nasty disease that's killing you and how many of them have to be also compensated your immune system has to kick in as well there's a bunch of factors it's not like how many I mean there's penicillin that kills some some like venereal diseases and all sorts of different fucking horrible infections yeah but there's not a lot but it takes your immune system has to be an effect too there's there's a lot of factor because now we're going to the definition of cure and man because you're talking about fucking polio nothing cures polio bitch and marijuana no one say in marijuana all the time assholes this is people that say you're not see those are same people that say you're a Nazi now it's pretty common pretty fuckin Nazi punch Nazis a woman on the show had a woman on the show a psychiatrist who basically said she said people who are adult healthy smoke pot shouldn't Pro not a problem it is a problem for the developing brain people who are under the age of 25 she explained as Hawaii correct and she I don't think they they think that the human brain is even fully developed your fluid some text and she talked about specifically also people who might have mental illnesses whether it's schizophrenia bipolar most people don't realize that or depression it goes unrecognized and she talked about how for those people marijuana can act as a trigger mechanism so she said healthy people none of these conditions marijuana is probably relatively benign but for some of these people and most people who might have these conditions are afflicted by them it could be a real problem she's got some very good points but do you know they are weed cures cancer this dumb bitch should get off the show do this cannabis hasn't shown just kill cancer cells in laboratory tests see question six you know it doesn't cure cancer though kill cancer cells no one's saying cure cancer you compare it compared it to turmeric you compare all these things but look the the point being I think you agree and I agree that as long as it doesn't hurt other people any more than anything else like sugar hurts other people look if you want to make an argument for high insurance rates you want to look at the overall causes of disease in this country and why insurance and health insurance cost so much you would almost immediately go towards simple sugar like simple sugar is a huge problem with people who are obese obesity is a huge issue in this country and it's a major factor when it comes to health care costs right I think it's adorable that you're telling me how to craft arguments it's it's an easier argument to say that ice cream should be illegal and is that marijuana should be illegal no I don't and I think tell me well now I'm gonna I'm gonna say what I was about to say beforehand because you keep redirecting the conversation and your turn and for some reason you're turning into something hostile that it really doesn't need to cost it might be to you yeah I didn't feel weird about it I feel great it is it is when someone comes in somewhere they know they disagree and someone ought to other people the same opinion you're gonna do it team up he doesn't even have any I think that look at this what you're doing right now Joe is like you talked about with people in jujitsu this is what I think there are now hundreds ient if excited say that I think that you through these arguments were cannabis cures cancer I think that you think these arguments work and I think it's like someone going to jujitsu for the first time you've never done it I don't think you've ever actually gotten to a place without someone who can bring up sources for you I don't think you've gotten into an argument or done anything with a debate team or people would actually hold you accountable to the argument that you make I think what you're saying you don't think that I have if you don't know what conversation so what are you somebody with me 24/7 I think right now you're the kung-fu guy hitting the the kung-fu doll with the spikes and you've convinced yourself that this is an argument that would work if he had other people more qualified than myself to discuss it and you decided ozone in on an art this is a huge way of you diffusing all these stats that Jamie keeps bringing up is more than a hundred studies exactly it proves that cannabis cures cancer exactly do you deny you don't need a judge my Jamie Jamie's pulling shit off the internet specifically about something where I changed my mind okay you clearly were ready or upset about the pot down wasn't nothing about that anymore because I don't really care about it and I think states should be able to legalize it if you don't care about it she fucking crazy three follow-up questions if you like me asking you why you endorsed Bernie Sanders on the show Nathalie Sonya Tom he's insane with the socialist stuff I don't think it's very genuine what you're doing what Kelly no it's not you Q started on with traffic fatalities and I did start on you said what is she's red and not talked about and this is exactly why right because we've talked about nations and always occur that was one of the things he to this transition this wasn't it and there's no what if conversation that comes from it oh sure there is no for people who are listening to this is extremely productive because they understand how someone with blinders can ignore the evidence sure and figure out some way where they're being wronged intellectually someone like someone will say that oh you should be in some sort of a debate you've never been in a debate you don't know what fuckin debates I've been in no you don't know what conversation with you and your boy Stephen come on why is this bullying political there are two people who hold one opinion asked me on something that I don't care about follow-up three four questions to go into an area where you two are very specifically passionate and I said I don't want to talk about it you don't want to talk about it cuz you're wrong no I don't talk because I don't care because he keeps show stage want to legalize it that's fine but it is a valid issue when people of Colorado are looking at this now and there are people in Colorado who might vote differently on the marijuana issue because of how it's perceived or because of the information at hand and I believe that people in Colorado should be able to vote they voted for pot but if they want to vote the other way in states they have the right to do that who's arguing against that well that was my point when we're talking about marijuana my point was when I worked at Fox we were thrust under panels where you had to talk about this because it was going on in Colorado I can't believe you called me a bully that's such a left-wing town you are how dare you you are how dare you how dare is how is it really you are what you use these absolutes and call smart and then say well okay let me give you one that I can pull from my memory thank you all of them were on alcohol that did fuck that up yeah you've done it several times but we did worse discussion are you doing that I know is a large number there's a large numbers is narconon or one of those company one of those there's there was one it was unlikely source yeah well you don't tell me have to leave now like this I surround well you're gonna miss your flight no matter what now you're fucked we're gonna be fine dude I'm not gonna be fine I'm not gonna make my flight back yeah you're gonna be fine you're live in America could be in Ethiopia right now huddling in a fucking Hut you know trying to protect yourself from a some rabid animal yeah don't be scared we're gonna be fine you got a little defensive we thought we're friends did listen I thought we're gonna have some fun we were having fun and then toward the end of the conversation you asked me what does she do not care about I don't really care about the pot which I thought I cared about when I was 21 you said you wouldn't defend issues when you were from when you were seven seven years ago right on your cells every well 21 I was probably a lot harsher on pot than I am today I thought it was worse I grew up around it I had negative experiences then I realized that was anecdotal I don't really care much anymore I don't think state should be able to do what they want to do then three four five follow-up questions so we could get to a point into this debate where the show is now going on two three hours long and I've missed my flight well you were trying to say was that people that are pro marijuana ignore the negative consequence of marijuana and I asked you what those were right and you said traffic fatalities one of them and then we tried to find out if that's true and we found out it's not didn't find out that it's not true you made an argument that it's not true but we didn't we didn't definitively find out that it's not true a lot of statistics well you just it's very easy to do that when you ignore opposing statistic no it's fine plenty of time man you're not gonna get your flight you've got a lot of time this is this is an interesting argument right it's an interesting argument because it shows what happens when people not necessarily disagree but getting a new position where one person wants to have the upper hand and you keep jockeying back and forth we're trying to figure out who's gonna wind up on the top of the heap no there's no jockeying back and forth now you're the one jockeying back and forth sweetie you know honey if that's a pussy come on fuck that honey that might be dumb fuck might be bullying yeah sweetie what you've done come I did it as a joke cuz I thought we're friends you don't think when we talk every now and then I didn't like you do but you don't think we're friends you brought me a pipe he gave me a pipe I did give you a pipe you know my podcast twice I know I'll fight you back here's the truth are you upset more than me what's more upsetting when you say you're defensive and you have somebody else to bring up sources that's let's be blunt that's it no I don't want you to look up and Jamie will be let me tell you something if Jamie found something that shows me I'm wrong and he does all the time he pulls it up well not gay Jarrod no if it is a standing pot on our show we do it differently and that's why I invited you on the show how do you do it differently okay - comes in the show if Sally Kohn comes in the show if you come on the show and you say I want to talk about pot in the show if you say that and you say I disagree with you I say okay not gay Jared not a word and you don't bring up any sources this is going to be me I'd let him talk I be like you think I would love Jerry talks all the time but I don't think it's fair why not I would talk to him - I don't think - one in her argument is fair so on one you know it's not and if he disagrees with me and you disagree to me together we can go back and forth all together I don't care I don't mind if there's three people get another friend that hates pot I don't hate pot well I mean just a spot I said mischaracterizations and absolutes there I don't hate pot I'm not saying you do I'm saying get a friend who hates pot break is not our friend who hates pot get another friend dared get another friend another Jamie look I should have used the word also no because the implication there's another meaning you hate pot no I said Jo get another person how to endorse Bernie Sanders and then had a thing on his face I think it would imply these arguments I think I gave you the argument and you continued for another hour Jo didn't really he gave it to me with a caveat and that caveat is that I'm a bully and that Jamie pulls up statistics and only benefit you are you are how am i how is it a bully when two people are talking how is it bully not two people talking now you don't have a conversation with two people talking you have a fail-safe you have other people who agree with you you have an audience who agrees with you I'm on your program talking to my audience man just two people talking let me be clear okay I don't hate pot okay I couldn't care less if you want to smoke pot if States want to legalize pot okay I couldn't care less about that now okay pot is not a substance without consequence that's all and some of those consequences can be damage to developing brain when they're 25 wait a psychiatrist don't talk about it and people called her a dumb bitch who you know and doesn't weed cures cancer there have been statistics and reports on fatalities increasing regarding marijuana you may not accept them and maybe you're right in those sources maybe your sources are more Val than my sources I'll grant you that so my issue is when people are dishonest and only present one side of the issue I just presented several sides and on my show on a regular basis listen if you want to smoke pot I couldn't care less go ahead and smoke pot and I think that the people who tried to make you think you know reefer madness and wet and wacky tabacky I think that's overblown but I also think there are some issues that people who simply want to justify it sometimes a habit which could be negative to some people not all overlooked completely one side of the issue and there is an entire side of the medical community who disagrees with you and I don't know that I agree with them or disagree with them yet wait a min the medical community there is entire side to the medical community who would disagree with your position my position no that I that that you think marijuana is a benign substance I don't think it's benign to developing brains we were to discuss that okay a good example developing brains why I don't think a lot I think a lot of I would agree I think a lot of kids listen to I know you're not responsible it's like you should be 18 or 18 in Canada you should be 16 year old to drive a car you're not telling kids to go and smoke up but I think a lot of people who are listening you have many young listeners who are in that developmental stage certainly under the age of 25 who only hear the positive virtues extolled of marijuana sometimes they're not entirely honest sometimes they're not entirely accurate I should say I don't think that's necessarily a good thing necessarily accurate how so positive talked about how harmful marijuana could be to the developing brain under yeah we have many time have you in a way that you've conceded that's valid not we've said I don't think you should do anything when I don't think like any 15 year olds to do anything to their brain because we don't know what the fuck happens to your brain when you give a kid alcohol I did it I'm sure you probably did it too when was it when did you drink first how old were you probably 50 first beer quick I think I was 14 the first time I got drunk with my friends I mean it's terrible it's not good for you it's not smart it's definitely not smart and I know and you know and I'm sure we all know someone who did get completely overindulgent in marijuana and became one of those wake-and-bake people that ruined their life and I think people can do that with almost any substance anything that psychoactive it I think people do that with cigarettes where they do they need that fucking cigarette more than they need anything I think a lot of AAA people do that with cigarettes and alcohol they replaced their weird addiction to alcohol to something that's not as bad for them I think there's a lot of things for the developing mind particularly for the developing mind that we have available to us all the time that are really dangerous you know and Henry Rollins on here was talking about when he was a little kid he was like five year old they put him on Ritalin yeah the time was five I think that's fucking horrible I think psych meds for little kids that don't necessarily need them but maybe they're just a little too energetic I think all that shit's horrible so whether it's marijuana or alcohol or quaaludes or whatever you want to give a fifteen-year-old kid that's got a developing mind I think there's massive consequences and I don't think you can really calculate those consequences that's my position I think you can calculate those consequences well I think you can but I mean you would have to fuck up a lot of kids in order to really prove the statistical viability of what damage is being done to kids and how much would cause the dead I talked about ritalin are you talking about quaaludes alcohol marijuana heroin Lutz in 2017 Wow quaaludes oxys good school with oxycontin's I'm just talking about downer so I'm talking about anything where it's a depressant or stimulant there's a significant amount of effects I think it's just classified as narcotic it's not like a downer like like a benzodiazepine or something well aren't opiates considered a downer considered barbiturates whether I think there's a depressant alcohol is a depressant right calls a central nervous system depressant but I know something like like a quaalude or I'm actually a powerlifter we're the only drug he could it was a people not remember this it's a date-rape drug was a prescribed drug guy named Chad I'm one of the date-rape drugs well whatever the most common date rape drug I don't know if it's I don't know it's actually roofilin or whatever it's called but most commonly used or the most effective date rape sure I know what you're thinking about but I can't it's not coming to me I know the drug but it's it's a weird one where it helps bodybuilders sleep well there's a powerlifter yeah yeah power lifters do it too because it actually infers more development or growth well not just growth hormone but recovery time because they have like deep sleep fuck what is it called but you know what I'm talking what is it used as a date-rape drug rohypnol no not not that's Rudy's that's roofies there's another thing I know what you're talking about is used as a date-rape drug yes and there was a guy a lot of thing he could sleep on right and then it became so they don't prescribe it anymore he hadn't sound he had like a kid like an 1,100 squat was quite world record but close to it and lived out in Reno Nevada and that was the only way he could sleep when he wasn't able to get her anymore his lifts did you find it fell for Jess tricks no good no goddamnit it's got a like a real common name I'll text my buddy cuz he had an overdose of it but he was like 18 oh god hold on a second she talked please where you going if you go back in the show tomorrow a TV show or radio your show to do so there's no way we're gonna get husband's us making up is gonna be so good for your show and my show too no it's not the entire commentary furnace is gonna be oh what a moron you think so we doesn't man don't be don't worry about it we're gonna be we're gonna get through this and get through it in a way that would make sense lick the rock I definitely get weird with these conversations last soon everybody can get you know fake hostile with me so if I call it come on bitch I talk to you like that I don't mean it in a negative I do it like I would do it if you were Bryan Callen and he would start laughing along yeah but you live in Michigan you get a little sensitive when you go that's adorable when he said that's not meant to and we were joking about other topics but on that you lasered in got serious you're wrong let's stay on this pound it in that's that's just it's it's I don't understand the purpose to it have some fun so you're at so that's fun fun so you like doing that you like having you like having fun agreeing with them what's going into town yeah a little silly like I think you might have got a little silly I like to have a little fun got a little silly did I did I bring up the pond issue I said it's the issue I care about the least come on let's get away from that we were we're free we're we're back on the road we're doing good you just want to grab the wheel yeah back turn towards the trees don't do it resist nitro hibiscus cold brew tea it's tea yeah I had a hibiscus beer recently what's disgusting they've ever had in my life and I love hibiscus tea just does not work for beer I bet if you wearing Birkenstocks and you what if you had white dreadlocks you thought this is amazing boobies beer you had kombucha no no kombucha beers so that's like a kombucha that's like super strong why do you think I don't know how they do it because the alcohol with the active culture in kombucha should figuratively right there's the alcohol shouldn't it figured leat it as sugar because of the way kombucha ferments no not necessarily because gt's kombucha that you buy at Whole Foods you have to actually have an ID to buy it because there's more than one half of one percent alcohol by volume so you have to show your ID and be over 21 in order to buy kombucha right now that you say that I think I might have tried kombucha beer once called can I say the name yeah yeah good vibrations mmm and there's one that's okay and one that literally tastes like there's like a ginger one and there's like a bit and one of them I don't de promise they don't remember which one so it's rolling the dice every time you have it see some people I just tell them about kombucha about the positive benefits of probiotics and like you should try it and you should be kimchi and you should eat I was a kraut Kieffer's great I had on my own culture did you ever had a have you ever done kefir years no no but I did make kombucha myself I've done that before kefir is easier really yeah it looks like it looks like a slimy kind of like a sea brain or cauliflower is it like a grain original technically it's a grain but it's really just an act of culture of bacteria and yeast so literally as opposed to yogurt with a straining or kombucha which it you literally just put it in a jar put it in on a countertop for a day and strain it and after I think about four or five batches it's doubled and we don't quadruples it's like an investment account and my wife killed it well I was on the road actually doing stand-up I was I had a few shows and I came back and you have to replace it every day otherwise there's no sugar to feed it and came back and it looks like a snot rag and it was so that was the end of it not well buy at the store kombucha is not really a fungus but it's somehow or another like a cousin of a fungus and people think it's a fungus but it's life-form and when you get it like I had it at one point in time I was like the size of a laptop and I had this like big salad bowl and I was growing kombucha in my refrigerator in a salad bowl and the whole top of the salad bowl was this rubbery sort of life form it's that like disk name cake but it would get big it would get really big and then what I would do is I would drain it into a pitcher and I would put the pitcher into the refrigerator and then I would put more of the sugar water and I forget what all the ingredients were but I know sugar was a part of it yeah the culture had to eat sugar in order to stay alive and then it would ferment and the fermentation was a part of it and then you would you know when you get like some sort of probiotic benefit from it that's a lot harder than kefir be free just poured the milk in the lactose is the sugar and that's it that's done it's actually good about it too if you read the studies on it like two tablespoons of kefir like actual homemade kefir is tens of billions you know microorganism super good for you and it's higher in protein because if you do the math so you can still basically at that point you're left without the lactose so you're left with really just the fat in the protein yeah and all the B vitamins so it's like it's like I read an article once cannot corroborate this but they said that goat's milk whole goat's milk kefir if you could only have one food would be the most complete food you could Wow but what about all your vitamins that you would get like phytonutrients ideal it's not idea if you'd only do one cuz you get the B vitamins you get vitamin D get vitamin K yeah and that's whatever they said if you could only have one and then there was an article said if you could only have to be like that and egg yolks have you ever fucked with like some of those pharmaceutical grade probiotics like what was Rhonda Patrick was talking about those once on the podcast she was talking about some stuff you have to refrigerate it you buy it is like super oh yeah I have yeah have you well you know my producer na cage it had ulcerative colitis so Jesus Christ so he's going to our office bathroom four or five times a day oh the poor guy and I had a problem one time right I was so stressed you have all these nerve endings near my stomach just I thought like oh no ulcerative colitis was getting tested for it and just turned out it was stress and they put me on these probiotics and it didn't really work and then when I did the kefir that actually helped a lot more would it be ironic if marijuana was really the cure they needed the entire I bet you probably would have health because it would have ease the anxiety I bet you what if it might have but it also might have made you more anxious because it makes people that's one thing you want to talk about the here's a negative I'll give you one side of the negative that people ignore is the paranoia that marijuana gave it 100% gives you paranoia I have had some friends that were deep deep pot heads that one fucking cold turkey and don't want to go back it's like a monster that's in their closet it's rating a waiting to get them when they go to pick out their socks there's there's no doubt about it it has this one effect on some people particularly if you take too much of it or if your life is getting away from you you know if it's like slipping away from you and then you start waking bacon and then you just don't ever deal with all your issues so they compound and fucking whirlwind but I was told than you of bullshit but my shrinks now you probably have you done this gene site testing know what's that really haven't done it I'm surprised so um it's mainly used in psychiatry now but they're saying it's gonna have all kinds of future with you know determining cancer and things like that and they actually use it to look for depression bipolar or ADHD and they can look at your genes now I'm not a doctor so I'm gonna butcher this but basically for me they can look at your dopamine and say this is this is how your genetics work today so if you gay I actually a video called do you choose to be gay and my answer is definitively no what if it was you well I'm again because I don't choose a pretty much knew when I tuned into the OSI when I was a kid and I was looking at Mischa Barton rachel bilson and the people who wanted to screw Adam Brody I think that's when you realize you're gay mm-hmm if it were me then I'd be gay okay what does that matter just question would you be uncomfortable okay no I've had my on the show because I've trauma minded you quite a bit thank you you could look rich a tank well maybe he's gay maybe it ulterior motives I don't think I would think um but with dopamine for with me like we have a relative in the family who actually well I should say who has an issue and so they looked at genes that create serotonin most people have a long gene in a short gene and you have two short jeans and with me that's the case with dopamine so like a lot of people who would maybe typically be addicts or people the ADHD or people who for me I didn't realize this until I was a lot older look this is I'm gonna totally expose myself most vulnerable to all the angry pot heads after the argument I didn't realize until I was older I didn't actually feel the same feelings of joy for like pleasures other people though so dopamine right you know how that works it's you reward center like you do something good Bing and I was a B student in high school I never opened a textbook because if I completed something I did a project that was it bones you like I did a project that's like okay I did a project what's the next thing I never really felt that reward center in the brain and they did this gene site testing and they found it basically have the worst genetic pattern it's not entirely accurate but it's actually increased the efficacy of antidepressants from like a 1 in a 1 in to to like a two and three Wow something like that because they can look in and look at your genetics more effectively and so no I'm sorry to interrupt but no did are you have you taken anti depressants I've taken ADHD medication that's not antidepressants but it's activity disorder is a completely different situation it's but it's also basically a dopamine shortage ADHD is mmm Wow that's why stimulants you know on people who actually have ADHD don't rev them up actually there's own a man you know some studying and they feel like wired and before there's nanak testing that's how they often tested for it as well how do you react to this drug and if you feel wired like you know me with all this I had six noir milligrams of caffeine right then you probably don't have ADHD what kind of shit they put you on when they put you on ADHD medication you know the basic like adderall stuff like that also they put you on adderall I yeah I'm taking it and I don't I don't take it every day because I never want to be dependent on it how often you take it I don't know ten times a week yeah probably yeah you just take it down okay it is amazing I will tell you this I never realized until I took it and this is not I'm not advocating cuz I think it's way over prescribed I think you're right I think most kids were I don't think you should put kids on it I think you're right and I think that most kids or most people who take it don't need it but I also think that there are people with real condition out there like you that can benefit from it well you have a genetic well we can prove it well because for the longest time my wife will hear this and she'll I denied it through and through I thought no you know there's this is just this is bullshit the ADHD just to get kids whacked out on Ritalin and I you know I had people I would deal with like counseling her stuff feels like it would get stressed I had stress management issues and like you seem like now no I don't believe it and then I was given a book on ADHD and I never never finished reading it I'm like three pages and moved on to something else and they said okay let's do this test this whole kind of questionnaire deal and was pretty extensive you know short of actually doing a cat scan okay you test like in the top 99th percentile and we did the gene site testing I think it's called gene site and it was pretty remarkable and I will say that I won't get into exactly what it is that I've done or what medications I've taken but it was certainly life-changing as far as I didn't know what normal people felt like wow that's really fast and ADHD is a fascinating form of a sort of a mild mental disorder that's extremely frequent I don't think it's as frequent as a lot of people think that I would give you I think it's over prescribed I really do I really do because whenever I say it you know people go oh I - I'm major adda I don't know it's not the same thing right that's the thing that people like to say to dis compensate for them being a douchebag Asperger's I'm sorry I'm on the spectrum but it is I came into it kicking and screaming and Wow I mean I never did anything school I just did the bare minimum I was boring hmm so boring and then when you know they started doing actually like you know tests and you know IQ testing and stuff and we found it like well listen medication doesn't make you smarter okay I have my own theories about this whole thing that they do when they take kids and they make them all sit in the same school in the same class and listen to the same subject right I don't think there's anything in life that mirrors that and I think experiences in life vary radically and I think that if you looked at nature and the great spectrum of survivors and you know winners and losers and how genes get expressed and how evolution takes place in nature yeah there's all sorts of different kinds of animals why wouldn't we assume there's all sorts of different kinds of people whenever you force all people to sit down and do the same thing you're gonna have aberrations you know people that don't like obviously you've found something with your show and with public speaking that you you excel at like you found this thing like this ranting thing that you could do we could just go on a hundred words a second about all these different things like you found this thing where whatever way your brain works yeah it works perfectly for that it's the same thing with a stand-up comedian the same thing with a musician an author there's a lot of people that daydream all the time like all your fucking loser no right this guy's writing books and it's fucking head just give him a goddamn laptop and he's gonna make a million bucks yeah you don't I mean it's like I mean and the truth is people they want to know you probably talked about this with Christina Hoff Sommers actually there are people who have a lot of those kind of interactions that you talked about in the classroom on a daily basis they're called women they sit down and talk think about women they get together with a book group whatever it is they literally sit down and listen and they'll listen to someone and that's it and they'll sit because they're very auditory that's the way they learn the public education system in United States was designed for girls from the ground up and you put boys into a world where they don't do well they do not thrive in that atmosphere of what girls do and that's why girls have much higher grades in high school going into college and then when boys can study at their own pace they do better on the SATs that's a great book called wild at heart I think by John Eldridge that talks about that and this is a long time ago talking about then rather we know boys learn better with their hands think about it right it's considered a masculine gym shop or not just masculine things but physical science where you're working in a laboratory those are subjects where boys actually tend to do better than girls often in high school or they rate it as something they like instead of changing the way we do male education we try and change little boys and that's a real that's a real problem and I think that's a big reason not because someone was bullied because someone used the word fag I think you probably a lot of incidents of depression and young boys in particular because you're putting them in an atmosphere where they can't possibly succeed yeah well I think both are problematic but I think the square peg round hole issue has been there for the beginning of school in the first place and I I don't mean to be like a proponent of homeschooling but really every I mean once you have kids I think you kind of realized that god damn every kid out of the box is a totally different thing they're just different yeah we're gonna homeschool because my wife she went to Montessori School and she went to was a public high school or private high school but she's basically she's a genius she's very very smart but she did not do well in a normal school at all at all do you think you could find a school that maybe is more flexible or a because the Montessori School socializing is critical for kids and socializing during the day where they learn about each other you know they learn about interactions and you can talk to them too they come home you know Debbie said something mean to me what did she say yeah you know I mean I think that's important I can tell you kind of a tale of two homeschooled kids I have I won't give any names here because I have okay family they have homeschooled kids very weird just stare at the screen all day I have another family friends who were homeschooled they're kids they're the best kid you could possibly have an adult dinner table because they put the kids in jiu-jitsu I think one of them does tennis they put kids in all kinds of social activities they travel with the kids they take them to Europe and then whenever they have adult get-togethers where it's appropriate for kids to be they still have adult night and date night kids can be there and they'll speak when asked to speak they don't interrupt they're able to interact with adults they're probably the most well-adjusted kids I've ever seen and then I have seen the weird creepy homeschooled kids where you do your class on your iPad and then afterwards you get to watch PewDiePie you know play video games or whatever it is so it really does come down to the parents but I do think that a parent who knows had a home school kid I think that's gonna be a specialist the mama's at home with the kids you know I think it's a huge leg up well there's obviously so many variables as far as the intellect of the parents and what their thought processes behind homeschooling their kid and what their experience level is and how much thought they put into it and where where they're coming from emotionally psychologically intellectually yeah there's a lot of variables I mean the idea of homeschooling is bad or homeschooling is good I have friends that have homeschooled three of their kids they have four kids a home school three of them the kids are fine yeah they're fine they put a lot of work into it they spend a lot of time with their kids they took their kids all over the world they took their kids traveling all through Europe yeah you know they just decided at some point in time and it wasn't always home school they had done some public school they had done some private school and then they got to a point they were like look like what are we what are we doing here like we're trying to you know the kids got older into there like preteens and then they're teens and then they came to this conclusion like what what they're coming back from high school with and from middle school with is not what I want them to be exposed with I want a two brother I want to be exposed to the classics I want them to be exposed to life and let just looking at human beings in a way that's like open minded and traveling and seeing things and so instead of like necessarily just having them take Spanish they lived in Spain for a little while they went to Spain and live there late interesting shit crazy Asian you were talking on Tucker Carlson she's a middle school teacher yeah think of the enclaves of crazy places where these social justice warriors go and often they go into teaching because it's their way to get power of these little kids here's the thing that was really we brought about that on the website and what I wrote about that does that interview yeah whatever de bout that was this is a horrible interview because she's okay with violence in Berkeley but what really disturbs me is every other professor out there who isn't a national story let's say she didn't get caught on camera hitting a guy with a stick right but some kid stands up who's a conservative in middle school I was that way where I would argue was a teacher and just as why I think you're wrong and she kicks that kid out of class and just says that kids being disruptive and or if that let's say that teacher is the principal gets the kid expelled from school these people have these little enclaves of power these positions of authority and parents kind of have to trust the teacher so you see that it's a national story she's exposed but what about all the teachers who aren't I had a teacher complained to my parents and talk about how disrespectful I was and what a horrible person it was because I think in the ninth grade I actually argued I was like I actually don't think we should give the land back to the Native Americans but she was too I'm with the teacher fuck you argument argument what did you say while I was a smartass so this was me as you know at 14 year-old right I said the fact that I remember that who shoe I won't use her name I'll say the fact that you're wearing Levi's and because you have a sore throat you're speaking to an electronic speaker when you dress drove here in a Toyota Yaris and you're gonna like electric electrically powered school in a union tells me you're glad that we settled here and she just she didn't answer she'd an argue she just sent me out of class and Kyra member the next morning I thought it was kind of I didn't really think my dad was furious cuz he got a call from someone saying I was disrupting class or she asked students was you get mad at the teacher no he's mad at me well how was he mad at you no because he didn't get the full story just you know this here's my Stevens being immensely disrespectful right talking back in class he didn't hear the she asked for an opinion this was MRE moral religious education was a class way to take in moral religious education yep so there's guilt for the First Nation people up in Canada is that what it is this is just specific professor and a matter of fact I learned what right-wing was because I remember at one point said that's so right-wing that's so right and I didn't know what it was I was 14 I had said something and I said dad what is right-wing mean he says well and he kind of explained to me the political spectrum I said okay I guess I am right-wing I was in Alberta and I was with some friends who live up there and we were fishing and we were fishing right next to these First Nation people which is their Native Americans right and they have a limit of walleye that you can take you can only take one walleye per day right if you're a regular person but if you're a First Nations person you could just yeah pull in as many as you want and and and I was like how does that work and they go oh it's way crazier than that they can go out at night with spotlights and shine them on moose and gunned them down from trucks because then it frees them yeah yeah they don't know what it is no stand still they try to figure out what the what's going on most don't see spotlights right ever in the real world so yeah so when they see when they freeze then they shoot them with guns from trucks and I was like what so they're allowed to poach it's not poaching they can do whatever they want like well how many of them out to kill as many as they want so they can kill all the moose they can kill all the most Wow I was like what that is that seems that seems I you know he makes a great argument the Native American case is actually have you read Chael Sonnen book no it's very interesting and he talked about this like Michael Medved and Dennis Prager have talked about this but I was surprised as to how cogent Steele's arguments were he's a very smart guy well he's a very smart guy and then he always kind of played he plays it down or plays it up when it's convenient if you read his book he talks about he says it's just a numbers game the reason that we were able to colonize here is entirely because of Native Americans they were being he wrote about it in a way I'm butchering it but he said like when we came for example like let's talk about the Mayans because they had literally pyramids are Aztec whatever they had buildings entirely full of cold he goes now how do you think they procured said gold do you think that they maybe went to other tribes or other members and said you are going to bring us this coal gold or B die and so what happened was thousands upon thousands tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands said when the conquistadors came who would never have had enough to take over that that area of the world said we're gonna take our chances with the red guys with the beards and the metal helmets because I've been treating so poorly for so long and the same thing if you look at the Algonquin in the Iroquois and Quebec those were the tribes that we had and the kind of the the packs that they would haven't listened they screwed them don't get me wrong they really screwed them with the fire water thing and they pulled the rug out from under them I'm not defending it but the idea that we came in and just conquered these people know there were a lot of people who were mistreated because this horse culture that they did it first off they hadn't domesticated horses they didn't even use the wheel and so a lot of the things that that were taught are not true when were tucked they were peaceful no they weren't peaceful that's why all of a sudden these new people who came in with sticks that go boom had thousands of Native Americans at their disposal who were willing to die with them because they were tired of being treated that way and I made some arguments maybe that effect got in trouble got sent home well it's a complicated issue that spans hundreds of years but there was certainly intertribal warfare and the word that the Sioux use they don't use the word Sioux they use the word Lakota they call themselves Lakota people Sioux is a word for enemy that's what it means so like that's what other Native American cultures would call them they would call them the enemy because they were killing each other the Nez Perce and the Apaches they would go to war with each other neighboring it was constant it's just when the Europeans came they were so overwhelming that we feel bad for what they did but you know what killed more Native Americans than anything our diseases yeah our dirty dirty bugs yeah we came over here and coughed on them they all fucking died well that's another thing too right that we killed them deliberately with smallpox blankets that's not true that's not true we didn't we didn't even understand we don't have germ theory they didn't understand they didn't they didn't understand that scabs if you like take you leave the idea was he took scabs from people with fucking diseases and you put them on blankets and you gave them Native American he rubbing your hands no that's a big thing with horses yeah they hadn't domesticated horses and a lot of animals mm-hmm so think about that you've never come in contact with these animals they're in the wild and all of a sudden these people are coming off effectively with a boat that's a giant farm mm-hmm and they're bringing these animals in that you've never had contact with before all kinds of diseases oh sure well that's the thing that people a lot of people who don't understand where diseases come from a giant percentage of them come from our livestock right that's why you have swine flu and avian viruses and all those different things yes ours in the Toronto Airport only Canada SARS he was right back SARS you the only ones who had SARS what was it was it would it stand for I don't remember his new SARS I knew all the illusions were wearing those masks at the Toronto Airport I remember SARS yeah about Ebola was just a year ago but it's fucking we're gonna die Ebola that fucking chick from New Jersey that bitch she she left the hospital right there's so much flak from conservatives too because I was like listen I don't leave Iraq Obama was the president but you can't blame a bowl on the guy freakin diseases from Kenya I know you know and that's one of those things where I know I'm seen as an ideologue but sitting we get so much flak for criticizing Donald Trump for example on on some trade policies really I just think this is bad what's the big thing that you've been criticized about Trump for that I've been criticizing your show just for criticizing him at all anything and you know the line yeah people get real because versus them bro well cuz you know there used to like you've had people on the show you've even mentioned in this program people who are their only their only way his own death right as being a being a provocateur to offender and there's there's a purpose to that there's but if just defending people as the end goal and I really don't think that's what we do if people actually watch the show I mean people actually watch the show every day an hour of content most of it is really pretty reasonable they see the highlight reel of me dressing as a tranny interviewing Wendy Davis right right that's from thousands and thousands of hours of the program so we criticize him all the time but you know less and less because every time he does something stupid the left does something so bad so we're it's like calling him literally Hitler like that woman who was this schoolteacher who's talking about well the poor Jim Jeffries really bothered with the woman who's a schoolteacher was she was talking about that just just labeling they're all fascists and you have to stop fascists and then when he described when he asked her what is a fascist she gave like this shitbag definition of what a fascist is it only suited her need yeah let's pull up the actual literal definition of fascist young Jamie what is the literal definition of fascist as I interpret it it is I did a video on this and here's what's so funny if I'm not mistaken Google's definition brings up fascism and mentions right-wing but if you bring up communism or socialism maybe its authoritarianism something that's very clearly left-wing they don't actually mention left-wing okay an advocate or follower of the political philosophy or system of fascism he went to Spain to fight against a fascist to extreme right-wing yes extreme right-wing a rightist or the military coup throughout the old fascist regime synonymous authoritarian totalitarian dictatorial see this is where it gets weird cuz undemocratic a liberal no type in communism but Authority but hold on a second yeah and totalitarian like this when you talk about extreme left-wing ideologues you are talking about authoritarians and you're talking about totalitarian yeah and you're also talking about people that would advocate violence against anyone who does not fit their mold of how a person should think or behave and what they do is they call them a fascist or they call you man nazi and that lets them alleviate themselves of any guilt of being a violent person against these people and that's what happened at berkeley and that's this woman felt no irony about being on television saying that Milo is a homophobe when he's a gay guy well and she was also tell about justifying beating up people who weren't Milo Jamie gasps could you hit a Thor terian real quick yeah okay favoring or enforcing strict obedience or authority especially that of the government of the expense it was the Phantom now do me a favor type in communism and I want you to see the Google so that just said right-wing extremism right with fascism which is not a right-wing ideology and only communism do we all agree is an inherently left-wing ideology yeah well a political theory derived from Karl Marx well there's a lot of like I had Jordan Peterson on the podcast you know we talked about how it's like progressives who are sensitive and kind people gradually gravitate towards Marxism in a lot of ways because the initial draw seems appealing advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid for according to their abilities and needs so here's the point and I wrote about this I think we did a video on this fascism which is not inherently right-wing at all no it's not they write right-wing extreme right-wing a liberal communism which inherently has to be left-wing it is the definition of the political spectrum of left-wing would-be communism and then capitalism and then in between can be authoritarian Impressionism depending on the regime no mention of left-wing with communism because I know there's a this is Google they know there's negative connotation it's the first thing that comes up but fascism authoritarianism they immediately try to attribute to the right hmm that's what people are fighting back again with when they talk about media and fake news and the constant bias you see if there was Google that's not fair right do you think there's a problem with also defining things in terms of a word like Marxism or like communism like let's just talk about like what are you trying to do like what are you actually trying to appeal to when you're saying that you can't have someone speak at your university if they say things that you don't agree with like do you remember this story about the University of Toronto really famous story guy who is an author they completely misrepresented what his book was about they were saying he's Pro rape culture and these feminists shut it down they pulled fire alarm the famous red-haired lady who's been screaming at people I remember her name Melissa click I'm Melissa click no no that's the one from the University of Missouri I'm talking about the one from Toronto who is like this like she's kind of funny in a way because she was like shut up fuckface I'm talking she the RAM of that yeah I mean that was that was this crazy moment in time where this guy had scheduled an appearance to speak about his book yeah and someone had misrepresented his book decided what his book was actually all about and decided that they were gonna have a campaign to make sure this guy couldn't talk yeah so people would show up and they would try to just go to listen to this guy talk and women were screaming in their face you know fucking rapist you piece of shit yeah the guy's like I want to hear the guy talk can I hear the guy talk no they wouldn't let people know mean that is fascism well yeah isn't it well it happened to with Ann Coulter in Toronto I remember and whether you agree with her she deserves I disagree with mine but she was a member she was asking me like what and I said well you understand freedom of speech doesn't really exist in Canada as my record doesn't exist outside of the United States it really doesn't exist in Canada I mean they have some weird rule doesn't exist in Europe No and when I told her that she couldn't and then actually someone went on news on the news and said well what Ann Coulter needs to understand is that America has this idea of free speech and rugged individualism and all speech is protected but that's not the case in Canada and this was the representative they trotted out where she basically said freedom of speech does not exist in Canada and so you can read the YouTube comments where every time I see the freedom of speech doesn't exist in Canada thousands of people that's bullshit because they think they get to type in an Internet message board but you can be jailed in Canada for saying something wrong you can lose your business there's a human rights council yeah we talked about it actually did you have yeah no but we talked about but he's got a different case that's from Montreal we talked about the comedian from Vancouver that had the altercation with the lesbians in the crowd they were hacking him and the comedians before and he called them some fucking you pussy-eating dykes or whatever he said something crazy and they showed him and won they won yeah he had pay I don't know if he's paid but he it was tens of thousands of dollars I think I was like something like fifteen thousand dollars this fucking guy had to pay to these people were yeah I know that people and you know that's why again we're people to the left versus right this is why it does matter because I lived through it in Quebec so in Quebec we only have the left we have liberals and then liberal separatists that's it there's no there's liberals and those liberals who want to only speak French and secede from the rest of Canada yeah exact connects a weird place right it's a very weird place it's not like the rest of Canada its multiculturalism gone awry the French were a conquered people it should have been shut up you're speaking English instead they said it's cute let's let them have their little Enclave and now it's just a nightmare for the rest of that's where white golfers are afraid about with California is that what that means are you just gonna dominate and turn this whole thing into a Mexican speaking joint I don't know what we were talking about yeah the left versus right because yeah I do think you do one a certain point I think a lot of people are readily acknowledging now that those stories that you're talking about the red-haired girl the Melissa click yes Asian lady you really can't find that today on the right right does exist on the right and those exist like that what doesn't exist period on the right you know people try to point to like at parental advisory lyrics and stuff and he probably has to pee as badly as I do oh my god an angle P that was typical what ya know the parental advisory thing from the 80s when they were trying she was trying to ban rap music never forget about that Al Gore's wife yeah was trying to ban rap music and Christians never wanted to ban South Park some thing where they talked about they said no we don't we just don't want it on it not we wanted on late at night we don't want our kids watching it never met Ray Parker and Matt Stone was it Matt stone him a stoner Trey Parker I saw Matt speak at UT and he just a guy stood up and he was like asking this question I can t fight against these Christians and he actually said he said well you know and he said we've actually never had an issue really he said they don't want it on in primetime we don't want it on in primetime we've seen them as an ally it's he said contrast that to the Comedy Central reaction where they decided to cut an episode because we put Mohammed in it and that tells you who's really in power right something's that effect but the kid who was at UT you know in Austin my brother went to UT so he would get access to all these speeches or presentations the kid was dumbfounded he thought well Matt stones not one of me and that stones not a conservatives not a Republican he's not a trump supporter right he just recognizes the intolerance today of the progressive left well there's definitely an issue when you have that woman the Melissa Glick lady who is yelling at that kid who was just a for tahg or for he was a journalist yeah and I think he was hired to be there in a public space who's Asian yeah he's taking pictures and she said can they can we get some muscle here cuz we've created a safe space you tank can't take photos of our protests and our sit-in and our safe space about racism so we're gonna get this Asian guys II don't understand black America like what the fuck how long do you think she was waiting to say I just want to use the term muscle oh man she was just gonna say get some well she was intolerant in that she was very adamant about getting her way and she did not consider whether or not they were in a public place and this kid had the right to take those photographs and again like you said this an Asian kid I mean this is not like some fucking white jock with a crew-cut like from you know back to the future we didn't say oh it's fuckin Biff fuck him you know it wasn't that it was it was like it was really hard to label him as an oppressor she still found a way and it was such an Asian response to where he was just like I just want to do my job I don't want to be the center of this story this camera up above us you know I don't want to start a March like you have to get out of here he's like no I don't know this is my job I'm paid to be here I have to be you have a public thing going on here there's a protest after urinate so bad go do it dude go do it you're gonna keep doing the show no we'll wrap up let's wrap up alright let's wrap up alright so s Crowder on to I'm glad we got
