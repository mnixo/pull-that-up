money Freddie Lockhart is in the building buckle up bitches here we go happy Sunday happy Shark Week and sorry give me three months minutes and wearing that Shark Week out Freddie Lockhart is in the building the only humans that I know that says son more than I do right today son I say by myself when I'm in the car when I see dudes on the phone get off the phone son let me get the phone up to the ear which is illegal under California law I wonder how many fucking people have died directly as a result of idiots being on their phone texting and driving and talking on the phone went by the ear and losing a peripheral vision staggering first I was like oh it's probably the worst it's like eating or doing other things in the car but no there's so many times you're just like really stop Facebook yeah there's a lot of people that just won't let that shit drop isn't that how they thought that Paris Hilton was a Paris Hilton's plastic surgeon but it sounds so good I don't know why they ever clarified it is leave it out there yeah tweeted about his dog and then a couple seconds later died and they were thinking that he was tweeting long drive but they don't know he could have been reading his tweets yeah you know he might not have been actually driving but how the fuck do you go off a cliff unless you think you're in a goddamn Porsche commercial and you're going sideways around corners there's this video that made me want to get in gt3 before I go on is there's a video of a Porsche on a mountain road it's a gt3 in a mountain road it's some badass fuckin rally driver knows what the fuck he's doing knows how to handle that thing well I never drove it and went out for shows the first six month Hatta and then it almost killed me I thought I've talked about this many times on the show so in the interest of brevity the the when I got home one day the suspension fell off in the driveway the suspension detached from the frame and I was like happened like 10 minutes ago when I was going on the highway you might have been well I think it's a lot of it is also just impulsive the liars that I've known it seems like they just can't help it like they have a hard time not like you know what's the weirdest is successful Liars like their names but there's comics business yeah for the other guys a movie after he's a liar movie star oh oh one percent people in this town do congratulations and here you're trying to tell me that you own coca-cola too it's like come on he's so crazy I'm already impressed but that's why he's so talented that yes he can just get on stage and just talk shit he's one of the few guys that have ever seen that we'll get on stage and not have a fucking clue as to what he's gonna talk about right and he'll stay up there for five hours he always did it's like I'd always extract one thing I liked from the comic even if I didn't like that comic very much as he could bask in silence so let it seem like you were supposed to be dwelling on the last oh yeah shit I hate you yeah like he just we're exposed too but being comics and by being comics in the pressure cooker that is Hollywood you're exposed to psychological lessons that the average person just never gets to deal with you know you get to watch someone become crazy you get to watch someone you to watch someone lose their shit when they get a little bit of Fame those guys are fascinating oh yeah you know the people to get a little development deal and all sudden of yelling at people and ordering people around you know the best stories that really do the story The Boondock Saints the kid Detroit okay - man that dude we have talked about this on the podcast very recently this documentary yes for the folks that don't know this guy that made the movie The Boondock Saints and they made a documentary on him called overnight and he's just an insufferable cunt of a human being who got some success right and fucked it all up success though I haven't heard of since then in Hollywood like like they bought the bar the kid worked at they didn't go he promised it was part of the deal Miramax Harvey Weinstein promised to buy him the bar co-owned the bar Damon did it we could wear stormy now we're gonna take any scripts and make them big that was the end of their thing in the mid late 90s man yeah people are lining up to me I haven't seen that kind of heat around a script since then yeah the dudes who were lining up to get in that all Boston Irish states were lame really clamoring to get in there yeah and then it started to whittle down Phil you have his Willem Dafoe who was in it from the beginning but like that's the only guy I think who stated if you see the movie though manages it's an amazing documentary on what what can happen to you can add it all yeah you can lose your shit man there's a lot of people I've met so many people that have just completely lost their shit along the way to just mediocre success just a little tiny bit you see them you know letting you know they got a million dollar guarantee this fucking show they're gonna put it on right after friends right no it's gonna fail that we're in but don't you think it's funny though like in the grand scheme of things that the bigger they are usually the cooler they're like a Tom Hanks it's probably not a ticket you know what I mean all of them yeah or or say in the world of comedy Chris Rock shows up to the comedy story shows up alone with a notebook ass-kissing if he can go on write or say you know and he's you know arguably the top comic in the world at least one of the most recognizable right now takes somebody who's like maybe the 156 best comic in the world but you can steal yeah yeah it's something like the will get on stage and Bogart like patents showing up too you know a war theater it's like you can't you know but the number one guys exercising that much humility everybody you know below needs to follow suit it's it's an amazing dance that you play when you're you're trying to get attention on stage because you're trying to get these people to look at you so you're trying to like perform the most entertaining set possible and the best way possible but in some way or another and you have to divert all that adulation away from yourself you have to figure out a way to accept it and then like turn it right back to the people then you can't bathe in it you can't like take it seriously I think that you are the shit or you will suck yeah and you got to remember too we're not saving fucking lives yeah I mean and that's like another thing too it's like with comedy but you have so many other interests it's like we have 23 and a half hours of data in there you can either become just a fucking miserable prick or you can educate yourself or pick up another passion you know and it's like or you can become completely obsessed with your career exactly quotes and not have any other thing that you turn to and then lose your shit because to me a career allows you to do all the other things you wanted to do it's like okay now I have a path to do the other things I want to do there's a an interesting thing that Mark Marin just did he did this keynote speech at the Just for Laughs and I listened in on it because I have this sort of love/hate thing McMahon Marin helped me out when I was an open mic and gave me some real solid advice and real solid compliments and I remember you know I only been doing comedies real short period time less than a year and Marin was established and I was like wow I can't believe this guy just you know just totally pumped me up and I was like I can fucking do this you know I felt like you know I got you know from a guy like that who was real stingy with compliments sure you know yeah so for years I've been trying to be so fucking nice to him like because of that no so every opportunity to shit on him or to fuck with him I've avoided and ducked because I felt like I owed him for something that happened when we were really young and so you know that's why I did his podcast even though he'd said some stupid shit about me and isn't even know me like we didn't have conversations about you just say he said a bunch of really dumb one of them really yeah one of the really dumb things he said is that I've done more bad to comedy than Mencia has because of doing Fear Factor and his rationale this is a true argument his rationale was that in doing Fear Factor I had taken work away from stand-up comics who also worked as writers so the idea is that in me being a stand-up comic who also has a side job of hosting somehow or another these other stand-up comics their side job of writing sitcoms outside of stand-up comedy their side job is somehow or another more valid that still it's still not comedy it's no not stand-up comedy you're talking about a guy who's a massive plagiarist who just ruined comic slides yeah and you're comparing them to me because I hosted a game show but this watching this listening to this keynote now I understand a little bit better because three years ago he was talking about how he was so depressed he couldn't get any road work he couldn't couldn't get booked anywhere no one have meetings with him nothing was going on and you know he was thinking about committing suicide and this is just three years agos before he started doing his podcast and you know this is why all the shit is what was going down and this is you know three years ago I wasn't doing Fear Factor but I'm sure it before then the bitterness was just as much when some people see other people get success they fester and it drives the fucking crazy and they want to look for holes in it they don't look for things that are wrong with it instead of saying oh look at that fucking guy he's going to do like like I love drew Carey okay no and I wouldn't want to host The Price is Right for a fucking million dollars in episode I'd be like god damn that's what he's doing The Price is Right or is that shows me that you you're a creature who survival of the fittest when this business changes you were death well let's say you know he decided to take a job is what I looked at it I mean look what drew carey's a great person now he's a warm friendly guy sure you know like what's the other guy's name the black dude is things oh no Brady yeah what's his name Wayne Brady waiting for you why don't I call them well yeah I've kidding remembers in smoke too much weed but anyway he when he does his show which one is he doing he's doing on those daytime shows - doing a talk show yeah one of those fucking either price is right or the other mean that to me whatever fucking good it's not good and it's it's one of those things where you look like it's like soul-crushing shit but it's just a fucking gig when I see Drew Carey I don't go to fucking Drew Carey solo go dry or sauna but Maron has this thing because he was so unsuccessful he looks for reasons why other people's success is either invalid or or negative or bad but this this fucking festering personality of constantly obsessing about his career and negativity is it was a fascinating keynote one of the things he said that he joked the Rose a really funny joke he I'm the guy who thought Louie's TV show should have been called fuck you Marc Maron no because they started out together you know it's got some fucking crazy jealous and they spelled Louisan that was an open mic you know he was everybody is a cunt - Jamie kill Steve Ari Shaffir he's Bryan Callen wanted to beat him up he's been a cunt to me he's a cunt and the reason why is it cunt is because he's a cunt to himself yeah he's really nice pounds is nice like nicest guy ever he insulted count on stage in front of accountants friends who came to see him in New York Alan wanted to kill him Callen you know Callen even like said something in threatened death and said looking I'll hit you like okay you want to fuck with me and fuck with me in front my friends like I'll hit you I don't know what happened or who this is just the stories that I'm getting but I know that he gave Ari unsolicited criticism and I know he fucks with kills Dean Bryan you fucking with the levels constantly you fucking with my head bro leave it alone but it's why is he doing that who's doing that cuz he's doing that to himself is his whole mind is fucked he's a guy who's been doing comedy forever but still can't get successful we were in Irvine the other day we did the Irvine improv and I'm like do you guys pretty much sell out here every weekends if not when Mark man was here so I could barely got a hundred tickets sold at each show and I was like a hunter tickets at the Irvine improv like that's impossible so it's like this this this career that he's had for all these years 25 plus years it's you know he's obviously done a lot of shit wrong until he did this podcast and this podcast he's just nail it the podcast he figured out what he is good at is really getting into people's mind she knows his own neuroses as he knows his own his own fears and hopes and dreams and stand-up and he can relate to other comics and then now he's sort of like calming down and being but he still does douchey shit like Anthony Bourdain is gonna be on my podcast ha seriously yeah and he wrote hey I heard you're gonna do Rogen's podcast but he ain't me you know it would be deep like that's exactly what he me it would be anybody come on man go go take a goddamn yoga class okay go to one of those places where everybody just hugs everybody yeah you know just go and get some hugs man just what the fuck this negative festering fucking kind of thinking is exactly what we're talking about where people don't have shit outside of their career and if they don't have a bunch of other things if you have something going on they never taken away from me you're not taking work away from me which you know nobody is you know I'm fine with that and it's like I had that comedy cop thing to me and about a year in the comedy when it's like holy crap I've got my own thing to say now yeah well it's another thing that Maron had said on the show once about his uh his parents never fostered a healthy sense of competitiveness in him and he's one of those guys that like if he's losing he'll just turn the board over I'll just fucking take your ball and you go and it's that that crazy sort of fucking dysfunctional thinking that that thinking that this disconnected is what it is you're disconnected from other people and you want it all you want on the adulation you want all the love and if you're not getting what you need fuck everybody else then negativity starts you start throwing your negativity I had other people and the only way you can truly be positive at all is if you feel like you're getting enough positivity to be okay I got a good level here I got a good style of positivity now it can be nice it's a fascinating psychological study to watch all these guys to watch these Marc Maron guys said we were like literally on the brink of suicide you know and I think I tried to like Marc I really do I try to be nice to him as much as I can I try to like I'm sure but it's like man I have a hard time seeing all that I want to just throttle a guy like that and go look let's sit down and write down what the fuck is wrong with you and just work it out for once and for all right let's not deal with this for 25 fucking more years yeah let's figure this shit out exactly exactly this he's a fucking guy that guy I he got mad at me once because I called him I said the old school comedy talent of Frankie pace that's how I said old school and he doesn't understand the old schools like skills it's like no man's old school like my man's old school Goju Ryu karate got you could say that to a dude you know give me some knuckles to be laughing you know that's like a compliment but when I called him you know an old me mom he sucks I shouldn't even said old school I just said go on stage without your stupid fucking devil horns your bag of shit and you bring with you everywhere without the talent he's a cunt of a human but it's the same thing it's like here's a guy who doesn't feel like there's enough positivity out there right if he hasn't stockpiled a big stash of it so he goes on stage and introduces me after I introduced him with this old school thing right and he goes this guy thinks I'm old school mr. liking stunts and I and I and then he shits on me and he starts shitting on my jokes it's all before he brings me up onstage so I go onstage I'm not even I didn't even know exactly how to handle him so I go onstage I go first of all dude before I address any of what you just said so I just start talking him as he's walking to the car go who's a positive thing I go am i right folks and they start clapping yeah it's like a rapper term I go when you say someone sold it was variable that you must be new school I go are you trying to say that I'm not good they don't like me I know what are you trying to say so then I start smiling and instead of getting upset at him I I start mocking him I go do you not like me do you do not like my comedy I go what's the matter I go doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when people laugh harder at my shit than yours and that's when he got fucking pissed off at me and he goes you fucking wish you were as good at me I go come on man we all just watched you you ain't that special I go didn't you guys see him like oh you saw him right what is he got like devil horns on and shit I go who's that it was that good was that amazing is that some breakthrough shit I look at you you little fat fuck and he goes you're gonna look like me when you're my age I go do you think you look like me when you were you were mine hahaha what the fuck are you talking about what are you saying I'm you you're me are we one you you're a cunt cunt of a man get out of get a bitter fuck to be like you'll look like this yeah he's that guy though he is the the last guy you want to be business owes me something this business oh you a goddamn thing you know a lot of those guys though it does it's like a and all people always say - it's like Hollywood so it's so crazy it's so hard to make it's the Feres business I know yeah it never shoes talent away no no get out of here we don't need you they never shoot talent away but those guys who can find all these things wrong whether it's the club Booker or whatever like it's usually the comedy sweet you're funny guys it's like I always say and what other club is putting you on right silence no never tonight another club well the comic stores got a fuck at half a million assholes that really shouldn't be on stage right there's nothing into that system back in the 1970 you're stuck there yeah you can go there any given night on a Monday or Tuesday and you'll see three or four comics you can't fucking believe a professional comedian right at the Comedy Store yeah in Hollywood man when I was that's Mecca the best of the best and the worst of the worst so works no but beyond bad attic is high in the basement hills real fucking deep but you know a lot of room clears back in the day we don't see them we look that's the face you that's exactly what safe you would look at the lineup you would see Freddy Lockhart and you look at before you and you saw oh yeah I remember when I worked the covered booth and I turned my shirt inside out because embarrassed the workers I have to answer to the likes of why is a ghoulia Rossi on stage hey Pierre giving eulogies as they do and I remember you drove that NSX and I remember is like if I saw that insects pulling up you were like the Calvary it's like Oh a legitimate bona fide comedian a real comedian that I can show all these people that had to look in a straight face in charge of $20 to see the likes of Dave here at their telling why is it my cell phone worked with the antenna down but up it works what's Wow huh that was his closer well the poor guy he stopped doing comedy and started doing some like I think he started doing some swimming humanitarian work or something like that video did he's a really nice guy he was I sold that guy my car there's nothing they picked appear honestly there was a sweet guy I don't even remember his act he worked in the store too though really really really thin guy had a nice Volkswagen Scirocco oh yeah I think that was why it was called no not the Sirocco maybe it was a shrine whatever it was like a Volkswagen pretty sweet Volkswagen and I started that's how I got like one of my first development what year was this this was 94 when I first came to Hollywood 92 91 something thousand nine is a nice car oh is it deesser course yeah my first new car yeah and I got a super turbo and so I had this other car just laying around and and you know dave was telling me you needed you know needed a car but he does know anyone like how much money got anyone up gave me like a thousand bucks for something like that I just gave it to him I forget what it was exactly but you know the car was worth like 10 grand oh that's awesome it to him take it he's a nice guy an interesting place because of that very reason though it was like it didn't you get the lesson of the comedy store was that there was no rules there that was chaotic and ridiculous and made no sense and you know a guy like Eddie Griffin would go on at nine o'clock and stay on stage till three o'clock in the morning like all the time it's a pool with no lifeguard yes you know bunch of kids swimming and some are jumping off the roof but because of that you know a lot of people develop that sort of habit of just going on stage and not giving a fuck about the clock Rocky then I did too and I'm guilty of it for sure I did a lot of long doing them a favor though and you're also a guy who gave back to the club it's like you know there's little things that go without saying you give us a new roof a new sound system let him run the light Charles Fleischer would give me a second to reacquainted do 40 extra minutes yeah well he was kind of crazy you know Fletcher says we catch up every once a month a band yeah something happened they stopped giving him sets yeah they stopped giving him set something happened he got pissed and he started going over to Laugh Factory he's a genius talk to I want to get him on the podcast I got his number once out of Starbucks with my fucking blackberry fell in the toilet and I lost I lost him before I stored it and fascinating character Steve he's the voice of Roger Rabbit for people don't know yeah yeah but he's also a scientist you know we were in the back of the common story said he came up with some geometric new geometric structure and been working on it for the last 36 days it's working on this mathematical structure I mean he fucking brought it in it was pieced together a little plastic is I go how long did it take you to put this fucking thing together you like pieced it all together himself there's a weird multi-sided geometric pattern yeah Wow what oh what a weird guy nuts who's married for a long time and now he's single you know and I think that the I'm thinking he's one of those guys that probably when his wife left the house building Adam Carolla has like a full cabinetry like construction set up at his garage he's got the dopest place where he where Adam does his podcast he's got a killer studio set up where it's like couches and microphones and all that no whole staff here's the staff of like when I was there there was like five or six people working for him Manning the video cameras and working the phones and all this different shit and then he's got this back area where he keeps his cars or it also has carpentry equipment building fucking cabinets and shit awesome he's a strange cat he's one of the weirdest the weirdest become I mean is I would consider him a stand-up comic now he wasn't for a long time and now he is again he's one of the weirdest of those guys because he's such a he doesn't watch comedy he's not a fan of comedy yeah but to him it's like eels well it's easy for me to do so I just kind of go do it he just fucking does it he's great catch him on the right mixture oh you might catch him when he's on some weed he's friendly as fuck gackt out and what to cut your fucking heart out with a fork people complain as the audio is fucked up Brian yeah I was getting some reverb in my ear yeah Brian I don't want to test well that's not good because then it's good on the mp3 but that's what I was playing with well how do we know what it sounds like on the Ustream see the problem is this laptop doesn't have any headphone jack because it only has one jack for headphones it doesn't this one have a headphone jack yeah but I come in if you pluck if I can plug it in there and listen to interrupt you you well I want to find out what's going on man because the last one was terrible apparently okay tell me what's going on now I'm talking to you Brian psycho and so you see my nose I'm getting a big spinning ball Ustream is very nice for having us on and all that good stuff but seems like a kind of sucks a lot of complaints about it all the time it's free you know yeah at least you like all the ads yes it's all static and stuff still how bad the sound sound really bad shit why don't we disconnect it from that thing how much of a pain in the ass how long will that take it makes no sense at all the audio oh damn Brian we can't have this hold on this is great can I show you something oh there's a lot here's the audio that your computer is saying it sounds like yeah I understand that Brian but it's going okay there this this plug that's going in here it's the same plug Brian I don't care what I'm saying is it sounds like terrible for it sounds terrible for the people that listen on Ustream so how do we fix that we're gonna stop we're gonna stop won't be right back we're gonna stop folks all right gonna fix this
