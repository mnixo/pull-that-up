hello freak bitches which is such a scary thing though because compromising the ability to think correctly to me is one of the scariest things that could happen to you that was I had Lyme disease and one of the nice pent three years in bed but the worst part about life is in years I was really sick Jesus Connor that's where the flow research came from oh yeah I pulled myself out of it through surfing in these crazy altered states that I was having while I was surfing and my first question was what the fuck is going is not I've known cure for chronic autoimmune conditions and why was I having these crazy altered state of consciousness experiences while surfing that's where it started for me um but with Lyme I law I mean I you go crazy you become extremely paranoid the most common misdiagnosis for Lyme is paranoid schizophrenia so you become extremely paranoid I was hallucinating short-term memory gone long-term memory gone am dyslexic I couldn't write I couldn't even read because I would get to the end of a sentence I couldn't remember the beginning the sentence that I read but it's like watching yourself go mad I don't know if any I don't but been through a lot of physical pain I've been through a lot of different illnesses whatever nothing is worse than watching yourself go crazy what are fun my good friend Tommy his girlfriend just this past weekend was telling me about she had Lyme and she was misdiagnosed she had to go to just more than I think she said more than a dozen different doctors before somebody felt finally listen to her if you find help my second book was to Jesus which is the book I write about this is very early it's the first couple of pages um I have a list of all the diseases that I was told I had before they actually discovered was Lyme and it's you know it's half a page of diseases just they I'm so confused by that because the Lyme is common so as I well I first of all I was I had it I got it on the East Coast but I was here I was living in California was living in LA at the time where they hadn't really now they've seen it but at that time nobody had really seen it and they didn't believe it was a West Coast disease and it you know it's still this point that Diagnostics are not fantastic for Lyme what I was saying my friend Katie my friend Tommy's girlfriend Katie she lives in New Jersey or Connecticut rather where it's really common I mean Lyme Connecticut where it came from so they live in a place where it's really common the doctor was like that nap not Lyme she's like I think it might be lime not not lime you're going crazy I went in I don't know if I could talk about this I can't talk about this a little bit but so that will keep names out of it so the first time I walked in to see my doctor I'd been sick for a while and I just moved to LA so I didn't have a regular practitioner I finally got one and been sick for a while so a lot of my friends had been trying to figure out what the hell was going on me and one of my editors said hey I've been doing research I think I think we have Lyme go ask your doctor and I remember walking into the doctor's first time I'd seen him and I was like hey man I you know blah blah this was going on I think I have Lyme and he's like no no you don't have Lyme you have AIDS oh by the way like you know I was like are you sure cuz decided you were gay well no I looked and I was like are you sure be cool so my mother was one of the very first AIDS activists in Ohio so like I've been having protected sex my whole life or baby as yet of true that heterosexual no intervenors drug use at that time and you know just any dudes nothing nothing nothing and nothing nothing at that point you know I'm willing to learn if you'll send me someplace special but uh so this guy decided this guy just looks at me like you're gay no I don't know what do you thought I was like I was like buddy I'm not like I haven't had almost sexual sex I've never used IV right like right sure that was what happened and his bro the worst thing is like I you know go home to your girlfriend who you're living with and she's like how was the doctor honey mm yeah did he test you before you say no he tested he tested let's just say I won the lawsuit Oh went by the time it was all said and done holy shit yet assumed Wow it got really obnoxious I mean like they they wouldn't test me for anything it dragged on and on no does that because they they're worried that if they do test you for something and confirmed they were incorrect and it sets them up for malpractice so they're trying to drag it out and it was an HMO thing so uh insurance has changed but back in that this was early 2009 t9 98 I paid I think my premium HMO coverage was like let's say at the time was like a couple hundred bucks a month of that two hundred bucks a month seven dollars went to the doctor for testing the restroom went to the insurance company the doctor got seven dollars a month to treat me so how incentivized are they to run a bunch of big expensive tests so he looks at anybody on an HMO is like aids you got eight days just get the fuck out him get him to run out of my office hopefully like I'll just do drugs and die oh just drink himself to death exactly wow that's crazy so this was a long time ago when lime wasn't nearly as prevalent yes now well I'm is a goddamn scary disease because I don't know when it originated and they just started sort of treating people for it over the last few decades right I don't um I don't know if this is still true but there was a period of time where it was um the first of the second biggest communicable disease your viral disease in the world it was second to AIDS but one of the things I studied um I did this show called Joe Rogan questions everything for sci-fi and one of the things that we looked into was something called more gel ins do you know what more gel ANZ's and more Jones is a very controversial disease where people feel like they have fibers growing out of their skin and they scratch themselves and develop these like open sores from itching and then they think that like they'll get like carpet fibers in their skin they'll think it's coming out of their body like that like fibers from their clothes that they'll detect on their skin and so it has this sort of weird psychological aspect to it what's interesting about it is a disproportionate number of people who have more gel ins or believe they have it tests positive for Lyme disease so I was talking to a doctor who had more gel ins who also has Lyme and he was very candid and honest about it he and he thinks that there is a direct respond there's a neurotoxic effect that's happening with the Lyme disease that's twisting his mind doesn't mean I went crazy I'll tell you I was it that's why I wanted to talk to his it Fairfax and sunset I was driving my car just stick and it was I was coming back from the doctors this was a typical Lyme what happens to your brain and I'm the lights red and it's rush hour you know what Fairfax and sunset is like a rush hour and the light turn from red to green and I no longer know what green means whoa my brain is just like and I'm like what am I supposed to do what am I supposed to holy people applauding and honking and finally I'm like oh crap green means go and I look down at the stick shift and I no longer have not remember a drive stick well literally get out and people had to push my car into whatever that little grocery store is right into the bargain I get really crazy so like you know fundamental skills of that had since I was 16 years old and you know the ability to go when the light turns green I mean you watch yourself go crazy wow that must be insane but you knew how to walk you knew how to talk you needed to say there's something wrong you had full access to the language I had full access to line I couldn't write I started developing to select I would scramble words up when I was writing but I could talk I don't think I ever lost my powers of speech that I remember what a scary little fucking disease lime is was weird scary creepy disease well this doctor he was absolutely convinced that the two of them were correlated he said that there's something going on with Lyme disease that produces this thing where you you start seeing these fibers coming out of your body and you know we had a ton of people descend in videos and show us images and they had slides they had prepared they were convinced these fibers were coming out of their skin and so doctors oftentimes just completely label it as a psychosomatic disorder but this one doctor who had it said I believe that the correlation is Lyme disease and it completely makes sense what listen to what you're saying the other thing is everything is a psychosomatic disease right I mean there's not idiots well the mind all I was saying is that I don't mean it that was kind of funny now because it's a slick you could kind of avoid it used to be we're all worried everybody's gonna die like you can joke around about aids now which is rare you know if you look at like the the time when Magic Johnson came out as HIV positive everybody was terrified we're all gonna die you know I lost a lot of friends that parrot I'm sure usually fire aids okay so good I might have lost some friends that way too but because of it yes you know you know yeah yeah but for you what did they have to do to you to get you off the lung disease and isn't alarm something you keep semi-permanently so I mean I you know I was in bed for three I mean I'll tell ya I was in bed for about three years they had to pull me off antibiotics because my stomach lining started bleeding out um there was nothing else anybody could do for me and I'll just tell you the full story and I was gonna in my life I like I was at that point I was functional but ten percent of the time maybe like an hour a day I couldn't work the only thing I was going to be was burden my friends and my family and I was just like are you at the time thirty um and in the middle of this I was it was what I was still living in Los Angeles a friend of mine showed up my door and said we're going surfing your fucking mind I can't walk across the room I mean I literally I couldn't do it and she wouldn't shut up and wouldn't leave and wouldn't leave and wouldn't he try to drown you and after like bitch it's hard to make a witness gonna drown me for hours of this or three hours it I was like fuck it let's go surfing today I mean what's the worst that can happen right I'll always kill myself tomorrow right and dragged me out to Sunset Beach and they literally sorta had to walk me to the car right take you know by the shoulders because I was really weak and you know they gave me a board the size of a Cadillac and the bigger the board the easier it is to surf and this was enormous and was a tiny day like waves were like two feet at best and we were so crappy nobody was even out but the water was warm and they sort of like they took me by the elbow and they walked me out to the break and I was out there and I knew how to surf a little bit it been a long time so it served at that point but thirty seconds later a wave came and you know I don't know what have a muscle memory took over whatever but I spun my board I paddled a couple times and I popped up and I just popped up in a dimension I didn't even know existed right something around my vision I felt like see out of the back of my head and I felt amazing felt like that kind of full throttle lifetime and slowed down none of it made any sense it felt so good I caught like four more waves that day and by the fifth wave I was just I was disassembled they kind of put me back in the car and drove me home and I was so sick after that that I was I got into bed and people had to bring me food for like two weeks cuz I couldn't walk to my kitchen which is like 60 feet away this exhaust I was not surfing time but on like the 15th day which the day I could walk again caught another ride back to the beach and I did it again right and again I have this crazy altered state of consciousness experience and you know again I was disassembled this time maybe was like 13 days that I was in bed and I did it again and over the course of about six to eight months with the only thing I was doing differently in my life was surfing I went from about 10% functionality to about 80% functionality so my first question is the fuck is going on right like as I said earlier the surfing is not a known cure for chronic autoimmune so and I lit out on a giant quest the other thing was my backgrounds as a science writer so like I don't have quasi mystical experiences my shirt l don't have them while surfing which has got to be the flaky as' you know thing ever yeah and um so I really believed that even though I was feeling better lives only fatal if it gets into your brain and I was I was pretty sure that even though I was starting to feel physically better that the disease had crept into my brain because why else would I be having these mystical experiences I must be totally losing my mind about to die and I lit out on a giant quest figure out what the hell happened and you know very quickly discovered that these states of consciousness have names we call them flow States and the version of what happened to me health-wise um and this is her Benson did some of the work on the neurobiology of this he's at Harvard um he wrote about it in his book the breakup principle but all the neural chemicals that show up and flow to things happen so one when you move into flow there's a global release of nitric oxide it's a gaseous signaling molecules anywhere in the body what it does is it flushes all the stress hormones out of your system and it pumps you full of these kind of feel good performance names and code lime is in essentially any autoimmune conditions your nervous system gone haywire so when you go into flow it resets your nervous system it calms everything down it gets rid of all the stress on all that stuff and when the worst part about Lyme is you don't even know where normal is like it has been so long since you have felt normal like you don't even you can't even find it on map so suddenly like I was like oh this is what normal feels like again the other thing is you know the positive neuro chemicals that show up and flow dopamine serotonin ananda mana sito's and those are all immune system boosters I mean they do a ton of other stuff enhanced cognitive performance and whatever but her Benson at Harvard and I think this may be over stretching a budge but he has kind of gone on record and said he thinks most cases of so-called spontaneous healing actually have a flow state at their heart and it's this particular process that's doing [Music]
