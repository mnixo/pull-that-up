here we go three two one and we're live Tony Hinchcliffe hello Jake the fucking snake I can't believe it man what do you know Joe I never heard it before I've heard a couple times I've heard hey Joe I heard you shot your old lady down yeah I gotta tell you man I watched you documentary last night and it's fantastic appreciate it is if that thing doesn't bring tears to you I you need to go to a doctor yeah you're not human man no doubt that is Dallas is a fucking Saint he really is hard-headed you know without it I'd never made it yeah cuz you know what junkies and I like to lie a lot you know an alcoholics do too but it was a tough tough road man and he guided me through it he's amazing never gave up and I can never thank him enough for what he's done for me and I give him our life back not only my life of my family I've got my kids back they're all digging me now I'm a great grandfather probably the best grandfather ever you know I'm just saying cause it's true Lyle picks anybody up the detailing of your recovery though and him taking you in - what does he call his house that house the the audibility house accountability crib yeah yeah I mean he's a special guy it is understand I mean no man in his right mind would bring one much less two drunks into their home you know you got to expect tragedy there's gonna be something come bad out of this and he was able to hold us together man I mean ever a couple of brief moments that does that kind of escalated and got kind of stupid but you wouldn't give up man well I got to know Dallas when he came on the podcast and one thing you get about him is this guy he he's not just about himself like he is really about helping people out he gets a buzz yeah yeah and which is to me is just so amazing and I've picked that up off him I search people out now in the crowd are having a hard time walking or you see something going on or they were over waiting all night and you know I'm sewing son it gets me in yes in the name Jake the snake I can talk to them hey you ever thought trying some DDP yoga man because it works yeah if you've never done it DDP yoga is without a doubt the number one thing out there for getting nothing makes your body healthy makes your mind healthy you know and for him to be out there he's just a soldier yeah he really is he pushes all day long man and here's a guy that they could be handling in a totally different way but he still picks up a phone and call somebody and thinks we're buying the program yeah L does that right what does design he does because he wants to know and the next thing you know he's been on the 25-minute phone call and they're sending him photos of the before picture and then he wants to look at an after picture you know six months from now the story you got a million of them we put that story we played a video when he was in of a gentleman who was the paratrooper yeah I could barely walk I mean he had done a bunch of paratrooper missions you know parachuting out of planes and landing on his knees his knees are destroyed legs destroyed backs destroyed everything's fucked up but he starts out barely can stand barely can walk to games yeah two kings by the end of the video this guy's run him he's running he's doing full yoga poses these animal incremental steps incremental steps but he kept getting better kept getting better kept getting better and that is it's so symbolic of like your journey in life if you just decide to give up and decide to just fuck the world I'm just gonna just eat and drink myself and deliver being you have been there you could talk about that stay there a long time man but then you turn it around but that's that's I fucking love that my story's like yeah but it's a one a million shot man unless you have a Diamond Dallas Page in your corner right because it wasn't only about Dallas helping me it was the whole group right see Dallas you know he came up with the idea him enough Steve you as a business manager whatever and they said look you know we're gonna bring you back through this we're gonna film the whole thing I don't know about that because I got burnt bad in the film here while back you may just cut me a new one man they lied to me and you know anyway it happens film this whole thing and at the end of it if we put it together and you don't like it'll never go out really you're gonna give me that right you're gonna invest this money and this time because we stayed there for three and a half years cuz it took me that long to get clean that's amazing you know I couldn't go in for six months I've done that I've given going for four months I've done that all the time I went in for four months man I go across the stage you get my diploma so to speak from finishing this course I'm being in rehab for four months I go out the other side pick up a pay phone and call my dealer he meets me outside the damn door man big rock you know in a stem thank you I made it but that's the insanity the disease yeah the disease will let you sit in a place for three or four months and not touch you won't even come knocking on your door so it knows right now you're locked in you're gonna do this but it's over there doing push-ups in the corner man waiting on your ass get away from these idiots over here teaching you bad habits Jake I'm gonna get you where you need to be and that was the thing of being there for that long period of time what was the feeling like when you did slip up oh yeah just a couple of times four or five times I did yeah boy it was horrible I wanted to die cuz not only did I feel like I let myself down I let him down and that really sucked cuz yours a guy there's opened up his wallet and said you come live with me don't worry about your damn bills I'll take care of excuse me old I'm damn sure in now he'll you have talked twice about this scram oh yeah I'm moving in with you both you're gonna pay all my bills man well I get healthy God everyone fellas gonna take three years Wow let's see he would take you know like if he had to go do a con or go do some music you know go to go to the movie or something he had people that work for DDP yoga specifically Garrett and a young kid named Dylan who I really got the kid messed up you know because he had to share a room with me I don't wear clothes kind of freaky here's his old wrestler that I've idolized for years and I'm seeing his junk yeah Oh gray hair and everyone's joke as well I'm seeing a snake in the back I accidentally bent over picking something up right there by his bed I had no idea my asshole was in his mouth oh but yeah Dylan he lived through some horrible things and Garrett did too but Dallas always made sure I was taken care of you know he whatever he had to do the first thing you had to do was take care of Jake he put me first I didn't expect that well the Solidarity in the the camaraderie that you guys all have and Razor Ramon as well when you guys are all in on a house together like the experiences that you guys shared working together and then still in life you know you guys have a bond that's very very it's it's very hard for most people they can get yeah you know it's like it's like guys that are you know in the service together and there's just something becomes they become brothers in one no and with Dallas you know the thing about him was he's never went down that addiction in that addiction road I used to run night clubs but he never became an alcoholic he's a freak piss on him screw you got a better car than I did okay I get that but I like my cards now man my cards now are awesome my life is so good too to go from hell that's where I was at man you have no idea what it's like to wake up and be angry that you woke up because you didn't want you want to eat wanted to be over and there's been so many years that were like that for me that I wouldn't go out shopping unless it was 3:00 a.m. I didn't want anybody to see me because I got to the point I hated myself so much I'm begging God to die when I would hear another wrestler had died I'd get angry at God and curse for not taking me instead when Piper died we were just talking about rowdy before the show started man I was so pissed off but he got to go before I did you know and that's just wrong man I mean even when I tried to OD a couple of times you know really tried I took a hundred valium Jesus Christ under Jim milligram valium woke up it's all I've done is puking myself and I said what a fucking loser you are you can't even die right you're a piece of shit what kind of mine says that so mine is the torture that people put themselves through be an addict people get to be had the wrong idea about this shit man anything yeah they're out there getting fucked up man they're happy no we're not no we're not happy we're not enjoying getting high I could enjoying getting high thirty years ago but the problem was I live without it I mean I would feel like my heart was gonna burst I couldn't breathe I was scared to go anywhere shit was it hot was it everything or anything like what what what was drawn what was pulling you what drug yeah what was it booze was it for me it was more I was there more everything hey I'm lucky I didn't get in in the heroin you know I probably wouldn't have beat that one but yeah I would because that's this is what I'm meant to be doing right now but to go through 25 30 years of doing cocaine that's amazing you know I think this big man for affording me my addiction because without it I'd be in prison somewhere cuz I would have killed somebody for my drug know I was out of doubt I would have you know knifed him whatever man you guys an Eightball watch this done life meant nothing to me man and he gives to a point where you put yourself in such a dark hole there is no life none at all and it takes somebody as special you couldn't send me to rehab right then I'm gonna work kind of I'd have been out in minutes even when Dallas offered me to pay the whole trip and you'll move in with him when feed you the best damn food on the planet we're gonna get you healthy really get the bullshit out of your system I'm like yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna last about a week no good I knew me and I'm like dude if I make it a week I'm gonna be doing good because at the time I couldn't do 24 hours nothing okay Wow if you wanted me to get up out of bed bring me some cocaine yeah Wow that's where I was at because life was too ugly to want to go out there when did it start did it start when you're pro wrestling career started or not before then uh no the cocaine and alcohol alcohol was always I mean I started drinking when I was 11 or 12 whoa my grandfather was an alcoholic drug addict slash drug addict this started with an oil field accident he got his legs crushed and he refused to have his legs cut off so he stayed in hospital for 18 months well back in the 1920s the way that they fixed you was let it heal then we break it you know that's what they did they didn't put bars and metal in there to straighten it out they let it healed and they debris break in a different way oh and they kept him a dick kept him on morphine for a year and a half was the end of the year and had they patted him on the back see you he had a little itch going out there Jimmy yeah after that he could walk so it worked but it took to a point until you're hooked up on morphine which back then it wasn't like today you don't any corner right he went to hell gone I remember in the 60s which is 40 years later they not trusting him to come to the doctor's office where they didn't trust him to take the pill the bill the pill being um what you call keep you from drinking antabuse you take an antibiotic but it's a peated i mean i've drank on an abuse when it's been like two days since i've had the bill i have a drink you have no idea how scary that shit is because immediately you start throwing up and you start pissing and shitting your pants it happens that quick and then you have sort of the sweats and all this and you wind up on the floor doing the heebie-jeebies man that's how strong an abuse is well they didn't even trust him to take the pill they said no no you take a taxi to the doctor's office and we'll give you a shot cuz we know you're not gonna take that pill so you do that every morning I need to go outside and get in the same taxi and because we lived in a dry County he would take that same taxi over to the next county and get a fifth of whiskey drink it before he got home now the rest of his day spent shitting and puking Wow but yet tomorrow are you gonna do the same thing oh my god that's the hell you know I was doing the dirty I'm doing the coping stuff man I'm hating myself the whole time I do it I'm not getting high anymore and I can't put it down I can't turn away from it cuz there's hope in that what's the hope for no more pain so just that it numb no more shame you know shame is something you put on yourself you know you can't shame me man I have to do it myself though man it was there man and because I went through some ugly shit as a kid being sexually molested my sister being molested too and then my sister kidnapped and murdered and we got all these things thrown in there and I was hating myself because I didn't protect my sister better hmm you know just you know life happens what do you do with it that's one of the things that Dallas preaches you know you got all this stuff out there man it's gonna come at you I just want you to do with it that counts you know you don't deflect it no you bring it to you you chew it up you spit it out you slept sit through the bullshit and you go on it's something I couldn't do because things got personal with me and I would lock down god shut up cuz that's how I handle things I just didn't talk about it when you've been sexually molested there is no good moment man and that screwed my head up and it still messes with my head I desperately desperately want to have a relationship with a woman you know a true relationship finally it's 63 because I did have relationships before but I was constantly sabotaging them because I didn't trust women those was the last one she raped me and beat me and threatened me and told her my dad killed me because you know my dad was seven foot and weighed 425 pounds so he could get the job done I just wanted my dad to be proud of me so all these things are factoring yeah even quiet while the wife beats me and made me do her and then beats me half towards dude sex ain't sex if you're doing it like that that's called rape and that shit screws your head up for life now what do you do with it well as a kid I hid that shit man I stuffed it away I didn't talk about that are you kidding me when I said be the first time talking about it to a high school buddy of mine he's you're so fucking lucky man you're your stepmothers still fucking hot she was on she's 22 years old cuz my father's a child molester for Christ's sake of course she was hot but it wasn't hot to me because that's my mom no and then the beatings afterwards that's fucking confuses you the only shit going man so you start looking for a way out and for me as a kid my grandfather would get drunk and forget where he hid his liquor because he had to hide it from her grandmother cuz she knew what he was she dealt with it for 50 years so every time she found a bottle on the farm she'd break it and that's it so he and I didn't I'm checking my house different places well me and my buddies from across the street would go out and find it lovely long eleven years old then we got smart started selling into the other neighborhoods yes yeah make a buck that was my beginning with drinking man and you know as time goes on man you start smoking weed in the pills what else is next because I'm still not forgetting I'm still remembering this shit and you go out and you try to have a good time with people and then you realize something's different than you because drugs that put you to sleep wake me up you know Downers wake me up like how some are you you give me five percocet brother I'll bring a case of beer and dance all night for you really go out and have three or four wrestling matches let's go to the if I take when I mess my neck up in 89 when I hear the guitar when I wonder you're the gym my regimen was to wake up go downstairs starts coffee maker thanks to men ten milligram percocet balm in my mouth chew him up and wash him down with coffee then hit the gym Jesus I loved it because I was on fire man plus the purpose that made me a little gnarly made me want to punch in really so you get a good workout anything good from percocet yeah that's how screwed up my wiring is that is so you don't get any drug and they'll tell you their wine yeah things that make you go to sleep wake me up things that wake you up put me to sleep so the pain of pro wrestling which is probably one of the most brutal professions that the person can embark on right and think about all the days that you were on the road all the many many matches all that physical pain probably justified the drugs even more didn't care he didn't care about the I don't I I felt no pain my arrest none afterwards no I was wrestling in a guy in Louisiana Ernie the cat lad remember him playing for the AFL San Diego Chargers he's in the Hall of Fame football and wrestling he was six nine three fifty bad ass son of a bitch but back then they had chopped box and he had like 15 knee surgeries and I was into his career but we were wrestling and my bone came out of my arm compound fracture and he goes kid your arm I'm like yeah I see it it's gone he's like what get away from me and I'm trying to get to him and he starts puking on me fuck you bone dude come on this finish the match you pick up a bunch of shit and six foot nine yeah you finish off your opponent by having him nasty smelling shit to him but I was fine that's Annie Walker you know I was sitting there and I was always saying this is a strange thing that I blow all the bone oh it feels cold whoa holy fuck holy fuck then you felt it the Adrenaline's gone right you've been in the ring you know what's going on hurts it feels good in fact you know I would have thought that you would look at the bone ago oh I gotta handle this now what did you wrestle fucked up no I wrestled straight know how straight bird watch you know I've been going through withdrawals at the time but I know I didn't drink her yes before before match and I didn't like it but I did it that way because it's my and my thing is another wrestler to take care of my opponent I noticed that after if I have like a fun set or something like that doing stand-up comedy that I like to have like if it went if I tried something new and it went extra good I like to have an extra drink or two that night would it be like that for you and wrestling would you get more messed up it was like Madison Square Garden early you know right go sleep was such a premium back then seven days a week well except for Saturday and Sunday then we arrested twice on Saturday twice on Sunday Jesus like you might do the LA Coliseum at 2:00 o'clock car and drive to San Diego Wow the next day you might be an Omaha two o'clock and you'd be in Des Moines at 7 o'clock and you're driving all this but yeah you know you fly you drive well with me made it even worse because I got a drag that fucking snake everywhere 80 pound box of shit right be like trying to carry this around with a bad back over there hey folks out there pray for him man he's over there moving he's making fun of young Jamie and Jamie as a minor in fact it's very difficult to talk about injuries when you're around Jason it's only before when I first got here is like I pulled my back the other day but I don't want to mention it in front of Jake the snake cause it's embarrassing this should be Tori's man tore his mangina he sneezed and tore his mangina it was a horrible scene he's a good man I will not stand here while you disparage himself Shelby's always now the snaked it was a snake a problem when you would get on planes and check could you keep it secret or would they let you on the plane with it I never said anything to anybody it just brought it no I just put it in a trunk I'm gonna put a blanket around the bag and then lock the truck you carry it honor with you check that check it Wow that poor fuck it's a yeah things like why is it so cold in here well because sure 40,000 feet off the ground you don't goddamn noise well the thing is you laugh about it it's like wait a minute I gotta trade this snake out after 10 days yeah they can't take it I'm like really so a fucking snake can't live through the fucking scheduling but yet I'm asked to do 90 fucking days straight so you had different snakes yeah yeah about every 10 days what used to be funny people say you're buying Damien like if you notice that Damien some weeks is my foot shorter than melamine it's not shrinkage honey yeah so you're seven days a week would go on for the whole year goddamn they just worked you yeah we wrestled Steamboat 93 days straight and about I need 60 days in I had to call my wife here come take me around because I've gotten dumbed down to the point that I couldn't think so I get to the airport know that they want tickets but I have no idea where they're at and I can't read anymore Oh God look at stuff to read but it just wouldn't we wouldn't work so I just had a big fuckin from exhaustion Wow you just get so beat up man your body's hurting so bad people say steroids man we were taking steroids just to try to get healthy heal right that's what the shit was invented for your recovery yeah you know that's they invented in war too I believe is what the story was it for the prisoners of war because they didn't want the American soldiers to come home looking like they did so they put him on slow fucking boats and fed him for three months and guys put on 30 40 pounds they say there would have been another war if they'd have brought those troops home coming from concentration camps for the Germans or the Japanese and we'd have seen the way they were and of course now that you can see some of those little films of the way the Jews looked for them they were being slaughtered and everything and just back of bones it that they didn't want to bring those troops home so they invented steroids it started popping everybody with that shit Wow can bring them back but we did it really just the drive to you was it hard to get them right well did they help you get him what no one say right help me but I will tell you this okay what they would do is we would get booked in Hershey Pennsylvania now when somebody told me this story first I'm like this is an old wives tale because shit like that normally happen you get get the talent down Hershey you go the locker room sudden somebody said they need to see you in locker room three what the fuck did I do let's not go in there and there's this doctor there and you got suitcases over here boxes here suitcases your boxes there what do you need kid excuse me what do you need up down what were you asleep Oh Halcyon those are good I'll take how many gonna get pennies up want 300 you

out there for ten days though so what how often they eat once ever six weeks ago oh really yeah really the action and the flying and everything they'd only live for ten days yeah they had to get them off the road and let them heal because of snakes lungs they'll be entire length in their body and they're very tiny so they get pneumonia really easy of course being in minus 40 doesn't help either they do get pneumonia real easy would you have to get a new snake was that your like responsibility we had a guy in Stamford Connecticut he was Charles Manson revisited this guy was a freak brother Stanford Connecticut is a weird place okay he had a farm in down Connecticut what and they did not know that he had over a thousand snakes in that farm on that building in about 150 of them are poisonous no because he was collecting venom for different for different pharmaceutical companies but I remember one time having to get a snake from and heedful it to Omaha and you know he'd been working with me for a couple of years Albert man will take care of you tonight bye what is it Jake like once they get it the strip joints like I'm necessary I'm like I know it's not necessary hey brother let me take you out until we get there man he's just kind of like sitting there and we head down the towards the table looking at his beard and break my jaw and I'm like get this motherfucker going you know so they dude you pick her out if you'll take a price I'll pay for love words I'm abides and buzzing Oh scuse me I just want to go back to the room and play with my snake yeah yeah he was a real freakazoid my just into snakes is he still alive yeah he is he was enough floor to win that bet Herc ain't hit down there and he was working in a gator farm and poisonous snake venom collection point and they had like 800 snakes down there right so the hurricane hits and just fucking levels of place well I'm calling for days trying to get old him see if he's all right and finally get him dude why are you so fucking happy I haven't best time of my life man this is fucking like God's made this especially for me I'm like what are you talking about I get to find all those snakes well you get to find them anything you're gonna dig through all that shit all that shit and lifts up stuff and stick your hand down and holes and shit to find these poison snakes yeah Scully come on fuck you you're fucked up what is it with Florida and snakes all right Thank You Connecticut man whatever I know but he went to Florida it's like it draws him there like a magnet he was in Connecticut man and they asked him to go do anything for the boys club you know introduced him to snakes and blah blah blah be great in over the 8 to 12 year olds so he sits in there and he's talking to them about this Mexican rattler now first thing you know about snakes is this they could be poisonous and uh poisonous snakes children what happens there they're not healthy they will hurt you they can kill you yes that's right that's why you should always keep up Oh oh my god hold on okay look he's accidentally bit me you know I've been bitten now so I think what I wanted somebody call 9-1-1 um we're gonna I'm just gonna explain to you what I'm feeling right now so if you ever get bitten you'll know what you're gonna expect to feel after you've been bitten with no no there he's fucking bitin man yeah he's fucked and he knows that he's fucked because here's the thing about Mexican rattlesnakes not many of those in Connecticut down so you don't have any anti-venom do you oh Jesus no they gotta fly it in from fucking to Atlanta or wherever so by the time they get that shit up their time and he's fucked up they wind up in to cut all the meat off one of his bones on his finger so you got like this gnarly so he had a necropsy right yeah yeah I've seen a video or a website rather detailing this kid who got bit in the arm no we had to get him somewhere to safety but it took hours that a medevac I'm and the helicopter his whole arm rotted away down to the bone so they had to take meat from his legs get it off yeah yeah and put you know they had to do skin grafts all over the I think he went through like 16 operations he's awful they to stitch them all together like pull the meat of his arm together and stitch it all together there's a giant 10 to 12 inch patch of his arm was gone yeah fucks you up plus the really cool looking thing that it does it causes all the small capillaries in your eyes to burst don't you so your eyes are like blood-red except they're bumpy ah you know like even close his eyes and I run my finger over his eyelid and you just feel all these little bumps and crevices and how long it take for him to recover he's not held for a couple weeks man he was a to put him in a coma for like 6 days oh Jesus Christ cool cool this is he does he have a tolerance to regular venom because I know a lot of us building a tolerance to different ones yeah they make themselves get bit yeah Cobra I think he's pretty much clean on this guy sounds like he's gonna end up being a supervillain of some kind just he could be mad because I swear to god he is Charles Manson wow he looks like Charles Manson he looks weird like any when he smiles just like dude that is not healthy you know wow he's a true but imagine what this guy would be like without snakes thank God snakes exists well yeah the steamboat you know come up with the Komodo dragon thing you know to come back to a snake back in the day on mmm so of course that's who Albert Albert was the guy with the Komodo dragons so he he had some pot that he was growing up in the mountains and he took one of the Dragons with him if you get it out in the sunlight so they put it in this fucking station wagon and they go up in the mountains and they had to walk to their place where they got the stuff growing so they closed the car door up and leave the window down about that much and take off come back windows busted out Jesus there's these horrible teeth marks on all of it or this fucking Komodo dragon been chewing his way out of this shit he's in a wooden KT he chewed his way out of the wood encasement he got out man took off and I guess it's about two months later man I was like in Indianapolis and waking up and listening to the news and ESPN's honor like what was thought to be a prehistoric monster was found running across the backyard of Miss gibbets house chase your poor little boo hmm when we get back see our monster while they come back and I'm sitting on what the fuck thought to be prehistoric see this shit and the fucking thing comes back up that's fuckin Alvers fucking thing man it's the thing that had escaped to much later yeah it gained like 35 pounds everybody's dogs and cats a neighborhood man and probably cook with kids too whoo that is such a ruthless animal you know the things are so ruthless that the little baby Komodo dragon is mere shit on themselves so that the grown-ups don't eat them so that their parents don't eat them they roll around in shit so that their parents don't eat them because when Komodo dragons are eating intestines they shake the shit out of intestines yeah they don't like to eat shit as weird as that is that's just bad attitude they eat their fucking kids so the kids know this least they somehow or another like know to smear themselves and shit I'd learned pretty quick yeah you see your sister Gertrude right see them avoid shit but eat your sister you like that shit is salvation Wow some good shit it gained 30 pounds that's fucking crazy yeah let it loose in Florida they won't even notice fuck don't wanna shove everything else we got yeah yeah that Florida Everglades is so clever with pythons man so so bad that they're eating alligators they did this study they found that they they couldn't find any raccoons they couldn't find any swamp rabbits or March hares I guess they call them because yeah everything got killed by Python so then the pythons moved on to alligators yeah alligators I've got a picture of an anaconda swallowing an 800-pound horse what it's got the head in the front legs already chewed up inside where's this picture you know I need it I'll get to you I need that I just fuckin crosa shit see if you could find that okay Jamie of my horse's body is like this big with his back he probably can't pull it up Jaime's coming at you hard and with it I bet in all your years you never thought Jake the snake could be roasting you live on the Internet believe that and mail received back injury and nailing a pull it up reference yeah I got you bro I'm not just a short face in a pretty dick short digna pretty face that's yeah did you ever load the day that you came up with the gimmick of having snake god yeah yesterday well everybody else just traveling solo here's the thing I come up with this idea like in 1975 Wow cuz ice listen to Monday Night Football and they were talking about Kenny Stabler remember him played for the Raiders remember the name left-handed quarterback man sling it and boy gets slinging it man and he also like to party man so I dug him man yeah I'm saying he's like this motherfuckers cool I mean super believed he took all the linemen with him out to the bars they didn't show up for 4:30 in the morning yeah here's the thing did the coach keep them from playing I don't think so but he did tell him you better fucking win yeah that's all I saw the what's-his-name told you better fucking win because if you don't oh yeah it's tapered took them out there and they won the game no but uh yeah no I don't know I don't know but what I loved the Kenny Stabler the snake thing that's a fucking hippo it ate a hippo Jesus Christ oh well it's got to be a baby hippo I don't look like he's too fucking small yeah but hippos are huge baby hippos probably probably big is your dick a lot of things there we go whoa which is pretty mentions is they can't Gurjit eight pull that shit out that's insane well I we uh I was riding down the road list Monday Night Football and look I'd be too much man if I fuckin wrestler curious snake around and fuck with the other resume drinking you know more and more and more and next day will come like that fucking idea and last night caring about his name what the fuck was I thinking I'm terrified of snakes I'm terrified but how do you connect that to the football player because he was Kenny the snake Stabler oh here we go in the snake oh he was just badass man I'm gonna be the snake - so you were already Jake Roberts and I wasn't even Jake Roberts and then I looked for a name was snake yeah like the snake flaky snaky he's got a 40 foot putt ears not even Blake would have a bad back it's got a bigger mangina than that oh no I'll never do that fucking gimmick fuck that but I did go I said okay I gotta think of a name and no one JJ I'm not thinking that at the time of TV program was Dallas who's the bad guy jr. jr. Jake the snake let's go Wow little B then I came up with Roberts I just get a snake well after years of throwing it out there occasionally and getting are you fucking serious wrestling there's not a fucking circus stuff fuck it ain't nice excuse me bill watch fat fuck Steven bastard but this is before Vince a four year WWI yeah yeah what organization was this well this was mid-south and they just fucking know if certain terminal you ever wait a minute you don't want me to carry a snake but the guy I'm wrestle has got a fucking hockey mask on and every night he fucking head bust me with it and you have me carved my fucking forehead open so he can believe everywhere but it's not a circus I get that totally you bet you yo so blowing out the window then I went to fucking New York and that's when Vince hit me with the you're gonna be wearing a purple or lime-green spandex which I said ain't no fucking fag you know I'm not wearing it what year is this Vince 85-86 forget how long Vince has been in the game yeah oh hell yeah he bought that guy out the guys at Watts mid-south he but he just went to every territory and just said I'll give you this amount of money I'm just taking oral English of my heart I'm giving this to you because I'm I'm taking your all your television yeah so crazy all the people that was all split up into territories so everybody had their own business and bore stage might be another one territory you know what's really crazy about Vince is how fucking Jack Dee is yeah I'd like what is he like 75 this is 64 65 Men's Fitness with a chains around his real recently yeah Jack or something about growth hormone that just continues to work I think there's a lot more going on than just growth oh I'm sure feeling so stacked with this I mean 73 what in the fuck is that just a billionaire toke that is insane jacked his back is 73 years old is built like Brock Lesnar that is insane he's the man I'm at imagine like seeing this when you were a kid like this is what grandpa looks like yeah you feel like what the fuck is going on with Grandpa yeah okay that is insane 73 years old there is nobody on this planet who works as hard as he does there's no other way it's possible I mean the guy is he's he's everywhere and that one the one video where he runs to the ring and is on his way and dives into it and slams his thigh into the side ring blows his fucking quad the ball and then still plays it out and does it sitting down yeah - cause - been in unbelievable agony right he killed annually would stand up and he's just sitting there sitting on his butt and the everybody has to like improvise for this guy sitting on his ass cause he's his blew his quads off of his bone watch this shit look at this I mean this is fucking crazy I did the same thing in tour look at this he dives in look at his leg gives out are you done at that point you're drilling all you're thinking is get the fuck up that's all you're thinking but it is crazy that he's just sitting there yeah I think the funniest part of this is this is the final moment of the Royal Rumble this is a huge long build-up and it's controversial because they both went over the top and landed so there's this tie so all the reps are trying to figure out what's going on so it makes it even funnier that Vince is just sitting there the owner extra yeah still was that Jesus Christ he's so much bigger than he is now in guardians of the galaxy protein diet is no way natural bro that's vegan it's incredible I mean just just the fact that that guy was able to do that I gotta bring this up because we were watching this in the greenroom right before we got it David Arquette is wrestling yeah did you know this yeah David Arquette is blood yeah got a light bulb smashed on his head mm-hmm cuts all over his face I fuckin two-by-four oh yeah well there's what usual isn't two-by-four yeah what is the worst shit you ever gonna hit with the guitar a guitar oh that's honky-tonk right I was a real guitar that's really surprising to me because it always appeared like the honky tonks guitar was just an exploding they all were after that what is this WCW World Heavyweight Champion David Arquette we met wait a minute what it was a highly controversial moment heavyweight champion how much this wasn't 40 that doesn't make any sense 40 art he he is definitely built way bigger he's way thicker than he's ever been before because when they showed him on TMZ he was rolling around he looked Jack he's got D visage now find the video that did the TMZ video because it's kind of fuckin hilarious it is really and just goes to show you what happens over you know it's a lust that you get for it you know wrestling I mean I hated wrestling growing up hated cuz your dad because my dad did it and he was never home so I blamed wrestling for him never being home mmm bottom line you can give a fuck about kids except those they could rape and hit in the head oh Jesus Christ that guy stabbed him in them gouging yeah with with a fluorescent light bulb that he just shattered by the way you can get that dust in your eyes look how big he is our kid was never that big before he's looking like an Eddie Guerrero right there you know kind of a marital arias what got jacked is the cool thing about David doing this is that like he just got sober a few years ago and he's doing this to keep life exciting for him you know what I mean and I just doesn't have any movie rules coming in now well I went no but he's a jerk who's fucking jack dude I mean I'm very impressed with his physique I got into executive producing a bunch of stuff like he's one of the executive producers of like Cougar Town he's with his ex-wife yeah all these massive ones back in and get stomped like that would you see where you just looking pushes back for you guys because no I'm gonna lay down here again oh and then he just hit him with a chair there's broken glass on it this is some high level production for 50 people in the room yeah exactly the blood and everything Jesus Christ punctured glass and the rain is brilliant yeah that is crazy now that's then he leaves the fucking ring goes wrong yes you could tell he's pissed he can go the way he wanted it to do you think he's pissed yeah he was pissed do you think they planned that somebody fucked him somewhere in there you have fucked you think so yeah could you see the M going for the guy uh-huh then the guy just took him over yeah and this store didn't get back going him he wasn't expecting that he thought he was going up uh and then you see him then you seem just fucking get up and you fucking storm out of the fucking ring why didn't you stay and she gets fucking ass obviously you can't see he's trying to get to him this guy won't fucking let him now watch guy takes him over and he's on top of me he's looking him for the one two three he got the one two three see he did not want that to fucking happen I watch this just gets up fucking I'm going home right now that's interesting because you see this from the eyes of professional I see this from the eyes of a layman in the crowd and I don't see that that's fascinating you see a double cross oh yeah three count on him yeah you know David Arquette sitting back knowing that Jake the snake is doing commentary on his match how uh David get a day job sister over a year rageous listen he just needs to practice yeah young buck I mean didn't Dallas didn't Dow started when he was 36 imagine that and the crazy part is you were one of his original mentors and I'm the guy that shit I'll fuckin teach you because everybody else would you're too fucking old yeah specifically Ric Flair Ric Flair told him Dallas you've been a manager you do this well you do that well but in the 36 get a grip on you know you're too fucking old to start and when Dallas told me that I'm like fucking man if it's Church is it really your dream he says my fucking dream man I want it fuck it I'll teach him and that's why I started I moved in with him and then we had the infamous snake accident in his house what was the infamous snake hisses oh I got busy with a girlfriend and forgot what I was doing upstairs I was washing the snake off and back downstairs to check on her and she caught me by surprise and raped me oh my god I forgot the snake upstairs ooh so I ran back upstairs realized it been two and a half hours and Dallas is just coming over his bedroom was like what the fuck you been in the shower the whole time I'm like yeah I just startin yeah I'm sweaty you look at me you know I'm in the shower yet man the snake was in there I'll get my shit forget right now you'll watch leave the show Dallas I was watching some soap out man fuck get a grip man leave me alone so I go in

whatever and you give them an in because they're going to hear you so much then you fall asleep actually her actually hear yo whoa experience is very different than mine well I've had three successful marriages nobody died I did 13 years my first wife 13 years with my second wife four months my third so I'm getting better what but it sounds like you're talking about prison I did 13 years is I says about marriage how's it 13 years that's like Samuel s in an ad said goes that goes back to my experience right you know my experience is unfortunate because what I've been through I let a woman get this close to me we're about to get started getting real which is what I really want but then I got to push it back cuz Brad can handle it I want to get back to this but I know what happened to the cats okay well long story short I couldn't find him this long as long as I was there how much well right before she got home I thought I would do the man thing you can get my car and run that's what I did that is what he did fucking I had a slick fucking 84 Corvette that I knew would not look good with high heels going up and down right cuz that bitch a wonderful lady she was a wonderful woman she was gonna fuck you up she don't forget buddy right and if I'm not sleeping with you you're not gonna talk shit like that to me right you know that's true always good if I'm sleeping with you but that was it I had to leave I came back two days later in my defense two days later okay and when I got there I see all these workmen carrying sheets of uh sheetrock sheetrock yeah I'm like what the fuck and then Dallas had told me they were gonna do some remodeling downstairs oh they're working on my fucking room right he's like dude 15 minutes package it and go what you got to get out one little snake and I've got to go that's really bullshit Dallas and yeah they couldn't find this snake either so they wound up calling some people professionals and the only way they found it was by carrying out several walls and they finally can pound it on the walls what did it do climb an event it got in the vent wherever I don't know and got into the wall and blacktop fuck and they had to follow it through the house how did they find it by running out of walls right after they were quite upset happily so I have my kitchen worked on once and after they sealed the the drywall in the back I heard since I know my cat so my cat spaz I was like spaz she's like shit I'm like she's in the fucking wall so I had to go get a hammer and I had a cloth in the wall and then pull her out cover didn't fucking that's where I get the music boom boom and sweet cat had that happen nineteen years Wow yeah let me do it Here I am in Australia this is like 1993 or four and there's a Japanese superstar named Thunder just like mm-hmm I mean just top of the top brother so he's on to her was no problem but first night he's in was we'd already been there two nights and these people come in these Japs come in and they start fucking yeah in Japanese to this other guy in English transferred and boom boom bottom line is he will not stay in the same fucking dress room as Jake he's terrified as I said dude I'm not gonna get it on him no doesn't matter he doesn't even think he should be here because of Jake okay fuck him let him go where everyone's son Gibbs you know I told you I wouldn't get it on you if my words not good enough fuck off so he goes and gets another dressing room on the other side of these Coliseum long ways across there he wrestles goes into shower comes out from the shower he's drying off he looks up in the mirror and in the mirror he can see a pipe of Cobra he's come up out of the toilet it was looking around the room and the rest of him still on the toilet and then he goes back down he screams he runs across the fucking building nude everybody's attention the police get involved he comes down to Jake where's your fucking snake boy I really can't find it so he gotten out of my locker room and went into the toilet and took off and come up and that toilet over there that's fucking back it got on give a fucking airplane that night and went the fuck home imagine the sense that he was scared as I read it and then went and found out the place where there was the motor here one yeah yeah I wonder if that of us in it I mean it only makes thank you sir thank you since you're that's they would go after prey animals right prey armored animals are terrified of them they probably have a sense of fear he's a fucking toilet you imagine that goes through the toilet I mean I still have horror stories and bad memories of sitting on the toilet in a snake just by claiming the balls and ass happened you know buddy I had those fucking dreams come to me because the snakes all those fucking years especially after that no one can travel that way again how'd you get the snake back I didn't I left him over there and fucking Australia sorry now he's taking over the country Jesus Christ where's that fucking snake yeah it's in Melbourne that's where I left him how long do those things live like how long 30 years 30 years so it's probably still alive in the toilet saving of that auditorium around eatin ass man yeah can you imagine some poor woman sitting down the toilet oh wait a minute that's not right Wow Wow he'll sneak up the ashtray climbed in the fucking toilet and went to the one guy that was terrified of him unbelievable everyone we did the Andre thing right Andre supposed to be afraid of the snake oh yeah and he faints and fakes a heart attack knees you know laying there poor Bobby Heenan over there taking a pounding on his chest he's supposed to act like he's had a heart attack and somebody goes give him mouth-to-mouth Bobby and Bobby's like are you fucking kidding me giant that fucking giant breasts you had ban from drinking time pretty eyes brother I love the giant to death I mean when I first got into wrestling referee in like in 1974 so and they came to me in this look you know refereeing tomorrow night but we want you to drive Andre around why so you were referee before you were pro wrestling right which is actually the best way to start could you get a feel of it you get a feel of it you you learn how to feel people and you are gunshot you don't know how to read people you know and in the crowd you can read them but I got the take care of laundry thing they give me a van said Andre I'll sit in the back kind of a beanbag chair just taking to the building he'll do this thing give him a ride back to hotel I'm cool 70 miles no problem 80 miles whatever so I get through the show and he's like beer okay he talks he walks even you know so I stop and get him beer I'm like my name's now Veyron Rania's do gassers it's an 85 mile trip man um yeah two cases some like two case I guess he wants some for his room right so we get back in the lab we start driving I don't know about you guys man back even when I drink until I get into that first third or fourth hour I got a piss like every time I have a bearing out of piss I don't really buy beer I just rent it you know I rented then I go get rid of it but so after you know 30 miles I pull a hungry sorry I got pissed y'all get out of the biz you don't know nothing mirror here's a popskyy fucking wheel closer I gotta piss again finally get there get settled I'll get your beer he goes finished what he drank 48 beers yeah yeah right yeah fuck off you big goof you know he leaves I get in there getting there first thing I do I'm checking with my hand make sure I'm up put my hand to piss because I figure this motherfucker never cut off to piss he drank two cases of beer and did not have to piss I don't care if you out drink me but dammit how can you do that I mean I felt so inadequate this guy great 48 beers and didn't piss 48 beers in 80 miles yeah that's it was nothing but his hand would cover that pair up so big his hands were just an amazing athlete an amazing man and to be in the ring with him was he was unbeliev when Hulk Hogan hoisted him up in the air look at the fucking that photo of him with a regular sized can of beer that is insane they look real that doesn't look real it's a 12-ounce yeah yeah that's a 12 ounce beer and it just vanishes inside his head see if you can find that video of when Hulk Hogan picks him up over his head slam zoom yeah that that was fucking insane how much did he weigh 550 550 pounds now 550 pounds just hoisting over your head with a bar with an Olympic bar is impressive but to do it with dead weight with a man well the thing about it is it wouldn't happen unless Andre warned you do right of course because he's gonna boost himself off course yeah I mean yeah I remember in being a ring one night he just swam really yeah you fucking but this is insane I cook at this this is insane if you look where Andres Anjar yes he helps that he helps him pulling spell he had me pick him up and slam him one night he's like slamming like no fucking weather his keys no yes sir and I went under and all of a sudden he's here stupid Simon he was he would use that athletic energy that my legs just heard the fucking buckle yeah you got to drop him fast well we can focus 200 pounds there at least but Hogan was fucking Jack oh yeah you know I met him later in life but I'd met him earlier - I ran into him on the street once and I couldn't believe how fucking big he was the second time I saw he was shorter because he had so many back surgeries that his disks had been fused and I'm still a giant human being but he wasn't as big no six eight no more yeah about six four guys that Kramer told me when I was friends with Piper he told me that when Hogan did that slam on Andre just like he could feel it just going all the way up is that true a clothesline Andre one night and you know I came in doing more because Andre wanted you hit him hard right which how you say that's the most frustrating thing in the world right through never watch that I mean you're trying to kill a motherfucker and you don't even know it yeah so here I am hitting him as hard as I could and he didn't know that so when he'd reach out and just I mean he used to hit me and I'd be falling right that's a lot of energy me falling he reached out and grabbed me by my hair and just pulled me right in my fucking feet and just rip a fucking little gear oh here you two are look at that look that way 260 there wow that's so crazy that's you that is so crazy look how fuckin big he was he was so good he did a horrible thing to me one night in the rain man he knocked me down and I'm on my back and he stands on my hair oh they reached out and grabbed my arms and pulled mmm Wow did you guys plan shit out like that or did he just improvise that just one out there we went out there and played he liked me I liked him Andre I'll test you if you don't man up to him he'll fucking eat you you get to see the documentary that they made on him on HBO about savage now Andre yeah it's really great you'd really love it I don't want yeah this is her too much yeah it made me it made me cry so yeah if it makes me cry know what that man went through what did he go through just people pointing and laughing right in pain you can't kind of stain was unbelievable yeah because of wrestling no because of the growth growth yeah yeah let's think about a water daily your day is well a bed don't fit too well right let's talk about hotels and bathrooms I know right where does he shit in the bathtub no that's only buddy's good shit yeah there's no toilet gonna take his ass didn't it he's got a squish in you just got it no he just fucking turn the shower on man let it dissolve it how did you how would you like to do hot yoga in that bathroom with that shower just right god damn we took a shit in the bath airplanes cars yeah well yeah no mojo so did he have a setup for him yeah that's another thing where Piper told me a great story about you know how everybody would always he would just get so harassed out in public and they were out drinking one night after shows and they were in on in some college town like will say Madison Wisconsin or something like that and they're having some drinks at a bar and Piper was like these kids these frat boys you know they noticed the few tables away and someone there an empty beer can hits Andre in the back of the head it hits the ground you know Andre looks around whoa and they're hanging out a couple minutes later another empty beer can hits Andre growls a little bit harder and then a third beer can comes and an Andre stands he hits him in his head Andre stands up you know it takes them a while to get out of the booth or whatever wherever they're at and these guys get up and they start running and they chase Andre chases them but when he gets out of the bar they are in their car about to pull away and Andre literally goes under the car that's out front of the bar and flips it over there's a cop a half a block away who pulls up blood blood and arrest them for fucking with Andre the Giant yes he puts their car with them in those guys mess with me do beer can he could do a backflip standing on the top rope and do a flip real end on his feet when he first started but uh I'm wrestling him and we had this little thing we do where you get me in the corner and he just still that weight into me you know which was pretty easy to to register and then I would slide down and then he would grab each side of the rope into the last drop of course he's got these ropes well that night he wanted to do it and then hand slipped who saw the sudden his ass plans right here and just you know her fucking vertebrae shoes and I'm like can I breathe I just want to know if I can breathe because I could at the moment it's like I'm screaming in I turned over on my side oh my god how bad is it I think my sternum was broke whatever yeah any sense on me trying to get my breath trying to let everything come back and I've seen the lights coming at first I was gonna pass out and then I hear Andre laughing I had the referee say Andre why are you laughing is hard for two Emma what and I can feel my fucking shoulder is vibrating and he's farting you know how long a giant can fart how long about 40 seconds he's like but it was a steady flow it wasn't 48 years with a part man he got up ahead like a wine stain on my shoulder that amazing amazing guy man but I used to think to myself the fans really don't like me because they're putting me out there and the fans are cheering me on to charge into that fucking big giant you want me to get killed don't you yeah your fans are vicious why are y'all doing this to me don't cheer me tell me I'm a stupid fucker and to get out of the ring for the giant eats you there's no fun in that was that hard to always be a great bad guy or did you sort of relish in that yeah yeah so boring right because people expect you to be nice thanks Bryan picture with the baby but it's a bad guy you can do anything mmm and it's okay you know I mean and then you get to see how far you can take people you know I mean some people freak is kind of bugs people freaks them out a little bit uh thinking about starting a riot but that's when you know you've done your job right when you can get people to step out of their comfort zone and come into the ring after you now you've done the job did you have that happen oh yeah how many times 30 40 times 30 40 times people charge the ring yeah and again well we got bad couple of times one time the worst one being in Dallas Texas which is like 60 miles from my hometown what started it I was wrestling sting and the guy stood up about nine rows back reached inside of his jacket pulled out a nine-millimeter and got three shots off before they got him oh I'd already dived underneath the ring sting being the big face and stupid yeah he's enduring whoo fuck you sting I'm not coming back bitch you know this guy got three shells off at me I remember going to the back thinking to myself you take them that for you making people do shit they would not normally do because they give second off yeah I got him but here's what they brought him to the back and I like shake you know press charges I'm like press charges no just reload the motherfucker put him back out there what the fuck do you think pressure of course I want to press charges man he put three holes in the building of the old fucking of Sportatorium there and Dallas was he shooting at you or was he just shooting at the ceiling at me yeah we have hated my ass I had a woman cut me with a box cutter what yeah yeah the first time she'd ever been to watch wrestling what what did you do to start that she had been at home with her grandkids and they were watching me wrestle like Oh granny look at so-and-so Jake Roberts he's oh he's so bad if somebody needs to watch his damn mouth Alice open Spanky's asked what that man needs you know somebody should have straightened him out earlier in his life and they're like oh granny shut up he wouldn't done anything he'd run from him too I would not run from that man and they basically challenged the grandmother not knowing it she's a little off next time I come to town she gets fucking ticket she's gonna show those grandkids he's not afraid of me oh Jesus Christ I came down the aisle I got security around me and all of a sudden my Security's car is this fucking great no skew I've turned to see what they're doing there's old woman that's down and they're all over something what she had a fucking heart attack man what's going on hey guys what's going on you man oh my oh you're full of shit look at your arm holy shit how did she cut you about 30 stitches Jesus Christ arch gun you just didn't realize it you don't feel it about really sharp yeah so I get to the back with her it's not your the story you know what happened what did it actually happen and I just looked at everything can I hug ya ya hugged her I started crying and she started crying and whoa Jesus goes up wife number two or three that's why it only lasted for months what the fuck man well you're a better man than me what you did kick her though yeah false teeth jiggle to your teeth uh yeah yeah Romany root canals one really yeah how long did you fight not that long I warm out for 15 minutes 20 minutes while I move a lot not a punishment that you would take Pro Wrestling okay the matter punish me takes ball Jenner fighting I had like 16 17 root canals Jesus Christ man you know the shots and as you get older the DS deteriorate yeah and those root canals that tooth just winds up turning into dust bags yeah and they start breaking off and pieces and stuff and manic and this probably didn't help in my spiral down either man that I couldn't go eat you know I had to be check and see what I was gonna eat and make sure I just put new polygroup in and you start eating a steak with Poligrip and boom it breaks loose and next thing you know your fucking mouths bleeding because it broke loose and right having to go the bathroom you makes a date so nice you know there's nothing that says love bichchu it on your girlfriend's box and your teeth fall out or a belly button you know it just turns them away you know but yeah it to be it sucks man you know and yeah did you never warm out no you can't do arrest you swallowed it yeah that's the difference but you know I got real fortunate that uh some people out of Dallas like I'm one in Vegas also G for it's called they uh look dude we see you're having probably see you doing your talking and I talk like this because I didn't write as much ether constantly coming loose and it didn't matter how many times I got new ones but they still sucked so these people gee poor man they finally came through we're gonna fix you yeah right so they told me implants well I didn't know a lot about that shit you know and they come back to me and they said I needed hours and dr. Goldberg was saying his name and uh little Evan implants in and it was pretty bad man I had a bad day it's hard to medicate me and put me out because I raised those levels too high so gern while I was that out and they were pulling teeth getting ready to put the things in to screw into evidently during all that process I just stood up and sort of pissing on the doctor Chris when everybody in the room and chasing them and fucking idiot was this why you were Soviet yeah yeah yeah I sobered up but yeah they had to give me so much shit to put me out right then I keep moving this bull she goes hey fuck you doc but this is I'm saying this is like yeah during your sobriety yes yes so this is recently Jesus Christ being locked in a small room but take the snake he pulls his dick out starts pissing on you you think you got a medic bars and his teens try to give him yeah what was even nicer was the next day they didn't even hold it against me that's I know I woke up the next morning I don't remember them taking me to the hotel and putting me in bed or any of that and I didn't know what the mask you know my ass before but anyway yeah I was just kidding but I woke up the next morning like whose fucking clothes are these cuz they basically undressed me there and get the piss all off of me and put new clothes on me did they have to buy clothes for you or the reserve that just I guess somebody yeah they're there the place and addressed me and well I came back the next morning having been there for five hours a day before and they set me down and said this won't take but about 15 minutes all right and they come in there here's your new teeth little up and screw them in man I could bite a bumper on the car no shit no it says he's alright is so unbelievable if anybody out there is having the issue with their teeth man get them fixed but get them fix the right way don't fuck around with getting partial plates and all that bullshit go ahead and bite the bullet it's expensive it no doubt it's expensive but it changed my whole life man that is the guy that did my hair she loved me but I being I wanted there you know cuz Jake the snake has hair well Jake the snake gets into the line didn't have no fucking air it was all gone and some people in Atlanta where I was living paramount paramount plastic surgery and stuff they look will give you that hair man you know why will you take this name and we love you and I know you love me but you're gonna do that really that's one of the things in the movie you know you the people come up with money for my shoulder oh my god I cry so hard at that part of that movie when they when you guys are expecting like I'm hoping that we raised a little something and a thousand a night you know what no 17,000 in the 24-hour span which more than pay for my almost at - good job which I was gonna haven't put on my back that way you'd have some to play what did you get done your shoulders the labrum tariffs no he was uh - Turkish person bone spurs I had to go three bone spurs and one of the Spurs was over two inches long you know and here's the great news I think I've got it back you got the spur back I can move my arm I can feel that fuckin thing in there go across a muscle you sure yeah did you get an MRI not yet but I'm about to be licensed tendon I hope so or not but what I'm getting at here and it's like the number of people that reached out to me condition for me they didn't have two people I didn't even know no just blows me away well just think about how many people you touched over your entire career and how many people ran away from home yeah macho man got bit and it's crazy because back then everybody's like this is the scariest guy we hate this guy boo this guy and then it's like years later they realize whoa that guy moved me like it's like originally everybody was afraid of you or hated you but it's like and it's all in retrospect when they realize holy shit this guy I can help in this guy he earned it from me he deserves that this guy changed my life baba baba is seen in the movie when it's unexpected and the guys are in the ring and they play the music and you start walking out with the bag just sneaking it yeah that's pretty incredible after all the shit that you had been through with you sir Brian of all the shit that I'd stirred up while I was a drunk yeah you know because I mean it amazes me how many people have forgiven me for the things that I said or did when I was under the influence man cuz let me tell you something there is nothing more vile than a drunk addicted hating motherfucker you know like I was and I went after I had did not mind going after Vince or anybody else you know I hate his life he said I wasn't hate you too I said I don't give a fuck of you know guess what I hate me more than you can aid me what are you you can make me much you know I mean it that's what amazed me people helping me is like all those years that I used to cringe when somebody to say hey would you want my baby I'm like hold your baby you don't know what the fuck I am don't make me do that because it would hurt me inside to pull that kid in and smile and lie I'm not a good liar when it comes like that oh yeah it's like this wanted me to do a commercial one time I just say no campaign mmm dude that's hilarious he's gonna have me fuckin do this you know these are the funny bits right right cuz I know what it's like not to be able to say no there's no worse feeling in the world man here you got something on this hand that's gonna kill you or you got life over here and there's green pastures and all this happy happy happy and you're gonna have a good relationship with a woman if you just fucking I'm gonna take the poisonous tree you know what's ironic is that your movie your film your story and who you are right now is one of the best just say no commercials that could ever do that maybe for real well you can't just say no no no you should ridiculous bullshit ever said yeah when you show that in the film that you want to say no I mean this is what one of the more powerful things about that film is not just that you succeeded but that you tried and failed several times until you succeeded and you detailed all of it all the warts and all every single step of the way and we didn't it's a very brave movie man I really hit that shit out no no you didn't that was tough but now I'm getting to do the right thing and for me I'm doing this comedy thing there's some really comedy I just go out and tell Road stories and shit you know like couple of stories that's like Ronnie's like yeah yeah I do the same stuff in buildings but I've wrestled for 36 years so I've got about 10 shows to do and I'm still on the first one Wow going all around with it and I've been doing it for two and a half years now but now I'm enjoying it so much not because I'm making people laugh because I'm getting connecting I'm getting to connect with people that I need and help people come to the show I tell them hey give me the eggie man afterwards we'll go find a place and talk in some of the stories I have man make my story sound like a fucking walk in the park man I mean some of the horror stories I've heard what people are going through and suffering through and their story their pain and their anger you know my shit looks weak compared to what these people and I'm getting to hear this and I'm getting to help them find the way and then I get to hear the stories of the success stories hey man I didn't start getting clean so I heard about you Sarnia clean and I started to try and hey guy guess what Jake I got two years in there I got four years in there those are great but the best is the letter from the six-year-old that says you helped my daddy my daddy loves you and I love you too because my daddy lives with me now Wow oh fuck me man Wow you know you can't buy that shit so I get what Dallas does you know when he helps people he gets high off of him god bless him he should get high off of it because he spends a lot of time doing it brought a lot of time that's the one thing I always thought about Dallas look he may not be the smartest guy in the room but he's smart enough to know that and he'll go find that right answer you know whatever he was dealing with me in Scott he didn't know how to be an addict or what that was about so what do you do he contacted all of his buddies or his ex buddies that had been through it and he went here and and he read and he read he self-taught man he used to have a problem reading but he got it down now so here's a guy that over prepares for everything yeah as far as I'm concerned but well that's also why he started DDP oh yeah right I wanted to figure out a way to heal his body itself yeah sure yeah not just sharing it but promoting it worldwide have you ever done it no I haven't well I mean I did do a little bit of it years ago I looked up the it I found a little bit of it on YouTube I never got the actual program through the program you can make it as easy as you want or you can make it as difficult and that's that's the beauty of it because you get somebody like nimble nuts over here spray spraying mangina China's warped out of shape god it's like the snake when it tries to find the Japanese I can tell he just likes playing with round things over there doesn't he the knobs you stroking the knobs one of the cool things about DDP yoga is the you know you see all those before and after of the physical transitions of people but what those pictures don't show is the mental presence that you get I mean I was I was in Chicago doing gigs a few years ago and this was after I got to see your movie when it first premiered I actually think it was David Arquette that got me and my it because we made friends at the Comedy Store years ago you got me and my buddies in on you guys had your premiere on Sunset Boulevard at that I'll take your word anyway and so I had already seen the movie but Scott wasn't at that and I don't believe you were there either and I just made a big one yeah and so I was in Chicago doing a gig and it's one of those morning radio shows that I didn't want to have to do that Friday morning 6:00 a.m. pick up whatever I just flown in and I almost I remember I almost called in sick to that radio show because I'm like I'm doing you know I want to just tired I don't want to do it showing up slow getting there yeah sure the back of a spirit flight but I end up not calling in sick I'm like let's just do it make coffee in the hotel and get to the fucking car what you do right exactly and as soon as I get there - like Mancow in the morning or they're like you'll never believe who else is in studio with you you're a wrestling fan right I'm like yeah they're like Scott Hall is also going to be here with you I'm like you gotta be fucking kidding me and I remember brush your teeth and I remember you know I remember hoping because I just seen that movie I'm like oh man I hope that you know I hope he's still in good shape and everything I hope everything's cool cuz I know how hard it is to stay clean as an attic and and my god if he wasn't just and you know you as well here today it's like it's just completely present not.you can't even tell you've probably had 20,000 concussions in your life you know I mean just they're looking around laughing smiling my mind was blown that he was as present if not more than a lot of the other and available older most let more you know pro wrestlers that I had met you know what I mean and people that I had met he was in it he was being funny he's reacting Georgian yeah it was unknown the joke compared to the guy that gets scooted in on that wheelchair that can't walk and when he's first starting with the chairs you can hear his bones cracking oh yeah when you heard his hip oh it's a wonderful sounded oh man and it was to replace and the first one sucked the second one man they went through the front that's the way to go I went in 7 a.m. at noon I jerked the covers back told my daughter hand me my pants or I'm walking out naked put my fucking pants on put my feet down and walk straight out no Kane no nothing really in five hours you can do that not supposed to the doctor was yelling at me as we were leaving the building what was he saying you get back the fuck in there and blow the whole thing yeah probably but he was walking to a crosswalk to connect the two buildings and I'd already went out the bottom and I was going to the car he's like beating on the fucking windows and this is like a full hip replacement sever the top of the femur and they put a new joint they screw it you ever seen how they do it oh no they drive it in there there's a goddamn huge bolt that goes in the center of your bone it goes right through the bone and screws in place and then you have this new joint the first one I had was brutal because the whole joint calcified no it took him three and a half hours to get it out Oh God and they said they finally went to like bring in the big hammer you know they went from the shiny silver hammer to get claws fuck you sledge out from the truck and bring it on in you know how cauliflower ear ear starts right yeah I know what it is yet yeah the braking cartilage blood it's blood blood calcifies so blood becomes rock it really turns into a rock you get that in your nose and he's getting he had that in his joint so he basically had rocks in his joint completely calcified that's fucking I wrestled for three or four years like that yeah I'll show you guys and we can come back talk about it what I would do is no one can hear you unfortunately we do this yeah yeah so you you were putting so much torque in that you were blowing your hip out of socket so your left hip they were rotating out of socket but it would Bend the femur ball yeah fuck that I did it for the doctor he's like oh my god cuz when I first wouldn't have seen the dog he's like how'd you get it I said well I drove you guys know how'd you get to the room I'm like I walked it's impossible I've seen your x-rays there's no way you can walk look I can't and I showed me oh my god he runs out of the room am i okay I know I got cancer I'm dying you know that's the difference between a regular person I want a guy like you like your tolerance for pain is probably through the fucking roof probably so accustomed to recognize it yeah well obviously with your arm broke and when you wanted to keep wrestling don't you don't recognize pain because it's just something you do you know there were times in my career with people like stuck like it's okay I'm alright well it's a lie because you weren't alright it's just the adrenaline is flowing so much you're so jacked on that shit you know that's the real drug is a drug adrenaline all right with that no Jamie I'll show you how to put your back in this I think the tension from this spring-trap here will save your life man now when you do in these traveling shows he's doing them in comedy clubs what are you doing how many clubs bars hotel convention rooms whatever that's got to be great for you too because at the beginning of the film one of the things that was evident was that you missed you missed the whole excitement of performing it was it was missing from your life so now you've got that back but also healthy healthy positive and then also helping people absolutely man and it's such a joy to help people but it's you know when I first went back man because I abused myself so much my memory was shot I could remember shit yeah and then as I tell one story a little glimmer will happen over here and then then I'll talk to somebody in the crowd and they'll mention I'm like I didn't wrestle that guy the hell you didn't yeah I don't remember wrestling this guy doing this with that one and they make him remember stuff he's like I said now I got like 10 shows waiting at first I had to really struggle to get one show together did you write them all out I did in the beginning now I just write you know bullet points and I can pull them back up which is so nice to do you know because I was an appointment with my speech wouldn't finish sentences you know now I saw in the film you did it with Mick Foley are you doing them with Mick on the road no no no I'm doing good ones now makes great I never see my show have you no not yet - shut up get in the car Mack I opened up for MEC a few years ago illuminated for me and you know god damn sure never closed for me the area if you're a wrestler I'd say maybe I can get you on a TV squash match kid what's the squash match that's when you just go in and pummel guy for three minutes and squashing laying out on the floor he doesn't get to breathe you know so that was like you tell another wrestler hey I'll see if I can't get you in a squash match Epis like saying you know you're a piece of shit I'm just gonna use you and talk you over in a corner when it's done well is that like a rite of passage do you have to do squash matches then he's getting gone a lot of guys don't know no we did back in my day they started at the bottom and you work your way up now yeah guys you go to schools for three months and yeah they never learned their art well when you go into school to learn wrestling this is not something existed it didn't exist is it kind of like school for standup exactly yeah I think it's exactly like that like there's there's classes that'll teach you stand up and the good thing about it is you get at least you start doing it like whether or not you're actually teaching anything is very debatable and the things that they are teaching is all in ring technique and and Taj's and science right and the thing that you know a die-hard wrestling fans now miss with the product is exactly what you specialized in which is psychology cutting promos I mean he once cut a promo I remember against Hulk Hogan where you said something like if you plant grass grass will grow if you plant rice rice will grow and if you plant fear in your opponent's head in troubles of those oh I'll tell you the best interview ever did tell you know because back in the day we'd have to do 70 or 80 interviews back-to-back and the TV guys TV guys used to fight for getting me because they knew there's gonna be fuckin cakewalk some guys you know like girls my boy those guys take 26 go ahead and they'd sit there like pullin fuckin teeth but for me my nickname is one take Jake yeah and I'd say give me something though a word out there and I do the whole fucking interview out that word just fucking around so I'm there one day I'm like I got one yeah I got one okay Jake what do you do just just so and you know what in there like Oh Jake ah we're not getting any sound here motherfucker did I tell you just to roll it just so I do it again making no sound for like 30 seconds they don't Oh tell the little boys next to you that you're not scared - Jake why time I just made you get up and fix a television that wasn't broken didn't you come to the TV like I said - you did you couldn't fix it tell your wife I said Wow Jill's interview chills from head to toe you sick fuck I do awesome the the life that you were living you could probably pull those dark thoughts out like other people well we some oblique and I'd sit in a bar man and write stuff down you know and next day I'd pick it up reading a hotline jaw what the fuck was I thinking you know I'd just horrify me but yeah sometimes you can pull dark stuff out of bad moments in life you know well you had experiences I mean I mean just trying to kill yourself with pills or whatever the fuck you were doing me the darkness that you had in your life like my sister being murdered and shit and my mother mother was a 12 year old girl and her mother was dating my father her mother was my grandmother passed out my father left that and went into a 12 year old little girl's room he raped her that's me that's how I got started and then later in life my father was raping my sister did not know it so he raped his other daughter did not know it always heard whispering so people whispering and giving him the evil item with the books a problem they're not getting the ring with somebody that had didn't knew my dad and they beat the fucking shit out of me cuz they hated him because I'd seen him some of the shit that he did you want to believe that of your own father God you don't want to believe that do you I was a girl that you met earlier Cody she is the first daughter of mine that I held in my lap she was 22 22 before I would ever pick up one of my daughters and set him in my lap because I was afraid I'd turn into my father I never wanted be someone that abused a child because I did nothing new what that shit was like I knew what he did to my fucking head I'm getting right and getting sober learning to talk about it helps a lot it makes it better you don't cure it you know you never get over it but I can deal with it now I don't have to go medicate it went now will you talking to these people that you're also helping you medium that also have these problems how many of them have also been abused a lot a lot you know what it's like to be sitting in a comic-con and look out there and there's people in your line and your eye contact contacts a kid you look at the kid and they look at you and you're like you four motherfucker you're going through a two aren't you and I can tell it I know that fucking kids being sexually abused you can see it can I hate that feeling cuz then they get up to the front and you're like trying to talk to them and they're like shut down completely and then the fucking asshole that's next to it's probably doing the Bulls yet he's wanting my Falcon attention man what chance do I have him getting you ain't good attention not much I keep going back to the kid how can you tell you just feel you know it he's smelly taste it if you see the fear you know and you see the way that the dad communicates with them and you see their reaction they won't look at you with their eyes you know really hard to get them looking me in the eyes man it really is no I remember I told somebody one time that probably the one thing that helped me in my early life about going through all that sexual abuse bullshit was I learned that a lot at a very young age the reason I learned that lies cuz it helped him get me to a safe place you know I learned to judge people and their attitudes you know I knew what buttons to push and what buttons not to push with my stepmother I knew what was a safe place and if there were keywords that come out from her I knew to fucking go hide I had to start reading this shit then I had to start coming up with storylines and stuff to get me out of shit so I wouldn't be put in the position to get gotten again when you're earning that shit at 12 and 13 brother you're getting some fucking knowledge you know just have to go through it no I don't know brother if there was ever a reason to bring back the big one gas or bullets or whatever hang I think paintings perfect for anybody that biscuits let's make a public fuckin hang um fuck five years in jail fuck you motherfucker let you dancing on the end of a rope I get people's attention they might stop some of it yeah I don't know how to still what what would they do that would stop it completely but it's it's one of the the most disturbing characteristics of people that that's even possible a lot he wants to talk nobody wants to talk about that shit damn sure don't mmm because here's what happens to the kid nine times out of ten they raise their head and they say something then this group comes in this group comes in cops come in they say this that's just that way he's probably just exaggerating this that this you have to go home with them oh fuck no oh you can't put that kid back in that house right well Jess you have now right or you end up in an orphanage where you're eating right together yeah who does yeah once all these year at an orphanage more than a predator and that's the problem is a lot of kids that get abused like that one of abusing other kids absolutely isn't what you're taught yeah Sandusky had that whole charity for kids services whole like that there's nothing up yeah I'm gonna open up abused children's home that way I know where to go get one I also knew that the kids were damaged and they would be used to it oh you know what we what we call love it can be an ugly thing you know sometimes a kid looks to get his ass kicked because that's the only type of love he knows that's true you're a powerful man to have gotten through all this and to be able to express it so honestly to everybody I mean that that that is an amazing thing because the pain of your experiences has not stopped you from expressing all of the all the the downsides of it but also that you've come out of it on the other end in a very positive way I mean you're a great guy to be around your funniest shit you you have amazing stories and you're clean now you know I'm funny the room like this because there's not any competition come on Joe just me and you ready to go from here you know lapdogs 27 no that's amazing I just went it really is I just want to help somebody else feel what I felt yeah cuz I don't want them should have to do the things that I did to quit feeling because I'll tell you it's a whole lot easier to pick up cocaine and forget about it than it is to go through counseling go through this go through reliving it 25 fucking times you know you go into counseling and they say okay tell us exactly how it happened yeah I really fucking want to do that what do you want me to do that so you can go sit over there jack of what what you're not on this that's what we're thinking right what do you want me to remember it I want to fuck the fucking forget it tell me I haven't forget it right don't tell me how to remember it I got it down what was ultimately what was ultimately the thing that allowed you to stay clean when you had faltered five or six times whatever it was what was ultimately the thing that allowed you to get past all this and just embrace sobriety and being healthy I think it was just realizing that I wasn't going to fail this time and that came from Dallas not giving up woman see I was scared that he was going to give up on me so it's almost like you were failing so that he would give up my soul I can get that over with right I know it's gonna hurt but goddamn it I can't deal with this thought of how much it's gonna hurt I'd rather it hurt right now and you kick me out and then I can go over here and get something that'll make me forget about this bullshit so it's always hanging over your head that you're gonna fuck up and finally when I realized no matter how many times I fucked up there's somebody gonna be there and again man three years I don't want to live with me for three years much less you dude night when I texted him is that he's the saint after I watch that that documentary I'm like dude you're a saint he just wants to help people man and you know I'm not gonna sit here and hard sell his product man the DDP yoga is singly the best I can think and your mind he's gonna have you eat good food diet no fucking diet all we ask you to do is not eat certain shit this by the way shit he's just asking you step off a gluten a step off dairy okay what's the problem with that cheese okay you want cheese you gonna have cheese you have sheep cheese and goat cheese plate don't fuck you up like cow cheese does well if you look at how healthy the guy is in his 60 yeah and how flexible he is and how how mobile he is and we don't want to chop just like him his back is fucked up but he could do everything and it's just because his muscles are so strong all around his back it's completely supported that's the old story of you know if you if you don't use it right yeah yeah from listening from listening to him on your podcast he talked about how he does in Xtreme ten minutes stretching to start his day and I've really really put that in action stuff from animals he'll say no watch this dog in the morning first fucking kids up what does the dog do it stretch its paws out in front of him a narc set back now then you watch now let's do this fucking work I wait a fucking minute absolutely not move men yeah downward dog and you're doing the arch in the back like a fucking cat what the fuck you yeah he's a smart man yeah yeah he's a powerful man - I mean it just what what he has in his head in terms of his vision for helping people and how he's able to see that through and that having that accountability crib and and putting everybody through these workouts on a daily basis I mean the amount of time invested in helping you guys this is fucking amazing and not just you guys but many many many many people my only fear is gonna get out there enough no he's getting out here mark is look he we're helping a whole other world that doesn't know him that people have known about him more and more I know you really appreciate your show and what it did for him that he said just fucking rocked rock because that's feeding that abuzz I mean it's feeding his keep going it really is true doing something nice makes you feel good yeah it doesn't really get talked about enough there's Jim right now yeah right see happy shit right there's a lot of that well you know people are scared they like watching fear-based things because it you know if it bleeds it leads but guess what if you're hurting yeah well I think the problem is even calling it news you know it's it's they events you know but news is almost always negative so you know it's calling even calling it the news like what does that mean news what's news this shit happened hours ago it's not news this is just events it's like the show is events but what what what Dallas is doing is showing people that there's another path and in his his yoga program and just how positive and energetic the guy is it's contagious you know and having him on the podcast meant the number of fucking messages that I got afterwards of how many people that benefited and how many people started taking his program and start taking his yoga or any yoga and cleaning up their life and just inspired by it it's amazing you know that makes me very happy when I can help a guy okay spread that kind of word that that makes me very happy yeah I just want to get out there I've chosen this platform of doing these shows and buildings you know cuz he wouldn't do me any good to be in a building with her 5,000 people because I can't spend time with these money right but if it's a hundred and fifty and a common claim there's gonna be five or ten people who want to talk hundred and fifty I got time for that yeah if it was five thousand be overwhelmed because not because the show goes shows easy they just fuckin memories I pulled out and had some jingle do it and twirl it around you know say couple cute things and I'm done yeah we're getting to there and that's what you know that's the deal that's my nut that's where I want you know when it's been a good show when I go and talk to a couple people and I can go back to hotel room just like which is basically the opposite of how you would go back to hotel room when you arrest yeah I want to forget now right now I'm doing shit to forget about and you can go back and chill I can go back in smile that's beautiful yeah I'm getting the chin you know I'm hoping that you know I've had enough miracles happened to me in the past four years to believe that there's until one more miracle left for me and I hope the hell I meet her soon cuz I don't wanna I don't want to be alone anymore man you see I did something stupid I'm gonna tell you guys now a lot of you guys listening like come on dude you're killing my buzz man well maybe I am man but I'm gonna tell you something guys a woman is a great thing to have but you can't have too much it's gonna have too many I know I experienced that I went from a small-town kid and Gainesville taxes were if you got laid twice a month by two different girls you're a stud you know you're the man and the double standards that we have for women that if a woman goes out and gets laid she's not a stud she's a whore what the fuck's wrong with that it's us well Jake went from small town til bigger city star oh my god you name the price you make it nice hey girl you and your girlfriend come to a little show for me use this toy that toy this toy brainian the dog here comes the clown because that's what he got it was never enough it had to be one more

the issue the excitement was having it or you right that's the cash not healthy right that's not very unhealthy right is the king exactly so you got to into the kink and then regular stuff wasn't
