hello freak bitches right that's fish bones yeah the Salton Sea no don't say what now the salt was not really and what is the primary cause of the white sand of Hawaii what is it why playing games still hide parrotfish shit really weird literally going to be walking around on ethical wise white sand beaches are made from a parrotfish whoo oh my god I'm so pumped that I taught you really lose race that is insane yeah that's possible that's including that oh my god it just shift like crazy just think shits and oh my god it shits and does that thing eat like a reef what is it eating these are the hunting camp it what is it eat a worm lunges and oysters also produce Pacific Ocean stand sand but no animal is as proficient as parrotfish oh well stomachs their meals pass it's really cute oh well I got a bypass like a gastric bypass or someone has Lou yeah reducing as much as 840 pounds of sand per year cue imagine if your poor little asshole how to process yours you're a big giant guy if you're for little asshole head of a process 840 pounds of sand in here right well let's break that down how many pounds is that a day because 365 days in the year and it's what is it's more than double that right yeah well 840 pounds so that is what's more than two pounds of sand through your asshole every day for a year that's insanity now you're a fish so think of that it's not even a person it's a fish a little fish is pumping out more than 2 pounds of sand through its tiny little asshole everyday that's insane there's never been a thing like this yeah and instead they dig their heels in and get confirmation bias from all these other people and then they form these social media groups Facebook groups they go to websites they get on web forums and they start interacting with each other and exclusively interact with each other and then also enforcing each other's beliefs and and great job man good job at attacking those shells right you know those like if you do you know if you think the earth is round you are a globe tard that's the newest Jamie literally like cringed Shh took him yet I had a like step back blink his eyes yeah you're a globe tart that that whole thing is because these people someone said something that someone went what people love to find secrets they love like this dinosaur thing is cool because it seems to be real and some see the gal that said that all the fossils were basically people doing like kind of Michelangelo deal and chiseling them out of rock because the fossils came out of rock oh you got you and she actually what chef pretty nice boobs too but um yeah yeah but maybe that's why people are listening but like I've got a platform now you get tits no it's really good I mean yeah so she's basically like okay so these things come out of rocks so these anthropologists because there's millions of dollars in anthropology or archaeology they're just chiseling these bones out of rock and here we go so her what's up you don't want to play it I'm use against dinosaurs I we need to play some of us and opposition what they end up being when everything is doesn't done mm-hmm so awesome it's not like she's here follow John a changeable also is actually a bone that was once in the ground that has been been filled with limestone calcium and other kind of don't like deposit over the course of many many years are left eyes out of the day know glass like why is she doing that glass I missed your fucking hair on your eyes this day I you may have seen the clock Bigler hey there's a bunch of hawk here you go okay can you handle Rossum paleontologists and the paleontologists takes a little mallet and they chip away at it and at some point they come out with something looking like a bomb and this is a problem hold on this is a problem just pause that the problem is some fucking idiot like this gets to talk about a subject that she's not educated in and no one is over her shoulder got act that's not true and that's not true palm range you said something that I want to go back to later what do you think feminism is about well it's argument about about equality I mean to me if feminism was about equality and I think that this this you know I'm reading more about in the learning more about it so I'm still very ignorant about it but this more third wave what they call third wave feminism which I'm sure the term you've heard that seems to be more about a combative nature to actually you know instead of like saying like men and women are equal men and women should deserve the same rights and the same treatment and all those kinds of things it actually seems to be very anti man in a way like it seems to be very like and almost like the tables have turned you know and I'm like well why are you turning the tables like didn't you achieve what you wanted like in the first place which was just that we were going to be here together at the you know at the Nexus of everything as a change on this part of the problem is that reinforcing that fake statistic the the gender paid pay gap that so many people have heard that like it was Sarah Silverman was just talking about it recently and some some big thing that she did I'm like that's not true but yet people just say it and no one stops them from saying a friend of mine though is a very educated guy said it we were having a debate about divorce and he brought it up and I'm like that's not even true and unfortunately we're in a place with no cell phone reception so I had to wait until we got back to send it to him like this is not true like what you're saying is not true like you're repeating it as if you know but meanwhile you've done zero research on it it's a talking point it just gets reiterated over and over again without any research and it's convenient convenient to reinforce your argument it's a number it's a number that deals with a very complex and nuanced debate and I think that the idea of feminism is to me in a lot of ways very similar to the idea men's rights movement I'm not opposed to rights for anybody I'm not opposed to anyway I'm very egalitarian and my ideas about the world but I am opposed to anybody that likes one gender over the other because I think that's foolish just like I'm opposed to people that only like white people I'm opposed to people at only like black people I'm opposed to people that generalize based on an enormous mass of human beings like men are shit women rule girls rule boys drool you know I don't like it the other way either I don't like it the he-man woman haters Club I don't like I don't like any ideologies that lump people into these huge groups because I think it's moron think I think it's this stupid way of looking at the world but we started water towers so basically we drill well and then we have a water tower which turns into a water kiosk where people from the community come up to it they might pay pay five shillings for Jerry Kim so jerry cans five gallons they pay five cents but eventually all the people in the community the one in rwanda we're doing is going to serve four thousand people it's out of school so the kids will have clean water all throughout the day but then people come there and the one in kenya is funding a school but the one in rwanda is going to fund more water wells so as these people buy clean water the only clean water around there that community the only thing to have to drink there's a lake that has the cows and everything else drinking out of it and cow patties are inside the water you can see people collecting water at the same time that cows are drinking from it right beside them people are washing clothes in it they're washing motorcycles in it and then that's their drinking water and so we're putting up this water kiosk where yeah we're going to charge them five cents when they get five gallons of clean water but those are going to turn into multiple water wells throughout the year and so we're trying to do all these sustainable solutions to where after we do that in rwanda we're taking that to the congo that'll be close to the soap production facility and the Community Development Center we're going to have which will have land water food solutions even the forestry though we've helped to replant over 4,000 trees now in the Congo it's like because the deforestation is so brutal so I think it's just sitting back and saying what do you guys need listening and learning that need and saying okay where can we fit in how can we help in this area who's a specialist how can we really make an impact I think our lane is definitely water I mean from that chiefly um a village or the story that you just saw lyubov II where he made that knife or yeah you can see that water changes everything and so that's going to be what hubs that's our hub that's that's our lane and that's why all of the water four teams are doing but in the Congo because of the pygmies are so vulnerable we're trying to find the ways to help them come up and as they come up other people are watching and looking and they're starting to implement the same kind of things [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
