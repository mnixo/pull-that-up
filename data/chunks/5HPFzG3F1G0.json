hello freak bitches you know there's gonna come a point in time where human beings have like a biological meeting and we decide now that we have genetic engineering should we decide to continue with this shape should we decide to continue with the shape what is love what is beauty in the ad to beholder could we all be better off if we were flying jellyfish they come up with this proposition to be able to replace with a simple prescription any feelings of love or sex or affection that people need or want it's all satiated you never have to worry about reclaiming that again and that the most harmonious shape for the universe the most harmonious shape to co-exist forever with an infinite lifespan is flying jellyfish how long before we'd be all be flying jellyfish seven years the way that thing just flew I wanted to be that thing I threw it off a bridge right wish someone could throw just throw you off a bridge you just watch this and this is the imagine that technology in twenty years where that thing's following you around all day long all night long imagine that in the shape of dicks imagine once they figure out that the shape of a dick is really not perfect you know just like there's other shit that's wrong with people like the fact it's so easy to knock us out yeah that's a big flaw punch somebody in the chin they go unconscious as a stupid flaw what if they realized like Oh dicks are good but have a seat I'm gonna show you the news we're gonna show you the next level the next level is some sort of new thing that gets inside you and just expands expands like a fist so in a few little dicks all-around tube like this is the main dick tube and it spreads out like corn and I want to solve X inside you imagine if your dick was this might be the dumbest thing I've ever said imagine if your dick was like an ear of corn and each one of those little kernels was another dick and once your dick got in there and we dick was hard you dick got in there then all those little digs would pop out and they would all like they would all play music inside the girl's vagina docked on town downtown 'dump-dome and that would be the thing like the girls could come the hardest you've made the best music inside their vagina Oh Joe that's what I'm saying right listen that's a very important point be just assuming that the dick shape that we have currently is the best but if you have the dick shape we had currently and the ability to make music with your deck right Jamie Jamie oh look at me like some Beethoven shit piano or a violin or mostly like drums I guess depends on what you trying to accomplish yeah I'm more of like a you a bongo player or bass drum I could see Team B playing upon guys at a party play a gym day that was one of the most intense title fights ever Rory MacDonald got you mean they got he got so close to winning that title he had Robbie Lawler almost knocked out he had kicked him dinged um Robbie was wobbling and then Robbie came back to stop him in the next round and his nose exploded and he literally went down in pain and you could see him writhing on the floor and it looked like he was just trying to find some comfort like the pain was so intense when that broken nose that he was just trying to find some kind of comfort the blood was everywhere and it was just two guys that push themselves to the brink and unfortunately when you see a fight what is that can you go to the bathroom so you're saying you should ask dad guys drinking over here Chris punk was the only one drinking here throwing down the booze checking his fucking Twitter every five minutes but uh the it was it was a sport or it was a fight rather with he's like you see him here like writhing in agony like here like that is so hard to deal with I mean he's just look at him he's like oh he just goes down I mean he's just in agony I mean it's one of the most intense moments I've ever seen in a fight of just like the most obvious expression of pain I mean look at him here it's crazy he might not ever be the same and even by the way ever Robbie - that was a crazy fucking fight Oh Rory said the next day that was the greatest day of his life yeah I'm sure it is what kind of a that's the that's the man he is yeah I mean he fought his heart out there was nothing left for both of them they were so closely matched such a good fight and Robbie how about when he's screaming in victory and his lip is split open like a cleft palate his lip is split open this giant gash in his lip like look at him there's a sideways photo where you see like a profile picture of him roaring with his lips split open and it's hard to believe that this guy's you know that he fought like that he fought with his lips but why don't there's a better picture of it Jamie find it it's like a sideways angle of the side where you see the actual cut itself but it was one of the most gruesome lip injuries I've ever seen and you know is the guy who won that those guys there it is Dana Dana apparently walked up from that side right there and said oh my god don't talk yeah you know it's I mean his lip was literally just a giant slice like he got hit with a hatchet in the face was crazy it was a crazy crazy crazy fight and one of the most intense closely matched title fights in the multi-way heavens history yeah ever it was about down to the wire I met a woman at one of my shows in Brooklyn she had no hands or feet what happened to her well she came up to me after the show and she like wanted to like give me a hug she's like you're so funny and she had like these stubs and she said you reminded me of the girls who did my nails when I had hands and I was like wow so much detail it was like racism what the fuck oh I was like I was thinking like I wouldn't bring it up if I just met her any other way right but since she brought up her hands I was like what happened to your hands and she said that she had something wrong with her appendix went to the hospital and the doctor put the wrong name like mixed up her charts and they amputated her hands and her feet when she was only supposed to get her appendix taken out or something very minor what yeah and then a few weeks after that comedy show where I met her I saw on the front page as a paper in New York it said someone so whatever her name was I forgot her name given 14 million dollars or whatever you know like this is it for your hands and your feet I forget how much it was but no hand jobs her life may be longer and I met her boyfriend imagine dating that happening to your girlfriend and like y'all stick around with it's so crazy I asked him I said how long have you guys been together he was like a year when that happened Wow I was like what man you're such a good guy you know she can't even like wipe her ass well maybe he went to the fucking hospital and switch things are out here she's found her but you know what she was so that's just so bizarre she was so happy that like you know you wonder like how how she can be happy but she was so like she was in such a good mood like she was just like loving the comedy show she was so appreciative like she was having a great time
