the Joe Rogan experience well that's why when I was training for that MMA fight against the comedian I trained with Bisping twice and I grapple with this being a piss pants not even known for his jujitsu of course he is he's got very much ramp up he know his guard his defensive guards one of the best in MMA very rarely do people pass his guard when he's on the ground he's excellent but primarily you know he's known as a striker yeah I merrily primarily duh I can't explain to you it was like I felt like a lion was just toying with me it it was and it was it was a strange thing because I'd never in my life cuz you obviously you know an MMA fighter can beat you up you know a professional mixed martial artists can beat you up but I don't think people realize how badly and how big of the gap it is because it's not it's but they don't know Joe you know people have no fucking clue until you do it I had no idea until this is last summer and I judge and he was fucking around with me for a second you know it was terrifying and I feel like less of a man I can't look at my son in the eyes it's the same way that I used to be able to I I don't fuck right you know what I'm like oh come on you'll be all right you know what it's like it's like do you know how people see someone do stand-up and they think I could fuck could do that everyone that's how we all started right but because you're just talking you guys just talking yeah that's what fighting is like it's like you look at a guy like this Bing and you know he's like a normal guy he's obviously very athletic and he's big and everything like that but he's he's not Shaquille O'Neal he's like some 7-foot Samson specimen he's regular-sized human see like well he's moving like a regular human I could do that but you have no idea no you're beyond helpless you have no idea literally yeah you have no idea you grabbed a hold of you you're you're a dead person almost anybody in the UFC any person the average person even if you're training it doesn't matter they can take you just let them do what they want to do yeah there's the intellectual levels like I always feel like whenever I talk to people that are really smart they're gonna have a Sean Carroll or a neil degrasse tyson or someone on the podcast you talked to me just like goddamn I'm fucking stupid yeah you know there's just just levels to this just levels to this understanding of life that's like but that's with everything with stand-up with artwork with with someone choking the life out of you yeah this day man I've been doing jujitsu since 1996 if I roll with certain people just it's a matter when I'm gonna get strangled yeah they don't even have to be bigger than me be smaller than means when am I gonna tap when's it coming I had a friend of mine now who's like a really athletic dude who I got he does everybody fine it's a friend of a friend but he trains out of uh he's like a trainer out of a Gracie school in Florida there's only one time he he got to roll with hoist Gracie and I said no I was like I was what was it like was it like was he like that much better because guys a high level black belt like he's like dude he was like we're talking what levels he was like he was toying with me like I had never done it before and that's how I that's how good those guys are 35 that's that's when you start fall apart when you look back now with what you know now and all the athletes you've worked with at the UFC I do you think you would have done anything different just eight rounds why would you spar around there's no a road fight are you literally just getting slower Forrest you already slow I don't know it's again being a pioneer like you were there wasn't really a whole lot of guys before you that were operating I had the other pioneers like the randy's and the Chun's and that's what they were doing so I better be top of it or do it they did that's the craziest thing that's a man's I'm not gonna question them boxing it already figured out you shouldn't beat the fuck out of each other every day they'd already kind of figured that no and the other thing they figured out is we would work with people I would spar with Wanderlei Chuck Randi in boxing they don't spar with people they're equals past a certain point in campaign well think about it you know a lot of they start like his Floyd Mayweather sparring with I don't know really good people his level no no definitely not he sees finally blood boxers and he's tooling them yes yeah I think have you heard of him though they're not famous and rich so they're not they're not elite whereas do you think about like a gym like our gym like I'll just use Randy's because I don't talk bad about anybody you're fighting other champions every day right maybe dangerous as fuck yeah maybe drilled together sure learn from each other roll wrestle like control your training mm-hmm especially guys that are in the same weight class as you that may someday fight you that's awkward yeah yeah and there was no guidebook yeah yeah you know guys like Keith Jardine and Rashad Evans figured out their like we already had to fight each other we'll train together now so we won't have to do it again right it's good move if it works out and that's just the way this is going to work did you see the video when the Mueller report came out they look like somebody got killed oh he's crazy shouldn't you be happy if you guys believed in Mueller everybody was like Muir is the fucking man he's gonna go get Trump this guy is methodical he's precise he's getting voted out everything votive candles with his face on it they could like bird they were pumped yeah and then he came out and it was like well no collusion it was like well I guess that now to cover up it's like what wait a minute yeah maybe maybe the narrative has it maybe the narrative has has trumped the actual job you were supposed to do guys well it's just so many people were so convinced and there were so many people that were making statements that in retrospect are probably like you could probably I mean I don't want to say I'm not a litigious person but if I was a guy like Donald Trump oh man yeah there's so many people to sue is it it was amazing I mean I remember I was on Bill Maher's show and we were supposed to talk about free speech stuff and like five minutes before and he's like let's talk about Russia his producer came in let's talk about Russia and I was like okay fine so we get our producer yeah this is like right before they switch happen for your TV shows well they just tell you what you have to talk it seemed guy comes in with a clipboard yeah it was it was a little bit it was a little bit strange and we got onstage and he's talking about Trump Russia collusion and I said what I've always said which is I'll wait for the evidence to come out and then I will make a decision as to whether Trump Russia collusion was a thing and Bill Maher was like oh I know and Bill Maher goes you don't you don't believe it was a thing and I was like well I don't see any evidence yet that it was a thing like I see some evidence of attempts to collude like Don jr. I see some attempts of people trying to get information the evidence of like actual legal collusion and why don't we just wait like you guys keep wanting Muller to give us it like let's just wait on it and Mark could not believe that this was my perspective right it was like it was like shocking to him why should why should the perspective I'm waiting for more evidence be shocking to anyone when it is obvious the evidence is not out like why why is that in any way controversial it's but wildering to me yeah well if you live in a house like I do with all girls - its it's just everything's girly I just did whatever I'm fine Laird says he's like I needed to be more specific I said I wanted to be surrounded by women I didn't mean be related to all of them it's hilarious you know it's I think it's nature God's Way of balancing off they say if guys have elevated body temperature so athletes people train a lot that they're statistically have a greater chance of having daughters because I think they hot we call it hot balls basically if kills off the male sperm I think so they did a thing on a bunch of guys either in the NFL or whatever and statistically they just have a lot more daughters huh and I think it's like nature's way of going oh you're gonna be all like moving and active and raw and all this stuff guess what just put a bunch of girls around for you sure say things to my husband I could never say as a wife mmm you know it's like I see it and I just go oh yeah well they know that for sure he loves them so they carried away with it they're in yeah they can't get fired no I like my youngest daughter when she was really little like five or six she'd say okay so I'm not really clear with this when I have a long time I'm by myself and when you and Dad need a long time like you're together and I try to like well you know it's important for moms and dads because you know we have to work it I go you know you're you're always gonna be dad's daughter I you know I'm we're working at being a husband and wife and then she'd keep going with it I finally would just say like hey do you want to have Christmas in separate houses and I'd see her think for a second like well maybe you know and I'm like we need a long time she's processing that she's like I'd miss you but I don't know you know so it's all bad dance you know no cuz daughter's man they don't miss a trick and they're on you and they're on their dad like nobody's business well my friends that have sons the way they say it is it's like you take one of two things either you have this wild animal that's tearing things apart or you have someone who's screaming and crying about something you don't understand yeah take your pick you want to show ya a mental destroyer or a physical destroyer yeah walls with holes and Bochum broken bones boys and girls it's like I have learned so much being a mother to daughters and I've been around women my whole life you figure playing volleyball being around tons of women it's very different as a parent he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Maryland's our bill used to get so fucking mad beautiful thing about bill barber would be snap it bill bill it's not funny like where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so fucking mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins so one another when I say they used to give me so much shit that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to be get into my career cuz of the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad soon as I got robbed by cross-eyed and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being cry was very very awful joke I remember telling his joke and a phonebook comes flying on the stage put trees through a fucking phone book at me I told him this is the where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I say what the fuck was that and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all got say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate rejecting off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the -
