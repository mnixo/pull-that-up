doo-doo-doo and we're live we're live with the check we're live with the change what's up man who I'm chillin now you don't bother you look better than anybody I've ever seen just a couple weeks out of shoulder surgery I'm a savage man you're walking around like there's nothing going on they took my savage stem cells out of my own damn back and they threw him in my show out of your back hip bone bone marrow they got in there cinch refused bunim shot him into my shoulder and shit I should have a sling oh but I'm out Tuesday anyway so I kind of prematurely decided to come out of the sling oh so he's supposed to be other sling in six days yes Nona is that six days Wow oh my god really aggressive I went to dr. Andrews he's out there and on Pensacola and he said no we need you back punching in two months so the day after such yeah heart surgery he said making contact so two months I mean right after surgery I was doing two-a-days fucking full ass rehab really yeah like crazy so I'm like these dudes is nuts this shoulder I had this done oh wait I didn't move for like three weeks what just have done with that one same thing now you hurtin this in training you hurtin in fights um a lot of what people don't know about me to think I just throw my right hand a lot but I wasn't never really confident with my left hand because I had that left leg room tear so it felt weird to throw hooks and it felt weird to use my jab a lot my showroom fatigue a lot so I didn't tell a lot of people that so I just saw a bombing bombing like hell on my right hand it wasn't because I was just not writing heavy so now that I had the surgery on this one I'm going to stem-cell both shoulders rehab the crap out of it and also about this on the rehab machine on the art wave you ever heard of it like a Russian Stan there's like nuts no what is it it's like a Russian stem machine that has ability to make your muscles contract 500 times a second it is highest setting so a lot of people use it a coach use it a lot of pro athletes use it the people that made it in Minnesota they don't give a lot of information because they don't want their intellectual property stolen but they charge you like 12 to 14 grand for the machine then they charge you five grand and show you to use it then if you really really want to know how to use it they charge you guys another 500 me on five grand so I was lucky enough hope that in watching it I was lucky enough to get one for my homie Mark Clayton he should play with the Rams I just bought his from them and so would it what is it called again it's called an art wave art wave ARP ARP ARP which I think this ends for advanced advanced recovery program so basically if you think about scar tissue soft tissue it has ability it's not like that stem that feels like the needle poked in but it's like intense stem that goes through it can break that fuckin scars you should go through soft tissue and basically increase blood flow range of motion so spraying ankles you know in one session that should be he'll really yeah I've usually done hundreds and hundreds to time I just had a money to buy it into recently Wow they use innocence college and so now you put this on your shoulder and what well you put it on your shoulder and they have like this posture so you hold this posture to this position right and then they also do a balance test first because if your back is fucked up your knee and your balance is off then neurologically it's not going to actually send the current to the right spot so they maybe she'll lower back and your shoes are fucked up so now your shoes are messed up so make it lower back her you know how to balance that's right but so they do that first adjust you make sure you all balance out then they find what they call a hot spot so they put it at a neutral site the black pad which is like your lower back or something then wherever you fill in the pain if I'm feeling it right here the pain might not be coming from there so they might they search around and who decision about so now this becomes a hot spot so now that I take the other pad off and find the spot that when they those who connect you feel like you're about to die then they wrap you up and then they do 7 minutes on reverse 7 minutes on positive and then it's painful and shit but like I've done training camps has some severe injuries and nobody would ever ever not real yes crazy so like so is saying that like if you have something that's bothering you a lot of times or something that's wrong somewhere else it's causing that to be bothering you yeah and this somehow or another finds that no you you balance you do a valid test first so say like a contractor comes in and you say all your hips off your legs long here's just you you have to be adjusted in balance first then they put the pads on then you locate out what they call a hot spot mm-hmm so say my shoulder right for some reason I broke my wrist a long time ago so I can't do like that so I can't push down Lucy out I can't get my hand to bed oh so if you get down to push-up time I'm going like this because my wrist is like this yeah so when I'm throwing a punch especially if I'm Tony just a crazy ass punch you can imagine that if I don't distribute the force properly that shit's my forms gonna be sore probably what's causing my shoulder pain also being an extended position and wrestling I'm extending stretched out over time and time he caused a shock no just that one point shy had Damien my away maybe that wasn't a punch they might have been the last damn straw that broke the camel's back but I think weren't and Tara from all those different years just beat my shoulder so you oh so what's this guy doing here before and after that's kind of version I think good video yeah right range of motion wise is is is actually deceiving because sometimes you will fucking get zapped on his deal mm-hmm you couldn't bring your arm up at all then all of a sudden now you like oh shit I'm healed but you're not really heal you got to continue to do the protocol continue to do the treatment and working that range of motion if you could do it one time you feel great go out there and start shooting threes you're shit gonna be fucked up hmm yeah so in the Demian Maia fight you hurt your your shoulder like with one of the first punches you threw right guys I was I knew it happened because I knew it I knew it's what they call sub flexor dislocated whatever so I do I saw opening I had already lumped his eye up and my homicide fuck that that side of his face up so I saw his left eyeball already almost closed so I said I finish I'd go hammer him bow through the punch and I fell - OH - go down oh shit so then I was like I can't lose a fight I can't let you take my belt so at this point I said imma throw straight punches and reaction and I see my power punch I'm gonna throw it so a couple of times I forgot I threw it and kind of went out again and he took some shots and I lift him up into kind of went out again so three or four times in a fight I can fella just go like like a whole like five or six like bubs just crushing me your shoulder but I had that pain before and I'm I'm I mean it sounds stupid I'm blessed that I tore this one because I know what it felt like right and I know that the only pain that I'm gonna feel is when I extend when I try to go that direction or any overhand right that shit was gonna be around so when I stayed here I just threw straight punches and there's couple of times I blitz it for and I wanted to punch and I didn't punch because I didn't feel confident with my hand hmm so you you kind of you knew something was wrong you just didn't know exactly what it was I knew I knew I knew it's up like so I knew it dislocated for sure whether the ligament was turning I I was pregnant it wasn't because you can actually do that you slip it out without it tearing but most times when you do that as a result of these muscles fatigue in you punching too hard making contact with your target and then your whole muscles just kind of feel like the best way I can explain it everything just kind of fell down so you tried to rehab it for a while right you tried to what you try to do I mean I did I did the arts treatment I did regular physical therapy I mean you got an MRI MRI I got to memorize I had one doctor tell me that you know I didn't have to do it I could one doctor can care less and finally I went to dr. Andrews and he was like you know what how long do you plan on fighting for you know and I hate when people ask me cuz I'm fine I'm like until I get tired of fighting and he was like well if you think you're gonna be done fighting then don't get it done but if you want to have a career and you want to be able to comfortably punch he said I watched a video he said you make your money with your right hand he said if you want to go out there and punch and be confident let me go in there let me clean it out let me enter it down we will shoot some stem cells some PRP in there on the way out of the surgery we'd be aggressive but make sure you get that range of motion and you'll be back in there punching so I decided to my eyes for four times for tighter fights in the year if anybody deserved to touch up something they hurt in the fight it's me so I decided to go with it I was so close man even though we've been to the day of surgery I was like man I don't wanna do this I don't want to do this damn surgery now were you still training we're still throwing punches yeah I was training and what did it feel like when you were throwing punches I mean that's the reason why I got it I mean uppercuts straight punches along that if I throw straight punch and I didn't turn my body over and I was just punching and she'll hurt if I uppercut didn't hurt I was shadow boxing him past hitting the bag if I thought overhand right it was not feeling it was not gonna happen so shoulders are such a weird joint you know there's so much motion even now like you're doing a rehab now like part of our protocols with dumbbells I can I can slice shadow box but if I come out here and you can just see if you see the way my body's starting to get alarm mm-hmm I don't feel comfortable yet but you're only how many days out of surgery two weeks two weeks is nothing yeah it's amazing that you can move it I'll be back I'll be back training month Wow well with this ARP machine and then with stem cells and PRP it's like the world's a different place now for initiated in 2008 so tell you and I rehab myself I took so a rehab book I had all these protocols from the Sports Medicine people they gave me and I put my own shit together and I made my own workout and I did it religiously twice a day but it's not the same somebody stretching you every single degrees every direction every plane watching your growth and actually being a specialist I was just doing shit cuz I don't want my shoulder messed up and I just started fighting like when I first started I was a wrestling coach for Thiago Alves Iver was a Dean Thomas I wasn't really a fighter Friday I had a couple of amateur fights but I don't know if I want to do this shit or not then I had to have a shoulder surgeon I'm like a man I don't know how the hell I'm gonna pay for this so got any weight room who's American Top Team guy I didn't know what the fuck America top team was he brought the satellite school to university Missouri where I was coaching it he came into gym and he wanted to pay for our weight room on a wrestling team and I'm like well shit let me go on a train in his gym and I wasn't training his gym and I worked for him four times so I can get insurance so I can get the shoulder surgery and shit after that I said let me get his fighting taken sure I wasn't even I was I didn't I was just doing it just to see what it was like but that's crazy yeah that's crazy when you think about how successful you've been on it and I had a lot of chances to quit to broke debt fifty grand in debt I'm like I told my coach that's I can't do this shit I'm honest I'm a full time coach I'm going negative day 15 out of 30 days man I can't even afford that's when guys member of gas first hit I was kidding 99-cent gas and all of a sudden 1 2 3 bucks at the broke his point of my life I was like hell with that so I did that and he said you know what you got a future in this man he said take out a student loan I was in graduate school he said take out student loans so I took out a student loan and graduate school to fund my information Wow and I didn't finish graduate school wow that's crazy yeah that's crazy not the way did it worked out see I would complain about it Dana tried to pay me 50 grand less known being 50 grand in debt you know it's like tables have turned quite a bit yeah it's fascinating isn't it let me look back if you look back ten years ago ten years ago god I can't believe I've been fighting for what is it twelve thirteen years now 2005 was my first fight Wow no now you're world champ so with this rehabilitation they said they'd like you to throw punches inside of two months yeah and then when would you be able to like fully resume training they think three of us they think three months I mean granted with this surgery you can hear someone say four months you can hear six months some people take a full year it depends on who the surgeon is how aggressively they push you forward and depends on why you need to get back I got a belt to defend where I got money to make and I got people has to be so I got to get back so with that said I'm going I called you up see I'm like this is bullshit I'm your world champion I need what am I gonna do with three days a week I'm not a senior citizen I need physical therapy approved for five days a week I need this game ready ice machine I need to do PRP in six weeks they should want me to get back ya know they they listen to me say you know what he's right you know I'll give him whatever you want give him so he can get back and get into fighting because I was fighting extremely often for them now are you you're living in st. Louis yeah I live it I got a house in st. Louis I'm out here every week though I'm doing Fox TMZ I didn't know you were doing that many different TV things so what are you doing on Fox I do I'm doing UFC tonight right dc's out and trying to count so anytime DC Bisbing whatever I'm usually got it fills in the world you'll see tonight and you have to come out here do that every week Wow they don't watch them say hey bismi you and your DC don't watch yourself I'm a snag your damn job I'm being permanent out here cuz I had a good show yesterday I want to watch out do you like doing it I love doing it I love getting out of the box that's why you know I know we probably get into later that's why I did Stan I'm coming the other day I did stand-up comedy I heard about the atom hunter had you up at the Dharma I wants the dine bar because I feel like acting is what I'm gonna do after I get on fighting and if you can be okay with being embarrassed not being uncomfortable and really not giving the fuck then you can become a great actor if you have the gift and you're willing to put in the work so I've always put in the work I'm not worried about that but if I gotta cry I got to be a college douchebag I gotta be something that I'm not used to being I can be a tough guy all day I can be a secret agent you know I mean you don't feel miss you know we can watch a film and mimic it you know fries to mimic Friday you cannot tell me I wasn't smoky I was sounds just like Chris Tucker like i was really in the fucking movie but he didn't have anybody to look at he had a fucking script and he had to bring that to life and you know we're really critical in actors and I just don't want to be the weakest link ever on the film so so that's what you want to do when you're done with all for sure for sure has that always been an aspiration or is it something you saw as like a way to do it after it's over yeah a lot of stuff you know I don't really even like fighting real honest yeah I'm just good at it what don't you like about it I don't like the politics behind it I don't like the martial art aspect has been taken away from it I don't like to disrespect to the sport guys that are you're not not really training hard they don't look the part I think professional athletes should look a certain way I really just don't like the youth there's this generation of fighters that watch and move on TV on YouTube and they're going they try to do it they don't want to drill repetitiously they don't want to actually put in the work but why does that affect you though it affects me because our sport is also the fans and the fans actually culture who gets to fight and if a guy's gonna talk enough shit and so I were in flight suits then this day and age that's good enough for a title shot and I think it's disrespectful to everybody that came before that remember that you had to go tendon Oh didn't you get the fucking call from the USC mm give connor one artem low ball from in the EOC and a 500 record he's gonna be in you see and i just its ways that the sport is taking a love out of it but i just find a way in dominating my opponents taking all the tools away from them you know Dean Thomas shout out to them and Duke Rufus or fucking mastermind so I take pride in that take pride in going in there now getting hit dominating knocking people out whatever but when you say you don't like fighting you like all those things you don't like to what other people are doing I love training I don't like what I don't like to what the sport has become so this is an interesting thing to talk about because a lot of people have different points of view on that and one hand a lot of people like the traditional martial arts approach of respect for your opponent and just fighting to the best of your abilities and letting the chips fall where they may whereas other people say well listen to get people to show up to get acids and seeds to get pay-per-view buys there's got to be some drama and some entertainment value to it and that's where someone like Conor comes into powers only when it's done it though yeah well Rhonda a little bit Rhonda did it a little bit Connors done it the best and when he actually puts in the work right Sonny did but he didn't his mouth his mouth was louder he's actually tried the best at it he's he's probably he's better than the counter at it Khan is very close but Connor actually delivers on more than more of what he said he's gonna do it in shell did I would agree so you got to think of anybody who's brought both worlds together best I would have to say Connor he knocks a lot of guys out I try to call the round he's only lost a few fights total and even those fights it was wrist mashing or fighting a guy switched opponent this note is different weight class you know he's taking those risks and rewards that if you lose it's not really that big of a deal you know nobody's gonna really oh my god dropping down to the bottom of the pack but these other guys that haven't done it don't have the skills ain't put into work I mean it can kind of really just will you see the trend right there is a trend right now that is so incredibly disrespectful very rude and you know you saw what happened with Colby Covington and you know let's go to his wedding ring daddy pressing charges I mean there's a queef well there's a coward queefing thin there's a lot of attention being placed on him though I mean you you see it's it's slightly effective let me see how much attention but it is effective in the moment right I mean the most effective it's tough it's effective in a moment I'm gonna tell you why because some time I sports is like you know nothing going on like fuck with this kids talking shit let me listen him right and right there at that point Connor wasn't round Ronda wasn't around John wasn't round who is UFC really projected at the star bright sage Northcutt had a few bumps Paige Vanzant had a few bumps they're trying to push up in Ghana but what started they have so now if you got this person is willing to go crazy even though we know as WWE the person is really not getting slammed we want to live in that moment anyway we want to go for the villain who has you really be beyond Demian Maia well what was all the top 15 victory well the Damian Mayer was a big one but that wasn't one but it was one but he was unmotivated and he was a guy that already had his title shots and you know he's getting up there in age what is really his motivation I wrote the book on how to be demon mind and he didn't even read the book he just skimmed through it because no part of the book said that dude you just gotta fuck you up and blood of your face coach ended that by himself I didn't do that you know even with my right arm being messed up so yeah he's just I'm just looking like how many young followers just yeah like I mean he didn't have a big following before that that was his biggest fight that was the big the big coming I don't want to discredit I'm Damian my ZG you know I don't want to discredit Colby but you know for you for me have some people in your resume have some you know I didn't be Derek you know tarik Stephanie Paul Daley Jordan me and this before I even got in UFC my first fight was Jay Heron who had only been stopped by George st. Pierre lost one fight to be national Neville's close and had one or every fight after that so I never had an easy fight all my guys was either former champions and former contenders of former you know people that were interim champions and when you got a list like that you should don't get the respect Koscheck Condon when he was saying you don't get the respect from who fought him oh my god can care that's why what do you respect you definitely get respect watch this when you think of Robbie Lawler okay Carlos Condit right right and a different category as it were to you that I'm the champion I beat both of those guys wait a min what do you mean by a different category I see them in a category then this might just be me I see them as in the category is if you're talking about guys are gonna enter in a Hall of Fame right and you think about all just cos checking Carlos Condit and probably lawyering you know this guy Anderson Silva not all those different guys but it's funny that I've defeated these guys wait a minute you're crazy you're talking crazy I don't think so yeah no you're definitely talking crazy you're the champ you know the champ you you're acting like people don't respect you as the champ they respect they respect like that Carlos Condit gets more respect or run along gets more that's crazy Carlos Condit gets more respect to me Robbie Lawler gets more respect to me but from who though sure even guys even guys that I defeated like you know Steven Thompson co-op said I'll get more respect to me I mean I don't say that but people are willing to be like oh my god you know tell them Dana said tell them to get in the cage retire Woodley he didn't say hey tyrant tell them to get engaged with Steven Thompson on the seventh fight win streak knocking everybody fuck out with a really super word style that took me months and a fortune bringing all these fucking crazy Taekwondo raymond Daniels could all these the best of the best to train him to beat him right like nobody gave me that pass like if you shouldn't know why you concentrate on that I don't that seems but you are because you're talking about it I'm not concentrating on me when he has these nutty thoughts I'm talking through the shitty fucking chair I'm telling me this is all nonsense this is wasted wasted energy you think what you think about and it doesn't matter to me because my path is pretty clear what I want to do I want you I want to rent I want to be the best Walter reigning defending undisputed UFC Walter actually in 2007 when that was the shit right now what was in the middle of ours you're in the middle of ice Connor and they fight and supervises that are bigger than a world title fight because I didn't know I know you as much you don't know you as much yet and whether whatever look Connors are weird enigma and whatever reason why that got caught fire the way he did it's a weird combination of personality results skill lot of in Ireland Ireland's a big factor I mean if Connor was from Nebraska I guarantee it's not just a big fight country the loyalty and the love that those people have for the people that fight from Ireland there's no no there's nothing like that yes it's a it's a weird anomaly so he's just this weird aberration and he gives people almost like false hope of what's possible yeah because I don't know if it's possible with a lot of people just it just it's lightning in a bottle for whatever reason it worked with him but he started in himself into what happened yeah here come the jumper cables yeah you'll see put the machine behind him right they definitely put the machine behind him there was giant hoards of people flying in from Ireland I remember one of some of his earlier fights I was like and I was commenting on and I was saying this is a guy who was on the undercard and they're acting like this is the main event of a pay-per-view they've flown from Ireland the audience is filled with thousands of people that flew from ours that's like number amazing yeah even back then it was insane when he fighted knowing back then you know it's funny somebody while always striking coaches like Conor McGregor's this huge star and I'm like that's what he had first got in the UFC and I'm like I don't even know who the fuck this kid is he said he was trying to convince me no he's a superstar he said it as I and then every time I get a chance I said you you were right he wasn't then with his mother for getting up being a superstar and he loves to get that credit because at that moment I think I was getting ready to fight Dungey and Kim and he kept on with this Conor McGregor so I said let me look at this motherfucker let me look him up because you obviously got a boner for this dude and I looked him up I'm like all right he's good I get it but let me see him beat a couple people and then if he can beat Dustin Poirier then I'm down me give him his props knock knock toast important that's important well he's 100% legit he's legit but it's what else is going on that's so weird yes he's not just legit he's also this unbelievable personality people are drawn to him that's no one can manufacture that like he's rehearsed it he's practiced it he's looked in the mirror he has natural wit he's he's willing to go risky and say some below-the-belt shit and he does his research he don't come to a press conference just you know smoking you like the front row of a comedy show he's looking into some deep shit and when you get there you kind of stumble so you're right he has that he also has a fight style he also has so happened to do 80% of shit he says gonna do so now he's the fucking Messiah right but you can't say that the UFC has not gotten behind you or people don't give you the respect that you deserve that's why you're not in the same level you said that at him and Conner or super fights I'm saying that he has gotten it now saying that he has gotten it and he has lived up to what he said he's gonna do on top of that you got it you got to be able to fight and he can fight and he was been able to talk so now not only can he generate the pay-per-view buys and get people interested he's actually gonna deliver a knockout again Josie Otto stop as she gets Eddie Alvarez and a crazy you know back-to-back fights wouldn't it don't you think that you're in an unusual situation first of all because you win the title by spectacular first-round knockout against Robbie Lawler right unbelievable knockout but then you have the most awkward and difficult guy to defend your title against wonderboy Thompson is a very unusual opponent it's hard to look good against him and that all the people that fought him you're the only guy that put him in danger not once but twice and the way you fought him I've defended the way you fought and many times gonna say look if you look at tactically if you look at technique and you look at the art of fighting that's the way to find him if you're a guy like tyron woodley a powerful puncher was a great wrestler who's got one real one punch knockout ability you're not gonna open yourself up to wonder boy and then arrest him either exactly don't get picked apart you're not gonna fight him the way he wants to fight what you did as you laid back a lot people booed a lot because that but when you connected you were the one that hurt him in those two fights he was the one that was in big trouble in both of those fights not you it was his fight was it was it was not for me I'm never you know I got the same thing in the Maya fight but at the end of the day and someone's attempting to take you down multiple times over 20 times it's very hard to get in any type of exchange every time you swing they wanna go yeah well the Maya fight was tough to him because your injury but you got to go back and look at like Anderson Silva's dark days there was a dark days when Anderson Silva fought Demian Maia where nobody wanted to have anything to do with him after that fight yeah and Anderson Silva fought when he fought there was several fights where he had just boring results no and people weren't interested in him fighting anymore one spectacular knockout and everybody's back on again and people won one spectacular knockout to get the belt and everybody slowly forget about it moments later because at the time Stephen Thompson said know where the fight Robbie and I think he's gonna win anyway and then he think I'm supposed to be just so graciously like god that's fighting an honor and not you want to fight Robbie right you said Robbie was gonna win you say you personally prefer to right fight Robbie because I've been waiting around even though that wasn't a case so you said this up so don't think that I'm just gonna give you my spotlight and say hey you know what let's do this no if I'm seeing the table been set I know there's Nate Diaz out there Nick Diaz out there's your Saint Pierre is Michael biz means guys that had that name they have that status that I'm trying to get to those are the guys I want to fight I want to knock those guys down because now I can continually issue myself up fighting him well he's trying to get the same thing I'm trying to get why the hell am I gonna pull you up with me right if that's the fight they wanted me to fight him whatever one they never offered me to fight he said something then I think the UFC thought I wasn't take the fights the first time they offered me to fight I accepted it so when all these people like oh my god you don't want to fight trying to pick his fight he just got the belt I'm like people man you listen I'm talking about too many people saying things that you're responding to that are irrelevant I think is the people that that are in the organization I got it okay you're dealing with people that I don't deal with that and in that regard but as far as like people that are analysts and experts I don't and as far as it like the social media like I really don't read social media good I post because I run a post and I leave it alone so that's why I say that I'm not saying without saying who it is I'm not saying that the fans are making me feel some type of way because my my path is clear I want to be the greatest warrior of all time right whatever it takes when I get an opportunity I'm trying to knock you out okay at all times Stephen Thompson is a different type of fight as you say before look what happened with Robert Whittaker rusty and look what happened when this guy wrote yeah those guys that's people that he killed with her can forget it and get all this shit and also realize how tough it is to take him down against the cage remember how fast he pops up mm-hm so why didn't I get myself 31 foot and if I want a double eight him I got the whole place to stretch across some blasts tomorrow you don't have one point scale Palmer so even if my back is against the Octagon when I go for a shot I got the whole entire octagon to take him down first is pressing I'm going for the takedown him in the cage or both defending my shot and then him trying to you know do some razzle-dazzle kick so I have no issue with the way I fought him or a Demian Maia I don't think there's another way to fight him unless he didn't take my series he didn't train the way he didn't bring in the top jujitsu guys like it was easy to spar and kick box and look good and never have to take a shot the way I trained I put myself in positions I know I'm never gonna be in you're never gonna take me down you're never gonna have my back I'm never gonna be mounted but I'm training that shit anyway just in case I slipped on a banana peel I get clipped with a punch so George George Mazda doll just from the way I watched him fight he was surprised even the something Steven Thompson hit me with never surprised me I got hit with it he landed some good shots he's really quick I mean I'm fast and explosive but he's quick those punches get to you fast he's long and we start bouncing you don't even know what the hell he's gonna do and it's kinda like what are you about to do what are you about to do you can watch his performance until he didn't do the proper work same thing with Damien mind he trained with Kobe Lang trying to take me now I'm stop the shot and just knock you out that's not how it works you got to bring in guys that know his half-car how he hooks an ankle Holly sweets how he switches from one side to other what happens when you grab around your way if you give him his back this hiking lockup I trained with guys like trained with him and the guys would have better than naming my on the mat that way when I got out there had he taking me down I would have been prepared to escape get away came back to my feet do you think that having a chip on your shoulder in some way helps you like all these people that doubt you in some way you have to prove yourself I just know that I'm the best like you know me and Dean was training one day and I start practice and I just I had a brain fun I start thinking about Georges st. Pierre and I saw I think about all his skills and I start thinking about Robbie and all the time welterweights and I said I'm the fucking best in the world nobody's faster than me nobody stronger than me nobody worked as hard as I do nobody has all the skills to strike in the wrestling did you just sue the defense of timing the explosion the toughness I've been in Wars I've been in close fights I've been in fights why knock people out I've been in at all so when I decided that I'm the best I start carrying myself as if I was already the champion and that's why I had champ camp before I even had the belt which was when was this around which fight oh right shit Robbie right before right before Robbie and I was supposed to not champ camp actually we supposed to start with um with Johnny but Johnny had some complications didn't make it to the scale so they do me I was fighting Robbie yeah I remember talking to you backstage one day at one of the weigh-ins and you were frustrated and you were like when the fuck am I getting my title shot yeah well then you know that this is a thing we know the game changes and sometimes they want to see fights play out before they make a you know card they never want to be on the line saying you were definitely getting a title shot right they've done that a couple of times and we've seen what happened right and they pulled out of so I fought Kelvin Gastelum Kelvin Gastelum was supposed to be this conditioning freak and he missed way by 10 pounds and you know for me I don't play that shit don't act like you were so sick no you didn't make weight and what happens when you don't make weight you actually didn't have to go through and suck your body all the way down to scratch weight like I did so he should actually look better so I don't want to me know he was sick and that's why if no he had a chance he just is never gonna beat me I fought him he was the one that was huffing and puffing he couldn't hit me he couldn't land any significant punch I land it and after that fight you know it was some scrutiny in the final my okay you'll me to grapple with him so he can try to take my back and do a redneck cachaca like did everybody else you want me to exchange with him and let him get into the fight when I know I'm faster on norm sharper he can't hit me I got better defense the whole time he's pushing me against the case I heard his crew say no no no don't go there don't go there he was terrified they the Koscheck thing was gonna happen to him so he backed up every time he pushed me to an octagon while we're not playing it you know me so when people look at that he was said that he was gonna get a title shot I'll never remember that they said if Kelvin got some would-be tyrant he's gonna get a title shot you know I remember people saying oh yeah they were saying that but they weren't saying well they didn't say that annecy Dana White said if Kelvin Gastelum beast tyrant he's getting a title shot remember he had already been coach selected for the coach he got the coaching job off the loss I have to miss him wait about ten pounds and then they told me he would never fight a 185 again if I took the fight I mean 170 again if I took the fight so he lost to me suede still got the Tufts coaching job and on top of that he was going to get a tighter shot had he beaten but why do you so you again it comes to this chip on your shoulder thing you feel like everybody's against you know you do a little I don't you want me to though no you do this is what you're saying it's the things that you're saying yes and I'm just saying it I know I know that I know the deck of cards I got and I'm not a play these tackle what do you think the deck of cards is the deck of cards is gonna come a moment where I'm a superstar and when I get to that moment I have more leverage at this time I'm not at the point what kind of McGregor's that so I got a if I gotta fight the number one contender and I can't vouch how to fight a George st. Pierre or Bisbing or a Conor and Nate at this moment I'm gonna keep with Vanessa - I good today well after George is beaten right now George is in an amazing position right George beats Bisping if he wanted it and he dropped the title but if you wanted to come back and fight you for the welterweight title that's a legitimate super fight right there I mean that makes a lot of sense you think coming off of his big fight you don't think he does look you tell me you think George had to show me George had the chance to fight me before business he chose of my business well maybe he felt like that was a better fight for him to come back it was definitely better fight because he buddha came back against me looking like that Jorge would have been right back in retirement he did not look great bhisma did not look great one thing that helped George in a fight his experience he loosened up he was a little uptight you know I hadn't been in an octagon what four years almost a little over two yeah you know three right martinet was it for it was almost four it wasn't quite far it's almost four cuz I fought November I fought November UFC to the 25th anniversary right I think it was like fuck laughs fuck off in the card yeah okay that's a long-ass time so he for him to not fight that long karma she trained us and in a fight you have a training camp focus on a person it's tough so when he came back I saw the experience kick in he relaxed a little bit that's when he faked and landed a left hook had he not relaxed I mean you know who knows what of apathy oh yeah right yeah it was a it was interesting because Bisping was tight and I expected I expected him to be looser big Bisbing doesn't have the he's not guys out but he's not got it you know you're thinking of like a rumble or income or myself or someone shot Stevens Jeremy Stephenson is gonna touch you in his overweight so with that say he's a he's a person that's gonna be volume he's gonna be in your face great conditioning he's very durable and George had to make that adjustment he said alright be an athlete this guy mm-hmm let me fake him out let me get him thinking about the shot that took him down twice let me get him thinking about it lovely chance come up my foot very smart move and that's something that the experience of being a champion do well there was some talk about him fighting Conor but I didn't hear any of that from the official people yeah and him fighting Conor at 170 pounds would have been fascinating it's in terms of like it's a terrible matchup for Conor yeah you know in terms of like just physicality once again risk and reward what happens yeah those who do great as well to it of all time yeah people gonna torture him about it yeah but Conor is that was another fight right now this is not a good time especially in his division there's so much talent like right now you think you got a single beef right now that's what I'm saying that's what I want you think you don't you I mean Tony's if if I was Conor which not if I had to pick the fight there both are gonna be I mean Toby might be a bigger job cause he got a huge huge 140 some million people in Russia might be a bigger draw but they both are very annoying fights very dangerous fights dangerous Tony Ferguson you know they don't take much for him to find a way to get around your neck and choking he's not only too tired he doesn't get tired he looks like he's losing fights and he don't care as striking is very awkward he can really do it Nate Diaz dear to Conor yeah and they Diaz you know bathroom like damn I hate you with everything you still around then Conner would for the damn shot the same thing is gonna happen TV do that to Tony Tony's no cementum here's my prediction my prediction counters in fight for a while you watch those things they strip them they strip Connor he comes by me hubby even Tony fight for the world title for you but for you what's your dream be honest is um you know my dream was to really I wanted to I wanted to fight yours and that's impossible I feel like if I far George I can live Jenna me say I'm the best walk away tomorrow if I beat him it's still possible George has retired how I said anything about you he asked one time like Fox Q&A where he was going like so tired and if you fought what would be your game plan you know if you fought us but I got X out because they didn't want to get all the fans pumped up they were fighting why wouldn't they do you think they're plotting against you us here yeah I see it in your face Joe he is not gonna do that to me I am too bright you want me to be like other people know me listen I want you to just be focused you want me to be real yeah sure I'm even real sure do I think that the people want to see me lose no I don't think they want to see so I think that sometimes I'm a pain in the ass yeah I am but in business at one point in any business there's not the person that's doing the business not what they best interests so if I'm an athlete and I'm looking out for my best interest and I'm trying to put myself in a position where you know I can fight become a legend become a hall-of-famer I should do that if I want to be paid appropriately I should do that in our sport because you the way to UFC started we didn't am UFC you do what we say and that's it no questions you fight who we want to fight you get paid we want to get paid and that's it and then what happened the specialist the one-trick ponies stop then collision athletes start getting in there college wrestlers you know Kenny Florian is the goddamn mom almost thinking about being a doctor at one point so now got intelligent people coming into the sport they just so happen to be businessmen entrepreneurs so now I'm looking at market value I'm saying what these motherfuckers making and guess what I should be making this if they're making that if I'm a champion and this person is doing this I should do that knowing what everybody's making knowing all the numbers I want to be at least fair I don't ask for no crazy I don't know 15 million and all that other stuff so if me doing that makes me come difficult then I guess I'm just a little bit difficult okay but let me let me look at it from their perspective what they look at in terms of what an athlete is worth is like how much are they bringing in like what kind of pay-per-view buys are you getting how much this is what I was bringing in this is a fight well he wasn't making nearly as much money back then how much everybody has a start so anyway you can't but then you can't throw you out and say okay fight wonderboy UFC blah blah blah and if you don't do 500 well you did 300 by 300 thousand bars you're not a draw okay how was I promoted as a champion how was it this is a long circuitous sort of a conversation if we continue along this way but what I'm trying to say is there's a fancy word there's a way 50 now it's it's like a circular it's sort of a thing you're not circling back around to it what I think is there's a way for if if you want to make a big super fight like if George st. Pierre really wanted to make a big super fight in the UFC wanted to make a big superstar out of you that's the fight because one of two things happens either he beats you and he's even bigger than ever yeah or you beat him and you become bigger than ever let's do it that's what I'm saying no the fight that make sense but that's that's that makes sense no one's trying to stop that from happening what when the UFC is not willing to pay a certain amount of money it's because they don't think they're gonna get a certain amount of money it's not because they're trying to avoid getting paid if they thought that you could be some enormous superstar and they could make Conor McGregor type money from you there's not they would never say yeah we don't want to do that cuz we don't wanna give Tire in power they don't think like that they think like there are numbers people they're trying to make pay-per-view buys and if you only sold 300,000 pay-per-view buys because the wonderboy fight there's not much they can do about that I mean it's not whether or not you are promoted a certain way as a fighters like that fight for someone like me is fascinating but for the average fuckin Johnny lunchbox I want to see blood cut type person that's not but the paper reviews about before the fight takes place right but they knew this style they knew the style they knew the matchup and especially the second time you guys it was it was the fighter tonight on the biggest card of UFC history UFC 205 in Madison Square Garden according to them it was the best fight of the entire card so if that was the best fight it was fine is that because he adeptia war to fight of the night yeah yeah that's just so you can get a bonus though right I mean and when you look at the the fights in terms of like you could have a card where there's a lot of fights that aren't entirely significant and that would be the fight of the night I don't think there's anything wrong with that fight I've told you before I like that fight you have seed the people that are casting the checks if they deem because they didn't want to make decisions right Dana and whoever if they say that this fight was a fight of the night which means you get more money you get more money couple more bucks but think about this how different was the sacrifice it was really kind of the same fight pretty much the same so how is that fight fight at night and then a very exact fucking fight a few months later it's a boring fight get it what happened who said it's boring if you says boring the worst one says boring if Dana says is born the world's gonna say is boring so well I never said it was no I'm gonna say I say if you look at the result after the fact people might say the if you knew what happened during the fight you might say well it's boring to watch again but watching it live was not boring at all because the consequences are so grave yeah it's one of the things that I point Alec if wonderful way fucks up he's going to sleep yeah if you fuck up you're gonna get kicked in the head too like anything can go wrong in that fight Derry didn't say he's a boring fight what he said was man the way you the way you let go on him in that period you know why don't you just do that every time I said Dana I said when I let go it's because I see it opening yeah when I see it opening you always know me to go tell me one time I've seen open and not went and I had somebody hurting I'm not trying to finish but don't you think that that's just frustration for someone who's not fighting who says things that aren't logical to you as a guy who's a champion who is fighting it's these are these are things that people say but it's damaging when mr. president right when the president says it especially when you got the coaches following whatever he says gonna go if they say Demian Maia is born everybody and then I go change word if you say tyron woodley in Demian Maia oh my god that fucking fight was boring somebody's gonna be tyron woodley Demian Maia oh my god that fucking fight is born they're not gonna change a word right that's what we have so as a champion and in a position of being supposed to being promoted at that place it becomes damaging so now how are you gonna come back and say okay Tyra's back his Soto's fix he's one of fucking most devastating guys out there you know knock your motherfucking head off but then five minutes ago you just say he was born you know I mean it's very hard okay I see we've seen we talk about two different things what you're saying is you feel like the way they talked about you after the fight was damaging and she's respectful and and also not accurate in terms of the consequences of your actions in the fire and nobody and nobody came through it was like damn you know what I have to find out this motherfucka Torres goddamn labrum in the first round and he still didn't give a one damn takedown didn't hardly get touched at all in entire fight maybe punch two or three times total that's kind of clutch she's motherfucker you got he must got it fucking strong doctor you would like to hear no I don't want to hear anything because I want to fight but you're saying you're saying I'm saying I'm saying there was a choice made to say one thing right but James also lies off the cuff right and that's always been the thing about them but but it's also you can also fly off the cuff in the other direction you can also say hey this person is fucking next superstar my guy in Ghana was crazy oh my god Cody karma is fucking the man oh my god Paige Vanzant it's on my man says your cat that you can say that and what's what happened - did you do million followers - million followers and that makes a big difference but that can happen to you at any moment you are frustrated by the reaction to three particular fights the to wonder well you definitely found you want me to be fresh settle down fella I'm working like Harry I know you are and I'm not fresh I know you are I'm unhappy with certain things and this unhappiness stems from the result of three fights but if you look at one fight before that the robbie lawler fight I mean everybody was talking about you like you were the most devastating thing of all time the fact that you were able to do that to Robbie Lawler yeah all you need is one or two more fights like that about Demian Maia what happened no I don't well let me tell you this I definitely don't I'm really not frustrated okay now you're playing a cool guy I see I'm not frustrated I just know my deck of cards mm-hmm and I got a very thick layer of skin and I'm very I'm very cautious of Who I am in my brand now when I look at the division right and you're a champ you're at the top of the food chain what do you see in front of you like what what threats what what fighters do you think or present unique challenges no well what do you think is next for you if you just forget about the super fighter I think the deck needs to be shuffled I think when I come back I think when I come back I take that back Carlos him in his dope he's freaking he's fighting this weekend tomorrow's me tomorrow and he's a guy that a lot of people are not talking about a lot of reasons and I'm okay to talk about it because you know I've always been honest he's very tough he's a good style matchup for me to present a lot of challenges he's a good wrestler he's very strong he's started to come along with his hands and I would like if I'm gonna fight somebody and this awesome number one contender shit shit I want to fight somebody that respect somebody like RDA somebody like Guzman til hot sand Evo these dudes are these dudes are savages and you know not to sound cocky but I think my toughest challenges are behind me carlos condit and robbie lawler and at the time when Koscheck was almost a few fights you know way from fighting george and you know those guys at that moment those guys presented a lot of problems kai-shek had the same overhand right just a little bit different wrestling great chin great conditioning a lot of experience he knows it was a threat for me Robbie Lawler was a fighter a year back to back you know had some of the craziest fights we've ever seen fucking lip hanging open he's bleeding and that's to do it I had to walk and he was a boogie man at the time so for me to get bubble guts don't nobody have that power their name Marco did when he knocked me the hell out I'll never be hit that hard again in my life you know think Kobe Covington he's gonna punch me and make me like went and back up no look what how you just punching Demian Maia those are rabbit punches so if you don't have great wrestling great wrestling defense great conditioning and power in your hand you just not gonna give me butterflies well I think for sure you have accomplished some great things and fought some amazing fights against some very dangerous challenges yeah I mean there's no doubt about that no one could deny that and those fights you did just talk about Carlos Condit particularly Robbie Lawler Josh Koscheck in his prime amazing fights great results but when you talk about Iseman we talked about RDA you talked about Darren till you're talking about also potential amazing fights okay you know I think there's a lot of outstanding opportunity and I think your division is one of the most talent rich divisions in the sport yeah I'm not just credit a net I think that I'm always a forward-thinking dude so the teal guy didn't sneak up on me neither did you saw till in advance you saw him I'm a talent I'm gonna tell you how to do this right at one point in time it was Brandon thatch it was Erik Silva it was Kelvin Gastelum it was Stephen Thompson okay Brandon thatch very silver kind of doing it away gassing them went up fought me Stephen Thompson went up so now these the the dare until the Iseman all those guys during that same pool so I'm always thinking about training I was seeing about fighting these guys always game planning for these guys before they even come up at some point I don't have to fight everybody because they got it they're gonna cancel each other out if his five studs am i walking to three of them so I got to be ready Demian Maia was in a surprise I actually gave me a my I thought fuck Jake Shields or somebody somebody I fall and my manager was like dude why you wanna fight even my MA such a B's and this is this and I'm like I know this on paper were at McDonald's my toughest matchup in the division right now okay even when Ellen burger was a stud and was fuckin wrecking people because his power is wrestling and his condition him and Johnny Hendrix also would have been a threat what guys were I was trying to fight let me get Johnny Hendrix foreign former champion Marie McDonald so I was going up against the guys Carlos Condit still today might be my favorite fighter so when I watched his video I was getting Bob like this motherfucker good I was stealing his techniques but what happened when I fought him did he look like the same colors Connie he looked no I punched him he looked like a ratchet was snatched him across the you know across the Octagon it wasn't like I just kicked him in the knee and all oh my god he was gonna win no he was getting dominating that fight because I did my work I respect him that much that I took all his tools and I left him naked out there in Octagon and he had the deal my sweet and healed my power that's what I do to everybody nobody sees it they think I'm just just strong ass fucking wrestler with a hard right hand but look at the way that Jordan me and looked against me look at the way that Eric's afternoon I'll show up all day the Kelvin Gastelum it's never looked like that against anybody else same thing with Stephen same thing with Maya same thing with condi the same thing with Robbie it's not it's not a surprise that's the way that Duke and Dean and I we we address what we if I'm fighting me if I tiring this way take him to the lay down his leg stay away from his power circuit this way so now I'm gonna formulate my game plan about what I think you think of me then I think about every fucking thing that you do every skill every talent every man your ISM what you do when you get tired what you're gonna go to what your bread butter and I get ready for those and it sometime is like Robbie took a long time took up until the week of the fight for me to be like I got this motherfucker what was it that was different he just punches really awkwardly he punched his arms are way longer than what you think he's got way better boxing than when you think he doesn't look all like like you see somebody slipping the stuff he do a lot of unorthodox overhand left's and uppercuts and right kicks which makes it very difficult to slip off line and throw any punches he will scramble any first shot if you shoot a shot he'll scramble you hard you have to shoot two three four attempts to get him to the ground he had one butterfly that he used to sweep to get out the ground so we just knew all that and then at any point he can play Roper though and then he can come off swinging so that's a lot of things to think about and then he just can stand here like this and go boom and you knocked out not technique not turning hips he just had heavy hands naturally so that's always a threat we've seen him in Wars he's not gonna go away so I had to you know formulate a game plan that I can get around all that now when you saw the RDA Robbie Lawler fight you said that you weren't really impressed with that fart because RDA had him against the Octagon and he was teeing off for 30,000 punches and he didn't knock him down and he didn't hurt him he was basically just punching the punch anytime you punched a punch he watching your energy well he's going up in weight and he's more volume now than he was when he was fighting a party a five yeah I think he's fighting hey you here now or energy you get hurt now I mean if you if you make the jump you make the jump you know you can't be like come on I was a little I was a lightweight and now he's a welterweight out but I mean his style is different then especially a guy like you throws what is my thought on Robbie okay a lot of people I pick Robbie apart in in in in the film one before I even fought them and the fight was over with before the fight started Robbie starts out the first 30 seconds extremely hard he ends the first second 30 seconds extremely hard second and fourth round kind of close he's going for you going for it he'll take some of the gifts on okay third round usually takes off you ever notice that he gets against a cage he's confident his defense he likes you punchy and he'll block you okay he won't waste a lot of energy so he can get into that second gear it's not that he's so well conditioned while she's fighting against Carlos while she's fighting his Rory watch this fight against RDA he spent the same moment against the Octagon where he allowed the opponent to punch at him - same thing with Johnny Danny came off trying to get through in the burn themselves out he's very smart but if everyone act like he's just for a marathon runner he's not so when that happened I said okay you got to get on Robbie Hart you gotta gonna ride me quick he's been punched a lot like I did all every fucking stache you can't a hair Riku in the fight an Amish guy hit me up saying Robbie has a flat face he punched his fat face he's used to absorbing those punches go around the side punch him on the jawline kind of crazy logic is not man I'll use everything I can tell you how many times he step to the fucking left notify how many times you throw his right hand versus left hand so you know I've been really secretive about a lot of this stuff because most people just see me as an athlete they just punch hard there's a good wrestler that you know that's tough you know you know good game plan but I really overly get obsessed with studying in my opponents to the point where when Maas when I was fighting Wonder Boy I'm like here about to do this him up to do that he's doing this he said this up look told you there you go oh he bought they did and everyone's looking like how the fuck do you not it say you motherfuckers watch that fight that I fought them and you thought it was so easy get your ass in there and that wonderboy said one of the boys a G and he can take a punch way better than I thought I hit it as hard he went three or four times and he just had the mentality I'm not gonna lose today I'm not gonna lose today and he was rewarded for that effort of just saying you know what i'ma give it all I got and um he'll forever have my respect but at the end of the day you got to be able to be honest with yourself I'm honest with who I am what I do well I'm not the best at elbows can I throw elbows yes but I'm not gonna sit out there and act like I'm you know Matt browning somebody no that's his deal Matt browning gonna storm you across the Octagon like I will so once I see what I do well and I you know I can hide my weaknesses behind my strengths I can allow my opponents never to put me in a spot where they're gonna have the advantage today me might ever put me in a position where he had me in his half guard no never did it but you still you didn't think that RDAs performance against Robbie Lawler was impressive because he overwhelmed Robbie I mean he tears I see I'm gonna fight I don't know pinkie minor attack from a tactical standpoint you find out I thought he had some really good success with low kicks yeah and I thought he kind of abandon it I was kind of surprised that he didn't do that and then I saw Robbie do the rope-a-dope but Robbie never came off normally like I said Robbie I'll take some punch the hill coming off storming you never came out storming maybe it's cuz he messed his leg up or whatever but just from from two people that they want to say they're gonna fight me next let me fight somebody and it's a turret with Lawler fought Rd a seriously injured now those injuries have been revealed let's see what we got here was to say destroy blew his ACL and meniscus in a fight and every other thing that's in your knee out in third round said wobbled over to the fence so it make sense yeah make sense because because cuz if Robbie isn't Horsley known for you know like think about what Rory had him against the Octagon with comic on it and he comes out and he comes out blasting but it says it said he hurt himself before the fight though another article I was gonna pull up but I found that that said yeah he was injured going into the photo he tore his ACL before to fight and if I said the title of that though go back to that real quick the title of it said who seriously injured going into the fight right injured and then the injuries have been revealed oh okay yeah so they said I think that was headed to third round right yeah just right when we were saying that he lays yeah so so he so he didn't he didn't come off you can't go to a thread on his brother for him plus it's 31 I go that's it sure you can't go to the thread owners will know what they are like but yeah you know what that would make sense because I'm used to Robbie coming off and getting those 30 second bursts like I don't know exactly I'll talk to Big John about this for a while about the judging right and you know damage being landed you know some of those fights or even if Robbie wasn't the more active one he's damaging people more because he punched pardon is little more aggressive but how can Carlos Condit control the fact that he just don't punch those hard is Robbie right you know she do be panel did you think he beat him robbing in a fight I'd have to go back and watch that again I thought it times you think it I don't think I did I thought I think I thought that Hendricks did or that Robbie did just enough to win what I'd have to go back and I'd have to go back and watch it again yeah I thought at that moment that Carlos wanted but I wasn't like oh my god I can't believe they gave him some Robbie but what was extremely close you can make an argument for either guy winner Robbie because he landed the more part of car departing in look scarier right I think that's why he got the knife that means something though yeah I mean someone who hits harder it has more damage that damage should be accumulated I mean that should be so standing up so someone throws punches and it looks like his affecting a person more even if the other person throw more and land more didn't a person is landing a damage in place you think she went I think damage should count for more than punches that don't damage so like if one person hears that the way that they suppose a score now Carolyn I don't know I mean the new it's what's interesting is Nevada still doesn't accept the new rules they need to get crazy right before you try to bring in the new ones yeah yeah but what's also interesting is the scores are much wider now like you see a lot more ten eights now than the other side before which i think is good i just think that we our system taking a system from boxing it only uses hands and applying that to take down submission attempts leg kicks you almost have to know this guy's our jiu-jitsu world champion the fact that this guy swept him he should score more because this guy this is his you know real house but nobody's gonna know just gonna have that you know insight I think it should be a much broader system I don't think it should be ten points at all I think you're dealing with extreme amounts of variables it should be like almost like a hundred point system the guy that wrapped my fight against wonderboy the first time the one that was one judge they gave a 10/10 eight the first round and a 10-9 the fourth round the fourth when I was when I knocked him down three times yeah the ten eight was when you almost got him in the guillotine is that why he no no I was gotta be getting in the fourth round yeah and he said well you know why don't I think you're almost kind of made a guillotine the first round in the difference fight the first fight the first varieties ground upon the hell out of him I took him down and IG beat him up for the whole round he gave that round of ten eight so it was the fourth round where you got him in the game for the fourth when I knock him down and knock him down again I knock him down again and then I went for the guillotine uh I come down three times he never forgets him the judge told me he said you know I thought it was a 10-8 round you know but then you wasted a minute in the guillotine wasted a minute you told me now I just got over this shit right I was fucking said they said that I just got over the fact that I felt like it was some bullshit I got over the fact so you know what whatever it is what it is let's do it again this time won't fucking beat him there's motherfucker welcome to me now I don't know who he is hey man you want that you know I judged your fight and you know I'm the one who gave you the ten eight in the first round attending fourth round and all of a sudden my insides you start burning and he's like you know I just want to explain to you why you know cuz I don't have a problem with you know facing the fighters afterwards you know you did well I was going to give you a ten round you know it's crazy and you know but then you wasted a minute to get to you I said I'm sorry let me tell you something I said the first round if you woulda said ten down on it okay I ground upon my bloody time up he didn't show no offense 1089 whatever you want to give it I'm cool with that and I said the fourth round I knocked him down three times and I said I want to tell you a guillotine choke is not a it's not a wasting it's not a move that you could say I wasted time in so finishing move Eddie I had these fucking tapped out the fight would have been over with so the fact that I try to knock him out then his neck became available to my arms then I grabbed his leg your neck and then I try to choke him out then he popped his head out yes he's tough for making it through their whole onslaught of me trying to kill him but does that give him an extra point he said with then he threw some punches I said go back and watch the fight I said he threw a few punches from top I mean he landed he said I don't know I said sir said I'm over the fight I'm glad they didn't say I lost the fight but the only significant damage that was landed in if I came from me the only knockdowns only you know blood drawn the only Sheppard II of someone the referee getting involved happened when I was on the other end of it I just think the system sucks yeah I really think the scoring system hey just don't let it go to know what fuck it today you know I'm not gonna try to knock you out no I trusted them three right there look very trustworthy I'm gonna leave it in the hands and all my kids my family my bail I'm just you know I'm living up to them I always hate that expression I hate it because it's so some guys don't want to be finished most guys in Stevens case would have would have been overweight yeah you know some guys just talk I mean I don't want to just be finished right nobody does it's a foolish way of looking at it it's not it's just you the best way to fight is the best way to fight yeah and if you see an opening like you said that's when you move the idea that you're supposed to just rush into danger that's how you lose like in the fact that people don't know that and that people say things like that and they don't understand what they really shouldn't be talking about fighting fighting is a complicated thing by describing and it's also it's one sport worse like if the team doesn't run the ball well they don't run the ball they pass so if this is Stephen Thompson he doesn't have to wrestle he doesn't have to try to do jujitsu right he's just have to stop you from doing it to him but he's got that style that's impossible to find anywhere else he's standing completely sideways he's throwing front leg kicks that could knock you out he's just a lot of weird stuff and he bends at the waist like a snake he'll eat you all those years of point karate like he's really fascinated - he's very - Raymond Daniel's which is a painted ass oh yeah sage Northcutt which I mean in my opinion sparring wise was way harder than the Wonder Boy more MMA experience for sure and also for sidekicks ages his sidekicks he'd knock I had the word Taekwondo pad to spar say he kicked me to defend my bad mr. Woodleigh joke so he um he was good at a kid named Kris bang from the same background then I had another guy named Michael tang who's Taekwondo guy from now from the East Coast and then actually a lot of people don't notice do actually his original base was Taekwondo so having all those guys it wasn't fun I mean it wasn't it was many rounds I did not win I mean says Northcutt kicked my ass for a couple of couple days because I couldn't figure out how they had to get up on him without getting kicked in the sidekick Brian hey now you got to think about it like damn well how close to I get to him before he yeah you know it's a totally different style of movement and Wonderboys probably the best in the world I know he's gonna it's it's a very complicated fight and that's why I almost had him use me but his manager who say that again Michael venom page oh really I was gonna bring him out - he wanted to come out but his manager excuse me wanted me to bring him bring the manager bring the friend you know made him all his money all three different separate rental cars I said yeah I think I am what kind of money I got but we're not doing that for three days you made a big change in your life when you started training with Duke and a lot of people don't know that before that you really didn't have like a main trainer which is pretty impressive Dean's been with me for a long time but as far as a coach coach every day I put myself to stuff that was all that was crazy before Duke it was just me I had a gym I would say hey guys you gonna spar this time we're gonna do this I was you know you know try to adjust my weaknesses that I've been really blessed to have the amount of success I had without having a full-time coach then as you got to the point when I told Dean I said man whatever cost man whatever I got to pay I need you the whole time I said because I can't do I've been winging this shit I can't keep doing that but what it was interesting you told me that it was your son's idea Wow yeah you got a good memory to go to Duke taking some notes no shit yeah my son I had on was doing an embedded thing and he was like so where we going tomorrow I was like him like either tomorrow is so on a humbug I'm like we're doing a fly to Florida me and Dean we're gonna drive in Milwaukee you're my my son Daeron he said I think you should go to Florida go up there and train with Ben Askren and anting to Patterson those guys and I think you should go I'm in Milwaukee Milwaukee yet so I said welcome to that morning I said fucking we're gonna know so the Betty guys they actually job my car was getting tired falling asleep so the embedded guys driving my truck up there and we went out there this is cold negative 14 degrees I was like man this sucks I'm coming back home in a week I brought Eve out there anyway never been in the cold in his life yeah I went out there and then Duke is always inviting me to come out he don't invite a lot of guys but Duke from being from Anthony I always saw those guys killing south balls and after I talked to Duke now I understand Dukes brother was a southpaw so his main sparring partner he learned all the tricks on how to defeat a southpaw so I'm like how did Anthony and all these guys every time to go get somebody of the opposite stance they did great against him so if you do the math everybody I fought the model had seven fights with southpaw Robby wonderboy my guess a wonder boy again Aldo Gosselin dong-hyun Kim all of it southpaw and all difficult guys at southpaw yeah and guess what everybody else in front of me is southpaw are da Robbie was all Paul Carrack we became a southpaw so you got you got all these guys that a southpaw so it made sense for me not only that he made fighting fun again I wasn't having fun with it he made it fun to learn I felt like a kid again and you know there was a great morality gym and you know it was I felt very specific to where I was going I feel like I wasn't doing any training just pushing slice and flipping shake just to say I did it everything had a function and I felt better and I look better and you know I did all this training I was running my fucking self into the ground doing all this you know three four day trainings and looking all crazy and I got into the Octagon and they never showed people like MN tiring out and got in their muscles you got all those muscles in the month with my guitar so I'm like damn I'm doing all this extra work but it ain't showing an octagon but then I started training with Duke and Dean and they forced me into said tyrant trust us you're doing too much and it's not if you're sparring is affected because of your strength the conditioning it's no longer supplement it's taking the primary and we're not in fucking CrossFit where I'm fighting you're sparring is number one anything it takes for your sparring to be the best that's what we got to do so we got to run more do less conditioning if we got to actually do none just bar if we got it like there's been times I go in there have a shitty sparring day and I said I'll see you out in the morning we're doing this again can we run it back cuz in the practice room you can run it back in real life you can't so I take advantage of you know the playground of if they've been practice and I think now I just love fighting again I love training I love competing and I love winning I love that minute well you know you want now how much time do you spend in Milwaukee do you just move your whole camp there like how do you miss the time I had to spend some time in Florida because um David Meyer I'll be a complete idiot if I didn't take part of the you know Brazilian Jitsu black belts at American Top Team it really depends on the fight I usually try to get at least four weeks with Duke the good thing about Duke Duke doesn't have a huge ego and he knows what he does well but he works well with other coaches that's why him and I'm Dean has been such a great duo if I need to bring in another striking coach to another training partner or somebody else he opens up the door for that because at the end of the day the goal is for me to be the champion state of champion and reach my goal being a greatest welterweight of all time Duke has a great a smart guy if it was not for that then it'll be a little bit difficult and also Dan Lam you got to realize I've been America's top team since day one Dan Lambert has never been in the blue about where I'm training at where I'm going I've always caught him and for him to give me the ability to go and get stuff from other coaches has also been very helpful no he's another amazing guy - and such a valuable guy and MMA think about the amount of money that he spent on American Top Team before he made any money I mean that guy poured money into mixed martial artists he poured it into it and created one of the greatest facilities on the planet earth for MMA especially the new place yes because it says he's great too I mean but as a coach what I really respect about Duke is not just the fact that he's got this incredible wealth of knowledge but that he's so humble yeah he's so like down-to-earth and chill you know AG's are the people that really just know it they don't have to prove it Dean's like that Dukes like that Lambert's like that some guys that overly want to show you and stuff those are the people that are kind of insecure or where they had its coaches striking coach I mean you Shane was like oh she's oh why you training with that guy they like get so sensitive I've never seen it before ya know I just don't like to deal with it yeah it's unfortunate it's my boxing coach like that to Eric Brown for a wild card I'm a trainer will help since 2007-2008 so he's the same way so now when you're out here like sometimes you're home and when you're home what kind of stuff do you do like if you're not injured if you're not recovering from a surgery like what what stuff do you do at home hang out with my kids go to football practice go to wrestling practice take everybody to school pick everybody up play video games what about like training I don't train you don't train at home sometimes not much really yeah you don't do anything I do set the condition in with my god Eric fair child and I got a I got a up and come in the featherweight that's really fast and good boxing so I play around with him a little bit I might run I might hit the bag might do the first climber but when this cam time I'm out when it's not came time I'm with family that's interesting so you don't you're not constantly training no wow that's do you feel like that gives you you used to watch change that because I stopped like MMA okay so now you feel like you were kind of burnt down but I never stopped watching I'm always watching film I'm always a my obviously working on Fox I got to break everybody down I wasn't burnt out I just I want to want to miss the shit I want to want to get back in there I want to hear somebody name they fighting me and I want to get nervous a little bit and watch them film and see what they do well and then let's get this - let's get this together write everything out let's map out the training count let's get our partners let's do what we need to do and let's get after it and that that takes away the pressure for me right now with with this injury and the fact that three months in you should be able to probably start training hard woody when you looking to defend the belt again you know I can probably I will probably fight April will be kind of pushing me but Bay June July's use the big draw eye for eye shadow weight today that's a good one here by way today and that's probably like st. Pierre fighting main event July whatever the hell we can July fourth weekend used to be an international fight yet that's the bell will be I mean that's why I have the biggest chance to get a big fight that's what I want if I was your manager that's what we gotta do time so July probably hang in there's no fight in between that that's gonna make sense for me to do as George say he's retired or he's not retired what did he do just just gave up the belt alright George I don't want to speak for George because I like George I like him too so I don't want to speak for him but George is smart he's he he plays the fact that he don't know I don't really speak English that well him I fucking smart he knows this being was the right fight okay think about it Bisbing according to all the middle weights wasn't really the best middle way they all everybody want the fight bismi right so if George is gonna go up fighting for another belt another legendary move fight a guy that does not have the punching power maybe cannot take him down maybe cannot stop to take down and for once yours probably had a power punch of power advantage against business me so with that said it made a lot of sense for him do that they also had a lot of history training together that was a big part of it yeah George his eyes he was very successful against a guarantee he was he was kind of worried about the size oh yeah are you like really worried about that there was talk about you fighting Bisping at one time I know you guys would it got back my 205 right now I'm good I'm good to fight it Midway I actually offered to fight George at middleweight and give up my belt at welterweight and just fight him if I lose the fucking right middleweight title then I lost my building now I'm fucking the Sam sausage head you know I guess don't to the bottom of the bottom of the day but when you make that kind of ballsy say hey I'll fight him a bit away and I'll give my build up if that fight doesn't happen at that point I kind of feel like somebody might not want to well it's hard to say right because he only fought once in four years and there's no timetable in his return and no thought whatsoever though there's a lot of weirdness in this sport right now it's so much rests on January 20th so much rests on and Ghana versus deep a because I think that fight is gonna be gigantic for the sport there's gonna be gigantic for the sport and then you know I think steep a is used to overly working I mean he he had a spot with he like man what am I ever won in my shot I finally got it took advantage of it you know I was in a similar situation I'm like when am I gonna get my shot got it took advantage of it and Ghana has very scared he's so scared you don't knock you out regular thing do you hit you you fall out he hits you at everybody else they wondering if you alive still it's kind of like like we hear we hear over all my god do you see the mean when it was like that like the Pez candy yeah and his head almost touched a spine that wasn't the same knock out yeah he not condemned he's freaky in his speed his power and his story is incredible I mean you want to talk about a story that's like right out of a movie yeah a guy was homeless five years ago and now the sudden in two years if I so appreciative it's so happy you know like two times the size of my head like you look like you shaking a loaf of bread I told his boxing coach I'm like man I do not envy you man you get punched in their body protect no this year he said he said you could put it on said no well not he's something special if I was deep a I would come down but yeah it's gonna try see buddy got a good chin but I wouldn't test it against him no don't test it I think he's gonna try to close the distance and grab him and truck driving thank you shit but no you don't think is gonna be able to I think you want to show everybody I stood up with Overeem I said oh a dog JDS I said over Fabricio I said over all these guys totally different things Rory Nelson I know I know they're totally defined on his coaching staff I don't know what they think I think he should punch to take down take down on the ground and pound where his arms out make Mick and God will fight him to stop again take down and see if you can take some steam off them hands that's what I think too and I think that the clinch is gonna be critical over him got the clinch on him but couldn't do anything with it and steep it was college wrestler steep a has got good wrestling skills you know he's known more as being an overall well-rounded MMA fighter but I think he's got to get that clinch I just think standing in front of in Ghana it's just you're just you're playing Russian roulette one of those boats gonna land I'm not standing from them and not even just even if we do an appearance I might hang you too close to MooMoo yo big ass over there oh yeah when he connects it's just it's something different so people always ask me that do you think they want in Ghana to win do you think they trying to set this up so he can win do you think as far as I said he's an amazing story if he was the champion it would be very marketable and I don't know that people want yeah I mean I'm a firefighter with the raspy voice I don't think there's I think if Stevie can turn Francis back that's that's very marketable to I think the unity when he has a he broke the record right yeah he will break the record yeah which is crazy from the defenses I know that's how crazy the heavyweight division is and always has been you know all the the the most anyone has ever done is Cain Kane's done two defenses right damn that's crazy it's Cain right Cain hope the the office caterer that poor Cain maybe block Cain has so many injuries man just constantly injured that poor guys constantly getting surgery freaking my man over there he's checking I thought she had a st. Louis head are you supposed to get some some stripes over there la la and it's from Ohio so what I Columbus Columbus are cold as hell out there fuck yeah it is I was just out in Canton not too long ago my son played in arm the Hall of Fame well I know UFC champion has defended the belt more than twice heavyweight champion so what does it say does it say whether it's Kane yeah yep Cain Velasquez yeah this is a while ago yeah I think steep a is a version of Cain with less injuries Cain kicks a little bit more but you know just pressure punch in endurance yeah yeah see bays a beast he's definitely a beast look this is gonna be the toughest fight for sure in in Ghana's career but what's what's I mean if Steve a can win it's amazing and it solidifies his position as the baddest man on the planet but there's some about in Ghana that is it's uh it's more it's more in enticing to people it's also the fact that steep a has been in so many wars and his chin has been touched a lot of times you know so he has a great chin but you don't want to keep testing it well she gets to do like ain't gonna was awkward power yeah the flat round Junior dos Santos fight was crazy long fight and he got knocked down over a marine yeah it's a tough one but the thing is like we we know so little about in Ghana's ground game we know so little about his ability to overcome adversity he's just been smashing people I agree I said I said that of the day I think that steep a he's been in a tough fights he's been knocked down and he's he's on a five five fight ko shriek as well mm-hmm I mean and it's against tougher opponents in the ganas knocked out yeah well the sport is so exciting right now man there's so much talent who your face are going on Tyron Woodley it wouldn't happen to be because I'm here I don't have a favorite fighter max Holloway smattering I love max at home I like his style too because his style is uh he overwhelms you he doesn't he's not knocking anybody out with one shot he's just constantly overwhelming you with conditioning and intelligence and timing and distance and he could do everything he gets strike he'd take you to the ground it's got a great defense how thick his submissions are outstanding and I liked that fight with him and Frankie Edgar that's an interesting fight I was just talk about this other day but Frankie Edgar has fought similar you know Cub Swanson or Yaya Rodrigues but max isn't really fought anybody like like Frankie know somebody that's short and compact that knows how to get close quick knows how to get out quick he'll take you down Frankie don't give it him he was taken out who is that Charlie Oliveira he didn't get me hell how great he was on the ground he was in his car punching and I think that can present some problems absolutely yes he'll fight a good fight yeah that's the March 3rd fight and Max is a big big favorite in that fight which I thought was called he looks like he's a Maui yeah he's alive confident and then that in the Aldo fight especially the second fight man you see that confidence just oozing out of him he's the chan beast he's a beast yeah I think 55 is an amazing weight class right now we argue on Fox that they think they try to get under my skin and say lightweight as the best division said don't play with me beep yeah be was a beast I haven't watched many of his fights I watched him I said I need to go back to my arm my man he fights like it every time yeah he's a monster you see the Michael Johnson fight he's talented I must be jump give up smashing alone his wrestling and his his his ground-and-pound is just so ferocious it's just on such another level and when he gets a hold of guys he's getting a hold of guys that are really good and just ragdoll on him like what he did to our da did you ever see that fine yeah alright so yeah I haven't seen those fights I got to go back and look ragdoll the RDAs you know just beats the shit out of people get you to the ground how's the big fan Anthony my man he something special dude he's something special and the fact that he did that to Barbosa he wants to move up 72 no he don't hey metabolic meals shit out sitting see my man he'll be by the pack nutrition is anybody out there I'm picking up the tab it's Jo cycle as down there 55 I'm not trying to see no kabhi right now yeah he's making 55 easy now though so who knows I think what I believe is gonna happen is I think Connors gonna vacate I think they're gonna strip him cuz Connor was got a hundred million dollars in the bank and he's having fun and talking shit and he's gonna keep training and he's gonna make a big fight in the future yeah but I think Habib versus Tony is the big fight and fuck they might even do that one in Russia they do that one to talk about doing those big fight in Russia or that yeah if that happens well that's a good fight I mean everybody's been waiting to see that fight fuck yeah that's like Tony Ferguson very unorthodox how many wins he's got like nine ten in a row yeah he has the most ever in the lightweight division and I think it's at ten I think when he beat Kevin it was at ten who do you lose Michael Johnson he lost to boy Michael yeah yeah I mean Tony so unorthodox and all the closer to get Steve to our corner even if I yeah closer to you but man yeah he just nobody has told Tony dead what he's doing is not who's Jaime Tony he lost to Jaime Tony earlier in his career it was cruel but what is that from national final ions interesting okay hi I tried the Hyatt Regency Oh Karen darvid Ian that guy's a very good fucking submission artist interesting yeah well he nollette 90-mile voges have is his name ah punch choke choke choke choke choke yep and then running running over guys to the Edson Barboza fight was fucking fantastic that was a fantastic fi2 army yeah well that's the danger about Tony you don't really matter if he's losing that fight yeah first the first second round he keeps it together yeah yeah he's a man that dos Anjos fight was amazing to beat the shit out of San Jose that's it I mean he's a bad man Tony Ferguson you cannot sleep on Tony Ferguson I used to fight is amazing I used to be like man this dude striking don't look like is something that frightened me too much but when it's coming so often and so weird angles and then he's going for shots and he he does the exact opposite of what you think you should doing grappling and then he's in the position and then we get there now he's got like five or six moves from that position so he's like swishing it here and there and there before you know your choke tout yeah he's he's something special he's a real deal that's a that's an amazing fight I love that fight you know what I'm really interested in right now I'm really instance TJ Dillashaw versus Mighty Mouse there's so much to talk about that I don't know I want to see it though somebody's got your mouse 'i'm carbureted Mighty Mouse really yeah I don't know why he just looks looked on paper like a more interesting fight down man I disagree I think it's more interesting to see TJ because TJ's got more weapons like TJ does more stuff he throws more kicks he's got more I mean you saw in the garb and fight that's where he heard I mean heard him in the head I just I just like Cody's boxing in the pocket minutes counters yeah anybody that's gonna deal with DJ's speed kind of make DG a mess and not very many people have been ever Brian so my thing they both are gonna be tough fights I mean it's gonna be tough for TJ's gonna be tough for Dillashaw Mighty Mouse he just has very few holes he's gonna pouring water over just keep going this he never stopped right now do ya now watch him drill before his fight I could do the same thing in the drill he just did it right in the fight yeah dang not he's special he's special his ability and his ability to not get hit he's doing something that's always takes and dimension so like he was trying to take down with dots remember mm-hmm and Dodson will them taking out and he said forget it I'm gonna grab the leg keep punching him in the face or I'll blow on him it hit and then finally he got the takedown he's just if he thinks is smart he's gonna keep more she's not gonna get discouraged you gonna keep going for it if he was going to get some who's a kid Tim Elliott jokes I'm like I was freaking out cuz you know DJ Muhammad like man is he about to lose to this kid and he said I'm good he had me in her deep like he just don't get right over no he don't get rattled he's got the whole package he's got mental toughness he's intelligent and his skill levels on another level I mean it's his skill levels off the charts he does everything amazing to match that extreme basics yeah you know like that that's um lift up return one of the flashy things you ever seen him do right but in general if you think about it he comes forward he does great fast basics from inside he stands great fast bakes from that side very traditional clinch super active with it I'm hard to take down gets up the regular way if he bounced you he believes like if a coach teaches you an armbar from the mount and his mind it's 100% chance it's gonna work there's no way it can't work so when you see him go do a regular armbar on somebody and cementum like you know Horiguchi or John Moraga like damn how you hit him with that one bar because he just don't believe in the fact that doubting his techniques ya know it's a it's an amazing time amazing time for this part and I mean it's amazing time it's just amazing time for martial arts period I mean I think martial arts right now is at the highest level that it's ever been in the history of people fighting each other you know it's a sighting moment as well because now you got so many different hopefuls no we got six or seven people that they just need one more anomaly just know one more this person just need one more then they jump off and it you know it becomes super strong because we we need more stars right now we got Conor but when is kind of gonna come back I think Rhonda might do to WWE thing John she's done I'm pretty sure I think the big thing is a good look I know she was at it like dinner with Triple H and our agent Slater so I hope she does that man cuz people can say whatever they want but Ronda Rousey was she was that girl at one point she was and she put us all on the map in a different way and had the old lady did the 75 year old lady at the airport talking about MMA so you know she she's a GG paid our do and I think if she wanna gracefully walk into a different realm WWE film I think she just produced some type of series that um you know we should support her on that I agree I agree 100% and I really don't want to see her fight again I would she wants to fight again but what if I would I would want to see is her move to a camp that could address the entire game of MMA in a much more comprehensive way and not tell her that she's great at something if she's I would want her to go to like Matt Hume or someone like that but who who is she actually fight she's not too big of a name buddy she's right fight someone who's coming up fight someone get a tuneup fight get an actual I mean but I don't even think she wants to fight I mean I think at a certain point in time you have enough money in the bank you have enough notoriety and fame she's got a lot of aspirations outside the sport she's married now who knows she might want to start a family you right right listen all I wanna see is George st. Pierre versus time with a July July I say that's my big prediction with UFC make it happen pretty sure big prediction for me is that I just hear my first fight back George my shoulder sore I can't even tie how do you sleep I can't punch out hard to sleep I mean George this is if you want to fight me brother this is a time at the time Jordan can't meet you right now make that money George and what a fight that would be in terms of like like just historical significance and and how big it would be yeah I mean he's coming off of the win of his career coming back four years off beats Bisping chokes him unconscious for the title yeah vacates the title steps right in their fights you at 170 he's a G it'll be fun he would exit the sport nobody would give him that much stuff I'm losing to me thanks for doing this man I appreciate it I'm glad we finally got in here did it tell people with your Twitter handle check me out on Twitter TW ooo dld wide sam dingle instagram and yeah we are here the champ ladies and gentlemen Bobo thank you [Music]
