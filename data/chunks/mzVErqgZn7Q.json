this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is one of the episodes that we filmed during the sci-fi program Joe Rogan questions everything it is brought to you by ting ting is a cell phone company that gives you cell phone service that makes sense for you they allow you to cancel at any time they don't have contracts they use the Sprint backbone so you're getting dependable reliable excellent cell phone service but you're getting it in a way that you probably wouldn't get from a big company like for instance if you don't use all of your minutes if you use less minutes than you thought you would ting will actually knock you down to the lower level and then credit you the difference on your next bill that shit is unheard of no company does that and I think that's an awesome way to do business they're not trying to rob you they're just trying to sell you something that's really good and it's an excellent exchange an even exchange you give them money they give you good cell phone service at a reasonable price ting has on their website a lot of examples that people have sent to them about how much money they have saved by using ting but I can tell you personally I have spoken to many people on Twitter and social media that have sent me a thank-you saying that ting save them a ton of money and it gave them excellent service with really high-end cell phone devices they use the Android phones and they have all sorts of other different kind of phones as well but the high-end Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy s4 the HTC One all the really top-end nice devices that you can get I recently just got a one of these Galaxy Note 3's is a fucking ridiculous phone it might be too big I don't know if I'm going to keep it but right now I got it and I am very impressed with the Android operating system I haven't fucked with this in a long time I got one a long time ago like maybe three years ago or something like that and it was like a drunk iPhone it was such a hunk of shit but boy have they caught up in a big way in this Green is magical anyway I'm waxing poetically about my new phone what I'm telling you is that ting will save you money give you awesome cell phone coverage and make you feel good that you're connected to a reliable but but ethical company that's not trying to fucking rip you off so go to Rogan ting calm and save yourself $25 either off service or device it's your choice and enjoy and I guarantee you if you're looking for some cheaper but yet excellent cell phone service it doesn't make you feel like you're getting fucked over ting is the way to go that's the new song tune is the way to go Rogan tang calm go get your freak on before this podcast airs I just want to say thank you to the fine folks at sci-fi and Arthur Smith the production company that made my show Joe Rogan questions everything thank you to Tim and Wayne from sci-fi also for allowing us to put this on the air as a podcast one of the things that we did when we were filming the show is we wanted to incorporate the podcast into the show because first of all it's the best method that I know of for discussing an issue there's one one of the things that I found about the show that was kind of awkward I really enjoyed doing the show I really enjoyed the opportunity to explore all these different topics it didn't come out perfect there's a lot of things that I want wasn't happy with but that's all just a part of the growing pains of creating a show um but one thing that I did find is that having conversations in front of people standing up in weird circumstances like in a hallway or you know in a laboratory or whatever the many many different scenarios that we had conversations on the show is very awkward the best way to have a conversation is on a podcast sitting down across each other in a comfortable chair in front of a big oak desk where you're relaxed you feel confident you're comfortable rather you feel comfortable you feel it's quiet the room is you know it's it's it's a fun place to be it feels good there's this good energy here and we control that for the most part by having it in Podcast form and my favorite aspects of the show were actually duncan and myself talking to these people on the podcast and it was kind of a revelation in a lot of ways it's like my favorite part of doing this show is the stuff that I was already doing before I was doing the show but I want to thank thanks i-5 for allowing us to do it that way because it really came out great um those parts of it and so now you're going to get the full unedited podcast this first one is from the Bigfoot episode and it's dr. Jeffrey Meldrum dr. Jeff Meldrum is in my opinion the most credible of all the Bigfoot believers I shouldn't say the most credible because maybe there's some out there they're just as credible that I haven't met he's the most reasonable guy that I communicated with and I really respect him for his first of all is stepping out and saying that he really thinks this is a big real undiscovered primate living in the Pacific Northwest which takes a lot of balls for someone who's a legit professor you know because people immediately think you're fucking crazy if you tell them there's a unknown monkey living in the woods he doesn't just do that he does that from an academic point of view he's a very very bright guy and he also does that as an expert in human movement and I found his theories on the Sasquatch combined with this knowledge that he has about human movement to be very fascinating and his analysis of footprints and what what's unique about these footprints and why it mimics actual real real primates and not human beings in fact I thought it was also incredibly fascinating he's a brilliant guy and a very nice guy and I appreciate very much that he took the time out of his busy schedule to come on the show so enjoy this is dr. Jeff Meldrum and once again thanks to everybody involved in the show everybody from the cameraman on down was a amazing cool place to work for a few months so big kiss to you all and now enjoy a podcast with powerful Duncan Trussell and dr. Jeffrey Meldrum the Joe Rogan experience train my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night all day tell me we're ready dr. Meldrum first of all thank you very much for coming here and talking to us about all things Squatch Duncan and I are very excited about this how many years first of all have you been involved in this were you in that leonard nimoy in search of Bigfoot show no that predated me that predated you okay that's the og of Bigfoot shows right yeah I remember seeing that when I was a kid and being so convinced and excited that there was a big hairy man living in the woods obviously back then I didn't realize that it could be a species it wasn't just like one individual dude but a whole species and I've been fascinated by it since I was a little child I don't know why I don't know what it what is it about Bigfoot maybe you could tell us what is it about Bigfoot that speaks to man either there are different levels I mean there's the just simply the mystery something that's undiscovered unresolved I think there's an added mystique because it's so human-like I mean that's been an icon an archetype of the human experience since the beginning of history some of the earliest heroes hung out with wild men whether it was Beowulf and Grendel or Gilgamesh and Inca do you know there there were these denizens of the forest that maybe represented our are sort of lost connection to wilderness into wild places do you think there's a certain amount of arrogance and assuming that we have full detail the entire fossil record of primates when you know you see things like homo florensis the hobbit man in Rhodesia and the evidence of Gigantopithecus which is only you know the 1920s they found that right yeah this is this is the thing that it really is placing Sasquatch in a very different context the one that I keep pushing because I can see this unfolding with every new discovery of a hominid like Homo floresiensis the tree of hominid radiation gets bushier and Bush here and then discovery after discovery shows that some of these lineages have persisted to much more recent times in the past and has ever been previously so you know Homo floresiensis 13,000 years old a new Neanderthal site maybe ten thousand years old really yeah and so the the notion that we're the only hominid on the planet contrary to all experience in the past when there were multiple hominids coexisting on the landscape may be a real misnomer a real misrepresentation of fact and these relic hominids may be the rule rather than the exception it's it's a real tricky subject the Bigfoot Sasquatch subject I have brought it up with people that I love and respect and they had mocked me right in front of my face join my friend Dana Dana White Dana White mocked me the other night dinner right in front of my face for believing in me I tell you I was pretty disappointed when I heard you were going looking for Bigfoot I was like how dare you sir what do you know about Bigfoot man it's one of those things Bigfoot is like ghosts or flying saucers or crop circles it lumps you in a weirdo category it is right there but that's because there is a lot of weirdos that believe in Bigfoot that's right you must know that I'm sure you probably experience more lunatics than psychiatrists do and that's what that's what warns off a lot of my colleagues is they don't want to navigate try to navigate that morass of of the lunatic fringe so you don't have the luxury of just simply going out and collecting data you have to winnow through all this chaff to find find the kernel and it's very I'm sorry it's very it's like when they lump you in like it's a stain it really is a stain on your career and credentials they could say oh he's that Bigfoot guy absolutely well there was a moment as I was sitting here contemplating these footprints that sort of pulled me into this subject when I I was familiar with Grover Krantz I knew the grief that he'd suffered at the hands of his colleagues because of his pursuit of this subject you know in his career stalling his career and I contemplated for a moment do I really want to go down that road or not but how could you not when you have 3545 fresh footprints laid out in front of you that are so clear so compelling so persuasive I for me that's what science is about it's going after those interesting even if they're anomalous data points what was it that got you started on this well it was that I mean I could go clear back to my childhood when I was born and in the Pacific Northwest and knew of Bigfoot knew of Roger Patterson in his film he came to Spokane where I lived as a as a youngster and showed his documentary showcasing that that film clip but my academic interest began in 1996 when I was shown a very the same line of tracks I just referred to in the blue mountains outside of Walla Walla and I tell you that the hook was set is there ever been a moment we stepped back and said hang on am I wasting my time on some hooey sure oh sure is there a lot of hooey involved in this subject there is yeah you got to get past that but I tell you what I have seen what I've experienced firsthand be it you know finding tracks in very remote areas myself hearing vocalizations having rocks thrown at me and what have you tell us about your experiences you've seen tracks where there's no people at deep in the woods yeah on several occasions well one one was in connection with a kind of an interesting in or impossible interaction we never actually saw something or anything but when you eliminate you know when you eliminate the the likely scenarios then the unlikely is what you're left with and in this case we had we were in the Siskiyou wilderness of Northern California one of the first expeditions of sorts that I participated in it we'd gone off from our base camp quite some distance off trail to investigate some lakes we we thought might have been shrunken up in the in the in the heat and exposing mud flats for more tracking opportunities we did find a set of tracks in on a dusty stretch of the trail you know if you've ever been out to camping you get up early early in the and the the dust of a campsite is still moistened with the dew and you step out of your tent and everything sticks to your foot those were the kind of footprints that we found on the trail one morning they were just as clear as could be something with that 16 inch foot five toes had stepped in at that do ladened dust and it just lifted up a perfect outline of a footprint now as a Bigfoot freak yeah what was that like for you this is all your first piece of evidence you're stumbling upon it yourself that's right yeah well it was freaking out no no I mean it was it was coming out I'm not even there yeah me too well at that but by that time with yeah there were moments we'd been in the woods already for over four weeks and so we had kind of gotten to the point you know you have to sort of steel yourself against that natural fear reaction to those circumstances but I think this is a something that a lot of Bigfoot hunters assume which is that Bigfoot is sweet or Bigfoot's this harmless being that's out there picking flowers and printing his footprints in the do this could be a killer this thing could be a deadly angry tired bitter old jungle ape aren't you worried the in your quest for Bigfoot you actually might find him well find one of them too you know let's make it clear there's more than one yeah this is not one lone monster romanette right yeah but but above you man but your but your points will take in I mean clearly this this if it exists is a large powerful potentially dangerous animal should be shown deference but I mean if they were killers like grizzly bears they would have been hunted to extinction just like Grizzlies were in the lower 48 for quite period of time there really isn't I mean the only stories you hear about antagonistic behavior towards humans is usually precipitated when the humans have shot at them they've started the quarrel but otherwise they seem to be you know it's just like with with gorillas you know gorillas were billed by Barnum and Bailey is the most terrifying creature on the face of the planet but now we're they current they're considered the gentle giants you know the the victor of the endangered imperiled tropical forests the the predatory primates are the ones that are most dangerous right like chimpanzees are more dangerous than gorillas because they're predatory true yeah you know this apparently but the lore is what people believe at least is that if Sasquatch is a real thing it eats animals and it probably eats elk and it probably follows elk migrations yeah so there is always that risk I mean you know anyone who's going out in the woods should should use to do caution yeah I mean people eat people sure exactly do you pack heat do you pack heat it depends on the subsets or not not he's a doctor dude he carries a gun how dare you he's about to say pack seat oh sure know it when we're in the field I mean we're in areas where there were there grizzly bears where there's cougar in Northern California they've got lots of issues with with Cougars preying on or attacking people oh yeah Cougars are personal security sometimes the Cougars I know Joe pepper spray to pepper spray and a thick jacket those Cougars you want you want some a lot of protection I prefer ten millimeters so dad - son I'm get some Kevlar maybe a sword well what a predicament you're putting yourself in because let's say you do run into a tribe of these things and they've they're smart enough to know that they can't be discovered you've got to decide between not getting ripped to shreds by these Bigfoot or blasting them into oblivion sure why do you pick well that's a good question I mean it's a I hate to speculate too much on a what-if scenario I I don't think that they're in tribal social organizations or that they are that intelligent I mean I think we're we're dealing with you know at least a large primate a large ape and at most a very early offshoot of the hominid radiation that you know has intelligence that's not much higher than that of a chimp or gorilla I just have no experience to back up anything beyond that if I could let you pick a toe any toe when we hack that sucker off and then immediately take you to Bigfoot my cameras crew whole deal you get to see Sasquatch a whole Sasquatch family yeah do you accept that do you hack off a toe to meet Sasquatch and know for sure I could probably get by without a pinkie oh my goodness you got bad sir I'm ready to chop off toes I'll chop off my toe throw my pinky into the palm would you really absolutely I love my pinkies I'm not gonna do that what's it for what is it what does it do what is a pinkie it helps you move around your freak I wouldn't know it barely yeah but two Wiggles to the left when it pushes off it helps you stay below the pinky toe yes therefore easier Leah Vienna sausage okay maybe yours mine's very active it's hard too hard to put that little nail you know let's have to race it anymore oh my goodness you guys are both sick how dare you okay well it's tempting though you would transform human history with this video I want my toes dude discussion over self it not chopping but it's a little it's a valid question because I mean a guy like you who's been studying this for how many decades now nearly two decades yeah nearly two decades think about all that time and effort just see it yeah I'm there but it's been a great ride I mean write what you know I've got to see places on this planet and see some of the most beautiful landscapes and terrains and meet all kinds of interesting people so it's been been an interesting experience yeah as we talked to one Sasquatch hunter what he said was that even if he doesn't find Sasquatch she's still camping go join him exactly I always tell people you know cultivate an appreciation for Natural History enjoying the outdoors because it's like me with fishing if I don't catch a fish in the first five minutes I'll start to lose interest pretty soon and if you're that way chances of you catching a fish or having a Sasquatch experience in the first weekend you go out to pretty slim so enjoy what you're doing you mentioned that these creatures throw rocks hmm how big are the rocks at they say well in my experience when we were there in the SIS cues we had it was about a softball sized rock I mean if you wanted to coldcock me it could've probably but I think it was more of a I got the impression it was just letting me know that we were close and I got the sensation in fact that we had stopped to take a break at a spot that was on one of the pathways that they follow it was where we had found that the footprint the first the first go sitting at Sisk use the Cissy use in North in Northern California Six Rivers National Forest and Siskiyou wilderness so the the primary theory when it comes what's my so is the primary theory about sasquatch is that it was something along the lines of a Gigantopithecus that was in Asia came down the Bering Strait with humans and that's why there's so many of inhabiting the dense rainforest of the Pacific Northwest that had just found it to be ideal habitat so just stayed there yeah that's that's one model I mean in Gigantopithecus you have a primate that's the right size in the right place at the right time to have expanded its range over the Bering Land Bridge and and there were times when that land bridge was a corridor of forests not not an Arctic tundra so it wasn't like they were migrating they were just expanding the range of each generation would expand into the available so from Asia all the way north america was forests at one point ten times yeah off and on it wasn't always ice-locked and so and that would have proceeded probably the time that humans came so they were probably here before Native Americans or Paleo Indians arrived in North America there's a lot of speculation as to how intelligent it is you seem to think it's very ape-like but I've talked to other folks who think it's almost a human right but it's like something in between us and a chimpanzee yeah well a lot of those people who attribute you know primal people or some kind of primitive human often also attribute various paranormal qualities they're in psychic communication they're being taught by them you know this ancient wisdom and etc and you know I don't have any personal experience upon which to evaluate those kinds of subjective I'm very respectful of you that was so scientific that was a nice way to say they're fucking crazy scientists cause you a lunatic so yeah it is a weird thing isn't it that it falls into that crystals channeling energy thing often times in which gives me agita I got to get out of the room when someone starts talking energy and crystals I really am allergic to it like we had it yesterday someone started talking about the energy and a safe zone safe space I was like I gotta get out of here it's like immediately I feel like I'm threatened my sanity is threatened I might get sucked in your stupid vortex welcome one of you why is that why why do you think Bigfoot is a loon magnet do you think it's because when you have people searching up for other things like butterflies that they theorize that might exist or other undiscovered species they haven't gone completely mad but for some reason a lot of these Bigfoot hunters it seems like they've lost their mind in this pursuit why do you think that is well I think part of it is that when when Bigfoot sort of fell into the lap of academia back in well it was coincident with the Patterson Gimlin film essentially that's when it was thrust under the nose of science the scientific community before that it was just a bunch of you know loggers stories and foresters stories coming out of the northern woods of British Columbia or Northern California which was still really wild back then it it came at a time that preceded a lot of what we understand now about early human evolution and great ape natural history and it was just there was no place to put it there was no pigeonhole to stick this in and so it was rejected by the scientific community and then that vacuum came the amateur fortune seekers or enthusiasts or you know those that thought it was left here by a UFO or traveling through interdimensional portals or any type of explanation as to why we aren't finding them what makes them different from other common wild life I think what it is is that there's there's first of all I think there's two different types of people they get attracted to like really following up on Sasquatch and one of them is balloons one of them is the people that if it wasn't if they weren't looking for Sasquatch they would be looking to remote view or they'd be looking to find out the cause of chemtrails or the they would just thought they would find some mystery and lock onto it the other one is courageous people who aren't afraid of looking like because like yourself I think you look at it you're obviously a very intelligent man you you or you're an anthropologist your professor you know you know what you're talking about you look at this and you go you know what um I don't think I can dismiss this you know what I think there might be something here right right even though it sounds crazy to say it I'm sorry guys this is why there might be something here that's right what is it what's the most compelling piece of evidence if you were trying to convince a person if a person was on the fence and they were like well she's talked to Meldrum I don't know I mean you seem like a normal guy um really Bigfoot like tell me in in a paragraph what's the most compelling piece of evidence well for me again from my point of expertise it's the footprint evidence that's what drew me into this because my study of the evolution of human bipedalism prepared me I guess you'd say I mean why wouldn't I be fascinated by the possibility that there's another biped out there I mean it's a perfect natural experiment to against wish to compare and contrast our own adaptation for walking on two legs which is otherwise considered to be unique amongst primates and so was Gigantopithecus thought to be bipedal or is it well debate it's in debate Grover Krantz made some arguments based on the shape of the jaw given the breadth the angle of the jaw that's supposed to be a Gigantopithecus that is that's one of the two of the examples of the largest species of Gigantopithecus blackie how we yeah and like it would hurt if it big yeah yeah well yeah those are massive massive molars ahead then like about that yeah absolutely call that thing Blackie oh yeah Gigantopithecus Blackie yeah I was the discoverer okay how rude yeah that's what he said yes what that's his name well the the thought is that they look more orangutan like than gorillas I correct well again speculation is speculation because they're found in Asia they're part of what we call the Shiva petha scene radiation the thick enameled Apes of which orangutan is the only relic species in existence today but again there's no way to know I mean gorillas and chimps are closely related and yet their skulls look quite different from one another waise so the footprint evidence is in your opinion the best evidence right and the this one that we have we both have the same one what is uh the origin of this footprint this was cast by a deputy sheriff by the name of Dennis Harford in the 80s in Grays Harbor County Washington State so over at the base of the Olympic Peninsula and he was responding to a report of a disturbance at a construction site and there on that that spur road hard packed dirt with a layer of fine pulverized dust from the movements of the heavy machinery went down by a rain left this remarkably clear imprint the these are actually desiccation cracks where that wet mud was beginning to dry in the Sun and shrink and crack but the extrusion of the mud around the footprint and between the toes and all left a very very striking facsimile of that foot it seems so uniform that's where I start to get spelled skeptical again it's the remarkable conditions when you know there were photographs of a number of footprints at that site including some interesting what I refer to as half-tracks that that terminate I mean the the details on here remarkable you can see what looks like the head in the base of the fifth metatarsal maybe a little bit of arthritis or some kind of injury to the joints there this bulge right here then is the key though that that you have on the side of your foot if you left a wet footprint on the cement when you came out of the pool you'd see that bulge and it's at the it's positioned at the what we call the calcaneal cuboid joint which is right there now in Apes the these two joints across here are much more flexible they're adapted to climbing trees if this were a chimpanzee it would look more like this and when they're grasping that branch then you have to be able to lever the foot without disrupting the grip we've changed that altogether by relinquishing that grip and incorporating the big toe into one stiff lever like this so the whole foot acts as a as a mechanical lever but there's moves here remarkably Sasquatch foot appears to have retained that that ape-like degree of flexibility which is actually pretty elegant adaptation to climbing on very steep rugged mountainous terrain hmm what would be the evolutionary benefit of keeping of a human-like foot as opposed to like a gorilla or a chimp where they can grab and climb with their feet well when you're 800 pounds it's kind of dangerous to climb up into trees besides what what would you look for up there that we don't have fruiting trees in the coniferous forests the the fruit element of your diet is in the understory the berries in the in the shrub layer so I've only I've heard a couple people say they climb trees you think that's hooey well it's probably juveniles maybe too you know putting a youngster up in a tree in order to get it away from potential predators if you're parking it there while you log it while you're off foraging for example but no I don't think I mean just as large male gorillas don't spend much time climbing up in the trees because a fall even you know even for humans a fall from ten feet can be fatal if you're experienced rock climber yeah it seems like if you wanted to fake that you would have to have a very advanced understanding of gorillas from if you were going to draw that thing and spend the time doing it you'd have to have a deep understanding of or you're really shitty and making a fake foot and you just got lucky incorporated something that looks remarkably similar to that metatarsal break I don't know that's a pretty that's good luck I would never throw an accidental metal metatarsal break that's not what it is metatarsal Records I mix it up no that's right yeah how are you gonna accidentally draw a metatarsal break but where where his calluses what it seems like his feet are kind of shaved down or fanic you beautiful it's like he could go to the beach right now you could go and lay out and people would think he had great feet well again the the conditions of that particular footprint were just really quite remarkable making a very clear imprint but you know there it's it's indicated that the the sole pad is probably pretty substantial and pretty thick we have some examples of them where they've stepped on rocks or stepped on other obstructions in that sole pad that substantial slope that is able to accommodate those intrusions quite quite remarkably but it's it's the composite you know if you take one example and you look at it you can dissect it and criticize it and and pick it apart and question it but when then you see you know as you point out repeated appearances not only showing for example the mid tarsal break but but these correlated half-tracks that where they're running I mean when we run because of our stiff arch we if we're sprinting not having a not exhibiting the heel strike will leave just an abbreviated footprint because we're up on the ball of our foot since their foots flexible when they run they run like this and it imprints the entire four part of the foot so in other words if this individual were running it's running track would look like that and again so that's the question I've often asked if this is if this is all just spurious convergences of you know would be hoaxers who's passing out the little black book giving instructions on how to fake how mark oblique insistence how uniform is that it's a remarkable system remarkably out example after example after example I mean to the point that I took the took the leap of intellectual faith if you will of naming the footprints there's a convention of taxonomy called ik no taxonomy that applies Linnaean classification schemes to trace evidence like footprints where the maker of the footprint is unknown and so we can now call these footprints a published peer-reviewed name anthropoid apes' Ameri borealis which is North American eight-foot hmm and Wow how silly would that be if it's all fake though a hole would be very low sounding Latin name it's going to be hard to prove that something doesn't exist though I guess so but that's not what science is all about writes but no it's not proving that things will exist based on having a stun the evidence and that's it it's based on a diagnosis that that of distinguishing characteristics these are not just fact similes of enlarged human footprints like like this example you know this is actually pretty large this would represent an individual with a foot that's probably in the upper one of the human population have you ever seen skill Anil shoe no I haven't I've always wanted I got a photo I got to remember to get it to guys it's a picture of me my face next to Shaquille O'Neal's shoe it's bigger than my entire head yeah huge I'm not kidding it's bigger than this yep she totally totally bigger than this so Shaquille O'Neal if he wanted to could be the greatest but hopes are yes Bigfoot you could I mean if he went wandering through the woods he's seven feet tall he's more than 300 pounds yeah he's just slapped some fur on him but it's foot have the same kind of bend no it wouldn't that's the thing even even as as large as his foot is and it's not it would probably not be and I don't have his metrics to say this with the certitude but I would predict that his foot is not as wide as as this imprint most likely yeah mostly doesn't have the mid tarsal but it doesn't have evidence of that you bet yeah they probably got on from the league I don't know a lot of sasquatches because if they ever did catch sasquatches and then they found out that sasquatches were people very similar to Neanderthals and they wanted to start playing football we'd have real problem we would real probably the problem being accepted football would be interesting for once they'd start banging all the white chicks first of all yeah what they'll be a huge problem you're gonna have Sasquatch hybrids great the giant nine-foot people I'll take them sasquatches won't want to enter into the UFC we'd have to make new weight classes everything gets better if you had a sasquatch I don't care what it is they start showing up for set now gorillas are fairly intelligent chimpanzees are intelligent dolphins are very intelligent we have zero problem locking them up in swimming pools so if we did find a Sasquatch do you think because of the bipedal nature of it we there would it would probably some pretty intense debate as to what to do with this thing well our humanity isn't defined by any one characteristic like bipedalism or opposable thumbs or you know a non divergent big toe I mean it's it's a composite of a number of characteristics and so we're beginning to understand that bipedalism was a characteristic of many different species of a very early hominid and even some non hominid eight species so um you don't think that it would be like people go like it's a man he's standing up straight we can't put him in the zoo well I'm sure there'll be something we'll say that what do you think they would do what is your honest opinion would they detain him well they have to like let a hangout to him for a little while see if we could figure out his language or what if it's like killer whale like you just never figure out their language like you know they're smart be like I don't know what you're saying do I eventually just let them loose well sure there will be all kinds of ethical questions if we come to that point and and what the outcome will be you know it's really hard to predict and because then you're not only dealing with the characteristics but you're dealing with human reaction human attitudes political agendas whatever yeah I'm sorry too what if you to death because of what Duncan denied you all day yeah I think that's an important question I think I think when you're out there looking for this thing you do have to consider that your discovery of the thing might be the worst thing that ever happened to sasquatch away you're his enemy yeah well you know that's been then been suggested to me brought up numerous times by various various people I you know and might one of my responses is simply the the formal recognition the discovery of the species is it suddenly going to make it easy to go out and shoot a sasquatch or to catch a sasquatch it's not going to change much at all you know there's a study underway now to examine extract and examine DNA from from hair samples attributed sasquatch if if that researcher dr. Brian Sykes from Oxford if he discovers a novel sequence that confirms that there's a species out there we don't recognize it's not going to change that situation we still won't know anything else about them DNA will only tell us so much may tell us about where it fits in the family tree but not what it does on a daily basis or alright how intelligent it is or what if I'm the president okay and I come to you and I'm like dr. Meldrum enough is enough we need answers we need a Sasquatch research team head up by you sir will you accept this position and you have unlimited resources to go find Sasquatch what's your plan what we've actually got an initiative thank you for the segue there it's entitled the Falcon project and this is gonna confuse people they're going to think you're looking for birds well when I called the Bigfoot project bad why does it have to be funded that's just badass badass how can we how can project sounds like it's a comic book thing oh yeah there's a cuddly well the the the person who is the originator of this notion he picked that he tells me just because Falcons fly high and see far and I premise of this approach is to use lighter than air ships helium-filled dirigible so an unmanned drone none but with the capability of hovering you know and and and going doing a grid search pattern using state-of-the-art thermal imaging and high-resolution videography survey that way why a blimp though I a balloon aside from the fact that it's incredible and I can't think of anything more psychedelic than to release a balloon into the forest to look for Bigfoot what Zeppelin music playing for me that's a time project Falcon so that would be the move balloons I think this is a novel not not an entirely novel these techniques are being used in wildlife survey studies already I mean there there are companies that have popped up that that provide this service to government agencies you know fishing game and so forth it's just the combination with this particular type of an airship but I think it's the way to get at the daily behaviors and ranging patterns and so forth of these creatures on the ground you're looking for that proverbial moving needle in the haystack we're going to obviously combine the effort with ground insertion teams that will attempt to follow up to find trace and physical evidence and how many people do you need I'm the president remember yeah unlimited budget not that many we Lenny let's see a half-dozen could do it we're going to need to take all these people away from the DEA and give them real jobs and this is a move take the people from the DEA and put them in the beh now the primal people though we may have the problems with the Bigfoot enforcement rights and so forth if they are people there right that does become an issue eugen yeah well there's people that have said they've shot them and then of course now they've passed laws saying in certain states it's actually illegal to shoot a sasquatch it is yeah not on all 50 right no it's usually by county so Vanek county where I come from we have a safe-haven traffic watch yeah Wow now if someone did shoot a sasquatch in your County what's the what's the penalties like a parking ticket you go to jail they were kind of vague on that yeah what the penalty actually was I guess we have to see you know that raises the question of their status right they're humans non-human or human right why have there been no bodies why have there been no skulls or why has there been no hair why why have there been lots of hair yeah but none of it like substantiated as in fact by way of DNA is not a human by way of morphology we've got hair that can't be attributed in any commonly known wildlife that has consistent morphological characteristics one of which is a hollow or a cellular medulla the central core which makes getting DNA from a hair that simply shed that doesn't have an actively dividing follicle very difficult very challenging but it was proven to be the actual real hair oh yes definitely absolutely so where it's an unknown animals hair right do you know whether what kind of animal is that known primate like primate well definitely well be in the sense that non-primate mammals fur bearing mammals of North America have have fur rather than simply hair that means they have guard hairs these long course tapering guard hairs that provide mechanical protection and then the underlying that differentiated layer of insulating here very fine under fur that's like down yes exactly yeah like down on a bird bird have they have down and flight feathers in mammals it's guard hairs and and under fur primates though don't have that differentiation they have hair that's kind of like a modified guard hair but it Sun tapered it's long parallel tips worn tips no sign of ever been having been cut trimmed yeah with a Flowbee that's it so that squads what flow we got nodes what color is there it ranges we have and it correlates with the reported colors of sasquatches seen by eyewitnesses from almost white chocolate they have almost why is it the Yeti or actual sasquatch almost white well SAS we're still talking about sasquatch so there have been white Sasquatch described by witnesses yeah rare but that never less seen d all the way to black the DNA on the hair comes up with nothing well it's difficult to get DNA because there's you know the way hair is constructed that you have a cuticle and then you have a layer called the cortex and then a central core and in if that core or medulla has cells stacked up in it then that's usually where the DNA is extracted from in animals that don't have a medulla present a cellular medulla then you have very little nuclear material of the cell left in that in that shaft in that keratin shaft and so getting any DNA in order to sequence it is almost impossible what are the party-poopers say that that hair is well they don't they say they say there's no evidence you know that one way or the other so it's basically you've got this hair that hasn't been identified but you know identifying hairs kind of more art than science because even on our bodies we have hair that differs in appearance head hair beard hair eyelashes more iers exactly pure q how to bring that up mole hairs um so it's different yeah it's definitely different yeah um yeah in the inside nose hairs fucking those all about huh those are ridiculous eyelashes forgot yeah eyebrows no one's gonna fit here's another thing in the same way that I can't imagine someone taking the time to fake those footprints no one's gonna go through the woods with a bag of weird hair and scatter it through the fourth no but you might pretend you found it you don't have to go scatter it if you're right any you found it yourself but there's a lot of people go full of poop right we know that you know that I know that and this this jekt particularly attracts a lot of them i'm sure you're aware of the gentleman in montana recently that was killed yeah this hilarious but not hilarious cause poor fellow's just trying to hook somebody you had a Bigfoot suit on got hit by one car driven by a 17 year old girl and then run over by another car driven by a 16 year old girl he's an asshole he's trying to scare kids you know well that could cause it wreck anyway well yeah look I have a 16 year old daughter if he gets she got scared by an asshole a fake Bigfoot suit and got into a wreck I'd be pissed yeah sir so the world got a little lighter as Bill Hicks would say we lost some more on the this this phenomenon for whatever reason is well I guess it's a bunch of reasons why people would want to hoax it first of all notoriety second of all because it's fun and third of all because it's so similar to us it's not like trying to if we tried to hook the Loch Ness monster that would be a pain in the ass yeah but uh you know you're a fairly big guy we'll put you in a big monkey suit put you at a distance you know have you wandering around you know long as there's nothing we could lineup for perspective you look a little you know we can get it off oh sure off oh yeah I there's lots of misidentifications I mean that's one of the problems of vie witness testimony is you're not only at the mercy of the witness's credibility but but honestly even if there's sincere and genuine and what they think they saw your you have to evaluate their ability to evaluate their experience to interpret what they yeah my memories poop my memories gets worse all the time shoo and especially because since we started doing the podcast and you know just having all this information like rattled at me every day and dealing have these long form three-hour conversations I don't remember who I said what with or when and I confuse stories sure and you know what also and I don't know if there's any statistics for it but I heard that there's a statistic that 40% of the people at Disneyland or on ecstasy at any given time I heard that's like a statistic like the number of people on psychedelics they're in the same way in the forest it's funny she does Oh many people camping or hi what's the percentage because I think it's 90% of the people who go camping or hi and I don't think that this discounts the fact that there's Bigfoot but I would say that most of the people who see Bigfoot if they're out in the woods they're probably stoned on top of it it's possible that they are but I think another issue is that you may only be able to contact Bigfoot when you're high I maybe that's it maybe it's that because of our weapon we need to get on some mushroom up son the Pacific Northwest is overflowing with psilocybin mushrooms I mean they're everywhere right it's so rainy up there it's just like Pirtle perfect fertile ground for them and a lot of people go up there to to gather those things now if you were up there and you were gathering those things maybe that puts your mind into a certain frequency yeah when Bigfoot's like I know this guy's tripping let's go fuck with them yeah and then Bigfoot chosen self hey dude plus those mushroom pickers are pretty territorial so maybe they're just making up the stories to scare off the competition are they really know very mush room people would be the least territorial no there that's big how do you know sir I'm scared I've run into a lot of monikers run into him yeah yeah Azen called them hey meet me here with a bag I've run into you and you've run into my chat my cache I wonder if Bigfoot eats those mushrooms I want course he does why wouldn't he's smart the craziest trip is tripping with the club being Bigfoot Oh mushrooms yeah yeah tripping with Bigfoot is definitely a great kids but I wonder if Bigfoot is pissed at all the wolves killing the elk love like serious issues with Wolves killing elk and deer now because they reintroduced the they took a Canada wolf which is a larger version the gray wolf and introduced them to Idaho and all these different areas now they're having a problem these things are running rampant there's thousands of them they're just in massive packs killing things they just opened a season in Idaho on wolves that that disturbs the shit out of people yeah and that's just a wolf in speak I see it as you know as a dog I got to say I think that you are a courageous person because you seem very level-headed you seem completely logical and rational with all this stuff and I think it must take an a lot of patience to constantly end up in interviews with stoners asking you Bigfoot eats mushrooms yeah yeah well there's a lighter side I've got I've got a notebook with all the all the lighter stories that I'll publish one day all right now here's something that you said you'll be a doctor unfortunately disturbs me here's something he said that unfortunately destroyed ultimately and that is you talked about the Patterson footage as if it wasn't BS that Patterson footage to me looks like a blurry video of a dude in a monkey suit well if it looks that blurry to you then you haven't seen the best renditions the best copies of Islam are they online there's one there's one that's online what's the best one well I'm not sure I can call it off top my head but a producer of the show just looked at me like oh no here we go yeah because he knows I got a thing for the Patterson footage well one of the things he looked fine I got a lot of good stuff already one of the things that's interesting is every time the film is assailed by a critic or a pretender to be the man in in the suit such as Bob or Ottomans right the you know it seems that new technologies have become available in the intervening period and and they're applied one of those was the was digital imagery by scanning that film digitally the the image could be the color could be channel split we know that the the lens that was used was not corrected for chromatic aberrations so different colors refracting different instrumentally through that lens well you sure talk a good game mr. somatic aberrations what are you when you split you know just well as Papa mushroom and you'll understand what I'm talking about are these okay rainbow colors we split the colors we can subtract away the least clear channels and just limit the image to the sharpest imagery and boy I tell you you see that image as you've never seen it before and there are details I've you know I'm working right now with a gentleman who is a former Hollywood makeup artist and and a costume fabricator nobleman's he's also very good with with computer graphics with photogrammetry and we're doing some really interesting work on the film but you know when you stop and think about the materials that were available 1967 they didn't have four-way stretch for they just had fur cloth which when you make a costume out of it even a padded costume it looks like pajamas it doesn't look like a fitted a fitted costume it doesn't look real to me that bit that can walk like a gorilla it walks like somebody who's late for a meeting not only that there's there's not a girl here's the context there's something about human beings where when a human being is wearing a suit or you see a human being that's pretending to be something they're not it doesn't seem right they walk like a human you'll think that you see that thing walk that to me feels like a human being I've seen chimps walk on two legs I've seen gorillas I've seen primates move they move differently than people do they have a completely different anatomical structure they feel different when you watch them this feels like an asshole pretend to be Bigfoot well also here's a let me just play Bigfoot advocate here there is the possibility though I mean if you're if you're shooting a Bigfoot hoax video hmm you're gonna walk better than that this whoever did this is like it's like he's in between takes going to use the bathroom or something that well this is just a dude is it with Bob hieronymus the guy who it says it's him he just a guy was friends with Bob Patterson and we've already been over the fact that Patterson like wrote a bad check to pay for the very camera that did he's a shady character he wasn't exactly the salt of the earth and you're gonna do went looking I'm sorry but he went looking for Bigfoot and then found Bigfoot that sounds so ridiculous but if you're going to take the time to go on the forest with whatever that big suit is and to film yourself walking through the woods to make a hoax Bigfoot video you're gonna try to walk more like a gorilla or some supernatural thing the stride of that thing is so bad and seem so fake that it makes me believe that it's real mmm oh well I got baked one night at the ice house and I was convincing myself for twenty minutes I mind fuck myself and I completely convinced myself that it was real and then I woke up I'm like that's ridiculous that's a kind of monkey suit okay we'll get to that we'll go to that um but the this this film have you ever looked at it and thought it was fake hmm never well I mean I've questioned whether it was authentic or not but I never come to a conclusion that it must have been faked it's the holy grail of Bigfoot footage well yeah but that's not that's not the reason I that the Nam night but it yes oh sure it has set the bar I guess that's why I would rather look at it that it sets the bar as high as as it is for photographic evidence and anything that falls short of it since we're still debating it is certainly not going to tip the scale but if it was faked it would be devastating no no it wouldn't because we still have this dozens and dozens hundreds of footprints that fill my lab that that form the basis of my conclusion but I would think it would just be devastating just because people be of so upset they were claiming that it wasn't real oh it was real sure that would be ego wise that will be crusher especially to such a fringe belief anyway right sure sure but if all I had to go on what was the the correlated footprints were the correlated footprints from that film side that would be enough to convince me that it's authentic really the correlative filled footprints were very good well yeah this example that so is that one from Bluff Creek that is that so that's from the Patterson footage that is man that exhibits that whole mid tarsal break right you talk about that's right and and you can see that kinematic that action in the foot of the film subject so you know what it looks to me when I watch it looks like a guy walking with ice skates on you know when you have ice skates can't walk right well that's it well that's that's that effect of the compliancy of the gate they don't walk you know you said it doesn't look like a chimp it doesn't look like a gorilla and that's absolutely true because gorillas and chimps are quadrupeds they're not bipeds well I actually I said it looks like a person that's what I say I said when you watch a chimp move and you watch a gorilla move they like human beings this looks like a human being right and and that similarity is largely due to the fact that this is another biped that uses a mode of locomotion that's very similar but not identical to our own and one of those differences you pointed out with the ice skating is that effect of the compliant gait you know one of the things you notice often notice in many of these foot princes compared to a human there's not a real distinctive heel impression and a ball impression which is the result of our arched foot that concentrates pressure under those ends of the arch so we have a heel strike and a toe off when we walk this creature because of its great mass has to distribute its weight over a larger surface area so it walks more flat-footed without an arch and then you've got the action that mid tarsal break you can see here's the deepest part of the footprint right there and then the pressure ridge the pressure release that's pushed up behind it but in order to also reduce those reaction forces though that impact of the step it walks with a slightly bent ankle knee and hip and so instead of the head bobbing along like we walk when were walking briskly down you know the the sidewalk just moved exactly I've had eyewitnesses when when they saw they thought it was either levitating floating through the air one described it he said look like it was on a bicycle because its head was just moving horizontally through space as it was as it was walking so smoothly so that's it that's an interesting distinction but to my eye that's that confirms the credibility rather than refutes it that's interesting still looks like a dude in a monkey suit though well it doesn't it the first clients you know but when you start looking at things like you know you're a bodybuilder the attachment of the trip oh yes I am let you know the attachment of the trapezius on the back of the head you can see the traps come down to those massive shoulders you can see the definition of the deltoid or you see a dude who has football pads on inside of girls I don't know but I gotta tell you you have such a smooth voice in such an easy way of talking about this you could make me believe in leprechauns another horn you mean you don't now defend look it's it's easy to get me to but start believing mad I started looking at it over and over again I've been watching the video the entire time we're talking like maybe maybe man nobody would want it to be real more than me that's why I disturbs me that I think it's fake because man I would want that to be real so bad almost as much as you you first me like well what one of the interesting thing you know Rogers no longer here to defend himself but Bob Gimlin his partner is and Bob was kind of pulled in on this he was he was the friend who had the necessary horse trailer and equipment and so forth to make this kind of happen and he got pulled in he was interested he you know heard the stories that Roger told him and went out riding with him every now and again over by mount st. Helens and Mount Adams near than near where they lived in Yakima but they they had gone down there specifically because there had been footprints discovered a month earlier and a long line of tracks of three individuals a fifteen-inch which I'm convinced was her and then a 13 and a 11 inch which probably were or juvenile offspring of hers that were just in tow they'd been down there for two weeks already it's not like it just went down and two whole weeks Wow they put in the time they really deserve finding the first video footage ever of a giant ape-like man thing well it's dumb luck there's always a certain element of dumb law or or yeah of course you know you can play it off either side of it but you got a way that you know even if even if you dismiss it on the basis or if you hedge on the basis of those circumstantial evidences then you got to account for the film you know that was the year that Planet of the Apes came out now that was the state of the art in the industry for costumes that has never been repeated in the industry we quickly passed costumes and if we were going to do it now we do it with CGI no one would even tackle that with a costume all right let me play devil's advocate real quick even the really good footage let's be honest it's blurry if you went to see movie and it looked like that you would be pissed sure it'll look like shit movie are you making you can't even see what's going on it's all blurry the trees you can't see the leaves everything is like washed out it's very difficult to extinguish really really closely exactly what you're looking at well there's enough detail that that you can see the the you know the deep set eyes you can see the nose you can see the split of the mouth you can see the see something what about Bob hieronymus the guy who says that he was in the suit and the guy who when he walks looks like Bigfoot well he doesn't actually one interesting thing no he hasn't look anything like it his liver abortions are completely off right you know and is he not wearing a suit here's a funny little telltale hip telltale sign okay you notice that when he tries to imitate the Patterson film he walks like in Egyptian he turns his backhand back far there was a there was a frame from the Patterson film that was widely published sometime after it was actually a copy that was in the possession of Renee de Hindon and it had a little blemish on the copy that made it look like there was almost like a thumb and a four finger making an okay sign that made it look like that hand was turned back like this oh that's an artifact of the copy the hand is actually positioned like this the palm doesn't face backwards but hieronymus trying to exemplify trying to emulate the posture exaggerated s' this Egyptian hand posture based on that widely published publicized sounds to me like someone's got a little confirmation bias I don't look well this wants it to be real no no it's it's but it sounds that way because I'm throwing out things that are based on very exhaustive evaluation of the film the exhaustive evaluation of Bob Morano mrs. walk like an Egyptian hands no sure yeah about everything that he's allowed to be replicated or published in and I throw my pinky in with a doctor here please do I just want to say look here's the thing if I'm going out in the woods and I've got this futuristic Bigfoot suit and horses and a camera I'm gonna walk in a weirder way I'm not gonna walk that's you buddy right that me I would walk exactly like this guy in the monkey suit you would walk like that yeah I would never know number one about the head movement thing I wouldn't know that this was some kind of primordial thing so these people seem to have deeply studied it to make something seem so fake or it just walked straight and they filmed it all blurry and then we add all these things to her well yeah there's why is it exhibiting behavior that's so uncharacteristic of every other Sasquatch sighting every single Sasquatch sighting they're like in the middle of the woods they don't come out in the open don't stand there and when they walk why would they walk that way why would it go right back in the woods why is it walking diagonally well we live to give you a nice long view of itself as you got your camera it seems that what seemed staged well one there are several possibilities just just give you an apologetic okay first one is it's bullshit right first one looks here just bullshit but the other is that one of them is that first you have to know the lay of the land there and and we've been to the site we've surveyed the the line marks the trees the stumps and so forth this is a very deep canyon with very steep walls at that point there's a wide girth there because of the flood that essentially scoured out that that creek bed and left that very convenient if you will sandbar where those beautiful tracks could be laid down but it made a beeline up upstream some distance cross the creek and and once it was past that steep narrow it opened up a bit and that's where it immediately went up up to higher elevation one explanations that's been offered is that it was now remember I said that a month earlier there were actually three sets of tracks possibly two juveniles those aren't obvious here in in this footage and like I said I'm quite convinced that her tracks match those of the other 15 inch set of tracks so she's obviously a female if it's real and so she has some young in tow one behavior of of you know that exemplifies maternal instinct is that broken-winged syndrome where the mother walks off nonchalantly to lead the the intruders away from the sequestered offspring oh so the offspring are over here so she's like straight making them follow her get her offspring oh yeah that's a Google is not an odd thing to do in a place that's filled with predators and then you seeing two predators that's how they do it they would well you know what how much of a threat are humans you know and I would think they're a huge threat which is why sasquatches are hiding otherwise if they came down and got food from us we would feed him every day sure I mean I feed squirrels dude tell me I wouldn't feed a sasquatch Sasquatch showed up in the yard have they avoided trail cams well there are a lot of animals that are capable of avoiding trail cams I mean there's actually growing literature showing everything from you know coyotes Pacific especially other predators like fielitz that exhibit avoidance behavior whether it's electronic emissions whether it's light leakage whether it's scent whether it's just the novelty of something on that regular used trail that wasn't there the day before probably smells like yeah or something I had a I had a friend he's a wildlife biologist he's been working over in Southeast Asia and he said recently a BBC crew came over and they wanted to get images of elephants and they put out a teen trail cams the elephant's found and destroyed over half of them Wow so elephants are very small exactly kind of strange how smart they are exactly so so you know problem locking them up mate well yeah again but it's a it's a question in part of rarity of solidarity and intelligence and behavior and so on you know you know isn't it possible that this creature has evolved the ability to hide that's it wait let me ask that again isn't it possible that this creature has evolved beyond other beings when it comes to the ability to hide maybe whatever this is is super advanced in camouflaging itself in a way that we've never seen well it's possible I I don't think that you we really have to resort to extraordinary explanations for it hiding I mean other animals are very capable of remaining undetected it's just a matter of odds I mean how many times when you have gone out or you know people I just drove through Yellowstone you know and got caught up in these traffic jams where people would stop to see the bear or the bison but there are hundreds of bison out there that are never seen you know but when you have that many scattered across the landscape the chances of bumping into one increase but if you're talking about a very rare animal you know something like a Wolverine or a Fisher or Martin you know you can talk to people who have spent lots of time in the woods who have never had a sighting of one of those animals so it's just you know for me it's it's a matter of statistics just just probabilities of encountering but gee you know if we don't see something move a vertical line especially is is very cryptic in the woods we're usually seeing things that are horizontally oriented like the back of a deer or a bear whatever but it's kind of like that closing scene in herring the Hendersons when suddenly the how dare you quote Harry and the Hendersons when you come on a show to talk to us about serious a great big without science by the way that's a pretty obscure reference power for most normal folks most normal folks are not like quoting Harry and the Hendersons but in what happened in Harry Anderson well the final scene when Harry's sent vodka woods the nth moment then out out from the landscape emerges his whole family and they were standing there right in front of you but there's because they were still you didn't see them and as soon as they chew it when it's a movie well right but but there's there's truth to that we we really pick up our our brain zeroes in on a movement you know a movement in the but if it's absolutely still we have a hard time sometimes like they like in predator yeah exactly know how much credence do you give to the idea that they're all over the country oh very little they're there their distribution again assuming they exist for a moment is very ecologically based so we don't find them in the middle of wheat fields of Kansas or you know West Texas we find them where there's sufficient rainfall to support coniferous forests and understory that that's productive enough to support large omnivore so if you looked at a few got a guide to mammals and flipped open to American black bear for example look at the distribution or better yet flip open to my field guide you have a sasquatch field guide Sasquatch field guide it's laminated isn't it it's yep so water awesome but there is a if I can find it here there is a distribution map of a hypothetical distribution where can I get one of those um well I can give you a address to send a check to and get one all right Gerry you just just got money out of you how much this is a cash well with with postage it would be 1150 okay getting United spies for you Merry Christmas buddy anyway but there's a distribution map and what's interesting is it's very similar to the distribution map for American black bears because there's another omnivore that needs a certain amount of productive habitat and you know there's lots of space on that map where there's no there's no evidence of any of any Sasquatch in this game music so your your your belief is that you're dealing with the Pacific Northwest primarily and then possibly a few other spots like Connecticut shit well the backside of the Apple a so if you go across the boreal forests of Canada right down the backside of the Appalachia New England states to etiquette Connecticut well could be that's really densely populated state yeah kind of hard Ohio John Oakey but down the backside the Appalachia even even eastern Ohio it's pretty surprising they've really been there yeah so there's some support for so you believe Ohio maybe possibly Pennsylvania yeah western Pennsylvania Florida Florida skunk ape sure really some of that some that there's a lot of my experience has been and for a long time I simply used the you know the easy caveat that I didn't have the time or resources to consider all the evidence east of the Mississippi but my experience has been that the data that has come from those areas that might corroborate such sightings is pretty scanned and there's a lot of things that are just not credible what like meth like meth a lot of math in Florida yeah I think if you see in skunk Apes now I don't know can you talk a little bit about the way that a bigfoot smells well yeah oftentimes in this the skunk ape you know as a mom curr that derives from that supposed stench but it's interesting when you look at the statistics collated from lots and lotsa sightings a stench is only reported in about 10% of the circum of the sightings that suggests to me that they don't continually smell badly at our to our nose but that they're capable of exerting the smell great apes like bike chimps and gorillas have very well-developed axillary organs the the apocrine sweat glands right the things that when we sweat when were nervous as opposed to the watery sweat that is used in evaporative cooling and when animals are went like like gorillas Jing Dian Fossey rather excuse me she describes the first time of silverback BLUF charged her came barreling down at her she hunkered down you know averted her gaze and it stopped just a foot short of her but she said she was nearly bowled over by this locker room scent that it was emitting oh my god and and she was probably meeting one by that point yes imagine how horrifying that would be yeah you got a giant silverback charging you that's so close you can smell it stink so so whether it's fear or tension or intimidation they're probably capable of exuding that kind of smell under those circumstances just like a skunk just like Scotch we were in my backyard the other night and I had explained to my daughter that you can't get too close to the skunk there was skunk wandering in the backyard we have chickens and the skunk is found out with chickens by the way skunks are murderers okay they're very carnivorous they're predators and they were looking to kill my chickens and they actually drink their blood that's what how they get they ganked their neck and drink their blood so cute little skunks Pepe LePew and not so much the little monsters but you know I had explained to her like I go if it gets you the smell is unbelievably bad and you know she's fives like I don't know what you're talking about doesn't smell at all I'm like it can smell it's smells on purpose sure that's a weird thing the ability to spray that stuff on purpose oh yeah and they can only do I heard they can only do it 10 times a year skunks yeah they can't they only have a certain amount they could spray so whenever they spray they have to mean it rate of production it what's fascinating is that smell that that we can recognize in just small parts per million right that's how dogs smell us yeah but not so bad I'm sure but they can smell the availability to recognize us the way we could recognize skunks which is it really puts it in perspective because it's very few smells that are like that that are squirted out by a small animal that can spread for blocks and blocks you know that when you're driving you're in your car you smell it through your vents right you know it's just super powerful so mostly Pacific Northwest or anywhere where there's large desk for us who's the most credible eyewitness that you've ever talked to all there been several what one that always comes to mind when I'm asked that though is a lady by the name of Julie Davis who had a remarkable encounter in the South San Juans of Colorado she's a very avid goat Packer and she's hiked the entire Continental Divide Trail through Colorado and her story was was recounted in the Denver Post and a big feature article but and I've spent over a month in the in the backcountry with her and a couple other researchers and got to know her very well and been in her home heard her recount her her recollections over campfire and and you know when someone had shares that kind of experience or well hers is worth retailing very quickly she was off trail with her goats and a couple of dogs the dogs were acting up she suspected maybe that she was being stalked by a bear and and there still are Grizzlies in the supposedly still our grizzly this is the area of the the so-called ghost Grizzlies where they they think they're extinct and then a hunter shoots one and it's a female and she's awfully obviously suckled the Cubs so there still are some Grizzlies out there perhaps well part of the versus South Colorado Rockies the wyman each country and the South San Juans but at one point she her dogs were again acting up she was kind of on the lookout she didn't want her dogs to tangle with the bear so she was taking the dogs towards the tent in stepped in the tent and got her pepper spray and suddenly the goats approached the tent they weren't looking at her though they were looking up above the tent and so she stepped out thinking she was going to confront a bear and have to spray it and they are standing right behind her tent so about from me to you just a small dome tent is this 8-foot tall hairy figure locking eyes with her and this is in the middle of the afternoon in broad daylight and I've had close quarters she said she looked at her it looked at the goats and looked back at her Elena's was apparently fascinated by these funny-looking animals in encountered before perhaps and she said she had a sort of a subliminal impression suddenly that that I won't bother you if you won't bother me and she said that when she had that wreck that that sense its demeanor kind of softened the edge sort of went off at at that point a second one that was standing right behind it slightly smaller one peered out from around the bigger one and they sat and kind of stared each other for you know probably what seemed like an eternity was just a few seconds and then they both turned and they headed off towards the treeline and disappeared like were you going yeah exact time I'll show you up candy ever have soda have a goat she didn't she didn't dare tell anyone for years about it because of the fear of the stigma and God I would give a thousand dollars to know if that's true yeah exactly not even the experience in myself just to know that she was telling the truth well and as I said it's one thing to you know in your position to said well yeah you know it could be it could be it couldn't be right but when when you when someone that you have come to know and you count as a friend is a close acquaintance then you know hi oh well you were mistaken you know it was just a bear standing upright from ten feet away and you you know you just imagined it or you've misinterpreted it rain blew a fuse or or you're lying to me you know right you're just making this up for attention and we spoke to one woman who had Barbara who had an incredibly compelling story yep so we yeah I've talked to people that have stories that make you to go whoa boy which I knew well yeah people are having experiences again it comes back to this issue of of how do you interpret those experiences how credible are they that's really got to be where the madness is because you can't discount unique experiences you really can't you can't and but but I always kind of push for the corroboration you know I want to see an associative footprint I want to see a strand of hair that matches that sort of standard or that that archetype of the hair of Sasquatch that that's kind of the gold standard you'd see I guess because then then there's another dimension to it that takes some of the subjectivity out of the evaluation of the experience for me anyway is this your full-time job do you no no no I mean I'm I do research you know I publish on a hominid evolution and bipedalism it takes a significant amount but I see it as one facet a very complementary facet to my my other research some of the insights that I've gained from studying carefully the Sasquatch footprints have actually fueled new interpretations of some of the hominid footprints evidence that have that have caused me to advocate some different alternative interpretations of some of that early evidence besides Bigfoot what are the other bigfoot-like creatures that you believe possibly exist Brian well they're that you know there's the reports of all around the globe of different sorts of things not all related now interestingly there's reports of very sasquatch-like creatures in eastern Russia and China and even down in Southeast Asia in fact you could go up from Southeast Asia cross mine amar northeast India along the foothills of the Himalayas up around the Pamir and Altai ranges on the border in Mongolia even as far west as the Caucasus between the Caspian and Black Seas there are these gigantic reports and evidence of gigantic footprints left by large bipedal creatures very similar to Sasquatch they have the same mid tarsal break in the footprints well we have a much scant err fossil record they resemble I mean one of the tracks from the Caucasus that a research in fact I'm going to the caucuses this August to work with this researcher who came back with a footprint that was cast by a villager from a long line of tracks that most of the village witnessed of a big hairy creature that walked walked through this this fallow field they resemble remarkably the the Sasquatch footprint so this might be the former range of you know Gigantopithecus or giant / anthropology I and Yeti and there is unfortunately scant evidence for it I've gone through as systematically as possible and evaluated all the footprint evidence attribute to the Yeti much of it's just unintelligible the snow you know the prints have melted out or sublimated you know where the snow evaporates at the high altitude another significant fraction are bears absolutely bears and it boils down to probably two specimens the famous Shipton photo from the menlung glacier back in the 50s what's the name of that eric shipton shi pto n yep and another one that's I find even much more compelling is the McNeeley Cronin footprint the McNeely Cronin expedition to the Aaron Valley Inn in the Himalayas those suggest a creature that's actually probably much more akin to this individual they exhibit a opposable or a divergent big toe in fact a McNeely Cronin particularly look just like an oversized chimpanzee with short stout digits hold this opinion mm-hmm so you feel like the Yeti might possibly be if it's real might possibly be a different animal or another different undisclosed right probably have a probably one that's still arboreal that lives not up in the snow fields but down in the subtropical to temperate valleys of the high mid Himalayas I guess you'd say like the a run Valley I mean that McNeely Jeff McNeely Annette Cronin were biologists who were conducting a two-year aisle survey the wildlife in that area wildlife and the flora and so when they when they woke up one morning and found a line of tracks that came up a very steep slope through three feet of snow bipedally on a ridge leading to the past that they were just about to go over themselves made a detour meandered in amongst the brightly colored tents and then continued on over the past and they lost the trail in a rhododendron thicket but here were these chimpanzee like very large chimpanzee like footprints do youare dooba what's your take on aliens or extraterrestrials do you believe in UFOs well you know and I always ask you that that term believe it doesn't matter if I believe or not better I've not busied myself with the evidence I mean I I saw a UFO an unidentified flying object myself one time we were out looking at stars with you know a date do you think Bigfoot possibly was in that you know I don't think so no I don't think you never know until you go in that UFO do you imagine that what a mindfuck that would be then puts from another planet and just lands and likes to go for walks through the woods just like everybody else all I saw was it was a point of light you know when one of your kids we would sleep out on the sundeck sand we'd count the satellites as they went over right very particular kind of oblique orbits this thing was going north to south and which would have been fine except that it executed to right angle turns in succession I mean absolutely right angle turns just as sharp as if you put a square up there in this guy and Wow and and so I you know both our jaws dropped and did you see that the eyes maybe that's the government because it's trying to throw you off this Bigfoot thing by making you look even more British way before that this is back in ecology maybe they have a time machine and they knew that you were going to be one of the most prominent problems well that that's the thing about a Bigfoot research all all these conspiracy theories if there's men and black out there you know harassing and intimidating these Bigfoot investigators either I'm a good disseminator of disinformation or something no one's ever shown up at my lab they don't bother you at all they've never bothered so you could yet so the idea is you probably work for the CIA that's right you trained underground as just hypnotic soothing voice you get around the stone it's convinced them Bigfoot exists leave little breadcrumb trails you know right you're the one with added bag of hairs I knew I knew you're right that's it you're a government agent I'm the the possibility that Sasquatch predated humans in North America you brought that up what about the possibility that there's some sort of a hybrid between humans and Sasquatch is that yeah I think it's very unlikely I mean I actually am aware of a couple of interesting stories from Native American sources that suggest that that that there was the possibility of Interbrew so you feel like there's a Yeti which may or may not exist but if it does is a completely different species and then there's a sasquatch there has been some talk about hybrids and including the Melba Ketchum DNA results which she reports to indicate some sort of a human and primate unknown primate hybrid would how do you feel about the results of those I don't hold those in in very high regard I don't think that her results are that credible reliable and certainly her interpretation the data is highly questionable also it's important to note that when you say a human Sasquatch hybrid what you're saying is that someone wasn't just lucky enough to discover a Bigfoot but they were also able to make love with the Bigfoot well we're talking about a long time ago and most likely they didn't even make love with a Bigfoot they made love with another thing and created Bigfoot that's that's her thesis yeah that's it it's not being looked at with well it knows color glasses I mean even setting the in any supposed data aside for a moment just to think about the the feasibility of that scenario you have to have two populations that are at least close enough that they're going to produce a viable and a fertile offspring and yet they're different enough that that offspring isn't subsumed into one or the other of the parental population and and just you know diluted back into the gene pool they remain distinct and then the crosses have to be frequent enough the the you know the looking up it yeah like looking up that there's that there's a substantial population then that accrues and and that becomes sasquatch and somehow gets from Europe to North America and other parts of Asia and relinquishes all material culture and and other accoutrements of humanity and I mean it just it kind of not only that how big must that thing of been right people are our size and then there's Sasquatch which is even bigger yeah this thing had to be even bigger than Sasquatch that sec sort of person made something in the middle right is it work that way no it doesn't science does not work that way you know why it doesn't work that way like or ligers are way bigger than tigers or Lions yeah clothes yeah I mean there there are yeah you can point to examples that they do lions and tigers really aren't good biological species because they do when that when the opportunity presents they do cross and produce viable offspring but the viable offsprings are sterile are they not no ligers my understanding is that ligers are not sterile really yeah that you can you could breed you could in fact one of not pocatello but Eastern Idaho's claim to fame was lighter town a couple of unscrupulous individuals that were were breeding and but not taking good care of them and all heck broke loose when they showed up outside of a school playground the loggers did yeah and oh well they they found well beaten paths where they were getting out on a regular basis before they were discovered and yeah I was was pretty but that but that's an interesting interesting possible scenario now I I started to mention that there's a couple of Native American accounts that suggest you know there's always been this theme of abduction of the you know the the Sasquatch abducting human females but the only two that I'm aware of upon which I can base any you know any evaluation reported that there was a pregnancy there was a birth but the individual grew very rapidly very sickly and died you know and was stunted mentally and died before the you know reaching teen years suggesting it wasn't viable and probably wouldn't have been fertile and this is an abduction yeah look Bigfoot abducted a Native American woman smooth loader brought her back and she had a baby that died mm-hmm why do you bring her back or she got away or whatever maybe she was annoying maybe Bigfoot thought it'd be really cool you know it's like a lot of hookups you build it up in your mind you know and then you get together with her in the reality sets and yeah maybe she's an is back with Bigfoot I mean they're they sound like just-so stories but you know we have some precedent Baruti galdikas the orangutan lady researcher she and her book reflections of Eden recounts an instance where at a provisioning station her native assistant was accosted by a young male orangutan who completed the deed and but he had been he was a hurry habituated or a repatriated I guess you'd say rehabilitate I'm sure what the proper term is there one that had been confiscated and then raised and and trained to return to the woods so it had some contact with humans previously but the but the point simply being is that that scenario is not completely out of the question right the question is what's the probability of there being a successful impregnation between two different species now I've never had to stop you know I I would but it seems like if an orangutan had made love to a woman that I would have heard of that by now and you know - I don't think so there's that lady in Connecticut that was almost in time almost definitely sleeping with her chimp she was giving it wine and xanax it slept in the bed with her I was very jealous of her yeah she's probably having sex with that thing but this is different from being on an expedition than having it rangitane barrel out of the forest and fuck you yeah but I think it's probably pretty standard for orangutangs they're bigger we're smaller they fuck us standard I think that's what they do when they're horny I don't think they really think about it there would be a blog dedicated to it just not enough contact with people with cell phones that live until episode this was a Pandora's box wasn't it so shows a pen barks sorry I apologize for that the the jane goodall quote boy when jane goodall came out and said that she believes 100% that sasquatch is a real animal did you go shucks you must have been so pumped well I followed up and and and saw and tried to see if she would read my book manuscript and possibly endorse it which he did so the cover of my book boasts an endorsement from from dr. Goodall so but you have you spoken with her I have a couple of times what's her number one thing that she locks on to as far as proof one of the things that really impressed her was the the accounts by Native Americans that she's come to become acquainted with and the fact that they that they've had these encounters and that they that their oral traditions are so deep-rooted about interactions and you know encounters with these creatures that they're part of the of the real landscape as well as you know as with so many animals the Native American stories often have are very metaphorical very like Aesop's fables they you know convey convey morals and so forth and so they're oftentimes the animals are given anthropomorphic characteristics and or supernatural characteristics but that doesn't change the fact that you know the clever and and trickster coyote is based on a real species of animal yeah so the wild man of the woods is probably the same what is Jane Goodall think of this footage you know I haven't I haven't had that opportunity our conversations have always been very brief unfortunately we haven't had the opportunity to sit down and speak in great length but so I don't know what she would say about the about the footage what was your background before you became intoxicated with the Bigfoot legend right well my my training is in anatomical sciences with an emphasis in physical anthropology so much of my days spent teaching human gross anatomy full-body dissection lab course to Health Professions programs so you know I've been involved with the dissection of hundreds and hundreds of human bodies know that machinery inside and out my research revolves around the evolution of human adaptations particularly those for walking on two legs and and more specifically the interpretation of foot form and function as it relates to to bipedalism and arboreal tea and other other primates like the great apes and and monkeys you're you living in Washington State is where you live Idaho I the state of Idaho okay TJ so state you nice and woodsy out there right well Pocatello is kind of a plunked there on the edge of the sagebrush steppe so we have to go a little ways to get to the woodsy but there's lots of wild country we're just two hours away from the Tetons in Yellowstone National Park and you went as are just south of us so there's there's some real prime territory so you can go Squatch in pretty close to your house sure can do you do you do that I've I've gone I go out with a colleague John minds in ski as a wildlife consultant and ethno botanist and we've done a lot of work in western Wyoming together and for a number of years we've spent at least a month at a time in the field looking for trace evidence and trying to get DNA with varies by various means would you say that you spend more time dissecting human bodies are hunting for Bigfoot probably dissecting human bodies you know but Bigfoot's really fun and dissecting bodies get boring after a while right well I never lose that it has a certain novelty to it every each and every year I mean everybody's a little different and sharing that experience you know it's a really unique opportunity for students to have that very intimate experience of dismantling that marvelous machine that's the human body so it never never really gets old for the record just so for the show would you look at me and tell me exactly who you are and what your credentials are yeah my name is Jeff Meldrum I'm a professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University I teach primarily anatomy and research the evolution of human bipedalism I hope you're right I'm seriously rooting for you there's not a lot of subjects that I really hope are true but Bigfoot man for me it has always been the one UFOs I'm pretty sure there's life out there whether or not it's videos of us excuse me whether or not it's visited us too I'm sort of I'm safety on that big foot I'm hoping for man I'm caught I want to be real well it's interesting there was a recently the cover story of New Scientist magazine this year was of one issue was what are the top 10 questions that face human evolution the students of researchers of human evolution today and number 9 was our other hominins alive today so it's gaining some traction is this notion of Relic hominids i've actually launched an online scholarly journal peer-reviewed journal called the relic hominid inquiry to provide a venue for discussion and publication of research on this topic and so it's it's making inroads in houma flores the answers that you're so interested that that was really an interesting thing yeah because here these these discoverers kind of scratch their heads and admit to the report as well yeah actually the local people have been describing these little three-foot tall hairy people that live up in the mountains and and even some of the European colonists have described encounters with them all along and that that had been the folklore for the longest time try and thought to be nothing but just stories until they found these bones was like 2006 or something like that yeah it's just been a few crazy little tiny three-foot tall non-human people right they said could levitate oh no no everything that lie they just fly they don't levitate like Superman Superman Levitt they walk through trees right through the rock way through the tree they become one with the tree from from what I read the little people can fly where are the little people suppose I mean there's also the orange pen deck right right where is that things supposed to live that name comes from Malaysia so Flores is a little island of Indonesia that there are reports of these small hominids all throughout Southeast Asia recent reports right oh yes contemporary reports absolutely as well as the native tradition they're still alive yeah tiny things are very smart apparently well you know you get people in very smart yeah fast any stuff dr. Meldrum seriously thank you so much and thank you for all this work because if it wasn't for a guy like you an actual intellectual smart dude who is obsessed with Bigfoot as well it would be so sketchy because you're getting this information from all these various sources some of them highly doped up you know it's hard sorry to celebrate the week from the chef that we said a week from the chamois from the Chateau yeah it's hard I don't think it's a fiber problem it's it's hard you know when you're a person like myself who is not educated in anthropology to dissect this stuff sure and if it wasn't for people like you out there I think the overall picture will be far mightier so thank you sir I really really appreciate it pleasure and an honor having you on really appreciate it nice to meet you
