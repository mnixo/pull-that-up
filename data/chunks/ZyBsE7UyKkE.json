Bravo Invitational jiu-jitsu tournament where's that it's tomorrow is it at the orpheum again at the orpheum downtown LA you can get tickets at EBI official comm you can watch on UFC fight pass and you also have a choice now to watch it on pay-per-view at inch by inch TV that's cool that's a great good move so if you don't have fight pass you can still get it yep yep that's my company so but if you don't have fight pass usually get fight pass if I pass is the shit and we're watching this fight on fight pass right now and I'm not just saying fight passes the shit cuz I'm a UFC employee if you're a fan of the sport there's fucking everything on fight pass you will go down a goddamn rabbit hole pride fights every strike for everything you watch soul mate rights and there's also like a bunch of like organizations that you never heard of before they have awesome fights right and just the fact just the fact that you could watch any UFC fight ever just that alone it's worth it it's amazing live just that alone just boom you could just remember that fight boom you can watch it remember that fight boom you can watch on-demand Sun and pride fights yeah like that alone it doesn't even need anything else we should do some fight companions for old pride fights the best let's elect on cro cop versus phaidor Wanderlei nog versus phaidor vas Abdo guerra you know come on my question is how long after UFC do they put the individual fights on high pass that's a good question I'm saying do they upload them yeah there's a lot of times before we can see this fight on fight pass well there's this is on fight back right now I mean archived oh it'll be our off right afterwards you think so how long does it take 100% it's right afterwards just uploads right away think so because I've tried to check fights out that just happened maybe where they were Fox fights if it's FX or fr Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2 the hell knows true or far what they on those yeah they can't put those on five paths I don't know I don't yeah I think they do that's part of the deal son you don't pay all that money in clothes of money they don't want to pay fuck loads of money so you could just not have Fox and just watch it on five pounds well they want I mean they should own it I mean they're payable what are they doing with it they ain't doing shit they reclaim all the time they reap one last night was Cain Velasquez rich Bigfoot and I watched that damn they're starting over plan 1 Fox do I have it on my DVR watch so I go or I'm a hipster only because this is I'm too lazy yeah too lazy bum turn on the TV I have UFC Fight Night on the DVR like automatically set to record and it always is recording old fights always super cool ones constantly so anything that's been on fight on fs1 or any Fox venue bro I have fs1 Fox Spike Bellator I fucking access TV fights on that bitch yeah so oxy I love access TV I love lion fight yes lion fight is they got some fucking amazing MoIT I have some PVC boxing on there and shit of everything so these dudes who are fighting right now pee pee Chara and Wilson I'm assuming pichota is the guy in the red and yeah the little thing at the bottom that Wilson dude has a sick left kick man he's throwing some nasty hard left kicks to the body but I don't know these dudes I heard there were some good fights on the prelims all I heard was good you know who won that Jaime do you guys know know who did he fight I don't know if he got head kicked Artem did yeah it lost and then I'm not sure but Conor was there and he's trying to corner him and the ref will stop the fight Andre fili why I am why the ref after stuff because Conor was an official corner man and was yelling out instructions and I was like hold up you got a chill man be professional and Connor was like my bad my bad really yeah you can't yell out when from your outside of the cage well he was caged side and he walked up to the cage yelling instructions oh so homeboy is like yo you're not an official corner man you only get three not four unless it's a title fight so he was too close yeah I'm just is a distraction yeah chill man that's a good rule that really that's a great rule yeah you can't have crowds of dudes that are your friends yelling calling you a faggot there you go yeah he just shows up everywhere with cufflinks and a beautiful suit puts his hands at me so it's mark god or to mark Carter it's a motherfucker he's a motherfucker he's not taking a bull shit oh this dude's got the choke standing rear naked so I watched Bellator last night right what does that dude that Gracie dude hauls son Hall Oh son you know grace yes yes bad motherfucker bad motherfucker serious judicial some dudes out how about that no yeah 17:07 submissions he's him he's a bad motherfucker submissions Neiman Grace and who's his father hauls boom holes how do you say no holes that died in it yes yeah that car dude you should've seen this neck crank Eddie dude I thought you can break this motherfuckers neck yeah that dude looked every bit of 44 but I guess he's only 32 that's great hear like the guy fought yeah he looks like Luke Thomas both right here yeah you know he was young son boy he had gray hair but if you take away the gray hair he's ripped and look good for sure defense two men he had him on his back the whole first round and and it fought him off but then Niemann switched it to a neck crank it just it looked like it hurt so bad are you gonna function every sink this oh yeah there it is right there no that's not it that was his fight at math square garden yeah you won that one jump now blowing I choked too last night you had the dudes next it looked like it hurt so bad Mousasi didn't look great Brooke so to sync this up we're at 25 seconds to the first round 23 22 21 and pu pichota i don't know how to say his name is on the back of Wilson he's getting worked oh shit he's got the choke oh oh yeah overkill oh shit I said no no not much time not much I think in stuck it's under the chin powerful he's gonna hang on this out he's good dad that's the belt but last night in Bellator Mousasi did look lethargic I had to take off a to go to the Carmen store I miss you can see it he definitely won the first round but then ship show Mako ya know what is his name what's his name she'll menko write my name kochenko - yeah go he hit him with a overhand left and closed up his right eye like his whole right eye confetti and then the sec I thought Jamaica won the second round in the third they gave two Mousasi races he did not look like a world beater no chef no interesting maybe they're UFC got rid of him just in time it's too bad because against Chris Weidman you look like a bat I don't think it's that Joe I don't think belt or gets enough respect there guys are fucking tough at the top level it's true so Mako hasn't lost a fight in how long yet span for steroids but he's won like six in a row he's a motherfucker he is a motherfucker did you see when you knocked out Melvin yeah like those that look at that eye boom Bellator is going to be a tough going for everybody I think that's true I think that's true and that that also highlights how fucking good Rory MacDonald actually is look look at Larkin mmm not doing well yeah well Lorenz got Kayode by Paul Daley yes you know when you stand in front of Paul Daley Paul Daley throws bad idea walk-in bombs that left hand is just a ridiculous weapon well look at Ben Henderson he's struggling Ben Henderson was Amjad he was on the downside when he went there though true but their struggle City is just rough he was trying to go 170 oh that was not and the guy he fought nightmare Phil Davis did well but you know Ryan Bader beat him you know Ryan Bader who was probably never going to be the champ in the UFC light heavyweight division now you never know now you never know John John John Jones in he was really not it was that's everyone though right there's nobody can that title John was there you know you got a wonder man you got to wonder what the fuck actually happened when it came to this steroid stuff you know as I talk to Nowitzki like a lot of these these websites were posting that if John Jones could provide a supplement that had that stuff in it he wouldn't get a suspension it is possible he wouldn't get a suspension Novitsky said they just totally took me out of context and that's not what I said at all yeah listen does dinner yeah he's he's at what he was actually saying is it is possible to have tainted supplements and people have proven it in the past there's something in a supplement and if you can prove that you took it completely accidentally which guys have you know who did that is um Tim means yeah the dirty burger but he got suspended for a few months even even though but a few months for John would be a win yeah that wouldn't be shit but with it but with his history it's tough to believe it's just well I want to believe I want to believe too so bad I want back so bad I think the UFC needs them so they need them so bad right what are you excited for these days see good go ahead Eddie I finally saw that documentary Icarus it's fucking amazing Russian dope yes if you didn't know anything about that movie and let's say Alex Jones said the Russians they're sneaking in laboratories they're switching the urine the A's and the B's I'm telling you I know this I have an inside source how could they do that it's impossible yes I believe that would be the end of Alex Jones right they're like breaking into the offices switching the pisses well they did it in Russia though it was in Sochi they won 13 gold medals a total number of gold medals every one was dirty the dude said everyone was dirty that guy is in serious hiding right now hell yeah yes he's like fucking they got him tucked away homeboy was worried about him right oh yeah yeah he was saying his that he's had like depression before and then he tried to commit suicide well that scandal first broke out in Russia when he was freaking out he was in Russian who's on the phone going dude they're gonna kill I was shocked that he was able to leave the country yeah what did you think that they were like they would have someone on his ass well Brian Fogle who's the director of it was on my podcast and explained to me how they didn't think that he was a flight risk and they cuz he was such the mastermind of the program they never thought that he was gonna take off there's a bunch of reasons why he cited on the podcast that I can't totally recall why they didn't think that he was gonna take off but obviously they fucked out without super fucked up he's all seeya well you know it's crazy dude how water the world anti-doping agency and the International Olympic Committee are all in bed together they're not policing each other why does not police in the IOC it's bullshit that's why though they let the Russians in even though they knew the Russians cheated in Sochi they had irrefutable proof that they cheated like that all the stuff that you've seen that Netflix documentary Icarus is 100% true they still let him compete in Rio all they did is they threw him a bone they said yeah we're gonna take out the track and field team least this track & field team has to go money so they took the track-and-field team out they loved wrestling gymnastics all these are dirty dirty dirty athletes they probably Russia party say hey listen guys if you guys are have my back we're gonna go after you everybody's doing everybody's doing no not like Russia cuz it's not state-sponsored but if you don't think a lot of them are on it the amount of money that you can mean he was a bribes explaining this like think about someone like Phelps right Michael Phelps because he won cuz he won the gold medal you know how many gold medal do you want a shitload right most of that guy is a huge celebrity he's wealthy that's a as the Russian ask on it he's found that's the Russians the Russians got Eddie so because of that because of that that guy makes fuckin millions of dollars a year but now go to the silver medalist who's that guy who fucks that guy Ryan Lochte but it will get who is he no one knows he's a liar no one know who they're Rio pretending that they were robbing him he had white joins us yeah he was like the police had me at gunpoint did you broke a bathroom door you piece of shit no really yeah he was like dad me at gunpoint that told me get on the floor I said fucking make me lose every and then I like brought you up white jeans on a few feet on the ground why aren't they dirty it always like I don't know clean ground you know Brazil is on free ground floors now it's just the white fucking biggest laughingstock of all times just a big old liar it's impossible to win the hundred meters without being on juice you know that guy Victor Conte from the ball Co scandal that guy that hooked up Barry Bonds and all those people with the the indetectable sort of ultimate snitch of all time the ultimate snitch cuz he he got out of jail and then immediately starts snitched it away says the entire track and field support is a dirty sport he said all of them he's like he was like to think about Jamaica Jamaica wins all these gold medals he's like what's going on why are they why are they wearing clothes gold medals like what's happening hey what's happening they have a very sophisticated drug program Jamaica yes like they're not known for being they've never been known for being sprinters like that's not their thing it's kind of new that that's their thing and they're the best ever ever do we just think it's the fucking plantation like what do you think it is well what do you think they're eating one of the things that Fogle pointed out was like we remember when Ben Johnson got tested positive when he fought it when he actually raced against Carl Lewis remember that he's no big deal he was super jacked that gold chain Carl Lewis tested positive - yeah they're all doing they're all we were tested positive it's just that Ben Johnson's levels were so off the fucking charts they were like Jesus but that was the first year they were testing it's like probably more like bad days yeah like Pride days and that makes you think I hate to say this but it really makes you think about phaidor there's Ben Johnson back in the day son that's a good picture but get a picture of him mid sprint Jamey Jasta how fucking jack imma fight he was he was so fucking fast look at that he's so big he was so big for a track-and-field Carlos look so he has AIDS back there help jacked Ben John he looks like Melvin man off that's right like like that kind of build take Adrian Peterson so these these emotions these guys are all but the Russian they're all on something every one of them is on something how come no white guys got a hold some good shit go to that one go to that with the one about Jesus right rakh yeah not same in the fucking spring the 100-meter dash oh yeah well I guess fuck it yeah if we get juice to the gills something the white star yeah it's not we're not sprite guys aren't willing to go that deep we just don't know what yeah you're full bane I wonder I wonder what it is look at his eyes first of all what the fuck was he taking his eyes turned yellow that's what they had said that his liver was struggling to deal with all the steroids in his system and it was making the whites of his eyes yellow damn he still beat the record with that Timex watch on the heaviest basic watch but that wouldn't really hold you talking aerodynamics my man's no not a bad penny gold chain the fucking Rick Ross gold chain that gold chains a big one dude he went I'm so juiced coaches try to have an intervention bitches like gold I know bitches an argument so powerful g-shock watch and helmet he does have yellow eyes man he looks like a leopard like he's ready to leap on you and no one said anything like brought your eyes and that watcher hey bro give away the winning now we've gotta be use the fast of all time this is our second who's that guy Ben Johnson yeah for a while didn't fire maybe yeah is that Ben Johnson there jack no Hussein bought was another time so who are the people's guys of all time he's number one Carl Lewis never yeah Hussein ball has the first time of all time then and the Ben Johnson bald Carl Lewis how many can you how many sprinters can you name well it was seen Marion Jones you know females but again she came out she would snitched on herself you ever seen a snitch on yourself but why she's Nature herself because I think there's some rumors and she's like I can't handle this anymore but it was juice to the gills I got a dick oh man all-time fastest look at this hüseyin bolt Usain Bolt Usain Bolt Tyson Gay Oh Justin Gatlin Tyson Gay I know though that's a rough name it's a rough name Tyson Gay there ain't a white guy in fucking now Wow look how far down you got to go to get to somebody you know who's saying bolt number 34 like Maurice Greene like when do you get down to Ben Johnson do they have him on there do they take it off yeah they took him off Oh Christian Coleman I bet that they shouldn't take him off I mean if you want to punish him punish him but you can't take him off it's like what they did with the with Tour de France they they took all the ones that Lance Armstrong won there they removed him as the winner he won like eight times but everybody was dirty you had to go down to 15th place to find a guy 18 was it eight anything was able how about in the guy who didn't ask PI know how about a major league baseball like no Barry Bonds can't be in the Hall of Fame because you got tested positive like who the fuck you think was stolen the pitches their juice to the gills - you fucked and what happens with like Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire will have seen Sammy Sosa that's a great angle nice professional triangle right there he knew exactly what he was done yeah that's pretty deep it took a while to cinch it in but all the rounds over no way tightening around I think that's I went for that armbar wait did he tap that on but I really was an end with it oh no the rings are still the ring yeah yeah that was a good ending oh so is the end of the round okay so we got one more up but if you want see what happens when you don't make the Hall of Fame look it have you seen Sammy Sosa lately I was a referee checking him his eyes after all you got he took some punches when he's down yeah I've seen Sammy Sosa lately like something went crazy became a white guy crazy yeah he just went from the back to triangle dude that's totally pro oh those guys right yeah oh dude he fucked him up with that right this guy's good dude Sammy Sosa is a different human being I need to acknowledge this what did he do look at his skin he looks like Michael Jackson yeah what happened what the fuck I'm not sure did you talk about it has he talked about Jamie it looks like you just went fuck and I want to be white dude don't go to the pink hat go to PCAT sir okay that's used to be the greatest baseball player of all time resign that's what happens we don't like guys I'm hoping well he might have fuck was he getting up with all the steroids no McGwire ZJ are you saying he's gay is that what you say open that's what happened when you don't like gays and the Hall of Fame that we definitely did say that I don't think he's gay I think Sammy Sosa still lays pipe even though he's waiting both heard gay know let's just be real clear none of us have a problem with gay people I love gay no no I'm gay people yeah I'm sorry she's wearing a pink hat because he's gay I'm cool with my own pink shoes I like it look at this dog yeah what happened so what does he say happen to him like because it's weird yeah he just okay that's a white guy yeah it's crazy and he was super dark he was dark laughs yeah maybe that was a tan maybe you got it was no no everything's changed you know what there is hair cream there is cream that some women do use to lighten their skin fight is over what happened he admits he bleaches his skin Oh minute he bleaches his skin oh wow that's weird I wonder why he wants to do that dude that's really that's the second Michael Jackson no no because Michael Jackson had what I have audition yeah bleach his skin no he didn't even know yeah but that's not what Sammy Sosa is doing Sammy Sosa just decided to be able to wear white yeah people done maybe or maybe Michael Jackson just wanted to be white but he used that as an excuse no he legit had like a skin thing and it started spreading like fuck I don't wanna look like this and just went full spectrum yeah have you seen some models who have it they're gorgeous yeah they're just rock it that but I think it's sexiest yeah Carlo Alexi I call the zebra models they're sexy as fuck they got like a cool low and we see them Jamie yeah supermodels why here's the triangle right but this is not the end of the fight like how did this fight in maybe he gave up at the corner I think where was the last round yeah yeah I think that was the decision home but we're doing the worst job of paying attention to this fight dan Hardy with a beautiful green jacket powerful joker colors so Sammy Sosa just decided to be a white just fuck it now connect into a white guy go black no I mean you can be a Tanner tape gets tape did a movie in Tahiti well you don't get black features well no but you don't get black skin you get like doing a super dark take gots all fucking dark no bro I'm talking about going straight black black I can't go black fit no there was a Maurice Povich that was a horoscope it what does Matt Maury Maury right black you'd be more read there was a girl some white girl who wants to be black I haven't seen this oh shit catch me a psycho no no no no no no no she's like really wants to be black it's a white woman who do and the audience is all black and they fucking can't stand her and they're just bearing is that the homegirl who got fired from her job look at this what Sammy Sosa says what happened was that I had been using the cream for a long time and that combined with the bright TV lights made my face look whiter that really is I don't think I look like Michael Jackson he added apparently Sosa has kept up his use of the cream over the years which has led him to appear even whiter than he did in 2009 so he's been just getting wider and wider and wider okay go higher there it's a bleaching cream that I applied before going to bed and whitens my skin tone so so said during appearance Univision's buh-buh-buh-buh it's a cream that I have that I used to soften my skin but it has bleached me some I'm not a racist I live my life happily what bleached me some sir you're completely alight man yeah Leachman psalmist I'm not a racist maybe like there was like a super racist white chick these China fuck and he's like there's only one way you never go for white unless she was just bad this was like like dodge fantasy racist but with big old titties big plump pink titties and now he's just fucked by the waist like you like it's I just put on a bleaching cream it's no big deal I put a little bit on before I go to sleep at night so the bleaching cream he said he's even lighter than he was in 2009 I mean he's talking about something that happened eight years ago he's lighter than that now he's also a little mentally unstable because he also has white man hair now he's like the straight white like goddamn dark Tate God Jesus yeah I mean he's tan but you went confuse him for being black well you would if he had black features in black hair no for sure if he had an afro you would say that's a light-skinned black guy you think fuck yeah 100% look at darkies so they're do that mixture again tell you that if we get Photoshop Steve but if you change his hair and curl on he's probably already on it yeah he's probably done try all be black my favorite meme online is that one black dude is going like this looks like the Reading Rainbow guy I don't know who that guy is Derek Brunson but Jesus back yeah against Derek Brunson come out for a minute it looks like Ben Johnson a little bit there's an animated gif for him doing it too it's even better an animated one yeah I haven't seen that one yeah that that's a part I like the clown under the there is this the animated one who is this just some dude it's amazing various I think he's a rapper do you know apology's a Jamaican rapper did you know that they have many cards now and people like they have like games they play with mean cars really and he's one of the meme cards and there's always the one there's the one where I forget who is some another rapper where he's standing like this like what like that picture sounds awesome and then there was the you know the black lady with the hump for a neck hey have you seen the one of the kitties like in school and he's like it's like vegans when they haven't talked about being a vegan yeah yeah that's hilarious yeah see the meme the game see look at this it's a fucking game you played this game like and they I don't know how it works but you deal these things out like these popular memes it's hilarious I only know a guy gets laid for that man probably Demian Maia versus Kolby Covington oh that's an interesting fight that's an interesting fight you know what man I just wish Damian Wyatt Maya was younger because without this sauce without this special sauce you know he's like 40 years old now yeah I mean he said even when he's young he's a beast he's a beast do you like never went on that whole kind of tear and then fought Anderson terrible fight back down cut 79s a beast again dude he still he still he's 100% of beat you wish she was young why because I love the idea of a specialist I'm always fascinated by a specialist about a guy who just does one thing better than everybody else can he do it to somebody that's been aspirin yes the fight I would dance it's been Astrid Demian Maia wish did retire cuz I want that fight Ben's never gonna get in the UFC he talked way too much shit about about Dana White I think those that are those days still there I feel like they know I didn't give a fucking in my way here's that much money like right yeah I don't know man why have a man then what if he talks more shit about you you we need ratings plan Ben astringent you know he's retiring right yeah it's a bummer undefeated retire and undefeated but it's interesting because the only one who gave him any problems really was a J here on J Iran got him to a split decision a long time ago though yeah but it doesn't matter it's like a wrestler who could strike a guy was good enough to keep you away you know good enough wrestling to keep it from being a wrestling match and he could strike but been evolved from there cuz been with with Woodley with all these little guys like he evolved his game so he talked to people in there like dude he's can handle this one guy that gave us some trouble some Russian baguette Stan type wrestler gun who claimed it was on one Fc he was calling been out saying I could out Russell II I'm gonna take you down and he did and he was on him for a while but Ben still beat him he got him an arm such a shame he never got in the UFC man except for that guy everybody that he gets his mitts on as soon as Ben like holds you or grabs you his clinch is so high level that you just can't break free of his his clenched you know what's up bomber is one of the reasons also you talk to you today 'no but that's style for a lot of people isn't gonna sell paper views or get ratings wrestling holding holding people down he's getting good at so many guys now - he doesn't care but here's the problem with that logic floyd mayweather style of boxing is not fan friendly either but floyd major superstar before that he did knock people out became the guy you do either pay to watch him lose or win huge draw Ben Askren not a big job right introduced him wasn't he was not a huge draw before he started talking shit to people it wasn't a huge draw until he became money Mayweather became the bad guy that's when he became a huge became a bad guy but also fought Oscar De La Hoya only all these superstars been askin is not coming to UFC and go night here's here's Conor McGregor some superstar right he's not gonna do that he doesn't have the style either but if he did that would be very very interesting because huge if yeah but but what I'm saying is that's the only way that this guy could become famous is by shit-talking shit-talking is what's gonna make him famous like people wanting to see him lose that's what makes a guy like that famous because his style is very appealing to guys like us they're like I want to see if he can do he's you know what it takes a while to evolve and and be a good finisher and at first for a while they were just taking people down and just owning them and controlling of John but she's good at submitting people now oh yeah it's a great grappler overall it's greater so now so now the the Ben Askren we have now you can't compare them to the bed asking for five years ago that's gone but gone there's a Ben Askren that's gonna take you down and choke you out now that's gone he's retired money but it's also the the nobody's really return FC allows my knees to the head on the ground what you say one Fc allowed him to use knees to the head on the ground right it's a good point you know that's a big weapon any kicks you see Brett what Brandon Berrett did over there yeah kicking dudes in the face kick him in the back of the head in there down yeah that's like it's alright shit he's their heavyweight champion yeah he's on the juice they took off they took out the soccer kicks though yeah I've seen well they did you see homeboy Roger Huerta good size that was wrong cuz I can't have soccer kicks he was fighting a Brazilian who was a big fella who was cutting to make 170 and Rogers not really a 171 55 in the UFC decided to fight 170 and he was getting beat up and then he went down and this dude's soccer kicked him into the next fuck it can't have that and be a professional sport it's just too brutal I don't know man I mean he hasn't really he didn't yeah I mean it was a brutal brutal knock there tough to watch hmm that one was particularly secret when cro cop kick ron Waterman mmm-hmm i mean it's fucking though it's hard to watch but why is it harder to watch than a regular head kick that's my question is it because of the loggerhead kick you kind of move more with it and a soccer kick you lying down already we're already harder to defend yeah when you're lower I think you can yeah right yeah for sure like Charlie Brown kicks on in the face I think I could kick someone just as hard to the body I don't know I think you'd be surprised you mean kick harder on the ground fuck yes like think about an NFL kicker yeah I like kicking like straight like that no I don't think so dude I'm pretty sure that I could kick just as hard to the body as I could to that to the ground I don't think so just question is up high I don't I think up high I would lose something I lose a little bit up high just from like the leverage but I think I think gosh I think your leg going straight like this and low I think that's where all the most of the power is gonna be right and all shit emptied all shit depends on what kind of kick cuz here's the thing you could spinning back kick someone in the face when they're down - that's another thing to think about but think about that like a dude gets hit he goes down on one knee and you fucking die I mean if your face is right there and you took a full-power turning side kick to the face he'll get Brandon he's so Jack now he's so thick this is uh yeah this is the one when he Kayode the dude and kicked him to the head when his on the ground marijuana beat Frank me I was like I'm taking light heavyweight I know it over but you know what happened with him man Oh straight left look at this soccer kicks to the back of the head that's just rough those kind of kicks to the back of the header forget that noise random varies a good guide man always a really good guy great guy good guy the fan of his but you know he started out as a heavyweight and then dropped down the light head with the big thing that happened to him in the UFC was he went to this big prolonged contract negotiation while he get paid he want to get paid and when he came back to tremendous amount of pressure on him he just didn't perform the same as he did before then he fought Fabrizio Fabricio Werdum got on top of them and put the squish down on him a beat the shit out of him Fabrizio zount Oh hmm this should be interesting John Blaha mark Goddard again in the motherfucking house who is the gentleman that laho bitch is fighting Devin Clark I do not know mr. Clark there's the Golden Snitch right to the left well I didn't see him he made apparent check and piss right he's got a magnifying glass you don't have a hit on breaking vials shake in the posture you should have a hit on him it should be IMG or WMV rather right dude you're fucking up our business they should find that Russian dude that they got in hiding Jeffy did a great job but we're going a different direction we got a different job for you kick rocks no your no keep them on you don't want to fire them because then they'll talk some shit Jeff we you have new job you actually marketing yeah amazing market yeah we need to run the social media mister you have them run the UFC Performance Institute yeah hey pissed boy you just stick hey piss boy you stay at the UFC Institute now and just keep your mouth shut you know what you're gonna make your make shakes now you're making shakes with UFC no no no you got to give them a prestigious position no we caught we say it's prestigious then just do that and we pay you out the ass - shut the fuck up how much make some hemp protein shake - just a fucked up yeah just have them monitor the dudes that are on the treadmill yeah job guys there you go guys put that hose in your mouth when they run with the hose like what are you fucking Rocky cold towel you guys need coal Valley that should be as gay golfing at this boy oh that UFC Performance Institute is fucking amazing I haven't seen it oh shit you know the next UFC in Vegas you should come with me and we'll we'll take a trip I wouldn't go I went there did you a couple weeks ago you had a meeting there a little fight pass right about a bi and combat you get - how'd that go good good good you know we're still doing negotiations about combat jiu-jitsu which is in three weeks but it's looking good and so then it's like they've been doing a lot of promotion I know EBI on fight pass yeah like during the fights totally we've had some times promotion they sat us down the saddest and said listen look what we do for you they put all presentation does every time we mention you guys on this show or that show boom you know how much that's worth they broke it down for us and we're like fuck hmm that's pretty badass so yes are you are you contract negotiations and that's what's going on um combat jujitsu is a new it's a it's an offshoot it to spin off from EBI it's a hundred percent combat you sell that with loam strikes and you don't sell that to place we're putting on the show and the UFC wants to be part of it and I just really can't explain exactly how but we're we're gonna figure it out within the next we got you and but if you don't know what combat jujitsu is it's basically in between sub only jiu-jitsu and MMA it's not MMA but it's not sub only it's right there it's it's for jiu-jitsu fanatics who are just interested in seeing you know there's there's like guys that are really into kickboxing and they know everything about kickboxing but they'll watch MMA a little bit you know what I mean but there look there in the kick box and they're in the business you know and then there's guys like that in boxing sure watch a little MMA well there's guys like that in jiu-jitsu too a lot of guys in jiu-jitsu do not watch the UFC you know why because they're so into jiu-jitsu they want to see jiu-jitsu there are lots of jiu-jitsu and MMA but they're not interested in kickboxing just like a kickboxing guy is not interested in watching just watches sure so there's a lot of different genres and combat justice for the jiu-jitsu freak that wants to watch jiu-jitsu competition with a little more realism a little bit closer to MMA when you add palm strikes the importance of each position changes tremendously like in the sub-game well well in the sub only game that's one aspect in the sub only game the fool guard is not important at all if you never want to play full guard that's on you you don't have to you could win Abu Dhabi in the point system without ever playing full guard you could win full guard is so not important in sub only and in point grappling just by what you're allowed to do were you allowed to do why is he punch at all no yeah it's palm strikes it's only aren't when we long standing it's just wrestling mm-hmm it's not MMA right it's not extreme jiu-jitsu you got a look at it so wrestling is just standing it's just wrestling but as soon as someone hits the ground you can start throwing palm strikes right you know but no elbows to the body no punches just pop no hands rights to the bodies nothing the palm strikes so it's like remember the old Gracie in action videos yeah with all those challenge matches in Brazil they had rules are like they were just palm strikes and jiu-jitsu mm-hmm those were rules so after we did the first combat Jiu Jitsu tournament at EBI 11 that's when I first introduced it Horry and Gracie calls me I never talked to Horry and Gracie love whoever he cauldros Gracie to get my number he wanted to call me and I'm on the phone with Horry and grace and he's thanking me for putting together combat you did to Eddie this is how we used to do it in Brazil I wanted Halleck to do this but I could not do this this is what we wanted thank you this is the real jiu-jitsu you know I'm like holy shit the guy who invented the UFC correct calls me a smart man and what happened that makes a fist it's a foul it's like a foul and you're not taking away like like 10asians well it's still it's still no points we call this finish only because in the first ten minutes if there's not a submission or a TKO I mean or that that's the only way you could finish then we go into overtime like EBI overtime but there's gonna be a finish so we call it finish so we get knocked up yeah we did - we did - four man tournaments we did a girl won the last show and we did a a TBI 11 like six months ago we did the first one now we're doing a whole show combat you did two worlds one a whole show and Gary tonin's gonna be in it Vagner Roach is gonna be in it so tomorrow you're gonna see Gary tonin and Vagner Rocha going at it EBI style and then three weeks later you're gonna see them going at it with palm strikes how cool is that the palm strikes is interesting because you remember when bas Rutten burst on the scene in in pancrase was like motherfuckers on fire with palm strikes yes has he figured out instead of swinging like a bitch when he figured out if you pulled the palm strikes and throw punches just you throwing punches like his hand yes yeah I started doing a lot of it so bah no no that was the rules yeah I know I know but he was said but even when he went to MMA he said he would keep the same thing even if it was a rule or not because said he wouldn't break his hand well you definitely can't threw a lot of punches in him for sure but you still throw hooks and stuff with open hand it's not look it's it's the thing about the palm is it's not much softer than punching somebody but you don't hurt your hand at all yeah like if you got a guy like bas Rutten who really knows how to do it well like boss has weird wrists he could pull his hand way further than I can like he pulls his hands way back like he gets his hand like back there so he's basically just fucking palms on it you know that's embarrassing yes so people so what happens with common jujitsu is we the importance of the positions change when all of a sudden when there's palm strikes full guard is garden straddle yeah guard would be trouble can't be half guard unnecessary in all of you Jitsu there's guys that win Abu Dhabi multiple times never put anybody in there full guard it's so unnecessary but when there's palm strikes it's the most important so it's better to prepare for MMA with that that was that's another reason so aspiring grapplers that want to start working on like MMA type Jiu Jitsu and Jiu Jitsu positions and focus on the positions that are going to translate to MMA better combat Jiu Jitsu will get there many sense they'll get to practice they'll get to practice Emma made you Jitsu without worrying about my getting head kicked or something you know what I mean that's what it's for it's for the the Jiu Jitsu fanatics that they they like to see MMA when there's Jiu Jitsu well with combat you did so it's gonna be mostly jujitsu well you know whenever they like move rules around on combat sports it makes it interesting like that's what they did with k1 they took muy Thai and they said you know I want this clinch you guys clinch two months the elbows cut people up you know knees to the let's cut all the the fucking clinch with the knees to the face like holding and mean and let's just have it turn into kick box yeah make it better yeah they just tried to make it more exciting yeah there's gonna be four guys that like MMA when there's jiu-jitsu in it now we're gonna get pure animate style Jiu Jitsu and we don't have to worry about the strike we love Muay Thai we love all that but this is just for the hardcore jiu-jitsu guys we're gonna get some a lot of data on what leg lock positions are gonna go out the door crunch it's in the sub only game shit you can go for any goddamn leg lock you want but when they're striking we're gonna on now at that one right that one's too risky let's just stick with these right here and that's what we're gonna find guys working their ground-and-pound yeah guys like getting a bag and just fucking BAM can I pop can I like you know I'm in guard I'm on top can i posture up yes as long as the guys on the ground you could stand up you could be in a horse stance in throw punch ah damn tomorrow it tomorrow at EBI 13 it's a regular sub only 16 man tournament but we're also having a four we're having a four man combat jujitsu tournament with Richie Martinez we just missed the knockout youngbleaux it's just knock somebody up he's bodied up - he's a real Fett with a body yeah he's Jack he's very wide yeah he is so those old watch would happen in the replay my name is a couple leg days whatever just stopped the fight for some reason and then they came back didn't wreck right away knocked him out or something they stopped it then we're like going you know yeah like I miss the way he stopped it I was trying to reset the clock I looked back up um huh it's over well we'll give a look at the replay here um here we go left hook took counter that wobble them oh all these just in the choke oh god I'm gonna standing joke Wow the capacity okay that's pretty dope it's better than a knockout right there sweet he's all messed up and the chokes that's way more dramatic than a knockout right there you got sent to the rear naked choke against the fence no hooks somebody had some ridiculous elbow knockout yesterday Oh No how about Heather Hardy Oh have you seen this Eddie so she was a ridiculous boxer I mean one of the best female boxer of all time it's like hey I want to try MMA she had a good first fight my square garden she fought last night this girl had three fights but I know the girl had 0x3 amatuer amature Minh this is a pro debut in gallery but she's a kickboxer and she kicked this girl's fuckin face Heather rolled like you Heather rolled like a doing box in that girl went oh well the girl was beating her ass before that did you see her elbows yes Heather was like what are these yeah she didn't know what to do she thought she was in a safe position and also the girl was lighting her up from the outside with kicks she was a kickboxing champion undefeated in kickboxing undefeated in Taekwondo I think undefeated in boxing so the girl like knew how to strike I root for Heather me you hear her story it's fuckin fascinating what's her story well she was living with her I think her mom her grandma and she had a daughter and they're all living like a one-bedroom place in New York and she was like I'm going fucking crazy be in the house with the baby I just need an hour to go work out so I was like oh there's a boxing gym down the street she goes walks in the boxing gym starts to work out and they're like damn you're not bad at this boom Jason you know you know a monster it's because she had run into that chick monster well box and I think Heather would I don't know that girl could fight man yeah super high level box she is yeah that girl can box too she is an undefeated kickboxing record as well as a monster but her control of distance was what's important and when she was standing in front of her she would kick and then she'd moved to another angle she makes it stop and Heather just want to kind of get in close and play that dirty boxing game well the big thing was the distance you know Christina Williams was fighting completely outside I mean if you've got to close the distance and you can't throw kicks like if you're a boxer and you can't throw kicks and the other person can box a little and they can kick good like this girl can you're fucked man those kicks hit you a couple times in the arms and all sudden those arms don't work so good anymore you know and then your super take getting the rhythm then you see Heather there she tried rolling like you do from the left hook and I'm like that and that fucking kick hit her so hard man Shin right to the face her nose is just destroyed like she's never gonna look the same again it's a pretty girl - yeah they're gonna have to redo her it's a bummer that you know their belt or spank on her to kind of be the next big thing to carry that one Division where there's not that a law skills er but that kind of loss is a tough one because you get your face caved in again your face caved in is not just loose I'm not signboard style yeah nice has been a page it's just yeah the face is so fucked up like that like you just got to wonder like how long would take before that girl could even fight again did you see Michael venom page professional boxing debut granted them oh fuck he fought was four and seventy whatever he merked that dude and he did it in a weird way yeah hands down leaped for the strike blasted him and then just stepped on the ropes and looked away how exciting is that kid he's fun man he would be a big star in the UFC in bout the ranch ups yeah yeah I'm Bellator they just they just do not get the credit that they deserve I mean I agree no one gets the credit they deserve but you know he's a big star over there like in London he's big Kim and Paul Daley is gonna happen oh yeah well I hope it happens it's gonna happen it is a video chamber you find a video of the the player it is it's kind of crazy what she does this is style so stepping into it so much momentum behind that Rory McDonald's on my Showtime on how you'd like to fight him eventually yeah be a fun fight although for dismantling wrestling shoes was just pick him apart he would dismantle him the problem is Rory is not easy to hit he's he's very good on it's boy if stay behind the jab if he wants to be got a hold of Michael Michaels fucked which is his deal yeah he's just too high level Rory has just one of the most comprehensive games 170-pound division in the world he's the best welterweight in the world he very well could be got a thing of CJ he beat Woodley yeah but they lost you know to me I think you know what man ha fell dos Anjos fighting Robbie Lawler god damn that's a good fight good fight they were gonna learn a lot about dos Santos at 170 dos Anjos at 170 looks like a fucking murderer scary it looks like the same guy at 155 I think when when he was making that mad Ron at 155 you know when he got to the end and he lost Alvarez he was just cutting too much way he couldn't do it anymore too much way but now you see him at 170 five he looks more comfortable he's got more power and he's beating the fuck out of people when she ate Neil Magny hell fuck Rams room like it was like a world champion fighting a journeyman that's what it was like I wouldn't have a journeyman I was like in listen I love you now but it looked like fucking amateur hour yeah he smashed him well Neil's always gonna have problems with the real elite guys in the ground elite grapplers it's just that's his downfall it's an Achilles heel everyone else he influx with you know health and Gasland he's beat top-level guys but if they're really really good on the ground but let's be honest but why beat Kelvin Kelvin was overweight and he came in and he tried to cut too much weight and he was just diminished I think Kelvin in shape is just way too much for him that's my opinion I just think Kelvin is one of the best in the world I'm not saying I'm saying but matchup wise the Kelvin unit 70s can be a tough fight for Kelvin Kelvin can do things to him that he can't do - Kelvin Kelvin knocks people dead and he doesn't needle is like got incredible cardio long reach but he just kind of picks guys up on range you know it was deeper rounds most impressed with him was when he fought and dressed her Hector Lombard yes his Lombard had him dead he had in my quarters I mean talk about Neal but he beat actor Lombard Johny Hendricks and Kelvin gasps yep yep yes he's definitely a world-class fighter but that's how good dos Santos is dos Anjos kicked him one time two legs his legs went well when he took him flying to be fuckin took him down the leg kick ate his ass up hey leg kicked him to the ground I mean have you seen the size of dos Anjos his legs at 172 its mom she's so much bigger it's just so much healthier for him these I just Dana said something recently that he doesn't think that more weight classes are the solution to weight cutting Ida's what's the solution whatever doing is not working because there's no one misses more weight than that 55 and 70 well how about Kevin Lee I mean Kevin if they're if they've got everything locked down how does Kevin Lee barely make it to 155 and looks like he's on death door and he's 19 pounds over two days who has it locked down you're saying I'm saying they don't have it locked no it's the biggest issue well besides Allah other things but it's one of the biggest issues in our sport and now we have in the set kevin has said he can't do it anymore he's gonna he's gonna move up he said this weight cut damn you said that yeah he's gonna move up the staff in helping don't say that yeah yeah you just gotta do same-day weighing yeah he nobody will take a chance no one would kill themselves of it same day way and they wouldn't take a chance that's how that's why I like IBJJF does that EBI does that same day you're gonna take a chance you can't take a chance you just gotta compete at what you're really at can kill myself I'll have 24 hours to recover yeah you don't have like IBJJF they make you weigh in and then you fight right look at him there but you know I love Kevin he knows but you know Tony cut a bunch of weight he figured it yeah Tony was like three pounds over like a couple days out yeah but that's two weeks for Tony Tony goes down he has it down this he's a soldier dude I mean but they don't fucking but it also if you're Dana you you need more weight classes cuz it's fuckin your your business up cuz could be I mean yeah we can't put any money on them you get Connors never gonna find him he's not fighting Tony next Tony don't want to fight like a man Barbosa maybe who's gonna fight bar buzzing beep yeah apparently he's got according to Cormier he's got a new nutritionist and the nutritious has got him on point well it's a discipline issue it's got to keep the tiramisu yeah tiramisu I don't give a fuck if you know it's definitely a discipline issue but it's also a psychological issue you think Tony's gonna fight Conor you think that's going down I passed it pastor I wanna make a toast Conor made that post too Tony you know any recent yeah the GTA pose yeah Grand Theft Auto with him holding a gun driving a boat cuz Tony did it first just talking that at first right well Tony was talking shit about him called a McNugget yeah but Tony Bossi's a shit but didn't Tony originally post the GTA meme and then Conor responded with his or vice-versa I think it's vice versa I think Connor went out Tony look Connor smart he realizes that Tony's a unusual eccentric character yeah he's wrote Tony Connor is an unusual axilla got a bag in the back Conner's an unusual eccentric character Tony's an unusual eccentric character - and Tony look Tony has the longest win streak in the UFC's 155-pound division he is the interim champion and he's the logical fine one ten in a row for god sakes and the toughest division in the world he's a bad motherfucker no doubt here's the vitamin champion here's the problem with that and I I won humber cent think Connor has to fight Tony an ex if you want to be taken serious and your legacy you have to fight Tony but if you're tough if you're Connors business the decision makers you're going we get Tony's draw for pay-per-view though it's tough for us to sell this thing well yes but not with Connor like Connor sells like fucking crazy and Connor versus Tony sells because Tony's a legit threat Connor versus my mom sells right but Connor versus a legit threat sells what Connor fighting someone sells but Connor versus a legit threat is where it gets Tony is the big fight that's the pick for the steal all right who are you kidding he's arrived everybody he's a character yeah but Eddie that's right but the papers numbers were fucking ter awful very terrible well well you know but don't get me wrong it's two to tango it does right Connor but you're the biggest name on a planet everybody respects him in the game because they know he's a beast he's coming up fucking people live choking people out left and right they know he's a beast but the world really didn't know him yet you know what I mean the world doesn't know either and there was a lot now the world knows Tony there was a lot of stores a lot of contributions heavens Tony the whole world doesn't know Tony but the MMA world knows Tony for sure but the regular people with the people that you need to get a hold of in order to really buy pay-per-views because the world knows Nate and that's where that's a businessman WM ease go well let's do Nate which if you look at any poll I did a poll here who wanted you to poll MMA junkie everyone goes no Tony first since the fucking fight you're talking hundreds of thousands of votes people go Tony fridge the next fight but W means gonna put the money's over here yeah but the Nate fights not calling me when and how long again let Conor play this kind of weird make up a fight game you know thing with Nate Nate made four million bucks over two fights and he don't give a fuck he's like pay me you gotta pay me but he's gonna pay for what you're you've lost for you last seven you know I'm saying yeah but he beat Conor and then the second fight he arguably had a draw with Conor but he lost it's very he lost a decision based on a couple of people's opinion but I think if us all that matters Joe but it doesn't matter it doesn't public opinion means a lot if you went online and you asked people who you think won that fight I bet you would get very close to 5050 Nate versus Connor doesn't matter the win-loss it does matter in terms of how you sell the fight it doesn't because to sell the fight if Nate would have won if those three people and had Nate winning you don't have a third fight after he'd be twice in a row sure after you beat Mei Eddie Alvarez you absolutely could have a third fight yeah absolutely especially not beat him twice not true not true especially if he beat him by the same decision if they had the exact same fight and Nate won that decision which was entirely feasible right the second fight was so close you could easily have given it to Nate if Nate wins that second fight she's beat him twice in a row you know think after Connor knocks out Eddie Alvarez the way he did if Connor fought Alvarez knocked him out you don't think you could sell a third fight because it was so goddamn razor close god oh and two I guess here you're looking at the numbers of you see the problem with decisions is these decisions are solidified by three people that oftentimes don't even have a fucking background in MMA correct this is judging zalem for all the time that doesn't mean a lot to me what it means a lot to me is how close the fight was that's what means a lot to me if a guy goes over to see me tough sell me on trilogy what do we have more cards from that fight yeah 47 47 48 47 48 47 that's it's fucking close as it gets it's a majority decision one guy scored to draw Glenn Trowbridge I do not remember what I thought whether I thought it was went to Connor or went to you know what I don't think I've watched it again I'm pretty sure I only watch that fight well it was a close fucking fight super razor close we've seen decisions like in fights that weren't as close go to the other but no one got robbed in that fight I wouldn't say Nate got robbed I would say that it's a controversial decision because it's any time you have a majority decision there's some controversy to it but my point is you could easily sell that fight even if Connor even if needed one I think there's other sites bigger fights if you know what is what is a bigger fight if Nate fought Connor you don't do you think there's a bigger fight than that if you're saying hold on Joe what do you say I'm trying to fight you so you're saying if Nate beat them twice the third fights gonna be a big fight right now I think you see this beat'em stuff it's the same exact fight okay the same exact fight takes place god damn man when they lose the same exact fight the same exact fight those three random fucking people they decide you know what this 4747 I'm gonna go 48 47 Diaz and then the 48 47 goes you know what I think it's the opposite I think it's 40 it's an amazing world it's not a make-believe world because it's entirely feasible that could if that never happened and Tony Christ are you listening to me it's entirely possible that could have happened in the exact same fight it's still the same fight the say the fight was very close though these guys were rivals man and Nate choked him the fuck out in the corral right that's always going to be there so even if Connor like got real close Connor such a superstar that if he lost a close decision in the second fight you could absolutely make an argument for a third fight especially with one or two spectacular performances like the Eddie Oliver so if we're going off that we can do any fight let's dig let's do Josie Aldo you could say that was a freak act at 13 seconds let's run that back that's a huge drive for sure and then let's run Eddie Alvarez back if he beats just engage he beat the shit out of Eddie Alvarez and then knocked him out Eddie was never in that fight all just was because he took it on six weeks six day notice not a bad idea but chadsey what's not saying I don't understand what you're saying I'm just saying and the the Nate fight you could have went either way but that it didn't happen so you can make ain't Connor in any fights can be big but when in losing does matter at the entity to the to the general population it does matter it does matter but when the fights are the exact say you could easily see the the decision go one way or the other like you know there's fights you've watched where you say you know what the guy got the decision but man I don't agree with it you just said shot with Mousasi for sure yeah it happens all the time that's part of the game I look at that if I if I look at a fight like that I absolutely want to see that fight again I don't care if one guy got a decision from three people that I don't agree with that's fine and I guess we're kind of saying the same thing I'm saying a me fight Connor does it's gonna be big well the he any fight Connor my big but I think we both agree that the big money's in the Nate Diaz fight correct and it's not the smart fight to do the big money would be in the Nate Diaz fight even if they beat him in the second fight I really don't think so I disagree with you there I do because I think Connors a giant superstar he's not gonna be less of a superstar and I think Nate would be a bigger star how many times encounter lose to earth more money if Nate beat him in the second fight I think wow I think Nate would be a bigger star Tony and this is about his biggest fight you can get a lightweight division Tony in UFC history and UFC history Tony against water and that's like Duran or seal and I don't think it's the biggest fight but I think it's not what the picture is like it's up there it's what the place among the best lightweight beautiful Connors coming off with the Floyd Mayweather hundred people no don't let's say if Nate first of all ready before you rip my head off I agree Tony and Conor one hopes of sight next he's a star in our world in the pot in the big world he's not he's a star oh yes you start let's say hold on a second you think you can go to the gas station right now and go hey man who's Tony Ferguson depends on the guy who's there election sure doc if you go to the average person asked them who Nate Diaz is way more people gonna know who he is then Tony know now hear me out Joe what is the reality why do they Floyd Mayweather's is still a bigger name then they could do that or they could do a rematch and have another big fight bigger than Kukui but I'm talking about for the UFC fuck everyone outside the UFC UFC has millions and millions of won Nate's a bigger name all over the world all over the world there's he has the interim belt he has to fight him I know you what did you discuss this discussion right as if in terms of like as a purist correct but Joe what if this is a fan I'm right as your average UFC Finnick what if Nate fought Barbosa Orca beep and beat them think how big that Nate fight would be with Conor then that's a big if though the problem with out is Nate's loss or time out if world right now we're talking we're not honor lost but we're not but we're not right now because we're talking about what pieces are in play right now like what wait what do we have right in front of so we're gonna do right now so if you're doing it right now Nate well if you're going by what the fans have voted Tony would be the fight that the first one but this is the fans that listen to Ariel Helwani or you these are hardcore people in order to make money you have to get those people and then you got to get the people who know it peripherally well then they do so Paulie Malignaggi is the next fight no they don't you know Paulie Malignaggi how dear usually they know until he fights but unless Connor fights in boxing but that's a bonds yeah but I mean what book they've taken all that out of context Nate is the bigger fight no matter how we paint this picture yeah the RIT the fight you should do is Tony though do you think that Paulie Malignaggi versus Connor is a bigot Tony new sunglasses do you think that Paulie Malignaggi versus Connor is a bigger fight in boxing then Nate versus Connor is in MMA I think whatever Connor does is but I think I think Nate versus Connor is bigger in MMA then Paulie versus Connor isn't boxing ok yeah yeah because because paulie's not like a Floyd Mayweather where he's gonna get all those boxing fans Paulie was good he's the big names on Showtime but he's not Floyd me writing yeah it's just yeah the whole Nate frickin fan base you got the Conner fan base then you have WWE behind that with the hype machine yeah and they know they've severely lightened that but the sanctions on weed yeah but but if your W and me you're going what are we gonna make the Morton I'm sorry knife your W if your Connors business planners you're going how do we make the most money it's a McGregor promotion in achtung we're gonna make more money doing that fighting Pauly not safer than fighting Nate or fighting guns true but if Connor loses two in a row in boxing that severely diminishes his star in MMA cut back to MMA and by the way they'll strip him of his belt if he fights another we got a strip but they ain't doing shit to him hey do us see who's gonna do it he does whatever he wants you might find it heavyweight if you wanted to they're gonna do shit to me is too much of a draw but Tony or Nate is it dangerous fight either fight as a total phony Tony and Nate are more dangerous than fighting poly what does that mean oh and it assigned to them GTA post what is this saying doesn't say anything there's no comment I don't think monumental is that that's just yeah just that I mean regardless there's a Tony Ferguson yes tony has his Tony might have been the first one to do it I think Tony Ferguson I don't see one oh there it is snapped out City no that's not it is there it is right there it's a video or something he's running with bears in Big Bear that's funny I liked that he trains up there man it's really interesting does he always rent the same place up the rent different different houses so he just goes like Airbnb roommates after a month and a half a clue how many we stay up there six weeks something like that guy's got phenomena I've already oh he was so common that fight - it's like he knew that Kevin was just gonna eventually fade out did he know about Kevin staph infection no but I noticed it right when he got in the Octagon as soon as he got on the Octagon I'm like dude has staff oh yeah the way Tony responded to it they said did you know he had stabbed because yeah I was trying to punch it as a target I noticed it I was calling it on the I can't believe you said something would you think about the fight why did you think I wouldn't say I don't know I don't kiss if you didn't know his staff I was like ah fuck I knew it was staff I like that looks like staff see staff enough times yeah yeah I know what staff looks like I'm like daddy good that's a bad boy yeah when he saw staff Michael he's super screwed already was a tough matchup Maddox and nori didn't go on antibiotics he said he did I know he said he didn't he said he didn't take the antibiotics didn't wanted to wreck his cardio but the staff itself Rex you I thought Tony looked amazing no he did look amazing but here's the thing when I was saying it and I said to DC I go hey man I go that looks like staff to me that work staff and DC's like yeah Oates except someone was in DC's ear saying don't say anything someone was telling them in the production don't go that step this is before before anybody I noticed it before anybody I noticed it immediately he took his shirt off he ran to the Octagon I'm like that's - so the truck saw that roar the truck was saying to DC don't say anything in DC's like yeah that looks like staff he said it anyway you gotta acknowledge it you know we didn't do well he did an interview where he said that they brought it up like someone said it to him he's like no I'm gonna talk about it anyway you have to we're just gonna ignore fucking staff it's a huge it's also a huge issue did Tony like wash himself with bleach and shit afterwards jumped in the shower yeah man did he have defense hope I don't know gee I hope so defense hope makes these little wipes - he's fine he was on staff look at the size of that fucking staph infection I forgot he had a mounted well I forgot to end of the first round he escaped though yeah Kevin's a talented fuckin dude he's young look at the size of that staph infection though Jesus Christ we're stuff I've ever seen that's a huge huge pus-filled fucking know how bodied up is that dude by the way for reals jacked how would it fuck did he make 155 - because he looks all of 190 look at their dad on the scale yeah you like the Cryptkeeper he look very bad but that's a terrible staph infection I'll tell you what a Toni verse Connors a fun matchup man sure it's a great fight tony has survivability he's got crazy you gotta kill and he's great he's crazy in a good way he has crazy were you gonna have to kill him he can get things off from everywhere he can beat you from the ground he could beat you standing he knocked you out he throws these weird off-angle punches he's got a great chin this super durable elbows from the guard that was what changed so talented yeah that's where Kevin was and you know most fighters don't know this they think that you know in the mouth 12 to 6 is illegal right these straight down but not the upside down mount is full guard 6 to 12 there's still the 12 to 6 like they're on their back those are totally legal direct most fighters still don't know that metal ball which is strange they don't throw them but you know who was the master of that shit Jose Pele Landi og he was the first Anderson Silva Chute Boxe that was the first one Anderson Silva was like his little Protege wholly paid a hose a Pele Landi we need fought macaca back in the late 90s and Vala to to Mecca and all that so knuckle remember that in high school gyms they had a rivalry Mitaka was up he still fights now macaco is a jujitsu guy and Pele was the muay thai guy but anytime a Kaka would take him down in full guard Pele would put his feet on his hips and throw those 12 to 6 feet guard and fucking would brutalize let some power it's like you didn't want to take this if that's all you focused on isn't the fools trained a lot of it this is hard to train those but we you know in full guard would say remember always always you look at Ben Saunders it's part of the game yeah rubber garden elbows they work hand in hand when Jason Day fought Alan Belcher examines exactly you were Jason day versus Alan Belcher he threw like 22 elbows from Mission Control it's part of the system if you can't get it you can't get him in a position where you want them just get the Michigan throat and throw elbows but in the situation Antonis fight Kevin Lee didn't want to stay on his feet he wanted Tony on the ground so when you have a situation like that where Tony is winning the stand up he wants to stand up but you got a restaurant top of you now you can really you can put your feet on the hips because if Kevin wanted to keep the fight standing let's say he was beating Tony standing there Tony putting his feet on the hips would be bad because then Kevin would stand up and now we got to drag him to the ground again but since Kevin didn't want to stand now you're free to throw those twelve to six on the bottom you put the feet on the hips and because he because kevin has to put the pressure so it's perfect you just hold yourself up and you can't even fire back when you got your feet your knees are blocking the shoulders so dudes can't even fire back and if you set the pace first he's got a block he doesn't have time to throw cuz you're coming straight with those elbows you watched that fight Kevin was he was confused with the elbows that through everything that's what set up the submission I'll tell you what's interesting is in the fight with Tony Connors hits next if Tony goes you know what I'm gonna do my weird movement but I'm chin grapple the fuck kadia you don't know how good of a fight you have because Tony's a amazing wrestler people don't realize yeah I'll give a restless it so because it fight for Conor I'll tell you that if if Tony doesn't want to be good fight if Tony goes you know what you think you're the best standing up I think I'm the best watch this you have a classic gun hands but if Tony goes I'm just gonna back my wrestling days you're fucked it's not great for Conor he finishes him it's great if he gets Conor to ground beats him up and such dogs and for Conor kotone it's great another well I think it's a dangerous fight for Conor I think it's a very dangerous for both guys super danger for Conor yeah Tony's the most dangerous guy in I mean that division by far you know he doesn't do anything that about judging about we're talking about the arbitrary three people I think I think that's a very flawed system and I think it's completely unnecessary today I think today with access to voting and online you can vote not a fan vote a vote of experts a panel of experts you get a bunch of Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts that are you know also MMA journalists different referees and judges have a panel of like you know I can you know what's going on how does the Academy Awards work I don't know how it works but I would assume it's a bunch of people that are it is now we're in the business a good idea Joe yes great idea that's different taking the wine sneezes oh man crazy right documentary and an open secret watch that keep hearing about the open secret was about it's about it's about Hollywood managers who do manage kids it's a racket man and these kids dude strange things stranger things he date just let he just left his manager and they're alleging sexual abuse they let just left their agent see if you could find that Owen Beverly here kid oh yeah he's in the engine just put it on his Instagram today because Owen has been taking a lot of heat online because he said that a three-year-old kid shouldn't be fucking transgender and people giving him a hard time saying he's a bigot like you got your fucking mind when stranger things after dropped agent because of sex accused of sexual assault Disney star falls suit Jesus Christ this is nuts watch an open secret and they tell they go through he do they pick their acquittal it's on it's for free I think on Vimeo yeah you can watch it for free on a secret stand 2% a man you know what Sturgill Simpson told me he said the same thing exists in music why is it in music there's a bunch of pedos and pet around the entertainment business all the way through music that this was about music and movies and TV it's about the whole women women and kids most of the kids and sometimes dudes you know Terry Crews said that he was attacked or not attacked some dude grab his grab his dick in front of my famous dude grabbed his dick you know what that who was that fucking big-time football player that was in that weird movie with John Travolta Howie long how he long said the exact same shit was absolutely ever happen how he likes dick guys were coming after Howie long guys we were propositioning him trying to tell him this is what you have to do to making the movie business suck dick or no else it happened to Hulk Hogan same thing no way yeah Cody molested Tony Logan got propositioned by a high-level movie person that told him this is how the game is played and did he do it - - that's why he's not in movies or tell you what we got guys who are killing it super skeptical hit me yeah she comes out now Donald sterling look at these beautiful black bodies what is that something that I heard about before he got in trouble that this is why a lot of players didn't want to play for him because he was known to bring people down in the locker room to look at his players showering and whatnot oh like super on cheese why is everyone so fucking creepy why can't you be cool be cool man hey man my idea about we go back watch your kids watch with motherfucking don't let your kids be around weird fucking agents and don't let your kids get into acting do not let your kids get in as it should we worked out well you know the other thing is like look at what happened with that Sandusky guy that guy was taking care of kids like his whole thing was like hey I do charitable work with children you know I do charitable work and I took your summer yeah I'm just I'm just all about helping kids it's all about helping kids like our future how about Callan what the summer camp does dick sucked my counselor I think you got jacked off his friend guys dig site what's that famous guys a famous dude in the UK who died and they found out what's that guy's name Jimmy Savile was like like he was super famous yes super famous what he did he had a big talk show in in England bring him over years like Benny Hill yeah that's the guy no show no shit he fucked look at the picture above him look at that picture about with the red glasses above with the crazy hair one more oh my god you left your kid alone with that fucking guy you should be slapped imagine that guy putting his dick in your mouth is there a documentary on him yeah yeah what's that called shit kept this a secret for a long time because this guy was like a big star over there look at his motherfucker put a secret like the media the people decart on with him like everyone knew that what about rose well go back to what about law enforcement in the UK you know name thrus knew Jimmy Savile civil then I say it Savile documentary is a horrible step Oh Louis Theroux is awesome I doubt that he fucked anything up that guy makes some of the best fucking documentaries going he's a month it's probably some yeah someone's a hater exactly Donald Cerrone a yeah so many photos yeah man there is a lot of Remy Savile gropes teenager and newly released Louis through footage powerfully seen the stuff that Joe Biden you know Joe Biden the former vice president do there's videos on him like at the White House and taking pictures with kids dude have you seen that shit I was like groping him and shit I just think he's super awkward those guys run when you're untouchable when there's no way you're gonna get busted for anything murderer child molestation dude you don't give a fuck you just don't give a fuck who you are you grabbed my kid anywhere appropriate there's a lot he's like dude sick bastard it looks like we said they're muffs then just told her secret yeah the problem is you takin like a screenshot of yours I've seen know I've heard the audio you could hear that what he says to these what is he saying creepy ass shit I get like white like do they just he just keeps see he's taking pictures all these kids and he's just like I just whispering in their ear and oh you're beautiful fee of a big government creep oh these are stills but there's actually video this shit within this is by the way what you're seeing in public right yeah you don't care they don't stop they doesn't care it's just that's a small version of probably what he's like behind closed doors if you're if you're big Hollywood actor maybe you're not and you didn't get sexually harassed I like pissed off right you know I'm saying like what the fuck if you're an actress and you worked with Harvey Weinstein every fuck is wrong with my face they're really going after him that seems weird doesn't seem weird dude but he'll yeah we're going after a guy's entire business here's the thing he's one of many there's got to be like a bunch of people that ran their business that Weinstein if they say like in Hollywood like my a just like oh no yeah it's about time you got calmly what the fuck everyone knew this like everyone knew did you see her contract it was in his contract the way he had his contract set up was like they had a certain amount of money that he would have to pay if he had a sexual harassment claim against him it was like it was a thing for him yes like he had so many claims that's like first offense was a hundred thousand second two hundred fifty thousand third offense was seven or fifty thousand dollars for third fourth offense was a million what had it written into his fucking contract come here max his contract with the Weinstein Company like he's a whole new man I don't know explain that contract like they'd have to he'd have to pay a hundred thousands yes okay they're protecting themselves oh when they sign shall rest when they I am they go okay the first time it's no yes I mean he was it was something a problem yes it was such a huge it was so known of what he would do and look even quit and Tarantino said that he did it to his ex-girlfriend why Tarantino said he knew about it I did it to Mira Sorvino dude and could Harvey Weinstein get any fucking unclear why he's got a young ass why so he looks like a troll he no he what he looks like is a sexual predator in a Harvey Weinstein moving correct like it like it was a shitty Lifetime movie like that come on let's do a little bit on that lacks unrealistic he's hideous I think you know what I think they look so bad look listen the girls that he's harassing them most of them bitches are fucking trash anyways you know what I mean oh no no here's what I see they're distracted what about the kids fuck them bitches what about the kids let's focus on that those girls are trash this is actress but here's the question here's the problem with what Whitney told me Whitney yes she knows she knows her shit what she said is there's a lot of girls that aren't saying a word because they did fuck him and the chorus for parts they fucked him for like editing of course spit him for a lot of things for him that's the rumor but that this is like a standard thing that Weinstein would do and women agree to it because he was a powerful motherfucker that could get them the world I'll hold up with however many whatever fifty girls are coming out with claims against them he's probably fucked five thousand and art coming out I think they'd probably arraigned ridiculously hot girls we all know about now what I suck his dick to be the next Batman yeah probably man Donald Cerrone damn you need to focus on the kids there we go well that's that's certainly an issue but Harvey but the necessary a fuck for parts you know what I mean well don't remember Bryan Singer remember that guy who's the x-men guy that guy got busted because some 17 year old boy was saying that he got used by him at a party and they would pass him around to all their friends why had all these booties what guy Bryan Singer that's miles no no x-men oh my bed fix file since I'm not the guy with x-files no x-men yeah that's a famous director yeah that's the guy he's in the movie an open secret I'm sure what's about it's about him hold up he was just some dude like that Sarah Newlin here he goes look at that the sad turn behind LA party scene that took down Bryan Singer like he would have all these like young boys with them and there's a picture of them at a pool it is fucking hilarious there's like look hi scroll back up look at this picture like look at him and all these young boys Tim on the right it's him above with the glasses oh or no the one with the arm wrapped around looks like yellow bastard glasses him with his arm wrapped Oh gotcha wrapped around that boy look his hand on the kids chest my kid looks like he's off sixteen right so there's a picture of him at a party that he threw at his place that is hilarious because that party has all these young twinks in a pool and the pools lights are red like like they butt fuck so much that they just bled out and the whole pool became red look at that fucked man that's party a brother they all are they all underage no probably not but well there's nothing wrong with if the Nilan know how many of them war but some of them apparently were under it holy shit it just seems like it's a cock fest if you're a young boy and you're trying to be an actor in Hollywood or a singer how you gonna avoid that shit look at these fucking parties all these guys are hands on each other well if the thing about gay guys right is like a lot of gay guys like guys that look younger they like like cute guy twink so you don't they call me twinks you don't have a lot of hair which really funny because ND what the fuck's his name from the guy from that runs Bravo was I Oh Andy : yeah that guy he got in trouble for saying twink and he's gay really yeah he's gay shit he's what's doing everything twink is like a thin hairless like well brilliant young skin died sorry here's Darren till walking into the Octagon let's actually watch this fight because you get creeped out we all have kids and I feel sick it makes it makes me sick Jesus Christ man yeah well corey feldman apparently has been talking a lot about it too well you know it's crazy but the question is why is he crazy yeah like is he crazy because he was molested I mean he doesn't say he doesn't name names but maybe he will if someone said 80% of kids in Hollywood or in the entertainment business have had some kind of run-in with someone trying to molest him would you believe it yes eighty percent yeah I would say maybe I don't know I don't want to give out crazy numbers I would say a large number I would it be psycho because I think there's agents as legitimate managers and I think Disney has a pretty great record shows they're probably legit but those ones don't get any work it just seems like it's like they just hook each other up and they're just looking for you know some of them do there's definitely predators that are organized definitely no one ever maybe the advance is that you Joe no never not no not like hey come give me about a comic John said he got molested in Hollywood now Alex Jones talked about that probably roofing himself walked it to him he was in that remember he was in that movie with Keanu Rami he was in a movie with Keanu Ria's yeah that one animated yeah wait a week or something well life waking light yeah it was a great movie was in that he was driving this is before anybody knew who Alex was and I was friends with him even back then but he they animated him ranting driving down the street see you play some of that place of it there it is of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line lay down GI lay down GI we saw it all through the 20th century and now on the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze we should not submit my favorite all-time Alex Jones clip keeps getting man swearing then he says I apologize so he did that one movie got molested out instantly even even though he was animated they molested his hey that's what he said on a show he's I don't know if it was during that movie bus is at least 10% crazy though you agree right what was that he's at least 10% crazy he's a butt on the stuff that he reports I would say about 85% correct that's probably a good number at least 80 right yeah 80 percent he's talking about some stuff that's probably jet occasionally he goes off the rails and yeah that hurt something but that's okay it can't be a hundred percent right no but the problem is he's always looking for conspiracies that might not exist and then people can discredit him because of the misses yeah it takes you sweets I hit a home run that was true you know what when you're we're making all these accusations you know against criminals a couple of them are not gonna stick you know and you might be wrong about a couple murders here and there but they're still murderers so we should focus on the fact that Alex Jones on Infowars if you if you think that's a fake news station to get then you've been brainwashed cuz that's where most of the truth is coming from it's coming from in Forza my men and the mainstream media the mainstream media is trying to convince you that Infowars is 100% fake news when there's a fake news bro my man Cowboys needs to propecia don't ya a little bit looks like it's hearsay and see a cowboy really I love cowboy when you see I like to see your cowboy part I thought that was funny Brendan see ya oh maybe no one has a receding hairline like that I do my shits way worse look at mine no it is not addy I like the new hairstyle you're rocking I like that yeah you look like you look like a guy from Fury you seen that movie you copy freshly haircut I do it all the time but when you see me it grows out a little bit right once every two months I cut my hair we got a big day tomorrow Denny's doing combat jujitsu tomorrow oh shit really yeah we uh we put together a special match it's an alternate match for the four-man tournament that boogeyman is doing boogeyman is doing combat jujitsu oh we should think about that shit and then Danny is fighting another black belt in just an alternate single match which is gonna be like a little super fight so let me tell you what Vinnie Sherman says about this goddamned tale because Vinnie Sherman is very high on them you know Vinnie's a big-time Muay Thai commentator he knows a lot of shit about Muay Thai till Zaman said Darren Till was beating men at 15 years of age rent to Romanian won an eight-man tournament fought two fights with a broken foot at 17 started training over there Colin Herron from kaboom a guy was super Thai boxer himself now successful MMA gym known as Colin for 30 years a top coach till till super determined living in Brazil - and he's a real rags to riches story he got stabbed here to go to Brazil cuz he got stabbed why this guy right here yeah in Liverpool his coaches I killed me if you won't be successful you need to move to Brazil move to Brazil when I'm defeated there just because so much shit let me get stabbed another party yeah people are so fucking crazy yeah I just you know he's running with a rough lot of stabbings going on there's I saw crazy statistic where the stabbing is through the roof right and no one's been denied getting stabbed and shot well if you ban knives how you gonna cut your steak all right here we go Darren till cowboy Cerrone ooh here we go here we go scissors gonna start big till is first of all yes fuck he's legit 2-8 and Donald just swung and missed with a leg kick and Donald's a slow starter man till ste it's a trouble fight till it's got some goodness O'Donnell went for the takedown till he'll take down the fence good very good till defended such a dangerous guard right there tells a super high-level kickboxer you see good distance control already oh yeah just tagged him he clipped him not not cleaned you're here how to get this oh my god oh she's gotta come for that Donald if you're gonna beat him kill him sit back and get comfortable well he's a bigger fighter too oh shit dude oh just ingdom this this is a bad fun I gotta take you've got a chute and pull guard here yeah this is a bad fun I got a shot point guard oh my god yeah tagged what else have we does it move his head man the Cowboys firing back Cowboys 9 out of it you gotta remember all the times Cowboys been in trouble in the past he's a slow starter man once he gets going in trouble this guy legitimately might be the best striker there is chance right here jump on his back oh we've got a good feet get ups Chris Hill man you know I'm saying like putts in some weird Brazil fights I'm sure he's been taking down a bunch good defense back up his feet I don't know anything about this guy fuck I did I didn't either at first and I talked shit about him he lashed out at me I did my research like oh fuck this kid isn't his main event let's talk to shit about him good deal the body boy what's his name again Darren till Darren till fascinating story poster here's the thing like Donald has been doing a lot of other shit too hasn't he been doing a movie movie yeah tell me clipped him TV show right lo cooked him an uppercut there and then yet young till who's a monster who's just this is all he's thinking about the biggest life nice jab by till looking very good and good good distance control on the feet how relaxed he is for his first main events crazy and he's fucking I can't get over how big he is oh dude he's tuned in cowboy up and he just doesn't respect Cowboys stress hands are low look at how low his hands are he doesn't really give well you got to think cowboy striking is good for MMA but at the level that you know you're talking about like glory or you know lion fight like real high level muy Thai guys how far did he go what did he do Darrin what I was just saying what a missed an tournament in Romania oh fuck that ended its nest Vinny Sherman who's a bit I'm trying to watch this and talk at the same time Vinny Sherman oh that's a good kick to the body now boy Feeny Sherman is very high on this guy he says he's a very legit Muay Thai fighter like the people are in the know and the business are super-high in there until super super you're seeing it here just from this distance control and his footwork and movement like every time Cowboys trying to kick him he's just sliding away yeah he's beautiful right jab - and he's a southpaw 200 left he's set up will land that uppercut he's done that twice - cowboy Oh stuck him down Cowboys getting lit up man he's getting bit up and he's not having much success you know if you're the UFC then you're looking for you know fresh stars and new blood this is what you're doing it yeah it is what you do in Cowboys the guy that will fight anybody anywhere flies to fucking Poland to find this kid you know and and said I didn't watch any footage on him I don't know shit about him I heard he's a good stand-up good I love to strike which is why we love countably but it's a double-edged sword and yeah well especially is when you're a big name like Cowboys a huge name so for cowboy to fight this guy who is arguably one of the best strikers he's ever fought and he didn't really look into a much but it does nothing for cowboys so you'd be able to be the guy we've never heard of you lose oh we just got hurt you just got hurt Darren just lit him up this fucking Oh bro this kid fucking Cowboys no more trouble knees till Cowboys in big trouble oh shit this is that that's it that's it cowboy just got stopped first round smashed ran through what a story a story - contender here once that just ran through cowboy just about ran through him what about walking right yeah just just smash Pingala Cerrone was just smashed him this guy has the the ability that maybe you know contend for the belt take them aside him he's only 24 just 24 with it that extensive of of shaking and he just made it he just turned into a fucking star at least in our small group of MMA this is on fight pass right there might drop what he found people watching let's talking about it might not even be 40,000 but I has done it this is bigger than that like however watching this you put a youtube video taking a piss what it gets more of you we have 40,000 watching on here yeah we're being like 2,000 remember those days 100 1500 but when I look at that elbow we landed on Jesus Christ oh dude he tuned cowboy up I mean that is just an absolute beating I hate seeing it for cowboy like and this is the reason why Cowboys so big but then it's also like you fuck you man cuz you're never gonna be world champion fighting like this well it's also cowboy has had a few of these fights recently MOSFET I'll beat the shit out of them you know the Robbie Lawler fight his last fight was a rough fight well some people think you know I don't think how we won that fight but it was a controversial fight to get back to the judges yes you know some people think cowboy were strong I think how they lost that fight I think we lost too because especially like Robbie really came on strong in that last round the first round if you have ten eight it'd be a draw but Cowboys shaking his head his nose is smashed we lost three in a row brother yeah that's a rough go when your cowboys age lost three in a row and just got murked by a young kid a 24-year old kid just lit him on fire 24-year old stud though lease is not just some random fucking yeah well you don't fight randoms in poland though right well he should be at 55 he's a 55 yeah I mean he's one of those guys that went up to 170 like dos anos and generally though it doesn't work though I mean not that often how heavenly KY Cowboys kill yourself at 55 but he was dominant at 55 cowboy never champion he got closed her a belt at 70 they did 55 tell me well I mean he lost the belt at 55 places when everybody got smoked to worry about how the Cowboys show ends because cowboy getting stopped like that in this fight like you got to wonder how many more of those are we gonna see and what what is that what tolls are gonna take on cowboy because of that style that he has you know because the fact that he's willing to fight anybody and because the fact that he spends his money like water you know Amy play the like it's cowboy like that's the persona he has your cowboy fight anyone anywhere and then what does that I know that's what I'm saying is no I'm with you got to worry about how this how this story ends because when you're 34 you don't get younger you just get older but he's still a name so how many more fights will they give him who let this do that that that fucking right left combo he just landed on him we should back this up and watch it again because he tuned I'd love to hear what till saying look at this bolo that was that right there I was wicked I can't get over how fucking baked this kid is man for that weight class give me some volume Jaime he's giving cowboy a lot of love he's amazing for that as well Dan Hardy speaks English too he knows what's he saying you know English English from England Mike Perry like mike beier jump in that fucking cage you will fuck was that guy Mike Perry Platinum Mike Perry he's a tough guys and knockout artist he knocked out Jake Ellenberger man job and out struck him til wood piece him up I think he's crazy man he is crazy but skill wise he's nowhere near just not even on the same same planet not even in the same part of all he does is really box yeah well he's an animal I mean Mike Perry's a fuckin animal no doubt of all is the English is strong guy some serious power page from here Perry's from Florida yeah strong guy with serious power but he's in he's way out when he fights like a really good striker like Joe Bansal footwork this they just avoid the big shot and just pick him apart yeah but but if you play that game he will not get a fucking Pluto this is a different guy though this Darren till is this is a different guy just what I wish Norman was saying you know what I was the remote run that bitch back let's watch this again I wish they would enough so they can't cuz you need the fight on fight pass but I wish they would air it like tomorrow on Fox Sports oh you kids so tell you it's like more recognition cuz how many people are gonna see this beatdown that's a good question but the thing is like if they aired on Fox Sports as Fox Sports on it then how does that work you do systems got a Brazilian flag with his English flag yeah it's ray is there for a while training that's why eight years I think allow men eight years so he was like a little kid when he went over that is so nuts he's 24 years old and some other fuckers already this good goddamn what says dome come on man that is so crisp what show did he come up on no going back to this Vinny just texted me says I told you he is special well but but a lot of oddsmakers barely had Cowboys the favorite Cowboys like a minus 120 so there's a reason for it you know yeah people in the know know tills a fucking monster boo crazy shit man if this rating called out Mike Perry after either maybe just once you another win but Mike there's that crazy round in jujitsu I don't know it's a good question take down the fence Raziel yeah use their long he also speaks Portuguese I'm sure so have them fight Brazil it'd be interesting right yeah brick I think the Brazilians would totally love them look at this shit you could just put up some stuff from your phone yeah let's uh let's watch the fight again fucking towers noses Winant merica I think I don't think you can yeah you can but you have to use the remote and click on it and then scroll backwards just doing that is it because it's streaming yeah I think so mmm still going on that yet can't buy stuff that's still going on yeah Cowboys nose looks fucked he looks fucked yeah nose I feel yeah me too is it my phone yeah it is my phone I love cowboy take a smite like that you know but it's what we're saying it's like how does that story end how does this story end yeah but how does this story end is very different than how's the George st. Pierre story and George st. Pierre retires now he's coming back fighting Bisping the cowboy story's different because cowboy was never the champion and he loves this rough-and-tumble life you know he loves the fact that he can just you know get on a flight and fight in Poland and go and kick this young kids ass but when it doesn't work out like this like he just made a star like he let a dude become a star off him like for guys like us and people that visit the websites look at that fucking straight one too man and that elbow in the clinch he is setting him up with a lot of shit to like was throwing the straight left but then turning it into an uppercut yeah Oh God has wrapped it on him too I wish we had another angle of that it's work - this fights before this you would see a stamp stand up is good but he was winning my decisions you want a split decision he had a draw really yeah what maybe maybe knocking people's socks off early on maybe cowboy had a terrible training camp or maybe the jet lag just might think this dude's just realizing yeah he's that good he's 24 and he's also realizing just watching his movement in this I'm not saying cowboy at AB at training camp I'm saying this kids a motherfucker the way he landed that uppercut the way he landed that one - that jab left like Mike Perry asked him for this fight it's like I guess he's their dose he'll melt him out I know this is one year item no because he's a name Mike Perry's a name time from cowboy to Perry those good fight fun fight lets him like he's gonna fight a brawler lets him show his skills I mean I would think that's a good fight for him look this dude's just an a great matchup for me yeah that's a great matchup for he has a fight already though Matt was he had a fight um at that I forget but he I'm pretty sure there's a match up already interesting very interesting just a difference in the level of technique you know and what till can do he could do everything you know he's not just a guy just Wade's in and throws haymakers I mean he's like very very technically proficient besides look kid he could get fucking knocked out Mike Perry can knock out anybody you fuck up and you Zig when you should have zagged there you go that's a good fight that's a fucking tough fight for him to that's a great Santiago pawn Zenobia yeah I just did a gunner yes with the finger poke but still yeah that was a fucked up thought there was more than one finger poke well you beat a five finger poke yeah I'd be with my finger poke we stopped him yeah the finger pokes we're so fucked up yeah so fucked up and when you see the replay of the finger pokes you like wait a minute it almost looks like he threw it as a part of his combination like I've worked on see that fight I'm gonna ever get him to the ground no going up fuck my house early on from the I pokes like if you don't watch it like in slow-mo if you just watch it oh my god gunner looks like shitty skin Rock what's going on here you go back watching slow-mo it's just I hope against the cage poke muhfuckas do an uppercut like that this fucking poked both eyes here's the stoppage again ding ding ding oh man the elbow already did it everything did it I mean you just beat the shit out of a man and cowboy just crumpled one time you saw a cowboy do this this is like doscientos yeah do some double pedal is just a kick to the body yeah but he crumbled you know I'm saying the competition rough man Ralph heartbreaking yeah I'm fucking real heartbreaker man but for that kid you know that's a great story good kid too and obviously you got to build stars that's how you do it I mean that fight pass but yes that's what happened on 5 knows that it's not the way to do this UFC give out the numbers on 5 pass like do they tell you nope didn't even tell you it they're like like thanks yeah no numbers smart move all right why give it up when you don't give it up if you're killing it so okay let's look at this man I mean shit dude Bisping vs. GSP now I'm hearing that that's not selling well what you asked we're done from what I've heard - it's not doing great hmm that's unfortunate doesn't make us if you just you know I'm not doing great GSP miss Bisby is not doing great not like you'd think though here's the thing though if you like top if you really stop and think about it that was four years ago is the last time you fought Johny Hendricks the people that are into the UFC now host Ronda Rousey and post Conor McGregor like the casual fans host Lesnar the hot the hardcore fans like you and i we're gonna go we're gonna watch that fight for sure like okay I'm gonna see what Bisping looks like you know fighting a guy like George st. Pierre is smaller than him guys taken four years off Bisping's got this opportunity to make a shitload of money and then George how's George gonna look it's a tough salamat four years it's a tough sell even for the hardcore fan like oh that's a great fight that's a great fight this being at GSP is gonna be a great fight for sure keep even even now people keep they don't give Bisping the respect I agree he's not gonna get it even if he beats GSP that's the problem I took four years off when he's a 7 year he might and it doesn't matter it doesn't sell two billion fuck the dudes that the casual fans fuck them just just we got enough no you don't care you job all we care about is the matchups that's a good matchup no you don't know it does or doesn't work like but we don't run the business so for us Eddie's right I agree with Eddie as long as they're putting these fights on I think it's a great fight alright so you two would rather watch the GSP was taking four years off fight for the middleweight title than him fight a guy who's an actual champion 85 like right first of all Whitaker is injured and he can't fight right now Whitaker has a pretty serious tear in his knee ligament so that's one thing this is also an opportunity for Bisping who's been in the game forever to make a shitload of money I like that I like Michael I like the fact that Michael is an opera to make a fuckload of money here I like this one because lol no Donnell needed to sound well man yeah you do if you want to make but if you want to make money that's yeah but I'm not in the business to sell on pay-per-view as well I'm in the business I know but you just said you want him to make a lot of money well he's gonna make a lot of money either way he's gonna make more money in this fight I'll guarantee there's some sort of a guarantee like pay these points where you make your money like you're rich you're life-changing monies pay-per-view points yeah ask Mighty Mouse ask John Joe it's asked Conor McGregor I'm sure but don't you think that George st. Pierre is at least gonna do half a million pay-per-view buys maybe more I like to think so I'm the heartbreak if he doesn't I like to think he's gonna do at least a half a million more sure this thing about seven his stuffs weird me out man weird shit that he's doing with her they're touching things with his moving things and touching things with his feet have you seen how jacked he looks like jacked he looks super small what if he pisses on he I don't think he cares I think if he's just one and done he's like yeah I fought whatever I'm gon see ya no I did not know you when you get pop you get up your money your win money taking away 25% yeah they take some of your mom only 25% though even if you won yeah like it Lesnar my bat hunt 25% here you go gimme this yeah I'm very curious about this fight very curious yep I'm listen I'm balls deep in it I mean I think it's it's a fun fight it's not the fight that much harder to take people down these days to it is the GSP was taking everyone down five years ago this means it's a damn tough to take yeah yeah it's gonna be a little harder I don't I'm not sure the GSP is gonna be able to take people down like you did five years ago I'm not sure I'll be right I'll take this matchup it's all rights by nowhere near the best fight on the card you look at that card it's a fucking heater you think that's a recent picture of George no not at all no not at all I think it is you think he looks like his good little soft like look we just saw Kevin Lee he's thicker than the Snickers down there Yeah right thick that's that's a okay Johnny Hendrix in that bed kind of heavy like around the middle yeah eating a lot but there's a there's a big difference between that and Kevin Lee right Kevin Lee was ggggg jacked jacked when he was on top that picture of him on top but Tony when he's dropping bombs on him jacked jacked George does not look that good but then again if he's clean which he kind of has to be have to be I think he's 35 now he's not young how old is George I mean he's 35 you can deal with me in great shape at 35 but really it completely helps if you were super active for a long time are we looking at the tip of his dick in that picture what's that all about he has a fat dick if that so why don't you guys Photoshop that out please that's all I can see you like Perry here first of all send that fucking jacket in a time machine back to the anything I have that jacket but crank the volume up and this Jamie let's see what he has to say he's gonna drop some f-bombs again to it man he's up he sounds like a rapper yeah well it's got a tattoo above his eyebrow something's about to drop some sick beat Donald is a Merck beer double-dip it look great they should keep Mike Perry off the microphone from now on okay hey I think I love it enjoying limp Biskit what does that mean what sounds like a white rapper is right what's that guy's name the guy with the bowtie I don't know buddy seems scared he's like it seemed scared to say anything this makes me uncomfortable [Music] like he looks mad at the world with that face very similar style I mean not similar at all so I guess they both throw punches correct we're talking about that fight when you have a huge fight look at him rocking back to fourth I like him very intense that motherfucker hits it's like a Mack truck he's like yeah he reminds me a lot of Linacre he's just a fucking nightmare to get hit by but if you can avoid it easy gameplay Jake Ellenberger fight man when it caught jake with that big fucking that november 4th guards first of all Kody garment Dillashaw fucking ridiculous very very interesting Jhoanna rose ridiculous that's ridiculous dude wonderboy Bosma don't fuck love it then the big rings back big mistake house he might make wait I can't promise you but he's back yeah he's at Jacksons now yeah it's like that's like don't move into Florida when you're older I'm gonna try a real camp yeah let's try this out it was interesting listen to what Johny Hendricks are saying about training in Texas he was like I gotta be careful when I spar with people because if I go do hard then they won't come back looks like training - you gotta find a real camp yeah what like any camp everybody go do ha - yeah fuck dumb boys go to a let me know how that goes so that's what he was saying he was saying finally I can go to Jackson's and I'm getting pushed he's like where I am in Texas I'm just not getting pushed but he left he left that team takedown remember they had some gnarly dudes there he left them there was a lot of shit going on with that though you know how that worked yeah he had a weird deal where they're like 20 percent of all the 50 yeah they took like they gave him a salary and then they took like half as money like they but the thing is the guy put a lot of money in everything so I see his perspective - it's like they put together a training facility they put they hired all these coaches they had all the stuff going on they paid for everything they gave him a salary and then when it came time you know for that investment to pay off they wanted half the money and I don't know how they how they you know worked it out if you're Johny Hendricks own you're a national champion from Oklahoma State and someone's like hey we're vet you want to take 50% right fuck you man right well I think what happened was you know once he started getting that world championship money you know that's probably 150 percent then he opened the big rig steakhouse was yes god bless that's the problem that's the bigger problem opening a restaurant is like notoriously one of the worst investments you could ever make that's where a lot of celebrities go under gyms are bad right but gyms don't have the same kind of overhead that a restaurant does and the dynamics of arrest yeah they just don't go well and if you get a couple of bad reviews you don't bounce back or son unless it's a Mexican restaurant you don't have to have a clean restaurant if it's Mexican for not making money you don't have to be nice you know show up to El Torito what was that place on Fairfax in is it nothing Torito is that place lost Bonnie knows bonito bonitos show up and it's like the little taco shop and there's a Mexican guy in the back he's making a burrito and you said hey and he looks over you go hey can I get two corner disorders and the guy just kind of looks at your knees like waves at you here are kind of just nods at you and you're cool there's gonna be a great place that was a white guy that did that they'd be shut if it's good I'll put up with it they're so good my nose is 24 hours a day zit on Beverly on Beverly and Fairfax so go you call me cracker make my braids ah it's so good that place is off the charts good yeah and it's a 24-hour joint so it's like a late-night appro space though chicken burrito stop Oh you'll go there one o'clock in the morning you might wait 20 minutes in line because there's a big house line there's the Mexican restaurant in the valley that closed down for a week because they got shut down for like rodent infestation it wasn't a newspaper and everything as soon as they reopen we were waiting and I'm like Backstreet Boys tickets yesterday we don't give a shit it closed down the kitchen because they had too much too many rodents hey man if it's good to I'll put up with it man I'll put up with messed it up and Chinese food same thing they don't have to be nice you know you go to Chinese food and there's like you there's a big group you guys are like mean and shit [Laughter] but if it's white oh you can't do why you gotta be high of course you have to be really nice if your y-you know what I need to get back to there's a fucking Thai place that Rob came and took me to in Thai town you know where Thai town is I guess it's on Hollywood or Suns sunset our home in a Hollywood Hollywood when you go east if you go east on Hollywood there's a whole section of lets you know where it's from it's right across the street from Jumbo's clown room you know that strip club Jumbo's that's everybody which makes fun of it I don't know anything about stripper clothes yeah I hear you that's what I hear but it's right across the street and it's like legit good legit I know you've eaten there Eddy I know we've eaten there to get a Hollywood Boulevard are you new toy no not that place oh that's on Sunset okay you're talking about what Street and get further down Hollywood yes it's on Hollywood type patio maybe right inside Hollywood Boulevard on the north side you know it is you know how you go down Hollywood and it goes you almost have like that arch that you pass through that takes you into like Thai town arge isn't there an arch wants to be black fucker want to be black look at them today's video of this video what a non sequitur by the way Jamie just does she talk black yeah the Maury Povich Show can you change your race he's still killed he's like quietly making million Martina desperately wanted to look like Pamela Anderson oh okay fairs in several cosmetic surgeries Martina transformed her looks and do this [Applause] the crowd wasn't Germans months ago Martina made worldwide headlines a shocking transformation chemical injections and body modification Martina now considers herself a black woman she's not a beautiful body pretty bad like a Bobby with long brown hair and long necks but much bigger breasts Martina began to dream about having plastic surgery to look like her idol Pamela Anderson oh my god this place is crazy if you look nothing like look at those fucking basketball that's what it is well the teeth make sense Wow Wow I got absolute biggest titties I've ever seen they're so stupid looking just to sit down Martina was ready for her most shopping and the owner scanned the fake tan they just went over didn't did a lot of fake time never see no fake tan there she goes look at those stupid tits those tits are just preposterous God we are sick does she use the n-word I mean I've heard of people doing fake things I'm worried before checking them just making up a story so hold on but those tits can't be faked what is she saying hold on maybe they can be if you have the curves yeah more so you wanted you look like Pamela Anderson because you like her and so then you became what you thought was Pamela Anderson and then a bit more but now fake faked it thing like that goes over her shoulders and arms that's how they do it in movies yeah it could be sure doesn't look like it was this era neck black black gods rum black slash girls rock girls girls well look at that so dark I want to see her boyfriend dress fucks maybe there's a boyfriend in there no there's no boyfriend are you sure there's no what she says there's no boyfriend no boyfriend shown his face what the fuck I see her skin is black yeah you're not a black person but here's the thing all people came from Africa originally like the only reason why people have white skin at all is cuz we moved to colder climates it were more cloudy and we didn't have vitamin D so you basically like a solar panel for vitamin D that's what white people are that's why people in England are so fucking pale because it's always raining and that's exactly what it is like everyone came from Africa all human beings came from Africa so she's not really black cuz it's not really her natural skin colour she but dude that is the greatest thing you've ever said for mankind she's not a lot of reasons it's a giant problem that people have with this idea of race like the only reason why people look different is because we moved to different climates like everyone comes out of the same thing sort of like all dogs come from wolves all humans come from Africa all of them everybody originated there that's the motherland so like the only reason why they look different than you is because of natural selection that the people that live there that you know you're obviously you need that melanin your skin to protect you from the Sun that's how people evolved and then as soon as people started going to all these colder climates and all these climates that have a lot of cloud cover you the people's body started changing and their body started changing to try to absorb more vitamin D that's exactly why people have white skin can they can they take hyenas and breed them to be like miniatures they could yeah for sure I saw a guy with a pet honey you know they did it with foxes they've done it with foxes and taking foxes and really quickly within 10 years turn them into a completely different thing with a weak jaw and like floppy ears like to be pets yeah well they did what they did was they took foxes and when they had a fox that exhibited any aggression at all they killed it and so then they would breed them again and then any Fox it showed any aggression at all killed it and then they kept doing this and they were doing this generation after generation to try to see how many generations it would take to turn a fox into like a really docile sort of house pet sort of a stupid study it's not stupid because it's fascinating to find out how long it takes because we thought it would take like hundreds of years for an animal to change it's essentially its appearance like its its physical appearance is very different than a regular Fox change their coloration change how their ears their ears don't stick up anymore they flop down and show submissiveness same with dogs right like all dogs come from wolves in the original wolves that people kept as pets they would just get closer they're the ones who got closer to the people by the campfire the people would feed those wolves and then they would use those wolves to alert them to other animals were coming nearby the Wolves stayed close to the campfire because the Wolves knew that people were going to give them food then the Wolves started protecting those people because that's where their food source was and the people worked out this relationship with wolves what country this is the human race before there was country esra go this is probably you know we're talking more than ten thousand years with the Fox that he was how long ago very recently I think it was in Russia I think that's where they did the job we're not doing that American and so they is a ruthless study but they found out pretty quickly that you can you can select you can change the way these things look based on which ones you breed with which ones and you got to think when people migrated Out of Africa and they moved across Asia and moved through the Bering Strait into North America they made they're dealing with brutal cold a lot of times they're completely covered up because it's so fucking cold what is that the dogs Oh cutie face they're very playful those little guys even in the walk to the pen you ever see grizzly man with the dude made friends with a fox like a wild fox in grizzly man was like stole his hat was playing with him he's true sin has ever died right yeah yeah yeah fucked up about those flying foxes what the fuck is up with that flying squirrels I mean I think the flying foxes mmm no somehow finds there's these weird gigantic Fox looking vulture bat things in Australia the city you can just see them in there they're series oh yeah they have like a fox face yeah they carry a fuck and they're just like right there those things are sweetest rally is so radical Adam green tree who's sending me videos you took of these saltwater crocodiles whoa that a regular bat it was trillion flying foxes it's just sometimes yes Pro flying fox oh you're right is it crazy foxes that what's it call a bat that they call it at everything look it look it looks just like a fox it's the Fox with Wade Shin so just in Sydney just hanging on the truth being is sick that is insane well you know how like we always look at nothing pterodactyls you know we look at pterodactyls and we always assume that they have wings like a bat that's what everybody was thought but now they're finding out that so many dinosaurs had feathers that it's entirely possible that pterodactyls were Birds did they think the t-rex were covered in feathers too right very possible there's not a lot of evidence there's evidence that some well there's definitely evidence that some dinosaurs had feathers they found fossilized dinosaurs with feathers and but this is all recently over the last few decades they're starting to find more and more of them like it there's there's a museum that I went to in Montana and they mocked out a Velociraptor with feathers because look birds like like you look at like an owl that's a fucking dinosaur they're the closest thing to a diagnosis thing to a dinosaur they're ruthless dude did I tell you about the fucking the war that I'm having in my backyard that's what dude there's Fox war a nut Fox Wars there's a hawk Wars going on in my dog owners are killing each other and birds are killing other birds and they behead them so I started going online of reading about and they eat their head and I'm like what the fuck eats a Hawks head well apparently when birds of prey will kill other birds one of the things they do is eat their head they eat the headache they pull the head of show like dumb no no no man I don't know what's going on but Jesus Christ but one of my neighbors saw a hawk eating a hawk baby like right up the street from me and I watched these Hawks like swooped down and one of them slammed in my chicken coop like there's like these juvenile hawks and I think one of the things that's going on is I have a fence in my backyard and it's we just put up a glass fence and these birds just fucking we've marked like 15 Birds why'd you pay this fence it looks beautiful you see the whole view with these birds they don't understand that it's a fence and they swoop down so you playing and they get K the fuck oh just had travel video camera the security you know a lot of wasted footage cuz only happens like once a month it's happened quite a few times where birds have flown down we found them just like drunk wandering around the backyard see Jesus the fuck up blood coming out of their nose like a fried them with blood coming out of their nose yeah yeah they get ko'd so I think we've killed a bunch of Hawks this way Hawks have died we haven't killed him to kill himself yeah evolution bitch but these other Hawks these juvenile Hawks are now like kind of taken over because of that I think one of the ones that got killed one of the Hawks that got killed look at that fucker fuck his mom's eatin eating a bird it decapitated a hawk yeah there is he's decapitating a hawk Jesus Christ God they are fucking monsters do this owls are so goddamn ruthless look so cool don't they they do look cool but it's weird that we've made these things out to be these wise cute creatures that like they don't pollute the the Tootsie Roll pop yeah the Tootsie Roll pops matters owls everywhere they're ruthless men they're - I've never seen a straight-up predators really what do you mean everybody see him all the time and no look at this bird he bursts trying to get away like not today bitch birds are fucking Thursday today I will hold you and eat your head butt so I found decapitated bird in my yard and I posted a picture of it on Instagram and then I started reading up on it apparently it's when birds kill other birds they'll do that they literally bite their fucking head off like a territory war thing like a gang thing I think when these burp my theory it's a shitty theory because I'm not really qualified to have a theory on this but I think that these birds slamming into that fence and a few of them dying have kind of upset the the gang situation in my neighborhood bird Ford yeah dude holes are so ruthless and they ain't shit compared to Eagles Eagles are the most ruthless have you ever seen those harpy eagles there are the huge giant they're jooge that gives an Eagles monkeys they go after monkeys and they eat a lot of those little slow thing sloths he was talking sloth man harpy eagle let's fuck them Google harpy eagles eat sloth I think Thursday was official sloth day I think harpy eagles are the biggest Eagles in the world I'm pretty sure that thing is jacked oh yeah they're ruthless look at this motherfucker swoops down what about vultures man they're big they're big they're the scary predators like that sloths are gone that's a bummer it's a rat like the sloth man but nature just made them like real easy to eat but they really don't you fucked with though out of it cuz they're not out nope and I know when they are they get ya shells goddamn slow these these harpy eagles they eat monkeys like crazy they swoop down at Jack monkeys and one of the things they found on ancient primate skulls they found all these weird scratches and all this evidence of predation and now they think that that is like is doing it's a little left and right now they think that that scratching is probably some sort of an ancient eagle that was preying on ancient hominid Jesus Christ yeah birds are a real pile they film this and put this and edited this together come on legs all taken in different years watch them Jack a monkey do what what's the big-ass bird that grabs the goats and drops of eagles those are golden eagles you're seeing that shit Falcons what about Muslim guys with found that falconry yeah they use them to hunt they hunt rabbits and shit talking about that bird that picks up a straight-up kill flies them up like have fun my man boom I'm pretty sure those are golden eagles yeah Golden Eagles hunt goats there's a big guy I think those are the biggest Eagles in North America then you're kind of out of it for that was perfect I know this fucking Birds the battery's dead oh man you ever seen them ones that they use in Mongolia where they chase down wolves those that it right here yeah Fox oh well they do foxes and even wolves but they they train these golden eagle that's a big fucking bird look how big that bird is and they put a GoPro on the bird's head holy shit and they sent the bird down the bird just put the walk down on these poor foxes they eat the flies to the student for the coats they kill him all the people I don't think they eat them they might you know apparently some trappers and pioneers were big on eating Eagles or not Eagles wolves they eat they ate a lot of wolves like some famous trappers like wolves were their favorite food whatever that lady's Eskimo whatever she is stressed out that this thing's not gonna catch it I think that's just what she looks like she's living a hard life son look at that the the look at the fucking Fox trying to find the fight back in those claws are just longer live up to vice grip hope you can get that beacon vault soon on that neck I think they'd have to put the chase in later like they get like like trained foxes and have them running and shit habitual a whistle is that I think that is that exactly what it is yeah that Fox put up or decent fight the wolf one is even more disturbing the Foxes trying man he's trying but it's just give yourself a fight there yeah well not really cuz the Fox can't even bite him they're so smart they just grab ahold of them birds stress me and help me it's just weird they figured out how to train these things man when you call your Eagle stand against the wind oh that makes sense so the Eagle can hear you you want to win you saw if you saw one of those things coming right at you what strike we use that overhand knife string think you got a grapple with an eagle I don't think if you hit them they're they're not heavy enough for it to make like a lot of impact when you hit them you know I'm saying it's not like you're hitting a dog right if you punch a dog in the face a dog weighs 70 pounds that they're both squishes the stance you getting you see you're coming you get hands hands outstretched like this grab the oh I'm checking a rap shit' and I'm trying to tear it apart trying to Rampage Jackson trying to get my feet on its dick and I'm trying to pull them legs yes yeah yeah just try to make some Kentucky Fried Chicken the drumstick a you got to pull those legs apart slam is fucking heaven that you getting Tora maybe this one arm you give them one arm on even take your shirt and wrap that bitch around your arms yeah that's it yeah yeah that's it yeah and you got to grab them talents gotta grab casino I don't think they I don't think they attack with the beak is much they attack with the towns and eat with the beat they come feet first yeah yes like when they catch a salmon how they're gonna get around this think about how powerful they are what if you had to grab a salmon well it's a you know reach in and grab with your hands not a chance they swim you down and fly with it they snatch it out of the water and fly away with a sidelong nails yeah and probably be able to grab them - that's not very cuddly like you know that's it yeah they're fucking evil I mean like tribal cultures that let their nails grow and they sharpen them and they use them as like weapons in war we have bitch nails are nails fall apart you know our nails made one you get them slammed in the middle because we don't use them maybe they're salmon maybe we're supposed to have claws that guy's a beast wow this is different man these things look how long as males are he's gonna give it to ya by these bare hands and eat it raw ooh you're not supposed to really eat salmon sushi even because I'm a parasite the shit out of it it's not smart I feel yeah do you need parasites I feel guys gonna eat it raw yeah well a lot of people do but when you talk to like people that want to play it safe they say you shouldn't eat anything that's freshwater don't eat fresh water well this guy's better you think it's gross but do you like sushi you don't I hate sushi you know like sushi yeah he's got they I used to go when Eddie and I would go to restaurants I used to lose my fucking mind cuz Eddie's like no cilantro onion this shit the meats good why do I need onion and shit on it we need some good meat the best is going to Fogo with him though then there's no bullshit you know you just get zombies for the cottage over to Fogo de Chao he went in Vegas we chatted Kania we gained like fucking 10 pounds guy we feasted sounds nice oh so good I hadn't been there and forever we had a good time sure well you don't really have I was gonna save munchies but when you get high you got me get high so much better than fuck but since you're not got the munchies from pot man I never know I mean not get hungry like normal but pot was it never gave me munchies cuz hot your dog food is way better though that's sure does yeah you're smokin a little bit I mean I do do ya do you use it too right no you don't right no you should try to write stuff yeah since you're doing stand-up you should definitely write hi yeah yeah that's that dude that's right you know what I do though I do both I write sober and I write high I do both and sometimes I Brett listen to George Carlin talk about that once he was saying that he likes to write sober and then he touches everything that punches it up when he's high well that makes sense yeah you smoke a little weed and then go over the material back there well that's funny about it yeah yeah I like both men I like writing writing sober and riding high but when I write high it's like I you just get these gifts it's like the universe gives you these gifts is that funny to when you're high and you look back over when you're so break out what the fuck oh there's definitely that I just have a bit about it but I literally wrote down a unicorn is a donkey from the future and then I went down and looked at my notes what the fuck does that even mean funny thing about it that you didn't write there exactly he forgot I was so high but I wrote it down and then I went over it do you have to Safari it was like what the fuck is wrong with me yeah wrote that down I've heard a bunch of shit down like I have to every now and then because a lot of what I write down if I'm high I'll write down some shit like at the Comedy Store or something like that and then I have to go over my notes when I'm sober I'm like yeah I do and you're felling do it physically it was white physically like with a computer and then I write notes basically with a computer I mean the computer well okay okay physically right like I thought physically was like with a pen no but this is what I would probably wrong way to say it but I have three stages right I write with a computer but then I write things down on paper like if I have to like do a set I write a set list out with paper I'm really interested in this new Samsung man the Samsung Note 8 yeah because the no date you write on the lockscreen you don't even have to open up an applique I like them right on the lockscreen and you write it with a pen you could write like a hundred pages of notes just on the lock screen and you could save them have you seen that shit what is it an apple do that shit that'll jump on Samsung's got it man the Apple gets sued left and right for patents they got sued for these new animated emojis that are coming out with on the iPhone x10 whatever it is can wait my phone so fucking rough right now I need one what year you got which I got the seven plus but gets brought it's horrible it's alright why I've got the eight it's the shit is it nice looks just like this but the cameras way better the cameras wicked and you can get it right now but the thing about the new way that the the X the X is weird man because it doesn't have a fingerprint thing where you open it you open it with your mug with your face stare at your phone and just do this go get the eight right now the eight yes you they right now I need you get that bitch to run the eight is basically this phone but way better yeah it's exact saying this is a seven but the eight is the exact same phone it has like all the sting but I'll tell you what man my phone has been fucking up lately got the old one right yes to Applebee's on purpose don't get that new lady says you need an update I'll do the update cuz they play this game they drop that bug fuck as soon as you update then you're fucked fuck I held it off for a while I'm going super Jesus I'm going super strong my phone not only is it freeze but now when I like say if you sent me a text like today it happened you sent me a text saying which door should I go into and I replied to you and then I went to look at my phone and there was no place to reply it didn't exist I couldn't pull it up so I I went I hit the home button and then I reopened the text messages back to the same thing so I had to physically like swipe up and close out the text message program and then start it up again just to get a dialog where I could like press you know the keys in yeah they wouldn't let me press the keys that's Apple done you do feel like you need yourself an iPhone 8 yeah yeah and I think I think I'm at the six still I don't even know what this that's the three CJ see if you could pull up a video on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 this Galaxy Note 8 has got me very very curious but there's a bunch of things that Apple does that keeps you on the tit yes one of them is that airdrop forever then once I went to it's so easy man it's pretty easy so easy what their job yeah where do you use that I use it all times like like if we made a video right here I would airdrop it to you you can't text because the files so big if you instead of it texting it just goes through bluetooth because you're near me and it sends it to you in full so this is it right here this is the Galaxy Note 8 it's fucking huge and it's all screen they have a little bit of room for like the speakers on it but the screen is gigantic well I like that and they pulled that pan out that pen is so dope dude it lets you do all kinds of shit like if someone sends you a picture you could highlight things with that pen dude you're selling the fuck out of me right now the market you could write notes with your hand see this to me is big because then I don't have to take a notebook with me I don't need an iPad or anything yeah write it like look at this this guy wants to highlight some shit look you could translate things I got another country like do that boom it translates shit for you it charges wirelessly yeah look at them Oh spokes bone from yeah but Joe how does it work if I was from the Apple phones of that does all my shit transfer over no yeah sort of the problem is the real product I tried it with the Google pips pixel just for shits and giggles the real look at that like he's writing notes with that thing come on son on the lockscreen the real problem is I messages so I say if someone's like used to sending UI message I'm sending my messages it doesn't want to send you a text and once it wants to continue to send AI messages and it takes a long time to switch over I actually called up Apple and I said I want you to remove me from the iMessage database like remove my email from iMessage remove me and they said why I say because I got a Google phone they said why did you do that I said that's none of your business bitch remember me motherfucker so they removed me from the iMessage database and it still wouldn't work I mean it would work half a ton it's kind of a bummer that's the deal-breaker for me all the people that had Android phones all work great like yeah but who how many people have Android phones like I know a few people that have you Android phones yeah my friend Ian Edwards has one Steve Rinella has one have a few friends that have androids Remy Warren has one but the majority don't my shoes yeah and you don't get you get I get sad when I see green text I like me - it bums me out he's got one of them I judge people people do judge people somebody some comedian had a bit about it really I'm cooking up with a girl and you know she's broke when you get a green text from her yeah that broke screen like people someone ah dude your phone bums me out I had a friend Sega's all your phone bugs me out man cuz it's broken it's all screens all broke my cases I like that you live in your life yeah you're right another thing that's cool about the green text is the person you're texting with doesn't see that you're like you know that you're texting sometimes the bubble yeah sometimes you're not writing anything you're just reviewing the text your conversation turn and they think that you're writing something and then they they then you see that they're writing something they stop - my wife were I'm about to check something that don't then I don't and it's just like why were you thinking about something and you change your mind about something you're about to write some shit and then it turned off what were you thinking tell me what do you think kissy emoji but I decided now it's not appropriate for this I took off the thing where it says read oh yeah I was just gonna say that that's that's a bad you might not have you might have that on there when you get a text message if you look at it and you send the thing like if you look at it that person knows you looked at it yeah yeah says well like that like that second someone text me I might just go straight to the text you know just see like what their messages cuz yeah I don't have time right you know you know time for everybody's also fucked up the other day I got 39 text messages I counted up from a psycho or but not people in the day 39 I can't keep up with all the time 39 different people text messaged me what is my job just replying texts that's cuz that's my job then I have to sit down and just and then people just go hey what's up like those those don't get a reply hey what's up what's up call me you know these are my family or aunt or or answer their nan question yeah like for me right now I gotta answer these and I'll try to catch up to those you got a 1 you lock yourself away doing a podcast for 3 hours you can have a million messages you don't have time to you got to get in your car this is one of the few times that I guarantee that I'm not going to communicate with anybody any other way this is one of the few times like doing a podcast at this one of the cool things about these kind of conversations like this is the only way we have these conversations like really like even if we're eating dinner we don't have these kind of conversations you're distracted did you check in your phone take shit going on yeah like the art of conversation is lost a lot of people and one of the ways we practice it is by doing these podcast yeah this is like a real hangout yeah and your phone's wrong yes have you had anyone come here try to keep them stay on their phone yes get the phone Rasul Peters cannot leave his phone along I can't be on the show that is you know what it's a bummer everyone got a phone everyone's got a phone and everyone's got a lot of work to do on the goddamn phone it's nice to be able to hang out with somebody and you're like let's just get on our phones together and we'll talk every now and then and I'll show you a video and we're cool and we're not offending anybody everyone's just on your phone right there's nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that and then you know what I mean it's like I want to hang out with you but I got to do business and we could talk when there's something to talk about for sure I got to handle some shit for sure don't you notice from doing a lot of podcasts I would like if you have conversations with some people some people are just not really listening to you not in podcast but in the real world like you get good at this like you you do podcast a lot so you're really good at having conversations but when you go out in the real world and have conversations with people there's motherfuckers that just aren't listening they're just talking they're talking at you they're not responding to what you're saying they're just thinking about what they want to get done their agenda in a test they're like texting someone else in some serious business and they're like no no I mean when you're having a conversation with someone they're not even like tuned into what you're saying like there's a lot of people that are just bad at talking yeah yeah and communicators and those people are bad at podcast every time then I'll get one of those people on a podcast you know are you even here with me yeah like what you were listening to me like it's work yeah it's work because you're contrite accom up and you're trying to like bring them in yeah so we're trying to get them to hook on exactly try Nathan to go to store connect with melis come back come back automatically and not what's a bummer to is the audience feels it oh yeah cuz they're like ah this guy's sucks dude yeah I've talked to people after I had someone on they go hey that guy something's off right yeah yeah as a loss wasn't he's like it seemed like he was on some drugs or something like that's another thing I'm finding it's how many fucking people are on speed so where oh yeah that's not technically crystal meth so for all is meth it really is like does the same thing no it does the same thing but when you're on adderall you're like you got a prescription you don't feel like you're you don't feel like you're a meth head there's a difference between you know right oh yeah there's a difference between them why are all still other teeth for a while not all of them before we start the show this the same guy Tommy caffee is bad for you you don't copy the same thing as coke I say that caffeine is a cousin of coke well they're in the same caffeine they're in the same unless this was mainstream information so maybe it was stimulant but it's really it's like cuz they just put coke in coca-cola then they all will they still use coca leaves to make the flavor do you know that cocaine like the number one provider of medical cocaine is coca-cola do you know how this works coca-cola buys coca leaves they have like Oh you would get cocaine from that's the flavor it's secret to the flavour of coca-cola shit's delicious soda it's just better than but the way they make it is with coca leaves they extract the cocaine from the coca leaves and the company that extracts the cocaine for those coca leaves they sell it to like they use it as medical cocaine Escobar's enterprises it's fuckin crazy man it's crazy it's medical cocaine medical cocaine damn what are you gonna legalize that well-manicured you gotta use your surgeries and shit why do medical cocaine use Mustangs down numbs things like like locally without like you know instead of like novocaine novocaine by the way related to cocaine lidocaine lidocaine I had that shit when I have my nose fixed they put the lidocaine in how many doctors are taking this medical cocaine and doing crazy things with it do you remember Joel wallet you think dead doctors don't lie yeah turn me on yeah you turned me on to that what they was he a cokehead no he was a doctor who's into minerals yes talking to you about how it's weird that people who are veterinarians know that if you have livestock you have to supplement the minerals in the livestock but people don't think about mineral deficiencies in food when you talk about people that have a regular diet yeah especially but they don't have a vegetable rich diet yeah with with animals with livestock you don't have a health insurance so you got a they know farmers know you gotta give them these minerals otherwise your life stocks gonna be shit so there's no but when it comes to humans we don't look at it the same way but you know a lot of people do they understand the importance more minerals and minerals now Joel Wallach one of the things he was talking about is how we put all our faith in doctors when it comes to like health but how little education doctors actually have in nutrition yeah and then how many doctors are doing drugs how many doctors like ones I know pills access to all that you don't know what are they doing what's going on I mean what the one heard of the little ones that I've heard over that hung with I mean they partly party Hardman they've accessed a lot of stuff they make a lot of money yeah the party hard yeah the people go smart yes coke goddamn cocaine what is that adderall an amphetamine and feta mean aspartate yeah it's Joe you're saying you had people you're saying people that come on higher sent all right I've had a bunch of people that I've asked just flat out ass because they're just going yeah they think they're so they talk so fast and it's so much going on like there's no way this guy isn't on speed and then it'll come out later in the conversation that they're on adderall that they take out or all they have a prescription the hills like well I have a TD no oh it's that a DD I got a DD two motherfuckers Crimson yeah I mean what does it have you ever taken at all no I took it and didn't shut the fuck yeah but I couldn't focus on anything I took in college write a paper and someone come in by K how's the pizza I'm gonna fuckin rant about Beats I got nothing done that's like speed yeah speed is supposed to be good for organizing like growing up I was you must the down you lose your teeth well it's not that I think your heart is just like overworked too many beats I think it freaks you out fast pounding or uneven heart beats pain or burning when you urinate that's that's banging chicks that are on speed taking more than usual feelings of extreme happiness or sadness tremors hallucinations unusual behavior or motor tics bit dangerously high-blood eye blood what not terrible let's be real not awful well see there is a lot of people that are on this stuff on a daily basis dangerously high-blood pressure severe headache buzzing in your ears and any more than usual there's a lot of people that are on this a lot like there's an entertainer this let's take it not just entertainment journalism Journal owns a big one this guy who was in here who's a professor actually told me that he knows so many fucking journalists and then I started asking journalists and they confirmed it with me like yeah everybody's on it and I go everybody who's everybody I know that's a successful journalist has taken adderall and so why he goes he's got deadlines you can work you don't get tired you get things you focus because you got like laser beam focus you're abusing any because they're all abusing it damn it's like steroids for writing yeah right peds variety so let me ask you this if you had a guess what's the number of prescriptions every year for Admiral in the United States let's guess say that again the number of prescriptions every year for adderall in the Unites I past anomalous say that's a five million I'm going with 30 million 30 I was gonna 20 to 30 million yeah how many right now how many mattr see they don't do it that way they write prescriptions written so like say hello I see three months worth yeah you might use it four times in a year so you would be four yeah right so let's find out I'm saying thirty I'm gonna go I'm gonna go 2020 let's say live well no one what I said you're still gonna go with five five Eddie come on ten ten don't what - peer pressure bro don't give him stick with 510 stick with five what do we got best I could find us from 2012 and it says roughly 16 million adderall prescriptions are written for adults between 20 and now we're nine well that's not good for 2012 however that's five years ago doesn't include kids kids in school and then in college and are now those probably reporters day hell yeah hmm about 25 years ago those kids are 20 now right there could be 15 another 20 yeah well they were yet this has only started with age 20 so kids that were in high school were sixteen seventeen eighty don't have updated statistics I just tried to type in 2016 and this is an article from 2016 using these nuns Oh interesting very interesting it's just it's crazy because it is speed window you can get it prescribed to you all you have to do is say I'll just can't focus I'm tired all the time I just don't know what to do okay they just write your speed wouldn't it help you in writing t really everything maybe some people say it doesn't help you creatively because you're so like that it's better for like organizing things moving all over Hey to your house like the late great Robert Schimmel do you know Robert channel was stand-up comedian hilarious dear friend great guy died a few years back he accidentally took adderall he was thought it was he had actually had a heart attack and he went to try to thought he was taking his heart medication he took the wrong shit he took someone else's adderall calls doctor and he's like what do I do he goes how much did you take and looks the bottle tells him dose he was gonna be fine he goes you just you're just gonna be up for a while and you're gonna be very speedy and so he just said I just organized my notes he said I just got infront of my computer I couldn't stop organizing just going over my notes and just pulling out page a after news and writing things down he said never and more focused in my life here's what I'm scared to try it again I wonder what's like working out on it a lot of people work out on it we had a lady in here recently who said she works out on it so she gets pumped I goes nuts when I was when I was 19 there was this 23 year old heavy metal chick who had some speed and she was hot at the time and we did a little bit and my dick was so goddamn small and she was she was determined to blow it up I kept saying I'm sorry it won't work it doesn't work it doesn't go to speed she got yeah don't worry I got all day and she was she just went on forever and she did eventually resurrect it not bless it was wicked that's the fucking speed imagine how long it would take imagine when you do speed your dick does not work really I just just shows oh yeah it's terrible I don't recommend it to anybody it was terrible I was young I was 19 she was hot a lot of pool players used to take speed they said it helped their game I did take a bunch of different kinds of speed to focus on the ball Jake there cuz you know pools very like it's a lot of intense focus and like tiny adjustments you're making you got to really like really concentrate on the angles and what you're trying to accomplish it's a very mentally taxing game you're gambling so a lot of these guys they gamble for like 10 12 hour sessions here's a question for your Golden Snitch friend if I have a prescription for adderall fighting UFC no what if I'm crazy crazy crazy Tim crater actually got pulled from a card because he had a real deficit and he was on adderall they pulled him from a card way back in the day no this was like Ultimate Fighter days when he was off the Wild West yeah exactly adderall the new drug of choice of many major leaguers Wow meaning baseball oh no why look this is this is football you're saying that's weird they're showing this is the weird video yeah okay so I've always heard they fuck with that all none after all is legal and easily obtainable but also dangerous if abuse use in Major League has reached absurd level baseball that sir dangers have used but yeah but the thing is like also if you use it you might be the best fucking baseball player alive and make a kajillion dollars it does provide you with energy that you wouldn't normally have it's cheating says dr. Richard lust Berg New York State licensed psychologist and member of the American Psychological Association oh yeah baseball try to make money but yeah it's weird cuz I fifteen years to make money in baseball okay I'm taking I'm injecting a dural into my veins if I'm shooting it right in my dick right with my turkey baster correct but in fighting if you if you legit have a problem yeah but what is that problem see that's the problem that it's never been clearly defined to me I've talked to a bunch of psychologists and psychiatrists about it I'm like what is ADHD I'm like how do you define it and you define it by a series of characteristics that people have but you could just say you have those I mean you could you could complain about all sorts of things that are on the list it's not like they test you like oh no you have syphilis blood type man let me test you oh yeah bro you got a disease it's not like you guys are older me but even when I was a kid like if if you were Acton couldn't sit still you just leave my kids a lot of Energy's needs to play or go outside more like no one was fucking taking it you know medication UFC exact Frank Mir was not denied an adderall therapeutic use exemption by Nevada Athletic Commission so what'd he say he was so he got one so he got one interesting for adderall whose granted one by you sada that's interesting because maybe Tim crater could have been granted it but it was public I'm not saying anything that people don't know about they're all talking about it at the time you know what I think that free for the people who really need it this has got to be very frustrating to see people like use it in abusing no Bryan Callen teen I was like you you have a DD like I've never seen before I'm sorry thing but he's all over the place and he's like golf for sure Ave DD and what the doctor talkers like now you're good yeah I told the fires doctor Ryan's now adderall no he's unknown played it Ross on life Fitzsimmons is on it Brian didn't want he was on he's on actually he's on Ritalin Fitzsimmons on ritalin what's the difference I don't know speed its speedy gas the other day Nizhny was like he does like movement like constantly moving on and someone asked him on Twitter like what's that about he's like ritalin weird yeah and he just went on this to talk that the first part no no no he's been on it because he is legitimately he has legitimate a DD with it which whatever the fuck that I was gonna say we don't know what what isn't a DD means okay let's let's define it like let's try to see if someone has a definition what is legitimate what do you think it is what do you guys think of this I think its own who can't focus on fucking anything and they're distracted by everything well it's also yeah there's definitely that it's also patterns and patterns of like behavior that you develop in your life but this also probably people that have a legitimate does easily they're sitting legitimately something wrong with their brain the question is how many people legitimately have something wrong versus how many people are just abusing it because it's just assholes yeah just wanted you speed get all that energy and get fired up is it possible is there any chance that maybe in some cases ADB or some kind of brain dysfunction is caused by the vaccines maybe is there a possibility that it's a vaccine oh are you taking it there I don't know I don't know there's definitely side effects almost every medication that you take for certain people adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD is a mental health disorder that includes a combination of persistent problems such as difficulty paying attention bryan callen hyperactivity bryan callen adult ADHD penny to unstable relationships poor work or school performance Bryan Callen and low self-esteem the doctor what now you don't have this Epstein can't give it to you bro and other problems what are the other problems we don't even want to talk about those when other problems be specific motherfuckers this is a medical diagnosis but if you read that that's basically every kid you've ever met yeah well here's the problem ever you get kids kids are filled with energy and they want to play and they want to have fun with stimulation once it's in your shit ya talk you they sit in them uncomfortable bullshit plastic chair listen to some monotone asshole who's teaching him nonsense I'm doing the scrolling wrong no it's not the kids issue does I think that's a good part of it but parents want to give it to their kids because they just want the kids to pay attention you know I had a neighbor who got their kid on Ritalin there was nothing wrong with this kid he got the kid on Ritalin you just like there's all stupid pants hey focus hey focus is far by killing videogames - probably right yeah yeah it's it's definitely dangerous how many people are medicated but the real question is like how many people actually could use the medication versus how many people are medicated because doctors are kind I'd like to meet someone brilli but who has that problem who really has a DDM to figure it out how about some of them kids were seriously abused as kids and they just come out and just and they're all just fuck fucked up lot of abuse going on well there's also like emotional abuse people just yell at the kids beat their kids there's kids that people get it ignored kids my friend he's gonna grow up parents that are just assholes and they're just slow life is like to constantly walking on eggshells they're all fucked up psychologically because of it Bomberman yeah it's a bummer dude you hear I can't read horrible stories but I've read some story about some guy in Texas that he's his three-year-old daughter wouldn't drink her milk so he made her stand outside by a tree and she disappeared brother he went back out 15 minutes and she was gone and the police went looking for her they can't find her she disappears you hear in the interview what he said well because the I put her out there and then what do you think happening else there's there's been a lot of sighting of coyotes in the area and they're like what the fuck is wrong with you coyotes I read that that I've read that exact article I couldn't sleep that night man I could not stop thinking up it has to do with kids it fucks really I have a three-year-old outside because she wouldn't finish her milk and she has a disability she's a disability she went finished her milk you like wonderful morning hey so it's fucking moron who Dave already taking another kid warning one in the morning wouldn't finish your milk so this moron puts out a tree at 2:00 in the morning and then they've riled custody I came took that one of the kids away before mom it's almost like definitely that kid come on by a guy with that guy I'm fucked up for free yeah that guy does I got you that guy should be toward the fact that he could do that to a baby a three year and his own his own daughter and I think about that I think in my kid I figure out scary be by the tree it fucks her world up and missing Todd she's still missing right there's no update on that no they never found her she probably got eaten they got to the Coyotes Jesus Christ meanwhile I probably killed her Anita that he made that story up you might be right you might be right it might be right might have I got to know the death bears the proof this story that sounds like a old home saying he did it either way yeah just ladder outside if he knew this coyotes around he's asking his kid again he might have wanted the kid to get eaten by a code because he's a bad person he's a piece of shit he's you know raising a kid tests you it's like you know there's some people that have just fucked in that damn shit end on this definition what else you guys get what's not in on that bullshit dad I know too much sadness man there's a lot of sadness my man a lot of good shit yeah there's a lot of great shit in the world but goddamn there's a lot of fucking morons I gotta fuck your day and you can't the thing is you can't fix him like a guy like that like that once a guy does that to his daughter what do you you know you're not fixing that car that guy's dead think of that guy as friends too if he'd like how was your night last night yeah my fucking kid went finish his bottle so I left her outside what who the fuck do you hang out with whoever you hanging out with we can talk like that everyone thinks it's all good you know the thing is like you can't forgive someone for that they have to kill them what how do you forgive someone for doing that to a baby like if someone beats a baby to death you don't there's no returning from that get our torture then people go it's a mental illness yeah publicly torture publicly but does that is that really good does that fix anything does it like yeah scare people well there's the bigger picture and people go hit listen to mental illness issue so when you have things them and it's like yeah the mental illness issue is a weird one because I saw something about HuffPost had some thing about pedophiles and they eventually took it down I think but this guy was saying I'm not a monster I'm a pedophile and he's basically saying that he has these thoughts it just doesn't act on them and everybody was like what oh fuck fuck what the fuck are you would they say that for anything right for if you if you rape kids if you're a child molester if you're a you know if you shoot people it's a mental illness I molesters are running this planet you open the door fuck those are the real you hear that Donald Trump's gonna open up the JFK dump how about that all the dump of documents from the JFK that had been sealed up by all the other presidents like the JFK assassination investigation they sealed some documents up because they're too sensitive and like whatever I was document sir I wouldn't they shred those documents you know why would damning documents be exists these are people from 1962 also Trump for sure focus on something else than this hey this is not a bad thing to focus on if you show many other things yeah for sure but first of all no one really can be president let's be honest there's not a single person that could focus on the economy and health care and international relations and the environment and like there's no way there's people who do a job yes for sure but there's not enough time in the world to focus on any of those things so what he should focus on Donald Trump should focus on the Vegas shooting he hasn't said shit about well what do you think you think there was some shady shit going on but here's the thing about this this Kennedy assassination one of the reasons why if I was him I would focus on the Kennedy assassinations they might fucking kill him like it's entirely possible that he's thinking that he could get assassinated hundred percent that's why he's opening it I wouldn't think there was any files like why would they had those files exist they should have been burned a long time ago yeah you would think so there's no file and and also is it it it doesn't have the high security of all time like they they pay the most to protect it out of all time cuz there's such a threat now oh he has crazy security doors on his limo they had a video of him I was coughing I was going I was looking at this image of him there was a video of him getting out of the limo and I was like look at that door on that fucking limo and then I went to some images of the limo the limo door is like that thick is it different than Obama's though I understand that the standard one I don't have lack makes I never looked at the other one but I mean the doors are fucking ridiculous or bomb-proof yeah yeah they're sick that would be the dopest car drive around and you be there sipping tea whatever is up whole world kikikiki yeah they make a car that you can buy there's a company called dev roll eau-de-vie rol oh and they make a car like your truck a Toyota Tundra but they make that motherfucker bulletproof I used to work for a company these two bulletproof vehicles for two weeks it was a fiberglass they do at fiberglass I kind of hang yes I quit it was too hard all the fiberglass fumes by the dancers father we shitty gig
