hypnotized recently is that something that someone did actually with Siri attacks this is somebody hacked their iphone you can tell when he opens it encloses a phone unit has a weird look to it so I think somebody just you know oh they do that they do that they root iPhones as well oh yeah I didn't know that people were hacking into iPhones of course I think there's like websites you can just go to and it's just where you would have works hacked about that that looks like just the iPhone I guess I guess not it looks like I thought those icons on the two top or something but that looks like SoundCloud yeah looks like a normal iPhone well I think that's the only way you could possibly do it I think that has to be a hacked iPhone or the whole thing is fake because I think the whole thing is much more likely because there's one thing I noticed at the very end of this video which you can find on Vimeo he it says something different than she says on the writing here so maybe this writing part was just you know and I you know Final Cut Pro or something well it's a series series series can't you see - I mean someone typed that in you know what is that oh yeah yeah it's definitely not it's definitely not Siri they definitely did it they either fake the video or they they rooted their iPhone but I think it's probably more fake that's like a big thing with the Android people man Android that's the one thing that I love about the fact that you can do that yeah do to get into Android they're like dudes were like really in the fucking UNIX shit right you know like routing things I'm a I'm a Linux contributor dude we forgot to record the video plug again yeah we keep forgetting I'm sorry folks so he had to go though he did it ago he did had to go did have to leave that was a fascinating guy though wasn't it yeah that was really interesting in it definitely it was a shit that I've already thought about before you know and it's kind of interesting to hear it from with somebody that has some cred well I think somebody yeah I think you know as you get older in life and you have a certain amount of experiences and you sort of learn the way that what the world's been working for you you know you start thinking I wonder if it works like this I wonder if this is really what's going on and that's basically like every I wonder that I ever had and he just comes out and says yes it does yes your your mind your consciousness controls everything your environment controls how the genes are made like what yeah the fuck by the way dude Fear Factor last night it was so great to see it like I forgot how much I missed it I yeah I've watched every single episode even til the very end I watched it and it wasn't because of you or anything I just that was a show that I thought was always fun to cringe at and just you know you you had more emotion of just sitting there with a blank look staring at a TV you're actually like like I'm just like you know like well it freaks you out a little bit better than those shows so last night it was also awesome seeing it taking it to the next level supposed to the HD I thought was so awesome you could actually see like the bugs intestines and stuff like that you know in more detail and the explosions of the explosions for sure yeah sound editing on that shows awesome I watched it was very surreal watching it very surreal yeah and you know it's just it's just strange the whole thing was strange I mean strange to live it and strange to do it again strange deceit on TV again I fucking never thought I would be doing that show again I never thought how could it happen this is a just a chapter in my life and I've moved past that now and then to do it again it but I enjoyed it man I really did I thought it was fun I thought it was a fun fucking show was that was that mom and one thing real that's all real I was oh yeah well you know what the casting my boy rich really knows how to fucking bring these people in they know how to pick a man at this point done - there's so many people that want to do any sort of a reality show that you could find some real characters man you can find some that that one character the guy that that was like a self motivator guy with the the hot blonde she didn't know how to swim and he just left her drowning like in the middle of the water that was a fuckwit felt bad for that girl you know I felt bad that she didn't honest when she tried to do that you know she look she wanted to win and she thought maybe once you got in there she would figure out how to do it but she did not swim that was disturbing that a rescuer it's weird yeah you guys the idea I think they had a plan I think the plan was he said I know you don't know how to swim but I'll carry you right I don't think you realize how hard that is to do it's really hard to do and you swim slow as fuck when you're doing that but you can't just swim when you're carrying someone's body it takes a long time it takes like more than half more than twice the time - and you know she was pulling him down and he was panicking so he left her out there it's weird thinking not not being able to swim that you should not be a grown adult that should be like something that they have to teach you in like third grading you have to pass a test yes she apparently she didn't grow up in the best neighborhood and you know she wasn't happy about it well obviously grew up in Vegas right that hot chick I don't know she grew up in that Mandalay Bay she's so high she was so high that check she was very pretty I wonder if she was like his friend and they came on like as a rioter yeah that's what that seems like a sense yeah it's very possible and then she just agreed to get I mean why not why not just say you know say it's my boyfriend we I would do that yeah you want to get on couples to fire together we have to be couples yeah we just pretend okay that's why we left her in the water that makes nine hundred percent sense right you never you never leave your girl in the water or if you were thought you were drowning you might if you thought someone would rescue her if you separated you might separate but you would say something save her you would say save her you know that's what I would say I would say you know if I knew that I couldn't rescue her it's like if she like first of all if someone's does not a swim at all and they're flailing around they can drag you under you have to get them to relax so you have to be fucking good at that that's not an easy thing to do like when just are kissing them right and then like in a couple Philly embrace suck a finger and put it right in approver calm him down like when you got a good hold with our pooper right and especially the thumb you press the thumb on the coccyx I just wanted to say coccyx it was also so weird seeing it because it was all ex-boyfriend ex-girlfriends which I thought was a great idea forecasting wise but it was weird seeing night like that one guy that where there was a like a guy in this girl that was like fake boobs or I think she had fake boobs but like a kind of a weird body you know I got older body and and he she he just like fucking with her like she controlled the whole relationship it was weird seeing like why people broke up probably because he she was like and she like you know he was yes ma'am yes ma'am I don't know if you remember that that guy that like he pretty much took orders from her the whole time during fear factor yes yeah yeah so you can kind of see wide like the relationships like ended you know like it was so interesting that I like that's why they chose those people you know they chose them because they knew there would be fascinating to watch you know it's it's weird how many some people's relationships are right is weird you know but there was some people that were fun like they had fun relationships like the one couple they were exes but now they're just friends the Twilight kid and you have pretty friends to team Twilight that was so funny hilarious and hard rider are Easy Rider but they seem to our there were very nice people yeah they're super cool yeah um she was gorgeous yeah she's really pretty and he was a good-looking guy and they were they were actually friends I mean it was legit is they used to date and they didn't work out and they both have different girlfriends now or boyfriends and they're friends right you know it was still the healthiest fucking group by far out of any of them yeah you know the other ones like the fucking easy riders those guys were fighting like cats and dogs and then the the other guy you felt sorry for that one dude yeah I was controlled by his wife had his ex it was sad you know and she would say shit and you just look or dude he has to just sit there and eat that you know I couldn't do that with my exes III not most of my kids you don't want to be in that position everyone knows you don't want to be in that disadvantageous position where you are you are giving in to them all the time right you know you don't want to be there man you don't want to be there where they yelling at you you don't want to be there that position sucks yeah now one guy even was like you know like he dropped a cow heart I think it was dropped a cow heart and uh and you could tell that she was blaming him for losing right and then like somebody else dropped it and he goes yeah see look it was hard to see it was hard to see you know like yeah it was it was so sad to see that yeah yeah it's hard it's hard dealing with people like that not dealing with them I mean but you know being around him and going hey you guys are just fuckin up each other's life you need to get the fuck away from her dude yeah I know you feel like somehow another you got this connection with her right no you got to see her to get your kids from her but other than that stay away cuz this woman is chopping you down yeah you know it's like you gotta do can't get a chick anymore when a girl is no longer impressed with a guy when the fucking magic is over and he is not attracted to the guy at all that is the worst time he can be around that girl is she will have you feeling like you are worthless and that will in turn it's not gonna motivate you it's gonna make you feel like shit and it's gonna probably ruin all these other aspects of your life too so if you want a regular relationship with someone who treats you like shit and is not whatsoever attracted to you that's devastating for you as a person and so like when we're around this poor guy we have to see this like oh you can't blame her she know you like who you like man but you got a you know for him he's gotta get the fuck away man run this is your reality you're creating as Bruce Lipton would tell us yeah right yeah exactly speaking of which man I have to apologize to to Todd bridges man I I fucked up and I did this interview and they you know they always ask you know most of like the old Fear Factor you do 100 interviews and after a while you just you you just run out of shit to talk about and you'll talk about anything and one of the things that came up we were talking about c-listers that were on the show and I'm just read it so there's no mistake and whatsoever and what I said the the question was the guy says I remember it was more c-listers and blast from the past like Todd bridges and I said yeah he was a really rear we're duan he's an angry dude I think he murdered somebody with manslaughter I'm serious you shouldn't print that because I think it says I shouldn't print it said you should print that but that's not what I said I said you shouldn't print that because I think he gotten some sort of a fight in a crack house and wound up killing someone hold on let me fact check right now they actually put the whole thing in me saying let me fact check right now and then I say yeah Todd bridges attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter charges he shot somebody five gunshots in a knife wound the jury acquitted him though that was 1989 he was 23 years old then I said but yeah I didn't enjoy being with him he was a weird angry guy blamed his losing on the producers like they wanted to get rid of him there's some people who just think that the world is out to get them and he felt like that in a big way it was interesting from a psychological standpoint this is the one reason why I said this he got upset at me when he got eliminated from the show and wouldn't believe that he was actually eliminated he believed that they wanted him to get eliminated I went to shake his hand and he wouldn't even shake my hand he just like put his hands back and walked away I was like this is so fucking childish and then I thought about him like this poor guy man you know he grows up in the in the limelight on a fucking big show like Diff'rent Strokes like try developing on television like that we've talked about that so many times like how insane that must be try developing on television so all I did was comment on him like you know like he wasn't a person comment I mean like I wasn't I wasn't concerned with his feelings that he would listen to it and despite the fact that you know he was in some sort of a situation in a crack house you know this was a long time ago and you know I don't know him and I just said it and I shouldn't have said it it's really you know even whether it's true or not is not the point the point is it there was no reason for me to say it and he's friends with my friend Dave and my friend Dave and him talked and he said he's been sober for 19 years and this upset him and I'm thought about I'm like who the fuck am I to just randomly bring up some shit about some dudes past that's gonna make him feel bad you know it was not it was there was no reason why I should have done it I did it I was it was lazy thinking on my part I should have never done it and I should have you know looked at his life as like one picture I don't know that dude and apparently he's been sober for like 19 years and he does a lot of good things it does interventions and shit so I opened up my mouth when I shouldn't have and I apologize so Todd bridges if you're out there please accept my apology I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that it wasn't he's right I totally agree I could have totally avoided saying anything about his past or anything about him as a person you know hey come on I get bored sometimes man and this is no excuse but it's true you know you do a hundred interviews about Fear Factor and stuff like that you can get psychologically lazy you know you get sloppy with what you say and you as you can see everything I said there including don't print that which actually says or instead of shouldn't print that it actually says should print that but I most certainly said shouldn't print that because I went into some sort of I went to fact check that so because of that they put every single word I said so you got a you get a chance to see my whole thought process on it so I don't know what the fuck happened to him obviously I wasn't there and the guy got acquitted good that's beautiful you know I don't I don't hold any ill will towards him and I feel bad that I brought it up and I shouldn't have so I apologize you know that that that the NT and this should and the shouldn't is going to be the new tower 7 for you I'm a mumbling fuck you know you talked to me over the phone especially with these goofy headsets that I insist on wearing you never seen those things I have yeah I walk around in my house so I like it because I can talk on the phone and do shit at the same time I'm curry style but Tom Cruise 1984 yeah it's actually I've got a cord and the cord goes directly into the cordless phone but it's the best way to do it because the phones cordless the poem sticks in my back pocket it's got a little clip and I can walk around the house I play pool when I'm on the phone sometimes yeah but that's why RadioShack is still in business because of people like you buying those kreygam from RadioShack you got to get them from hello direct correct yeah that hello direct is the the best company in the world for business phones yeah they make big conference phones and they make really good headsets that you listen to a cordless phone on where it's like real high-end it sounds really good really strong but it's the expensive equipment but it's expensive because it's really high-end stuff it's really worth it but you know you get any fucking headset man I got a Sony one that was like 30 bucks it's pretty good it's not bad at all you know are you sure hello direct is not like a home shopping netwerk of Bluetooth accessories I don't think so I think they make sofa I mean I think make phone headsets John Heffron attorney hi john Heffron has never tried to rip us off I just want to be clear about that he's a great guy and he would never do anything dishonest but John Heffron occasionally has these fucking plans we're like dude all I have to do is I start this one business in Uganda you know I give them the keys and they have money that comes to me for the rest of my life dude I'm set like he's got like this sort of like crazy lottery winner scam mentality sort of a thing as far as like him wanting to like find someone product that like really takes off like with it is it like an Anthony Robbins thing because I know he's into that shit I don't know I don't even know who that is that is no no Anthony Robbins says I googled does it for me I know if I ever don't need that information I just use Google I might know who never heard of Tony Robbins Tony Robbins you know who Tony Robbins is the motivational speaker God he's fucking gigantic he's huge no is he like a Buble because I just found out about Buble and now he's haunting you bleh some Buble guy that sings a lot and and and now it like somebody told me do you

went to the Olive gun in the other day and it wasn't that good what happened I tried all their new stuff and it was like well they're trying to get crafty oh no no it's not even that it's like I've found that if you eat late at night so like I always go like at nine o'clock when it closes at 10:00 and you could tell be that the kitchen starts to break down at a certain moment and most restaurants like kitchens like alright we can start to break down meaning you could stop making new soup you can start putting everything away you know because there's only a few people left you know to order food and I feel like lately every time I go to a restaurant at that time period it sucks and like the the ravioli I had was like overcooked the they have like they have lasagna that's deep right now or something like that it's so awesome but that was like felt like it was sitting in the fryer for 20 minutes so they probably you know precooked it or something like that but don't go to a restaurant after 9:00 o'clock is what I'm saying yo you have not as good as food as tired well it's just because they said they start closing down the kitchen because it's about to close yeah and people are tired my fault don't go to Olive Garden after 9 o'clock yeah Oh 6 p.m. sort of a meal yeah see I'm on the road lunch with any restaurant is what I'm saying though not just all of garden any restaurant does eat dinner with Anthony Bourdain oh really yeah in Toronto where'd you go some restaurant some nice place was pretty cool we got there when it was about to close and they had a bar we sat in the bar area and they said you know the regular menu is closed but we got this menu and I said you tell the chef that Anthony Bourdain is here you drop that bird I totally did cuz she didn't I don't think she knew she so she ran back and the chef's came back with a book and he fucking signed their book and shit it was the coolest meal ever me and my pal Anthony Giordano and Anthony his crazy wife his wife wants to fight she'sa can you imagine his wife is a badass dude she's been doing jujitsu and muy Thai for like 4 years completely obsessed she does him every day one in the morning one at night I mean she's like she's got a thick neck and she's got fucking muscular arms and apparently she's like super super aggressive I'm like wow what a strange situation that would be have a wife that might be able to kick your ass man yeah I might be able to put a beating on you you think you could deal with that now you don't think you deal with that now what if your chick just started getting into jujitsu and fucking and wanted her and then eventually wanted to roll with you oh come on bitch know what if you're fucking her and then in the middle she's like eat my pussy and right when you go down on she slapped a triangle on you it puts you to sleep could you imagine if that was like fun for her hygiene for your leg you try to get off the bed she hooks your leg oh just slaps

that did this animation that they pulled from the show apparently this is like did you watch it no you know it was creepy no I can see why they pulled it it was it was creepy it was it was almost

one that shows I grew up in and I loved everything about that show yeah I need another it's so we're watching TV nowadays they don't have that anymore because that's not you like who cares all year you have a little black kid that you adopted is it like a little rocky kid oh you got an Iraqi kid two Iraqi kids and you're an old man man could you imagine that was a fucking to come Jesus Christ you can't have those kind of sitcoms anymore you know you could never have a Sanford and Son anymore you know so if you have if you had anything that was like a semi racist like an all in the family right you couldn't have that today so how are you gonna have you know what you'd miss out on 80% of jokes you had some guy with two little Arab kids you Buble and that duel that's what be the name of the whole thing and be like good leg with two Iraqi kids learn estoppel and the podcast I swear to God you know bringing me to you retarded world in your Buble Road you can be hot so let's talk about this mind book thing Matt these guys wanted us to talk about yeah and they left they have a social networking site they put together these are the people that just left that were with mr. Lipton and it's called wwm ein book WSS mind book dot WS why did I say www what am i a fucking moron like people don't know that just by HTTP colon backslash yeah the forward slash backslash thing what who cares that's like it's four bits Louis that's like it's spell checking me out well it's weird that that you know it's better that that's the same protocol these little simple numbers how long is it gonna be before let's just say the just write the word and you know and go right to it yeah HTTP dot dot I mean if you write cnn.com you don't have to write all that other shit your browser does it for you right so why do we have to see that I don't have to know let me put in the word what's WS really stand for website apparently they said Wednesday probably some funky country you know probably some weird country like like a lot of like TV was like Transylvania or some shit you know people who people got TV but it wasn't television TV stood for an abbreviation of some sort of a country right yeah and some people got that at that Internet address you know you're allowed to so I guess you're allowed to give this ws whatever it is it's probably like some weird country somewhere I wonder when should we'll do that so we don't leave people and fucking in the dark here let me find out what the hell that says s domain but yeah mine by the way I'm going bald son why just for watching yourself on your factor or know that - yeah that I am and I watch myself in high-definition like man I don't go on bald well what's weird is when they showed like like at the beginning I don't like in my shot young hair I don't like the new opening is that just temporarily with opportunities factor your Internet's address okay the website WS story okay here it is a WS story but it's weird to see your fucking so much scalp well the new that if we're on the opening they should like the young you and then they show you the old order you and it's like night and day difference hell you've really transformed you look you look bigger than like meteor now well I didn't lift weights at all when I first started doing this right I did I got into really lifting weights probably around like 2001 or two which is right when Fear Factor just started because that's when I really got into jiu-jitsu right before that I had a problem with my knee I had what's called a bucket handle tear and it was it was real bad and it was from years ago and what it would happen was at least once every couple of weeks I would be doing something strenuous anything strenuous my knee would pop out and lock in place so what it is is the meniscus would lift up like a bucket handle and get stuck and it was fucking horrendous man it was a real pain in the ass and it took me a long time before I ever got it fixed and then I finally did get it fixed and then I was able to like really train hard again because but until that I would do something like I would lift weights I would bend over to tie my shoe and it would pop out and I would follow the ground and my leg would be like locked out in a front and then it was fucked for hours dude and then it was sore for weeks you know and then I would get like a couple weeks later I get to the point where I go just wear a brace go back to you to class room it would pop again and then one time I tore it really bad it popped in tore so bad that I could not bend my leg so Eddie had to take me to the hospital and we went they had to do an MRI on it and they gave me anti-inflammatories and they eventually they shaved it down the lady was like you know you need to stop doing martial arts yeah I think we're like really like like judgmental about that shit well you like cornered me listen I'm telling you right now you need to stop doing this stuff so I got that fixed and then I started working out like that's when I really got into like we're seriously lifting and you're like crazy like like on Twitter I saw some people say you see damn Joe Rome got fat and it's so I definitely am fatter this is the right will you ever do an episode with no shirt on the whole time well people think I'm fatter than I am for sure but I'm definitely fatter than I used to be because when I used to fight you know when I was when I first started doing like Newsradio I was in like fighting shape I was it was in really good shape and I had like a very thin face right my whole body fat was like way lower than it is now I couldn't like pinch fat on and unfortunately that makes me have a big fat face it's so funny that every time somebody says that I'm like your well I'm not really fat I mean if you saw me with my shirt off you wouldn't say that guy's fat no wait I'm not fat like I I'm not thin like I used to be I used to be shredded when I was when I was constantly doing Taekwondo and kickboxing everything I had like five six percent body fat all the time especially when I was gonna compete and then you know it never got really heavier than that until I got like deep into my 30s when I was like working all the time and eating shit food you know like after I did that that Men's Fitness cover I was gonna cover that's I got those that was like the best shape I ever got in and I just got lazy after that I didn't really lift weights at all not more how was it the Today Show we haven't talked about that you wanted Today Show I didn't even get to see interesting you know is weird you know they do it outside and in this little Plaza they do part of it in the plaza so Al Roker and I'm sorry I don't remember the other two people don't remember the name I apologize it's Jane Pauley is it Jane poem no I know I forget their names but they're very cool people and they're very tall and I look like a little tiny person out there and so we're out there in the cold and they say a fear factor just coming back yeah yeah and it's gone it's like it's over and done and like you know Al Roker cracks a joke and that's a wrap did you smoke weed with Al Roker I wish I did I would love it coming to my outlook is very friendly lady sax for you he's a very nice guy he's very friendly lisa has been every time I met him he's a very nice guy who is Matt lost a shitload of weight to men there's a guy who lost a lot of weight there's go who recognized that he had like some sort of a problem with his diet and you know living his life that way and just straighten it out well he did the Lap Band thing right did he do that yeah I think that's what he did and I think he was successful at it you know we you know many people that have had it but they just ate started going eating no I don't know about money but we know about one yeah yeah oh just keeps breaking those fucking things well which is so scary you know the fact that he's just pumping food in there and snapping that cord yeah you know I don't know what a lap I don't know how it works do you understand how it works I think they just tie off your stomach don't they died to make it smaller and then your stomach does oh you know if these are eating pack and barbecue into that hole that not trying to break it open why do you say barbecue barbecue be delicious right now what is this no but anyway yeah this guy actually had it done which is really funny because all it does is like gets you to not eat as much like you could just do that on your own you'd have to get cut open but people like they they trust their will so little that they would rather get cut open yeah you know that's craziness it's amazing it's amazing it's amazing that you know that I mean I can understand it when you're like on death's door and you know like I got to do something or I'm obviously out of control man I don't know if that's the thing to do I think you should look at yourself somehow you know whether it's some sort of a psychedelic experience or you know read books and get inspired be around positive people I think that's probably the better option that's gonna make a real change in your life because having an operation even though it's like it pushes you into a certain direction like okay now we're moving positive we're getting in less food we're gonna lose some weight going to put less pressure on the heart this is all good even though that it's not being done necessarily by you it's forcing you to do that and whenever you force yourself to do something instead of learning and adapting your behavior naturally and then having that behavior eventually through positive reinforcement become the norm this is your normal behavior now I actually like to eat greens I like to eat a kale shake in the morning I like to be healthy you know so until that until that takes place you're just gonna repeat the same fucking patterns you know and that's with our friend who keeps blowing his shit out you know it's the issue is not this whole you know and how to stuff it it's why do you want to stuff it all the time like this man what the fuck is going on physiologically psychologically I mean I'm not against doing whatever the fuck you feel like you need to do to get yourself healthy you know you want to do the lap-band I totally think you should be able to do it but I think if I was your friend you know I would say let's not let's not be crazy Joey Diaz wouldn't do it that's why Joey wouldn't do it Joey's like to cut you once they cut you they cut you open dawg come on you telling me that that I'm that weak I need to do that so Joey lost like 80 fucking pounds you know did he lose something crazy like that he did at one point no you did - you lost a shitload of weight dude yeah how heavy did you get at one point was the heavy you ever got I think it was like all right like 2 4 I can't dispense oh wow it's like 245 250 or something oh boy goes in it and then I got down I know like the Louis I got I think was 169 175 summer and your head looked really big yeah right yeah funny looked weird I look like Carlos Mencia it looks well no he looks better than you looked when you when you gain weight it's a weird thing like your head gets big too you know when you like even if like you gain weight through like muscle lifting you know a guy's like gain a shitload of wait for like powerlifting and stuff right they're not on a sauce their fucking heads get bigger man like I have a friend who's really big that's pretty dope whoa that's a 3d that you don't have to wear glasses for holy shit this Nintendo DS's badass I have a friend he's about 300 320 pounds right and his fucking head is enormous and I look at his head and I go okay even if he lost all the weight how did his head get this so big did his head grow because it's his body was so fat you know like what what is it that made his head grow too you know it doesn't when you get older your your your face facial nose in your ears yeah I've noticed that you know is that my nose seems larger than it was when I was a younger man I feel like it looks it looks different from it doesn't make any sense but it looks different since I have that operation on the inside a filler got whiter or something that doesn't make any sense right well maybe they carved out too much they didn't they wanted to save so as like god it's stupid because there was no change in the structure my nose at all but goddamn it works better now anybody who's ever thinking about doing that I had a what's called there's a video of it on YouTube I forget the the technical scientific term of what the operations called but they went in and fixed a deviated septum and fuck that was the one of the best things I ever did I couldn't breathe out of my nose since I was like a little kid I broke my nose falling down a flight of stairs when I was like 5 my nose was crooked right so my whole life I've been a mouth breathing fuck you know and to actually have that's such an amazing thing is it a hundred percent now or do you only want to go back and get some more cut cut out oh no no no it's great no it's great it's wide open it's amazing I hit the bag with my mouth closed I can hit the bag just breathing out of my nose I don't do it for like long stretches of time I'll take mouth breast too but you know in I want to make sure that I can exert myself like this is guy that I've been working with I've talked about him before his name is Steve Maxwell and he's on Twitter you finally go to Steve Maxwell or Maxwell Fitness calm or just Google and Google Steve Maxwell I'm sorry pologize that I don't remember his net his the website name it might be Maxwell strength and conditioning either way he's a brilliant guy and a brilliant strength and conditioning coach and one of the things that he has me working on is breathing and so wow you you learn like the correct way to breathe to calm your heart down like it doesn't seem like that would work but there really is like a way to calm yourself down it's very difficult to do because one of the things that happens when your body goes into oxygen deprivation when you're exhausted when you just totally worn out you just want to you just you just trying to get air in well obviously the air that you have right now is enough to sustain you you are alive I understand that your body is sending messages and saying it needs more air we don't have enough air but you know what you're gonna be fun you know what's gonna fuck you up even worse if you freak out about this and your heart starts pounding a million miles an hour on top of the fact from the adrenaline rush on top of the fact that it's tired from being pushed and being exhausted and what he's teaching me is how to breathe in through your nose like you breathe in like this so you're exhausted completely exhausted you don't want to just like you want to take these big panic breaths but that sends panic signals to your body you have to control it so you got to be disciplined so as you're doing this you want to take these breaths but yo you do it's amazing how quickly that amazing thing relaxes it was a huge lesson to me like now like when I'm exhausted working out I force myself into breathing like that and I recover way quicker it's amazing and all this is like pranayama breathing this is all like in the you know they're like ancient yoga guys we're like badass at this like this is like a big part of yoga like breath control I said a friend we just call him yoga ray-ray Capone he was I think this hope I didn't say it's not last name wrong he would rate cop out thank you corrected myself and he was the head of this band I forget his band but it was like a hardcore band like crazy wild noise kind of band you know and they're real popular and then he got into yoga and he became this yoga instructor and eventually just wound up I think he gave up music entirely and he's just like teaching yoga to people at some some big corporate retreat somewhere in upstate New York who's gonna move up there his family this guy had a mazing cardio dude I mean amazing you would never see him cast out ever and he told me all I did was breathing exercises he would do these long slow deep breaths will you breathe in through your nose and it takes like a minute and then you hold it and then you slowly let the air out slowly like you just want your instinct is to just fucking panic and just let it all out and just breathe in and take gulps of air like you're drowning no no no no it's very difficult to do I've tried to do it I do it when I get in the tank it's for me the quickest way to get completely relaxed and centered when I get into the tank before is that certain special plant the other the other thing is doing these breathing exercises you know so many people don't know about breathing exercises and don't understand that you know your your lungs you can condition them and you can you can manipulate them and they're you know you you are in control you're deciding when to take it breath and you're deciding when to push it out and you can use like time-honored practices of manipulating that's actually strengthen your lungs and strengthen your your your aerobic capacity because I'll tell you man this dude just had awesome control of his lungs he would never get tired that's a Hicks and Gracie principle to Hicks and Gracie was like the greatest Gracie ever you know pretty widely recognized as one of the greatest if not the you know everyone would say number one every jiu-jitsu guy almost a hundred percent would say Hickson Gracie he's that badass and the other thing about him is he's a yogi and he has his crazy abdomen muscles math where he's doing these breathing exercises in this video and he's sucking his whole stomach into his ribcage and then moving it left and right it's like the amount of manipulation that he can do his abdominals and his breathing so you and I can't even wrap our heads around it you watch a video of it man it's fucking crazy like pull it up on YouTube pull up Hicks and Gracie breathing we are breath exercises breathing Hicks and Gracie from the from the documentary choke and it just makes you realize man that there's um there's more to harness in your body than we're aware of there's some other shit and yoga is a really interesting aspect of that that whole search because I found very few things in life that make my head feel as good as yoga does yoga puts me in like a real relaxed state I don't necessarily get to it that often these days but when I whenever I do it I'm always I'm always happy I did it always makes me feel like peaceful after it's over and I think you know sometimes when I'm busy with a lot of shit I actually subconsciously avoid doing anything enlightening because then it'll make me not want to work as hard not want to get as much shit done you know and so whenever I'm like avoiding yoga or avoiding even practicing a little bit of it on my own I always know that I'm probably working too hard did you find the video right here check the screen right here and tell me if you see recognized wanted hold on a second yeah that's it Hicks and Gracie workout yeah he'll do he doesn't work out and then at the end of it he does like this crazy breathing shit look at he's turned aside my ward there's so much effort he's doing sit-ups on the beach right now this is a greatest jiu-jitsu artist ever this is a guy where every single family member will tell you Hickson's the fucking best man interesting feeling when a few yourself in New York time to be capable to expose yourself in a way to fight and compete that's not means a victory or defeat or anything but just to be able to choose to do it you know this motherfucker this guy is like there's not one person that will tell you that he's not good at jujitsu you know I'm saying there's not one person that when I tell you that this guy's a master you know he comes from a whole family of killers and he's the number one killer and he's what is right now doing is he's strengthening his neck with his giant bungee cord really brilliant guy - I had a chance to eat dinner with him once and went to his house and discussed jujitsu techniques and mixed martial arts the physical the body as a machine has a machine we need really take care of you know so I try be beside a fighter I try to keep my physical this is a smooth as an a combination where I can be very flexible very strong very fast very well coordinated with a broad silence with a good breathing so those elements it's fine yeah what's the shit this is your freakiest mother stammering no no I'm good sometimes when I make my routines I get in a very special stage of meditation and this is beautiful because he's receiving here a lotus position and totally clean is crazy breathing myself in the present moment this ain't it yet it my 20 here goes watch this you can actually control yourself mentally and physically you can really understand your fears and your emotional stress you freak girls out I like how they got the music play in the back I know isn't it amazing nobody can do this stomach yeah it's very strange to watch my he's um he's what I would say is a real martial arts master you know there's only a few of them out there in the world that you know people universally recognized as a martial arts master and Hickson is a martial arts master you know he's such an inspirational dude that documentary choke I guarantee this thousands of Jiu Jitsu guys all over the world who wants that documentary choke all the time just to watch Hickson you know when Hickson you know came on the scene a lot of people don't know about hicks and they know about hoist cuz hoist one the Ultimate Fighting Championship but even hoist said that if he ever got beat they were waiting to put in Hickson Hickson was like Plan B he was like the atomic bomb like we'll go in there with troops but if you bitches you kill his baby get your shit together we're gonna drop Hicks and Gracie on you you know and he he went over and fought in Japan steady fun Japan valley ii don't know there's some politics involved some family politics I don't I don't understand all that but I do understand that watching him compete was amazing didn't fight enough guys you know I really wish that we would have got a chance to see his high level Jiu Jitsu at work against you know some of the real best anime fighters the world but when we did see it man he was so dominant man talking that dude you never talk to somebody and you know you just you get inspired and you you and at the same time you're like wow like this fucking guy is on such another level like with his mind you know the way he like is so serious about things yeah like when you go to the Apple Store and you talk one of those guys know totally different is that how you feel I wish I was a genius I wish I was behind the genius counter anyway breath control is just fucking awesome it's like hooking try that shit it's like cooking hooking how's it like working are you retarded today what's going on no like when you're in the jet plane you go oh alright calm down tiger you silly fuck well you've been saying it's silly shit all day I haven't no I've actually everything I said makes sense oh what's that guy's name that you keep fucking repeating what yeah the singer that's everywhere anyway yeah you didn't get silly with that no I'm telling you I can't stop talking Buble now you're going to see what I'm talking about now that you know what this guy's name is is it going to haunt you I bet I'm this Nintendo DS thing that you handed me this 3ds thing is amazing yeah it's really good like I my mom allows me she the Mario Brothers game there's if you're a big fan of Marta's it was so it's done right for the first time being able to do a 3d game it's amazing like I'm looking at it right now it's really a trip because you know it even works a little bit an awful yeah but that's the basics see yeah they have to look at a dead on to really get it you can see like wiring yeah the board there's two things I don't like about it one is that it's it's I have small hands but I still found it was really cramped to play after a large period of time so yeah yeah so I got your time yeah so I got this thing that just snaps into it looks like a xbox controller so you can just play it like it's an Xbox I should a button that activated a camera it's got a camera oh it's got a 3d camera you can take photos in 3d and and alright does it actually look like 3d if I take a photo of me taking a photo yeah that would be interesting if you put something in the front in the back you know like a 3d like that chair or something but yeah it's got a 3d camera and I I'm having fun with it I think it's I didn't know it was that cool but that's now wait imagine when TVs are like that though that's us that's us you know small low screen but imagine when TVs the 3d is gonna be is this like are these things these mobile game boy type devices are these things sort of like digital cameras where they're on the way out it's all going to be incorporated into phone the ipad the ipad game yeah yeah i pad itself there's oh this is the coolest thing ever I'm so sorry mirroring huh you've done that right yeah miron will you do your Apple TV and yeah something even cooler there's this new thing called on life I don't have you've heard on live it's called on live and it's a video game browser where you can sit here and what it does is it's it's a service that you pay for every month and it has all the latest video games so you don't have to have like a high end computer anymore you don't have to have an Xbox anymore you play through like this weird streaming technology and it doesn't seem like it would work well meaning like you can sit there I can see her right now play but new Batman video game from my computer and it in real time streams the game to you so your there's no downloading a games there's nothing and it actually we're saying but what the cool thing is is the iPad has I think it's coming to the iPad soon where you can play like legit video games on your iPad so that's you'll be able to play xbox games on your iPad pretty much so your finger movements will dictate like how what is gonna be like your controllers and everything right and well it's really cool if you can see this it's pretty sweet what's really cool is that it also if you're bored and you're sitting in your bed you can sit here and watch anybody that's playing video games right now and you can flip and you could just go into their game and just slowly we'll just explained everybody Brian just pulled up a browser with how many fucking windows was that hundreds and what game is a fortress or some show yes I don't even know what this is but they have like Batman they have like any games drop in on these games off in and just start watching so I've been late lately you play them can you play you can't on on the iPad yet that's this is just watching people play this is just watching this like watching TV though of people playing any video game you know you know which by the way I used to do all the time yeah when I was addicted to quick I used to watch a lot of quick demos exactly but on Android you can play it they just released the Android version so you can play the games but I download on my Mac and I can play games from my Mac here without having any video games on my thing and it works really well like I was surprised how well it worked Wow at least for the for right now and if five years from now that'd be the way to go there's not gonna be X boxes anymore you're just gonna be fuckin using your TV and having a Bluetooth remote to your remote or your controller or whatever you're using Wow getting very strange but that's caught on live I wonder what the next level is gonna be it's with this 3d thing it really makes me think that they're eventually going to get a 3d thing that's gonna be your regular television will be 3d capable just like everything became HD capable you know I mean HD has been around for a long fuckin time but how long was it before everybody had an HD set Oh Stilton the majority don't does it really matter I bet the majority still does not have an HD set wow that's amazing you know I did this tour this television satellite television tour we you sit down and they connect you with all these different morning shows want to talk to you about Fear Factor being back and that kind of shit right and one of them we have to reset for because one one news station somewhere one one TV station somewhere doesn't have HD right so because because of this one they have to reset everything and smash the signal and do something totally different I don't know how they they change it but they have to change it for this one network and like fucking in the middle of nowhere that does not have HD and I go what's that about and they'll go it's like a mom-and-pop own TV station why doesn't they why don't they just pay for them to upgrade I wonder if that would be more expensive than having to do that super expensive you know I think it's super expensive I mean it's a worthwhile investment but if you're some rinky-dink town and you know you got I mean how many people how many people are accessed or how many people have access to each televisions all right you know if it's like you know Jasper Wyoming or some shit some weird place no one's ever heard of and they have a TV station you're you're clinking into it it's on HD sorry that there's television stations and are not HD but we have 1080p on our iPhone yeah that is amazing well it's like there's a this is a big wave and not everything is at the far away for us a lot a lot of shit going on the sides at the end it's uh it's curious though it's good because if if HD you know eventually gets replaced by 3d all these people that just switch to HD well motherfucker I just got the new a shit if it ever becomes a I'm not a fan of the fucking classes in the movies but if you can show me movies that are as good from like the sides and the edges as they are from the front and it's 3d we could just watch it on the screen because right now the way that looked it's big difference between head on and on the edge right if you had a watch like you know Co noun in 3d on the edge you'd get annoying yourself it's like it's too fucking close yeah I it's hard for me to even go to a movie theater nowadays though I never go I mean I have big TVs and digital sounds so like even that monkey movie I never got to see it but it's out on DVD so I might just go over in it I've been the movies three times in the last month and two of those three times people were talking during the yeah see I don't need that shit I don't need that it was so annoying it's like you know people think it's funny that laughing it shit you know they're talking to each other about something totally not related to the movie and you hear them laughing there's very few things as distracting when when you know you're hearing someone laughing out loud during a scene in a movie and they know the problem is there's not a lot of people go into movies these days so if you go during a weeknight sometimes you'll go I'll get ten o'clock movie and they'll be like fucking three couples in there and that's it there's no one in there yeah they're on their way out movie theaters bookstores you know all that shit that make a nice hat that makes me sad I'm gonna miss both for sure I love movie theaters I love the idea of like a movies coming out like when the Avengers comes out I want to be there opening weekend man and that's when all the fucking nerds are there they're real excited to be you know they're at that movie yeah I want to get tickets in advance you know I mean it's like then it's it's a fun experience you know if you see a cool movie in a theater with a bunch of people and they're all into it that actually enhances the experience but if you see a theater and it's like half empty and the people are talking god damn god damn that's annoying yeah and people simply they feel like they can do that when there's less less people there you know that's why I've found that people are really rude it's not one of the movie theaters crowded it's when there's only like a few couples you know especially we get more than three boys together more than three teenage boys together like very rare that's all the time for me you and three-nation three teenage Jake is that your move Wow I know I'm book stores to go out either man I love bookstores I like the idea walking by and going huh what is this biography on who huh what did he do oh and we read about this guy's life I like that I like that I can just walk down an aisle and go you know I maybe I want to read a biography today or maybe I want to read about cars today I want something mindless I want to know the history the Corvette you know maybe it's a you know I want to you know know about fucking solar power but I want to be able to just wander through and pick out something it's like the same thing with record stores man I used to like record stores man nice to like Virgin Records we'd go and they would let you listen to the CD remember and there was no no fucking headphones available because people would just stand there and list music all day they'd be like damn I want to find out this fucking records any good that was like the first time anybody ever took a chance and said listen I know you've been burning the pass so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna let you listen to everything before you buy it remember that was like fucking revolutionary yeah now people download the whole fucking thing and if they really like it they'll buy it on iTunes I stood by you most people don't do that I don't think I think most people just steal nowadays but I still buy a CD here and there definitely yeah yeah i but the problem is I don't go to a record store I go to Amazon I just get him delivered even though I was at where was I just add oh I was at Best Buy and there was like so many things I'm like oh that's cool I'm gonna get wait let me just go on Amazon oh shit yeah it's 40% cheaper on Amazon is it really 40% so many things here's here's a good example I hear this is kind of obvious so urban outfitters has this a video game system that it plays like old Nintendo old Super Nintendo old Genesis anyways they have it force it on sale for $100 it's on Amazon for $44 holy shit and then that's just like how Best Buy is you know like Best Buy is all the time you just go through everything you're in Windows laptops for like seven hundred bucks how much can you get a good Windows laptop you can get a good Windows laptop for 300 bucks holy shit yeah you're not gonna be editing video but nowadays shit so cheap that's amazing yeah you can get a laptop for 300 bucks like a good one like a Toshiba or something yeah absolutely absolutely that's amazing that's amazing that's one of my favorite complaints too when people start talking about Apple well I can get the same specs in a Windows box for one third of the price yeah but yeah but are you running Windows do you understand that exactly silly goose people get mad at me man that's one of the things I've had mentioned on Twitter people say something like dude I think you're cool and everything till you start talking about Mac and PC and you don't know what the fuck you're talking about like wow it won't change to Walmart so much in computers someone got a little touchy someone's a little uncomfortable with the reality the fact that your shit gets viruses well they can make voices for the milk platform as well there's none of those people doing it for them to Joseph I'm making it yeah whatever okay I think we've those people would be so the people that write viruses are probably on Windows and they they would probably want to destroy the Apple fanboys as much as possible figure trying to extract money is what they're trying to do if it was easy to extract money there's just the big enough market with Windows computers why fuck with it so easy to get into your shit yeah you know I just click a link I mean how stupid is that you click a link and you get a virus hi oh sorry your fucking virus detection wasn't ready for this yeah no I just snuck into your bases and I got you pregnant sorry stupid now all your data is no good you know hell spawns inside of you making babies I tell you what's what and wants to know anything in the road somebody told me to call this number it was like 1-800 wet tits I was on one of the other podcast he's like oh you know I got a new 1-800 number and so he wanted everyone to call this number what it was it's like 1-800 wet tits or boobs or something and it's just this girl going only want money I have really wet boobs it's like a recording and then at the end of like this two-minute speech she she goes she's I call this number you know dad talk to me live but the problem is now ever since I cuz I called on my phone and put on speakerphone just so we could play on the podcast problem is that now non-stop every day I'm getting a text message like automated like hate me my crazy roommate want to suck your butthole out and call this number you know and it's like I'm now in a spam on your phone you get spam on your phone never know so you never get like random text messages that are like trying to sell you or do something okay I don't know what to do now I'm sure I can call AT&T but someone got your number well no it's cuz I called a phone number and I got automatically put on some text message calling list so you could block them I'm sure you'll find out what number that's coming from mattel 18 teen no text messages from them yeah but that's should against the law cuz I thought what if we accidentally called that number by mistake now that you're just signed up for some spamming that's yeah you don't I mean yeah it's true it's bullshit yeah but whatever it's amazing that's taking this long for them to infiltrate you know think about how long people are getting text messages or just now they're figuring out how to get in there that's amazing yeah you know that that's pretty incredible when you really think about it yeah dude now with the Patriot Act they can listen to everything they can listen to all your calls with every fucking new bill that gets passed they can dig into all your text messages and all in the name of you could be a terrorist all you have to do is be like a single guy in your 40s you could be a terrorist you know all you have to do is this like such all you have to do is have like a year's worth of food there's like someone was I forget who did a description of it but was it John Stuart I forget who it was but they had this all these descriptions of what what is defined how it defines a terrorist now it's unbelievable it's ridiculous like if you have missing fingers that you you could you should you could be a terrorist if you were that could be a watch that I have you're a terrorist yeah that's right yeah that one watch yeah that one watch because they used that for timing shit right right it's just standard standardized just to watch a fucking regular watch all right and you could be on a watch list god dammit how did this all fall apart like this that Bruce Lipton guy kind of freaked me out yeah did he freak you out a little no I mean I think for the most part was Reagan was right you know I don't believe that or don't and I I've always kind of believed what he talks about so I agree I don't know it's I hundred percent believe what he says you know who's gonna freak you out man Michael Rupert when I get that guy on there he's got a smoked cigarettes with you to remember smokes cigarette every five seconds that collapse boovie man alright you know and I want you to talk to him too about the whole thing that he said about the cell phones membre said they were there stopped upgrading their towers and you're like oh yeah yeah he's probably change his mind now yeah yeah that's just obvious now yeah but what that does speak to a direction right that he was going in yeah I need her when it when is I want to rewatch that movie again oh no cuz I remember I was talking about a few things on that but we're I'm exchanging emails back and forth with his assistant so there's so many people I want to get on the podcast yeah me too like who else I don't get Nicholas Arden hadn't niggas about Nick Swardson back yeah we'd love to get Nick back if he's got more than 45 minutes to kill Kevin prayer Kevin would be great again I just told you I did talk of the show you saw yeah he's great I want his Christmas party it was awesome oh yeah I saw pictures of it what the fuck was he dressed like it well dad that he had a p90x holiday party and so you were supposed to dress in holiday sweaters and mixed with p90x clothing so that's the workout program for kal program so it's a p90x cuz I have no idea the xmas this is what it was yeah and so you had to come there with your favorite ornaments and stuff like that so I cut off the avatar fleshlight vagina put a hook in it oh no you did this yeah I watched it and a hook in it yeah and hung it on the tree when I walked in no and then it was it was cool though but his his he was one of those arcade games I told you about this he has a MAME arcade game which had like every single allegedly every single video game on it and like he had dragons lair spaces like and there was this game called rastenn I don't know if you remember this from the I think was the 80s it was like this Conan O'Brien guy it was just like a simple slasher like a Conan O'Brien slasher and it was one of the coolest games to see because I haven't seen it since I was a kid so check out rastan see if it brings back memories is that Conan O'Brien dude I wasn't watching the Barbarian they were showing some game I don't know what it was but I believe it was a game for the iPad some crazy fantasy game you're upgrading your weapons and swords some but it was like really wild fucking animation and I was watching I was like this is incredible it's not an iPad it's really new you know whose is that that's uh it was the reviewing it yeah oh is it cliff he's game yeah it's cliffy one of his uh the Matt amazing epic yeah dude it's fucking amazing looking I mean it's it's incredible and I'm I was watching I was like wow we're at the level where that is coming out on a fucking iPad that's incredible yeah the iPad is pretty badass and that supposedly the third one's gonna be the rumor at the ladies room it was February 3rd was gonna rub your dick it seems like they just came out with a second one I'm kind of getting an area about that shit well it's been almost a year I think they're doing one a year I still have the first generation I'm an old holdout I'm like one of those dudes you meet that has the the iPhone with the aluminum at the bottom you use those anymore things made out of wood you can't use them anymore I mean you have to like it's you barely use them you can't you guys have to not ever update your itunes yeah yeah if you update your iTunes or you're fucked everybody says that to what you were saying that when you whenever you update your operating system on the older phones it just like it seems so clunky yeah they make it yeah they make it on computers ass for the for the new shit for the next level shit yeah but they do it on computers also they're forcing you they're holding your hand yeah you could look at it and that they're forcing you in a bad way but actually the forcing you to kiss the fuck up it's positive in general everyone's faster getting shit done faster yeah I guess playing with yourself faster right did oh did you see that shootout that happened here oh no yeah I would yes what the fuck was that that I don't know but what's crazy is I found they released this name I read this small report where they Rosella be one of the stores okay so there was this guy on I think was hot right next to the movie theater they said I'm gonna think of Hollywood and Vine well that just had a gun he was walking down the street and just every time somebody would drive by just Bam Bam shooting people like non-stop one guy got hit in the head who was a music executive here and I think he might have died hit him in the head just like he just pointed hit right in his head and bam I and so he was just walking down so he doing all this shit finally a police came and they shot him down and they killed him but what's crazy they released his name finally he was like a 26 year old and if you go to his Twitter page and I tweeted it I don't know where it is it's on my timeline but if you go to his Twitter page he he like was a his photos or the people we followed we're all marijuana activists gun activists and then c-span shit oh and then so I found his Facebook then when I was Facebook and his Facebook he he brought like six days ago broke up went to single in relationship and he was like saying things too you know like I finally get what Steve Jobs last words or something like that and then my oh great and then but what's weird is like if you looked at what he watched like his interests on Facebook and stuff was like c-span and like weird shit like who who watch a c-span 1 & 2 that's what is this and yeah that's like that's like looking at your registry right yeah and he also was like his he only tweeted like three times and one of his tweets was like Charlie Sheen need more tiger blood I ran out like whoa Jesus Christ there's some sad crazy fuckers out there man right that's a scary thing though that this guy would just randomly start shooting people that scares me to see that the video that they certified was very scary I was terrifying it's just walking down the street shooting at cars innocent people yeah it's scary shit man but you know you have to worry about that whenever you have you know more than more than ten people yeah even when you have ten people man you know how many people don't someone when they were young they were normal and then as they got older they got crazier and crazier when reality didn't sort of fit their their vision of what reality was supposed to be and then I started doing a lot of creepy shit and you know never really sort of saw the world for the way it really is and then they start getting crazy yeah have you ever met people like that a lot most comics yeah we know a lot of them they were crazy right yeah that's an interesting thing to see it's an interesting thing to see someone legitimately lose their grip on reality yeah we've seen it you and I've seen it we've seen it many times yeah it's fucking weird huh it's weird weird watching people slip away so what do you do about that can't do shit no I can't bring them back they're gonna bring back themselves I just totally forgot what we were talking about yes so right before what this last thing Todd bridges and the Olive Garden you need to take him to the off Garden when that that would that would be nice if you guys I don't wanna hang out with him I just feel bad that I said that I shouldn't have you know it's not in keeping with my idea of being a positive person but that's just sometimes shit happens man you get tired you say something you shouldn't have said that's why you know no one's perfect we apologize and then we move on mm-hmm I'm glad to get to you man Todd bridges is a nice guy I'm sure and he gets it any you know he probably well I just don't like when I do something like that and I don't I don't like how I was thinking you know sometimes you get tired man fuck you make some fucking mistakes you know if you get tired and cranky or if you're just over well over run or overburdened do you find yourself like when when you're tired and cranky like you just don't like your behavior lately I've just been a complete asshole just because I have no time I feel like sometimes with your girl like sometimes you like it deteriorates your relationship because you're tired and you're just snappy you know yes it's - needle to me it's like I'm in my own world because I'm trying to deal with a thousand things that are coming at me and and so like the other day I had to check myself and I had to like say Larry look I am completely ignoring my relationship right now I'm like not I need to stop work stop working as much so I made my making myself not do as much on purpose like I'm taking a day off here and there where like I went almost two months like every day need to activate yellow band huh yeah I did yellow band activate honey band I was controlling the situation well that's that's something like you need to work on look I'm not even known about anything like the other day I was on stage and I got offstage and they were they turned off the podcast or now Icehouse chronicles I'm like what and they're like well it wouldn't go to open so to turn it off I'm like wait wait you're the guy in charge don't you know why you knew I was coming back but you know it's just working out that now you'll never do it right now I'm like nyeh don't ever do it so you have a little bit of trial and error but that's like what's cool about the Joe Rogan experience like we started off with snowflakes and there we go alas something new yeah on a laptop just for a goof and now we're coming up on two year anniversary so we're gonna have to we're gonna have a celebration of this shit yeah we're also this week we're having two shows and Saturday we're having a huge party so maybe that could be though yeah sure that's gonna be a yeah that's close enough to the the time yeah we start around like New Year's Eve right Christmas Eve Christmas Eve yeah Christmas Eve so yeah we're right there I mean what is it like the 13th or something like that today yeah have you ever heard of the Rose Bowl parade yeah no I've heard of it it's right here okay what does that happen I think I think Year's Eve or New Year's Day or something like or Christmas Day but a podcast from the Rose Bowl I know but they put these think weird signs on the street outside the studio here and they say any cars parked here from December 23rd to January 4th are subject to inspection oh well then that makes sense I know you can't have someone park a fucking dirty bomb yeah but does that mean any kind of spectrum they just want to look at what kind of CDs I'm not this homeland security they don't find your weed I'm gonna find your weed and your girlfriend's porn they're gonna lock you up in jail I gotta take they're not in this mask out of the window yeah take this mask out right now and put a fucking American flag how about that I have these um these these things you have in front of the window I know we hang American flags yeah we need it what's more American than our thoughts and ideals is real America not this bullshit actually fuckin corporate swindle fest that's going on Brian real America is about speaking your fucking mind it's about creating something uniting together and one giant bond as the greatest nation the world has ever known so we should put up our fucking flies because we truly represent America not those cunts that would try to stop us I'm a hey mine upside down that bad is that masturbate yeah I wouldn't do it if anything that would piss off a soldier whatever it's for people hanging upside down comes back from Iraq and he's had a fucking hard time and he's loading up his gun right when he drives by your window and sees you with an upside-down flag decides to pump nine into your fucking window huh what if you have somebody hanging upside-down and it's upside to tie right for them oh okay I see what you're saying so you have the world's upside down I think you can get away with that as long as you have like little bushes and stuff by the guy's feet as well has to be clear the guys to be glued to the ground like he's a walk walking through the park and the American flag is just there all nice and proud just upside-down from your perspective right but he lives in Australia it's called thinking up you know get up from the land down under or everything's upside down you know what Australia you can't even fuck around outside you got to put sunscreen on because their ozone layer is gone that's so weird they got a big hole in the ozone layer so when you know that I see Alaska yeah I know no I think you said I'm in Australia if I did say Alaska because I was gonna say something about Alaska as well but in Australia they have like these ads on the side of buses and they're fucking pretty graphic man and they show people with chunks of their body cut out from skin cancer we show the bitches and it says you know let's you know I forget the ad campaign but the basic message is hey you can get this from the Sun dude you got to be careful and then interesting that's weird yeah they have they have more issues than we do apparently that ozone layer is a motherfucker and everybody says it was hairspray and all sorts of different things that I wrote at it the meringues terrifying you imagine yeah I guess it just all settles down there by the way the the earth is built I don't know if that's the theory that's been disproven or proven or what finally watch tangled and I really like that maybe a little my uh my MIDI middle one told me yesterday that she's not uh she's not a fan of tangled anymore why not has this tangled fan and are at this tangled thing in her her room she's like I don't like tangle anymore it's funny thing about kids they they love something and then they watch the fuck out of it it was Dora the Explorer for a little while she would watch the fuck on the Dora the Explorer and now she doesn't want to have anything to do with it they move on to the next show and then it becomes the next show that they're massively obsessed with you know it's really interesting but tangled now but just a year ago man tangled you know when we took her to see it and then she saw it in the movie then we got a DVD and brought it home all my goodness she couldn't watch it enough man you know what's the craziest thing because every time I want to venture Adventure time I have to watch the kids commercials the kids commercials for toys are the most ripped out insane like if I was if you're a coke addict never watched kids cartoons during the day and look at the commercials there was one about these the toy was little crabs that had makeup on and like really nice hairstyles and it was just the commercial made Knossos like why would they be marketing to kids like dressing up crabs it was intense ridiculous I tweeted something earlier today i retweeted something that someone sent me where they were talking about kids today and all the different people I'm gonna click on it just so everybody knows what it is RSA animate changing education paradigms and paradigm is felt PA ra di GM s if you're a tard like myself hey that was rude I apologize but this is a very interesting little thing that someone made that points out how kids today are inundated with so much fucking massive massive amounts of information and that you know to take these kids and force them into watching something really boring all day like school like staring at a blackboard and then you know you wonder why they're incredibly you know detached from what's happening there their world is the world of explosions and fucking video games and intense music on their on their iPhone it's you know it's loud and emotional and you make them shut that off when you come into this room to tell them boring shit you know I mean it's almost like but you know what he was talking about earlier about programming I don't think it's like a conscious effort to do that I think it's just they're lazy and it's just the shit design but man to take kids and take them from the world that they can experience now with the internet and video games and movies and songs and cars and technology and then make them sit in the fucking class and listen to stupid shit all day it's amazing what they need to do they totally need to do this Electronic Arts and THQ and all these big video game companies need to start selling video games that have to do with shit they want to teach the people if you ask me any question on fallout 3 or whatever like like about bottle caps or whatever I know exactly what you're talking about I memorized I have this thing memorized in my head I will never forget it I know the mansion if you should do if you could teach kids through a video game that would actually let them like go back on an adventure through time and learn about history and like be a part of it yeah you're you're George Washington you know you don't know everything about George Washington by the end of that video game and the kids will remember that every single kid likes to play video yeah but you'd go back there and just start punking people go Grand Theft Auto style start fucking shooting people off there always make it so if you do any of that stuff you you you get taken away recess or you get a detentions if you fucking shoot somebody in the kneecap you get detention you know I guess that could start the beginning of the end now I don't know it would make history interesting you know you'd have to have some really entertaining person like it was like a history major or you know a history professor rather it was just really good at figuring out the best way to construct the stories you know and getting and getting you into it and then showing you cool shit to that's another one like showing you documentaries and cool pictures and stuff like but you know when you get to certain things like mathematics and stuff like that how are you gonna make a video game where kids learn math and they and then it's fun it's fun for someone who wants to play like fall weirdo to do something like to call the duty you know you wanna play call of duty in there make let's play numbers alright you know I wonder what do you I don't think you can teach that that was unless it was something like a Sim City or some kind of like you know you you're married to the Octomom and it's like a math video game thing just so well some people love math I'm just talking shit cuz some people actually sit down and do mathematics for fun I hate math so much we had Tara Patrick in the studio the other day and her biggest turn-on is a guy that knows math really want to have a kid you know why cuz she wants him to know exactly how many dick she sucks she wants him to really be able to wrap that around his head she was not not to be vague oh honey I know you suck a couple likes listen I'm tired of your bullshit listen to me do you know what a million is can you wrap your head around a million she was preggers man she's starting Wow nice she's got that little you know prettier juice on her John Tanner well she's got a little you know like she's got a little chunk to her if you beat off to pregnant chicks you sick fuck I I did because it's different you know I I don't look for it but I'll bet dad that girls pregnant and hi double Bailey oh really that's amazing so when you around her and she was hot it was exciting she just she you know there's a few girls like she's she's just hot to be around you know there's a few girls of it you know smelly you know but no she's gorgeous and she just you know she retired so she hasn't shot in like four or five years or something like so boring a virgin basically but she just released a new photo shoot on some foreign magazine and she brought it and it was nice she's a nice body she's pretty hot and a nice husband her boyfriend or father of the baby that's coming what's he do he's a makeup artist oh but he just did like the new Superman movie and stuff like that I said like he's a legit like he was really cool he's a really nice guy it's just a funny thing where some dudes just can't accept that you know some dudes are never gonna be able to accept the fact that chick was a porn star yeah you know and some guys just like yeah whatever whatever I'm getting mine I don't know it's interesting how weird we are with sex it's a strange culture where everything is sold with sex but yet if you you know if you really get down to the nitty-gritty we're really fuckin weird about it we're really insecure about it and insincere about it it's strange right mm-hmm we have a fucked up culture man it is a weird culture you actually try to suppress nature it's a strange strange fucking way we live man but selling things with pussy you know when that makes sense when you get married when you get married it makes sense because when you're single and you could you know you know like well this relationship doesn't work and we break up all to find someone else and now be interesting cuz it'll be a new person but when you're married and you're commit to this idea that you're just gonna be with this person for the rest of your life then you start like seeing some chick selling watches you know only that dirty bitch that dirty bitch were the fucking long legs like it really like attracts you like maybe this Omega watch is gonna get me some of that right you know it really does work you know it's it's funny it's like I guarantee you if you had commercials for like a cell phone service in Ethiopia and you showed like delicious food in the background you know like here's a cell phone it's fucking roast beef they're mashed potatoes and giant pictures of orange juice all this yummy food and these poor fucks will probably look at that like oh and they would want to buy that cell phone mm-hm doesn't that make sense yeah this podcast is over isn't it mm-hm pretty much yeah sure I'm like we've done I think over three hours yeah well we had to come back so how'd I give my apology to Todd bridges I really do Phil belt I felt stupid about that and we really wanted to
