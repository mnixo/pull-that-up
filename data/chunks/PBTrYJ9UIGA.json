five four three two boom and we're live Remy Warren international man of adventure how's it going cui I purposely didn't ask you or talk to you about the grizzly bear attack because I wanted to save it you want it you want what is it like to have survived but literally being will you two feet away from an attacking grizzly close yeah you could have grabbed it yeah yeah yeah easily easily oh it was that was just nuts it was one of those things okay I've thought about it a million times I'm sure how long ago was this this was so that would have been early October or mid October so you guys are three months three months to come around yeah and yeah man it's just one of those things that I've thought about it so many times in my head and I've always been I think Steve was the same way like I'd be pretty cool to survive a bear attack get scratched up a little bit after that experience I thought to myself that never happened okay yeah Stevie's always say Steven oh we're talking about from meat eater podcast and he has a two-part series on this particular bear attack but he's always say he wanted to get clawed across the chest and have like not a tattoo but like a big class a marking like what are the odds that that happens yeah I think that in order to get that you have to go through a really really horrible experience there's guys that have had those attacks or there's guys that have had those detects a lot but yeah I mean there I've been around a lot of wild animals and seen a lot of things and been charged by bears and this was just different it was that kind of attack where while it's happening you're going this is not gonna pan out well somebody's gonna die something either you're just looking at this bear and it's coming in hot and just everything it's a weird experience you don't your memories a little foggy of it everything happens so fast but it felt like it's so long so the Adrenaline's must overwhelm anything yeah and you don't even think about I just remember it was it was a weird situation so all maybe I'll just kind of recap this story so we're we're on afognak island and we're hunting in the fog nook island is yeah so a fog neck island has some of the largest bears in the world they're brown bears they're they're big brown bears they can be over a thousand pounds so we're hunting elk they're my brother and myself have hunted elk on that island before and it's just a miserable place to be what's a fascinating hunt the way you guys were describing it because the just the fact that you would choose out of all the places you can go you pretty much can go anywhere you want yeah you chose to go on this brutal adventure hunt because it's so difficult and says once is it like vanilla was talking about this once and the way he described it is like there's things that are fun while you're doing them but they're not fun later like roller coasters yeah and then there's things that are terrible and awful but you'll think about them forever and look back at them fondly yeah that's exactly what this is it's that after the fact you think back and you go in the moment you go I will never do this again and then about a year later you I should do that again and what is it about the place that's so miserable well it's just it's hard to walk through it looks it looks easy hiking and there's just this big mountain where you can get to you with a plane you've kind of got to climb this big mountain and the vegetation is so thick and it's so steep that it takes forever to go somewhere so to put it in perspective to go say a mile might take five hours whoa that's how much vertical it like a map mile yes so the way the crow would fly if you just go in a mile and then another distance could take you half that time or a quarter of that time but there's a big mountain in between where you need to go plus the vegetation and it's really steep so you've got all that kind of working against you plus you can't really walk in just a straight line there you've got to navigate around all kinds of stuff there's you from the place I'm in this Jamie that was so that was after the bear right after yeah I'll have to figure out because I right after the bear attacked I pulled out my phone and just kind of like recording everyone's reactions and then I put it on my Instagram story but I'll I'll try to find it tonight and I'll post it on to some I'll figure out a way to yeah interesting together they let you save them now now this was like three weeks before that unfortunately so this place is miserable it's rainy all the time rainy high winds thick thick dense vegetation and literal monsters yeah I mean giant bears and then big the elk are probably was they way they wait they can wait up to 1,400 pounds easy way bigger yeah it's like the size of two normal way twice because like an average elk would probably be around five hundred pounds in most places in a really big one like we're talking about the California ones it to hone sometimes can get to a thousand yeah this is another four hundred pounds exactly it's a lot that's a biggie shine and there's bears that eat those giant and also those bears are giant the Bears can be over 1,200 1,500 pounds of sauce eleven feet or more uh yeah eleven feet eleven feet it's nuts eleven foot bear no this one that attacks you guys how big do you think it was if you had to guess I would say well I would say it's eleven and a half feet because I know because actually after we went in there my friend who's a pilot there and dropped us off he called me about a week or two later he's like they shot that bear they went after you guys somebody went in there same place bear attacked him they killed it in self-defense it was 11 and a half feet and I think almost 1,200 pounds oh so there's very good odds that that was the same bear I would imagine that it was there's very I mean see Mary had taken over that area seemed about the same sup when I when it came in I thought that's a big bore it wasn't one of those ones you think oh that's a it looked like a big mature animal in there piecing together what happened in my mind later but yeah so we're hunting elk on this island Stephens up getting an L we hang it in a tree we do all the stuff you're supposed to do get the meat away from the carcass but we had yet to see a bear up until this point and when my brother and I went in there a few years earlier we just saw bears every day we'd see six bears a day so your minds just bear bear bear when you're seeing them all the time you're not seeing them all the time you get a little lacks and that's where we really screwed up because the attack went down no one was prepared we were just sitting around having some sandwiches and one uh so we're at we're filming and there's six of us all together and I think that large group that six is what saved us because when the bear ran in it was six of us sitting kind of in like a semicircle a strange circle and when that bear came in we did that scatter effect and I think that scatter was kind of like if a Lions going after a zebra they use their numbers and stripes to confuse the lion is that scattering of things just going everywhere that caused confusion for the bear so I think the bear went in thinking whatever is under that tree I'm gonna kill it and it thought it was one thing and when we blew up into six different pieces it just tried to kill everything at once and couldn't actually get one person God but it's so lucky yeah it was crazy because we're sitting down we decided we'll have lunch before we hike back because the day before we we hiked a long ways we got back to camp it three in the morning or something I can't remember two or three in the morning we'd barely eaten so everyone was just thinking let's have lunch regroup hike out so we're Pat when the other guys that was with us brought the Jetboil to boil up some coffee so I was going around collecting water from everyone to get coffee go around and when I sat down I took my pack off and I'd the whole week I'd been doing this thing where I take my pistol from the pack belt and put it on the holster on my body when I dropped my pack and I it was that weird deal where I took the pack off and I'm thinking about switching and like it's fine you know and I thought I'll just sit because there's few times I'd set my pack down I was like I'll just sit I'll lay on my pack like as a chair a backrest and then I'll flop the you know have the pistol right there so it's within arm's reach and I'll be sitting there well I go around get the water and then someone had moved kind of where I was sitting so now so I sit down across from the pack where my pistol is and then thinking and I was thinking about how hey hand me that pistol but I just like you know you don't wanna be that guy like oh yeah the guy's not everybody had pistols just me and Jana said a pistol and then and then Pat's behind us he goes I hear something and I look up and that's that bears like dead set so Steve would be where you are the bear behind Steve so like Steve was between me and the bear his back was to it like how far away not far I don't know 30 yards so the first time you see the 30 yards and is it for nerds yeah it's dead run Oh super fast I just locked eyes with this thing I mean I see it coming in the hallway just beady eyes locked in on me and I think this thing's gonna kill me and so I'm thinking you know when I say I'm thinking I don't know if I'm thinking I'm just I just remembered what I what was kind of going through my head at the time I thought oh fuck I'm gonna die and my protections right there like I'm gonna die this is that sense situation where I'm dead and they talked about it and he could have saved himself but his guns on the ground and I think that that was like go for the gun was my whole thing so I start to go for the gun Yanis would have been here as I remember it and so I start to go for the gun and realize fuck I don't have time to get to my gun and it's three feet away that bear is like right there come so fast so fast so I kind of do like a football Juke move left right and then wheel around right do like a spin with my back and the start running to the left and at that point Yanis it I didn't know this at the time because I looked at some pictures after it's kind of piece everything together so Yanis was sitting right next to me I think he got up to turn there was some trekking poles right here he grabbed the trekking pole so probably while I was juking he reached around grabbed the trekking pole swings around hits the bear in the face Jesus so then the I see the bear running off then I see someone going down the mountain with the bear I'm thinking he's got someone so I grab my pistol start going down the mountain yelling cowering up I guess I count off and everyone's like what right and then Garrett pops up out of the bushes and his eye he's like wide-eyed so Garrett aka dirt dirt myth was the one who was on top of the somehow he's on the Bears back so I think when the bear wheeled around he like hit him and he ends up on the back so I saw just legs and bear going down the mountain I saw his legs on the back of the bear some thought like maybe the bear had him in his job yeah that's what I was thinking I mean what if that was in a movie you like get the fuck out [Laughter] yeah and then we kind of circled up around the tree and the real scary part was that bear so it was so thick you really couldn't see and you could see maybe as far as the wall is from us with was that the trees feet yeah and just real thick brush and you'd hear the bear charged in again and we only have the two pistols Yanis and I and the the wind was so strong there's no way we could use bear spray so we hear the bear charging in and me and Jana stir like pistols out ready waiting for this thing to pop out at point-blank range and then it would anywhere yelling bear and then that thing stops and then it would just you crash off and then it would charge in from the other direction like circle around the tree the other way and did that I think three times that was just under it's like a horror movie where it keeps coming in from different angles oh it was weird it was not a fun feeling you just felt so small so you guys had come back to the carcass that was hanging in the tree and it had probably claimed that carcass we don't know they knew the various was there I assume now the the weird thing was is it came in with the wind so in the wind was blowing pretty stiff and say into her face mm-hmm and the bear came in with the wind so he wasn't going into the scent right normally they go around they catch the scent and they charge in so I don't know if he'd heard something if he was there we saw what slightly looked like bear sign both steena Steve and I kind of pointed it out but we weren't we were thinking maybe it was something older you wouldn't you say bear son you mean bear shit the a bear shit in the base of the tree yeah and so I think you know we did some things that were wrong but in in the instance what saved us all now if we were to do it a hundred times over I would say I would do it differently but it worked out how it worked out so I obviously I would never mops to just have nothing and have this weird scatter effect yeah but I think that what saved everyone from getting anyone from getting hurt which is a miracle was the fact that when we scattered it just confused that bear because he kind of had this look after he started he started wheeling around kind of like trying to pick a person trying to go and he couldn't target one individual and then things started hitting him and somebody's on his back and I think it just freaked him out and he went off to regroup keep charging back in but never made that full charge all the way back in again wow that's crazy how many people have ever gone through a bear attack unscathed like that and a group of six yeah and the thing about it was it wasn't just a bear attack but had looking at it later had someone even been grabbed and mauled not to death but injured I think that it would have been very unlikely that that person was survived because we the weather that came in was so bad I don't know if it 100 mile an hour winds I mean you aren't getting rescued in 100 mile an hour winds I wouldn't think Brian I don't know those Coast Guard helicopters I'm not really sure what they're capable of maybe someone to say yeah we we'd go but that would be a very hard thing the gusts were so bad when we came back over the ridge to our camp now we're all on edge you just want to get back to camp to put it mildly yeah every and and then of course we see bears on the way back and were like thinking is this Bergen follow us you guys see on the way back one wonder so we started barreled a different one yeah smaller but still after that yeah you're thinking now before that happened we're thinking no bears will attack us after that happened we're thinking every bear will attack us and we start to go over the ridge back toward camp I think at that point I was in the front Steve and someone else was behind me as we go over this little saddle the wind hits knocks the first three people over whoa one of the guys have like a pack cover on his pack ripped to that off and just sent it in the never endeavors I mean it went up and it was crazy I've never seen anything blow away like that it just went flying so then we get down the winds are gusting the rains pouring we look down the to two main tents are destroyed Stephen eyes tents are you know flopped down on the ground I see somebody's sleeping pad blowing away sleeping bag is getting soaked so now we have a real situation of hypothermia if the bear didn't get us this hypothermia might and we now no longer have a camp that we can just go to so we've been attacked by a bear our camps destroyed we get down there one of the tents is jacked up we can take all the camp down and relocate behind the spruce gather up everybody stuff mostly guys sleeping bags are wet we end up like restringing the bear fence around this new camp this is after you've just had a full day and been attacked by a bear and by bear fence we're talking about one of those electric fences yeah it's a little electric how do those things work it's a battery operated deal you run electric fence it's like ribbond electric fence just like a cattle yard would have you run that around and then it's just off of it six D batteries that's it pulsus and it just it tingles just a little bit it doesn't really if you touch it it doesn't really light you up so I think they just I don't like that feeling especially if I got like their wet nose they might feel it with their nose first brush shocks him and gets him to run off hopefully yeah I don't think I'd like cuddle up with my dead carcass inside that bear fence I'm interested that much you know but yeah I was it was just a nut today so how did you guys have any set camp back up so we there was a spruce that we were using and we got behind that spruce tree and then put one of the teepee tents up kind of tied it off to the spruce and then Steve and I had two small backpacking tents that we put underneath a few of the limbs cut out some limbs and got up under there and it's still 100 mile an hour winds yeah 7100 hundred and something gusts out there and then some of the guys we actually cut wood and stashed it under the tree earlier so that was good we had semi dry wood and we dried some out in the tent before and the tarp had kind of fallen over it so we had a little bit of dry when we were after beep a couple hours we were able to get a fire going inside that inside the tent and then they could dry out some of their sleeping bags and stuff like that Jesus Christ it was crazy how long did tape before you guys got off the island so I guess it would have been the next day in the evening did you get any sleep yeah I slept pretty hard Wow I was ready for bed how could you sleep knowing that that fucking thing's out there yeah it's not like that for me it was I was kind of I was thinking that was awesome we survived when it's over you're fine with I was fine with it you didn't think like we're still in the same island the same bear still there and we only walked like how many miles I probably three miles three miles it's nothing yeah especially for a bear for a bear that wouldn't have been a problem for us it takes five six hours seven hours something like that it was crazy but yeah and after it happened once we cleared the area I was okay but in the moment I thought this is it this is how I died it was a weird feeling I've had that feeling a few times in my life and I just don't like that that helpless feeling of like thinking but what scares me the most is that thought of thinking while you're dying you're think about that like while you're dying knowing that this is that last thought I don't like the idea of that last thought like that's if I was carrying a plane and the planes going down and you think well I know I'm gonna die there's nothing I can do and those thoughts that go through your head I don't like those thoughts just not see coming because those thoughts are the worst part I've thought of that before like how do you deal there's thought the feeling right before the plane hits the ground right what what out of your parachute doesn't go and that's the same with the bear attack that bears coming in you have no if you have a gun you're focused on your task and then if the bear got you crushed your head maybe you would you have that task to focus on but your focusing on the inevitable is going to happen there's nothing I can do I don't like that thought it's the worst they are crazy anime there I mean Adam Greentree who were talking about before the podcast did this 28 day backpacking trip in Montana and Colorado and elk hunting in September and solo all by himself and took a bunch of Instagram pictures and putting them on Instagram story of him holding up a pistol with a sow Grizzly standing on her two legs looking at him in the distance while it's snowing out and she got within 15 yards she Bluff charged him within 15 yards she's just trying to get him away from her cubs different situation than with with you guys because the sow when they have the Cubs would just try they just don't want their kids to get fucked up by you yeah they don't want you anywhere near them so they try to scare you off yeah there's Adam yeah I remember I saw that I was crazy yeah those in Montana I think look at the bottom bottom comments some dickhead chunni 94 you are cunt and then his next comment hashtag vegan hashtag animal-rights hilarious fucking idiots I hope that guy gets eaten yeah it's my Lily I don't know I hope you get eaten shiny but you silly fuck yeah it's not a fun feeling those Bluff charges are still extremely scary because you never know what if that's gonna be the one yeah that they said yeah well in Montana's had quite a few lately you know there was that really crazy video where the guy had half his head hanging off like his scalp was hanging off his head he's explaining what happened it bit his arm not yeah and he apparently was just was just scouting and that guy if I recollect right I think that was him he was kind of one of those guys that I think even might have talked classes on bear safety and stuff like that and I think afterwards he said yeah it's a fucked up deal it happens well he was lucky had a backpack on apparently cuz he was down and the thing was just tearing him apart and but he was you know cuddled up I don't like that yeah so a few years ago when I was in Alaska I met this guy and he was an older guy I don't know if I talked about this before but he was a older guy that was on that same Island and he got attacked by a I think it was like an 11-foot brown bear while he was skinning a deer and killed the bear with a knife but he got destroyed yeah killed it with a buck knife yes he's probably 80 something now there used to be I remembered reading stories about it in outdoor Life magazine when I was a kid and then somehow I got to kind of interview him and get to the whole story firsthand and recorded it on a video and stuff where's the video I just got it on my hard drive I mean yeah I'm God I'll put it out this year is cool how big was the knife I was a 500 lady a six inch book knife something like that you know the black handle almost like a yeah like a solid straight blade knife yeah and the bear like attacked him he kept stabbing it fighting it all what is this Jamie yeah that's the video yep that's no that's your video no that's on my video no oh that's the guy yes the guy yeah that's that little tiny knife yeah he killed it with that little thing yeah oh my god that's not a big knife No so where did he kill it he stabbed it it was well like you kept getting it and neck and then the bear would go off and then charge him again and then finally the bear went off he said it was pretty sick like getting wobbly every time you attack it'd be less and less and then I think he actually grabbed his rifle and shot it last time I'm a bear was laying there because he was able to get the bear away well how fucked up was he he was really fucked up and and there's a part of the story so there's a cabin there that I have actually been by they got him to that cabin and they had the cabin they have these things they called Arctic doors where it's to keep the cold out when you open the door it's like a two door system mm-hmm well the way that the Arctic doors set up the the emergency responders couldn't get a gurney in there so the owner of the cabin rips out a chainsaw and cuts his wall open whoa to get in state I mean saved his life because they then they got the gurney and the the Coast Guard got him out he was in the hospital for a long time skin graft after skinny Graff and all kinds of surgeries and he survived the problem with those stories is that gives me hope I always have these stupid fantasies like if a mountain lion ever comes after me I'm gonna look its debit in the net yeah you think about all that stuff until it's just right on top of you yeah oh shit no this is gonna work I'm looking up the thousand pound there so I think no way I think we're I mean I know we're really weak like we're so weak you feel a strong person it's really really we exactly you feel really strong up until the point this is breaths on you not gonna happen when I was on Newsradio we did a scene once with the chimpanzee I don't know anything he never made air I think it got edited out but we had a baby chimp it was a tiny chimp I think it might have even had a diaper on but this little chimp was like 2 years old or something like that and it was on top of me playing around with me you know like you want to hold him again hold it and I'm holding it and it just just hits me a couple times on the back just fucking decides to smack me a little bit like a pumpkin and I just couldn't believe how fucking strong this little thing I had in my mind like like you think of a chimp that's like 30 pounds or 50 pounds you know that's like a person that's 30 pounds or 50 pounds like it is a totally different thing like its body was hard like wood like it felt like this table like everything was hard like you have it in your mind like oh that's skin and muscle that's like my skin and muscle no no crazy there's so there's so much stronger and they ain't shit compared to a bear yeah little baby chimpanzee in a diapers it's so crazy how weak we are I mean it's amazing how our brains and the development of our intellect and our ability to use tools and houses have protected us from all these animals and I wonder what we used to be like I I was thinking about that the other day and I was kind of debating in my head whether our tools I think our tools are the only thing we hide behind him oh for sure I think that's the only thing that kept us alive for so long I wonder what we used to be like though I wonder if before the tools we were more like the chimps maybe well we were showing photos of Australia Pittacus which is like one of the oldest human beings and it looks kind of like a chimp person you know yeah all covered in hair oh I'm sure they they weren't very big you know no it's about chimps eyes even the ender tall's Neanderthals apparently were only like 5 feet tall but they weighed 200 pounds really yeah it's like solid high for maybe something like that or the gorilla type chittering stupid jack giant bones like probably way stronger than us yeah that's crazy yeah we just figured out a way to build stuff and I guess we just got soft yeah it's amazing that we made it this far though yes yes bears like that and all the various animals that we must have encountered along the way I think that's why when the Pioneers came West they thought let's get rid of all the Bears oh yeah I see why they got rid of the Bears yeah there's a imagine those guys back then cruising across the plains and constantly being attacked constantly they had a legit fear of bears oh yeah because it wasn't we don't understand it in our society of having these natural predators be actual threats to you in your daily life yeah well not only that but back then they didn't even have like a real legit map of the territory no they were just trying to figure it out as they went along using around something and yeah well the last guy in California to be killed by a bear they named a town after him it's out near Bakersfield it was the last guy in California to get killed by a grizzly bear they're just interesting is that's the California state flag yeah as a grizzly bear on it but we killed all of them yeah like fuck this well I feel like the California grizzly bears I this is just from my opinion they would have been semi coastal so they've have been very similar to the brown bears with a mild climate they probably would not have needed to you hibernate like they would have been very large bears ah we should reintroduce them though well I think there's probably some people that would agree with you yeah you know a lot of the the people that want to reintroduce wolves everywhere yeah I say it for everyone they reintroduce somewhere else let's reintroduce a bear somewhere you know in the Monterey San Francisco all those jobs Jesus Christ imagine I couldn't I couldn't yeah I think people really have no idea what that is they think of it as some sort of a thing that they've seen on you know the Discovery Channel or in some cool YouTube video or you see them wandering through the fields but until you're with it was gonna say about with Adam said like Adam said he's like might he goes it's a fucking monster yes fucking monster he goes he goes people are out there looking for monsters he goes they're fucking real he goes monsters are real he goes he goes it's not their fault that they're monsters put that fucking month is the worst Adam green no that's a spot-on impression that's exactly like him he's around me I could do it better might could have that thing where they talk low at the end always guy was out but he was talking about how it was charging him from 15 yards he could see the muscles and the hair was standing straight up but it was looking and rippling and he was saying is this it and then he found out later that the gun had the wrong bullets in it that's crazy so the bullets were too big for the gun and the only way it would have worked is if he got one in the chamber he had he couldn't get cock it to put one in the chamber he would have had to individually put one in the chamber and then it would had one shot yeah that wouldn't work 200 yeah I remember it almost seemed like slow motion the way that hair was just waving back and forth its locking eyes with it I saw one grizzly once ever in the wild at close range in Alberta and it wasn't a big one it was like maybe six six and a half feet but don't look it gave me was so different and look black bears give you yeah this is a zero fucks look they just say no just look at you they look through you through you yeah look at you like your food yeah if it was gonna eat me and how it was gonna eat me yeah it wasn't looking at me like I was scary like black bears look at you like what are you doing man Am I can I come over here smell you I'm out of here and then they take off but the grizzly was just looking at me like these marble eyes like black mark actually yep those eyes the dead they are dead eyes man like shark eyes yo yeah it's nuts they will all the one all the videos you see bears tear in that cat might preserve where they've just eating fish in there chomping oh yeah well because they have food so much food imagine if you just took all this fish away and put one person there that's a look at those bears have and just completely change yeah we we showed a video of that pull that video up Jamie of that there's there's a crazy video of this guy who's a photographer who's taking pictures of looks like 15-plus brown bears and this one river and one of them walks up beside them and just sits down like literally sits down about ten feet away and apparently this one particular area is so rich with salmon no one's ever been killed there yeah that's that's probably I think it's cat my preserver I think that's what they call it but now you have to get permits cuz it's just such a popular place you go in you fly in there and you just take pictures of the bears and they're just they have so much food and they're so habituated they don't but if you took the food source away yeah this is it look at the size of that thing see that gun sitting there yeah that's not what you want to do I've decided yeah that seems like an issue it's not like you go over and grab that gun you be so crushed before yeah that's that and it's give me some volume so you can see it here breathing look at that thing fucking arms on that thing what is the name of this video Jamie so we give the people credit says bear sits next to guy and it just it's sitting is now is that bigger or smaller than the bear that attacked you guys that's probably smaller oh Jesus Christ yeah that's leave that thing I mean that's that's a like that's not a very old bear there yeah see how his chest is kind of smaller up in the top I guess yeah this video freaks me the fuck out though but this bear was just sitting right next to this guy but I mean you look at that and they just look so peaceful nice you would never think it's two completely different worlds when you go somewhere like this it goes that now you see how close that thing is yeah I know in that video it just looks like a docile fuzzy animal now watch this look down there that's so crazy there's literally like 15 huge fucking bears just pulling salmon out of that River that's not yeah I mean I think they're beautiful I think they're amazing and I'm glad they're there but it disturbs me to no end that people don't really understand what they are and they treat them as if there's some sort of a mythical creature in some Disney Land movie and they don't they don't understand conservation and controlling their populations which is what they did understand when they killed them all out of California they were like people are getting fucking killed at a regular basis it's a real problem and now British Columbia is in this weird situation my friend Michael Hockridge lives up in the woods in British Columbia he lives in the real me see the real BC but the population center is all Vancouver yeah and Coover which is this amazing city great restaurants and everybody's like what kill the Bears fuck that you don't need to kill the Bears but if you fly in to where my friend Mike lives and talk those people out there they can first of all they can hunt as many wolves as they want you could shoot a hundred wolves a day yeah there's no lack of wolves there is there they're everywhere there's we heard him you know I didn't I didn't see one when I was up there but you could hear him off in the distance but he said that he's got one in his house that jumped at him and shot in the air jumping off of a ridge at him Wow yeah he was making a predator call and this wolf closed in on him and literally jumped at him and he shot it in the air so in his house he's had it sounded like this he's got the the wolf mounted like in the same position it was in when it was trying to eat him yeah see people people have to realize that like I love wolves don't get me wrong but you know once I started hunting and then I started really looking into wildlife conservation and then the consequences of letting apex predators get out of control like it's scary yeah yeah that the wolves I've never really been afraid of but I did one time I was in Idaho whose spring time and I heard something in in the he was like real thick brush again and I hears something and all of a sudden this wolf pops like five or six feet away just full dead run like freak out hey I was about ready to kick it and it veered off the path and then I hear and then another one comes running in and I grab my gun and shooting the ground not one was from me to you Jesus Christ and in it ran off but I didn't know my initial thought was they were just chasing each other playing and I just happened to be in their way but I don't know you might have been lunch who knows and maybe I scared it because I had this well they hunt him in Idaho so they probably this was before you can hunt him oh I was just and I had you know well I got my gun off after first I'm just thinking no I don't know what's going on here but just in case some trace you know John does a crazy story you ever talk to him about it no we talked it he told it on the podcast but there's a video if anybody wants to listen to the actual story on the podcast you can find it but he shot a wolf excuse me he shot an elk in BC you know and oh no or about Alberta Alberta the thing was Alberta shot an elk and didn't realize that where the elk went down was literally right in a wolves den no there was these bones around and she was literally like a scene from that movie the gray yeah like there's like broken jack bottles so was him and John only has a four arrow quiver right yeah he shot one arrow which he used to take down the elk so he's got three hours left and he's got a guide with him and the guide has a rifle but the guide only has a handful of bullets he's got like three or four bullets yeah so they're standing there they're trying to take this elk out there quartering it up and then wolf starts circling them and howling and then they realize like oh fuck like we're literally in the Wolves den and one wolf makes a dead run at him he kills it with his bow another wolf makes a dead run on it they shoot it another wolf comes down he shoots it with the rifle so John is shot too with his bow and the other guy shot one with a rifle John's down to one air and the other guy has like maybe two bullets Wow and they're freaking the fuck out they have their back to a tree and wolves are circling them and they're howling because they've already lost three wolves yeah so he's literally getting charged by wolves with his back to a tree with a giant elk carcass behind him that they're trying to claim that's crazy crazing he said the alpha male was standing on a ridge he drew back on the on the wolf the wolf looked at him and bolted and took off and the rest of him took off a million yeah but he said they were circling him howling from like doing like a roll call like trying to see who's still alive like what's going on here but even after a gunshot and two of them killed with arrows it was still chart that's crazy fuck huh it's a great story yeah it is it's terrifying yeah but just let you know like people think well wolves don't harm people in World War two the Russians and the Germans had to call a ceasefire because so many people were getting killed by wolves they decided to call a ceasefire kill the wolves and then go back to killing each other that's crazy it's a crazy story world war one or two one I think it's one to James it too was like fed on the dead people well I think there were so many wolves like Siberia or Russia wherever the fuck they were there's a lot of wolves you know and they don't give a shit if you're a person or a chicken you go for it yeah I mean it's cold it's tough tough tough living is one it was one it's a world war one yeah but but it's a confirmed story I mean they just guys would go out on Scouts and they were just vanished and they they find their boot with like half a foot still in it and like fuck like people don't realize like a wolf can cut through an elk bone with its teeth yeah we need when you see a wolf actually take down and now it's pretty impressive if you seen it live yeah I've seen it I've seen a single seen a single wolf take down a spike elk once and what it did was it was just so fast too it ran in it ran it downhill they're so smart too but it was the elk was on a ridge the wolf starts chasing down and starts chasing the elk through what we call deadfall where a bunch of trees have fallen over so the elk has to exert itself and jump over things and then the wolf would come in and bite its back legs and that that wolf was so fast it could run almost between its legs as that Elks running I mean it was crazy and then it got its stomach open so it's dragging its guts and then the elk finally you would get its guts caught on the trees that it was going over and got it by the neck and just held it until it died how far away 300 yards maybe Wow yeah a lot of it some of it you couldn't see you know because it was a hill across from me so you could see it you'd lose it in the timber then it'd come out in a patch and then it was right below us and then we just kind of backed out and left it to its Doug they saw a grizzly bear swat a moose down with one shot really he said the the Grizzly literally lifted up its paw was chasing the moose and slammed it on the mooses back and broke its back really yeah that's how strong a fucking grizzly bear yes he said you couldn't you it's like to see it is want like to see it as one thing but to try to describe it it's like there's no way I want to describe because the amount of power that thing had in its paw he goes it just gives you a totally different perception of what it's capable of you know you have an idea well the Grizzlies big in the Moose is big yeah kind of a brawl nope grizzly swats it boom just snap just down most just went like you got shot that's crazy yeah when you see the power of them you think yeah yeah the whole getting scratched things probably that's not how you're getting scratched you're getting tore up so in BC they've recently they passed two two laws the first law they passed they were going to outlaw trophy hunts so what they said is because eating black bear is a traditional thing a lot of people eat black bear a lot of people that are you know that don't hunt or don't have anything to do with hunting don't know this but black bear is eaten by a lot of people yeah grizzly bears not eating as much but some people eat it a lot of the indigenous people eat it or whether they call First Nations and yeah in Canada they they'll eat brown bear some of them will but they decided no more quote unquote trophy hunts so so you can't keep the skin and you couldn't keep the head but you could keep the meat okay so as a weird weird law that got passed and people like well that doesn't make any sense because people you're I understand that they would want the people to only hunt for me that makes sense but why not allow them to keep the skull and keep the Cape and all that other stuff oh it's wasteful yeah then they changed it entirely and they said no Grizzly hunts at all and it was really quickly the one one law changed then it all changed and they based it on a really small sampling like they they had like I think was an email sample kriti Bowman has a thing on it they did a podcast on it but they explained how it went down that it wasn't they said 75% of the population agrees but it's not really 75% of the population 75% of the 3,000 people that they got responded to the email right and or the online petition or whatever the fuck it was but they have a problem now these people that actually live there like my friend Mike it's like okay if you're if you're not gonna control the populations of them like Mike how to shoot one that literally had its face in his cabin he opened the door and it was literally he shot it like we're literally right there like what were you are it was trying to come in his cabin and he shot it yeah I think that the reason there's I've heard that there's more people or attacked or affected by black bears yeah then grizzly bears or brown bears but it's just not as many people live in proximity to them right if you put a major metropolitan area on the middle of fog neck island people be getting jacked all the time yeah yeah and that's what's going on also in Montana I mean when these most recent attacks it's just because there's a large population of bears there and you can't hunt them and the good thing is that people hunted them almost to the brink of extinction and now through conservation they've brought them back to the point where they're no longer endangered but there's the the dispute between the animal rights people and the wildlife biologists and the hunters and you know trying to figure out what what how big does a population have to be before you realize that you have to chop some of them down like you don't nobody wants to eliminate grizzly bears you don't want a hundred thousand grizzly bears in the metropolitan Vancouver area yeah and it's it's a weird it's kind of a weird balance when you talking about hunting and animal populations and then you throw in predators because I don't think a lot of people even understand how humans have affected the environment in such a negative way that nothing will ever be as it was right people go oh well the Predators will control the prey populations and so why would we need to control the Predators well we've upset the balance in such a way that if we don't insert ourselves into the equation which as far as we know like humans have bending the equation hunting since the animals that aren't currently in North America have been around brown bears have always been hunted by humans you know when you're looking at the way things were I mean indigenous people on it um people before you know settlers and whatever came in the bears were being hunted so humans were always a natural predator of the bears but the way that humans have affected the landscape between obviously taking up habitat I mean habitats the number one thing is habitats gone invasive plant species is crazy the type of plants that grow in places they shouldn't be now we'll never get rid of those plants so because those plants are their native plants that the animals originally should be eating off of don't exist they they're out competed by noxious weeds and other things so the amount of food source is smaller so then the prey population cannot there they've lost their winter range because of developments and other things and then if you just inserted and said well all the Predators will take care of those numbers - well that's not true because the numbers can't get to what they were because there's less availability starting at the bottom level of food source and winter range and habitat so what do you do about though I mean is it is it possible to kill all the invasive plants no it's not possible no I mean there's there's no way that like where I'm from Nevada you you talk about invasive plants there's those species of grass sheep grass own fires wipe through the native grasses can't compete with that so the cheatgrass takes over has less nutrients and doesn't have the same type of browse that the native deer and whatever species deer and elk need mostly mule deer where's this cheatgrass coming from somebody brought it over because ornamental and it's just gone rampant most of our plants aren't native plants now really good oh yeah you look at yeah most of the plants that take over are invasive plants yeah our country's primarily invasive species maybe someone will call me out on this say that's not true but there's more invasive plants than native plants that's crazy yeah the grass is most of the grasses that we have around aren't from the region's Kentucky bluegrass in California doesn't make sense well it's always fascinating to me when an animal gets into an area where it doesn't have natural predators it's like a nutria yeah like nutria is down south and they just have to hunt those things like all over the place giant rat thing yeah well I was just over in Maui hunting access deer yeah they said the populations there just have exploded oh yeah they don't have predators in all the native species actually are being negatively affected by the invasive species now were you there how recently was this yesterday yesterday yeah oh you just got back yeah I got back what is it like in relationship to where we hunted in lanai it's very it's very similar different different terrain a little more mountainous terrain so probably kind of cooler yeah a lot of lava a lot a lot of rock and cliffs and some other stuff and goes to the ocean and there's there's kind of all different there's more of a dry side of the island it's more about lava type terrain and you've got bamboo forests on the other side once the deer get into that thick bamboo type forest they'll never eradicate them same Wow because just like the pigs and everything they just can't get him out of there yeah well the good news is they've instituted a hunters for the hungry type program in in Maui right yeah correct yeah so one of my one of my buddies that I hunt with over there Rob and he he started getting some of that rolling where they could go on the ranches shoot the deer off the excess deer and then give them to people that need food that's amazing which they should be able to sure why why not its it's the some of the best-tasting meat there is yeah and they're overrun with these animals yeah that's an argument for hunting yeah it's really difficult for animal rights people to argue against because you already have this invasive species that's over populating this island and either you're gonna bring in wolves which is another invasive species which isn't that similar to what they tried to do in Australia yeah Australia they started they try to bring in a bunch I wish I was here they brought foxes and cats but the foxes and cats well you've got these marsupials that are slow and lay eggs and don't run away the rats rats hide and they're fast platypuses don't ya and so Austin ground nesting birds all that stuff so they just hammer the native species and then the invasive rats it might still just take a toll on everything yeah what is the solution to a place like lanai other than hunting I mean you would have to give the deer birth control or bring in predators or poison or poisons that these fair talks in New Zealand Oh God you imagine just they use a poison called ten and they will the fair talks is mostly for opossums but they use a poison called 1080 and it's serial poison so they essentially coat cereal which would be like grains and rice and other things with this extremely deadly poison and then they just dump it out of helicopters into the forest it doesn't discriminate no whatever's local as well correct and you're putting I mean you're you're dumping poison it's crazy gonna get into the groundwater yeah yeah I mean it's that's so stupid what kind of what kind of solution is that and if you think hunting's bad yeah that poison is not an easy death no no it's awful takes a long time to and the thing is again like you said that the meat is delicious yeah if you just if they just had a program where they went to Lanai and just shot animals just for for hungry people in Oahu or Maui and they could have a lot of amazing meals for people oh yeah why not even just here what about sending that freezing it somehow sending it yeah other place in the world yeah we're doing that with other places New Zealand Australia we're never sitting at programs like that well people like that fella that was the wrote Contin hashtag animal rights and hashtag vegan this is this is where they run into a wall yeah like an ideological wall like what do you think should happen to wild pigs like what do you think should happen you think they should just go run rampant and destroy all the other wildlife there are not just an invasive species but a ruthlessly reproducing invasives but yeah and they can out-compete other things so by leaving one thing you're killing something else there's always there's always this weird trade-off where for some one thing to exist something else has to die yeah it's unfortunate but that's just how the world is if you don't like the way the world works it sucks it's kind of unfortunate but it's also kind of look yeah and I don't I don't want that elk to get killed by that wolf but I would have loved to see it happen yeah it's going to happen exactly I mean you got to see and mime in my opinion you got to see something really fucking amazing oh yeah what are the odds that you're there right when a wolf takes out an elk yeah not very not very likely yeah cam Haynes posted a few things we did that you a elk hunt turned out good yes great but cam posted a bunch of videos because a bunch of people were you know it's always getting a bunch of people complaining about hunting yeah but he posted a bunch of videos about bears and one of them was a bear eating a big grizzly eating this elk calf while it was alive while the mother was off just like just a you know 30 yards away freaking the fuck out and she's watching this big old grizzly just tear her elk and it's gone yeah making weird noises work get mauled and you know I don't want that to happen but it's gonna happen and it's it's not I'm not happy that it's happening but it's fascinating to watch like if I was there I would definitely watch that yeah I mean it's just she's like it's liya yeah but I think that is the real ideological argument and this is where like the vegan people fall short it's like I understand that you don't want to kill animals you don't have to I understand that you don't want factory farming I don't want it either I don't want any that stuff but this is a you're dealing with a different thing and it's it's a smaller thing like the amount of people that are hunting for food and managing wildlife and controlling populations is small it's a smaller thing than the amount of people that actually eat meat but to target that like you would literally targeting the one thing that's been thought out the most yeah yeah well yeah you've created we've created these systems that we're okay with yet if you really look at it they're just fucking weird yeah no farming of animal we've done that for a very long time but the way that we do it now is just some kind of difference twiggy's yes it's different you know you're putting things in your body that shouldn't be there when you can go out I can go and shoot a caribou that's never had it's only been eating native type grasses on the tundra and it's completely wild and healthy and my body even feels different when I eat this yeah sort of stuff yeah same with elk right yeah and I get their argument that not everybody could do that you're right I know everybody can but guess what no not everybody's gonna do a lot of things it's hard to do it's not it's not an easy thing to do it's not easy to get a bow and arrow and go into the mountains and find an elk and shoot it and then pack it out and do exactly most people are just they're not going to do that no and I think if you if you really well I think it was kind of cool this this the last week I took my fiance hunting it was her first time hunting really yeah I mean like where she was hunting oh you know so she's been with you before when you were hunting yeah like what are you doing he done yeah exactly but you know over the years she's seen me go okay she gets it she enjoys eating the meat she as always you know when we first started dating or ever said oh I could never kill anything and I understood that not everyone can but through the process of watching what I do the respect that I have for the animals going okay this isn't as bad as I had always thought it was nothing was bad but hmm and she gave it a try and just like okay and then when we you know she the first time she killed something she cried a little bit but immediately after she was like I'm actually really excited I'm really happy that I got this this deer and then last night we cooked it up for dinner when we got home she's like it does taste better I was like yeah this is your deer this is you provided this meal for us this is your animal now you're a part of it it's not you didn't go by that you killed it yourself you knew what that deer was and you just respect it a lot more now because you were a part of that process you had to struggle a little bit we almost didn't get one you went through the whole thing of well you know the whole process of it it's completely different it's just a different thing that when you're eating the food yeah when you buy a steak from a supermarket you have zero connection with that other than the fact you had to work to pay for it you know you go to a restaurant you have even less cuz you're not even cooking it you know you just sit down there yeah I'll have the t-bone medium-rare please and then it comes about Wow looks good chopped up chop chop chop Chomp Chomp Chomp Chomp Chomp you know but when you do it yourself you know when you you described it once I think in a great way like that when you pull out an elk steak from an Althea shot it's almost like it's sacred oh yeah like you're holding it like a baby you've just you've worked so you just appreciate everything you work hard for yeah it's also that you were there like you understand this when you're eating that meal that meal has a memory attached to it whereas effort attached to it it has a comprehension you understand the process you understand where the arrow went you understand the blood trail you under your you were there when you quartered it you the whole thing is like it's all coming back to you as you're eating there's no way you could reproduce that without actually doing it no and then there's there's that value when you look at we even just having a set of antlers around people might they don't hunt think oh that's just trophy it's glorifying it but after the meats gone you're still in remembrance of that animal oh yeah it's like a very deep process that you take with you for a long time yeah no doubt I have my first elk that I shot on my wall at my house the only one that my wife lets me put up with the first shot with a bow and I I walked by that thing all the time and I just I remember the whole experience I remember bugling coming up the hill I member hiding behind the tree I remember drawing back I remember waiting till I could see its vitals I remember the arrow hitting it and I remember going holy shit so yeah we're watching it stumble remember it going down all right it's like vivid like super vivid and and vivid in a way that not a lot of memories are because it's so primal cuz it's a life and death V and all I think I mean I'm not a neuroscientist obviously but there's some shit that's turning on in your head that's slightly from the caveman days when you shoot an elk with a bow and arrow and you see it go down you realized you like you're gonna eat this thing like through it's very it's very interesting it's almost like the way I there's certain experiences in life where once those experiences happen you go whoa I didn't even know that that was a part of my brain oh yeah being a father's that way in a more intense way like once you have kids and then you realize like how much you love your kids like wow this is this is a part of my brain that I didn't even know was there and that was like fully lit up and and overcoming all of my senses and thoughts you know there's some sort of strange deep connection that we have and I always tell people like a good way to but that you you sort of feel that in a mild way without too much craziness is fishing yeah when you catch a fish like oh oh Jesus there's weird sort of excitement to it but people don't have a problem with dead fish no yeah it's weird cuz fish don't have faces or something like you look like your dog yeah like something that you maybe just because nothing you don't cuddle fish or some right yeah it's in the water it's in a different different yeah it's you know in the water it's in a different world yeah there's something that we have about and then but then there's other animals like we're super racist when it comes to animals oh for sure like rats won't get a fuck about rats kill those things nasty yeah it's gusting because they have hair everywhere but their tails yeah slimy ass fucking reptile retail yeah but you know something cute like a chipmunk like oh yeah fella why that's funny cuz today on my Instagram page eight I look at those doing some spearfishing and stuff I caught an octopus and when you to kill an octopus you swim up and you bite their skull to kill him really yeah got a skull yeah it's right between their eyes it's where their I guess their brain is you bite them between the other because otherwise it moves around too much so it's hard to cuz an octopus they just latch onto everything why do you have to bite it you can't stab it there it'd be really hard to under all right move and it's got you know it can is you stick the knife and it would move around so everybody does it that way you always bite yeah for the most part whoa so you just right eysan you feel the skull and you bite down crush it nobody had has a problem with you biting an octopus in the head he's not yet fucking smart okay so this guy's got one yeah that dudes a Kiwis whoa the guy's an animal Jesus Christ imagine if you're that poor octopus this fucking savage with that beard that's what a Brian is right and the thing is yeah nobody gives a shit about that but the thing is octopus are smart as fuck yeah they're weird weird smart yeah we've talked about that before yeah just the way that they hide the way that they do stuff well your show that you you're not doing any more right now they apex predator was a great show and one of the things that we're people don't know what it was you traveled all over the place and tried to learn from the way different animals would hunt things but you know I remember when you came in here and you were talking about octopus I didn't oh by the way you can say octopuses and you could say octopi yeah whatever you want yeah but I had no idea like when you came in here like dude they're not even from this planet they're like aliens yeah they're weird but they they are smart but in the ocean they're definitely at the bottom of the food chain are they really but they co sharks well big ones these little ones everything eats them really if you're an octopus you're you're a savory dish for every fish is quite delicious yeah when you're fishing that kind of octopus for bait works better than anything really yeah these fish that's actually how I saw the one that I got I swam down to go shoot a fishing just pecking at it cuz I get into the reef and they'll just keep going for it till it gets out of there spearfishing is supposed to be really fun it's like hunting underwater it's yeah it's really fun I you to enjoy it I think you dig the hole you got to go that one of the best things I've ever done in my life was that free diving essentially like a free diving class mm-hmm but that's one of the coolest things when I guarantee you'd be able to hold your breath for four minutes or so and after you do that you think like shit I can do anything it's weird it's a weird feeling that was one of the coolest things that I did and I did it on that apex predator show that's what I did it for but then since then I've been doing quite a bit of as much as I can try to go diving and spearfishing and the first time you held your breath you couldn't hold it that long and then they told you how to do it just a minute you minute minute and a half something so what was the difference it's all mental really yeah so what do they tell you to concentrate on just the fact that you aren't gonna die mmm key and relaxing when your heart rate starts to see it's more about just controlling things controlling your heart rate and other stuff I'm no expert but I'm there's people there really have been spear fishing and diving as much as I go hunting but I try to learn as much as I can when I'm out with people that know what they're doing and it's just a cool experience of being underwater and you get that little bit of a panic and you start to use your oxygen and then you just try to relax relax relax and you just can stay longer whoa and sort of this guy is he giving you like techniques technically text to breathe slow your heart rate and then just knowing the fact of how to hold your breath don't let it out and the fact that what your body goes through the stages that your body goes through when you are out of oxygen it's when you get to that end period you actually almost feel like you don't need to breathe it's really good yeah and that's when you gotta breathe that's when you gotta breathe because when when I was done doing the four-minute breath all that came out and the first he says breathe like Exetel you like exhale and breathe because I don't like oh yeah and then I'm like oh yeah I need to breathe ah that's weird so is it sort of like hypothermia like as you get really really cold you start heating up Oh like you feel the obvious like when people are dying of hypothermia one of the things and they find them they take all their clothes off yeah yeah very it could be something similar to that Wow I don't know yeah so um when you hold your breath and you take art why is it better to hold your breath and to have no breath in and just not breathe because your body needs the oxygen so they are using from a big breath like yeah that's better just hold that yep because I was wondering like how what is the record for exhaling is all your air oh and then holding a breath before you take another deep breath wait exhaling all your all your air like taking a big deep breath exhaling everything and then holding it while you have no air in your lungs like how long can you go not for long really no you're saying you breathe in and breathe all the air out and just stop yep oh a few seconds really yeah you wouldn't well I mean not for you not a few seconds feel like maybe a minute it with no it no no no were you blackout yeah I don't know yeah yeah breathe everything out and then do ten jumping jacks oh yeah you fucked you know what I mean then there's no way yeah he'd burn it out totally yeah probably passed it I'd probably be the fastest way to pass that Egon anyways guy who fought in the UFC and he was a free dive champion and I believe I want to say he went longer than seven minutes yeah in the ocean underwater I'm holding his breath yeah some people are incredible I mean they can go five seven that some of that she's building up your endurance yeah but a lot of it is building up your endurance and just really slowing your heart rate and not using up the oxygen that you know and not freaking out is is you freaked out you get scared your heart rate goes up and use more oxygen it's one of those things if you're running out of gas and you want to speed up to the gas station and there's a burn more gas instead a slow down drop it down to 34 - Cruz yeah you're gonna get a 70 if you can dude you've lived a really fascinating life when it comes to like your experiences in the wild like how old you 35 33 33 c most 33 year old guys have not been to as many places experience as many wild things as you have I mean you've you've really had a very very unusual life that's oh definitely especially with wildlife experience yeah well I mean if I look at it I've spent the majority of my life out in the wild that's kind of crazy yeah that is crazy real normal yeah I'm not honestly not that normal but right right of a player dancing or you were in the that one it was probably was Oh in middle school was into it you were a dancer right didn't you like do like dance competitions and no I think that's one of those rumors you know those you know when you get really drunk and you pull out that party trick that you know and you're 15 years old yeah it looks shitty but nobody else liked it that's one of those it's one of those like a dance champions like that is not anywhere close I was in some summer like I was in me and my brother went to Iceland in the summer when I was in high school and the person that we stayed with was like a breakdancer and just taught us how to breakdance let me just do it for fun some of those things you whip out it like a wedding okay so you never went anywhere hilarious that's one of those things he just broke everyone was but one Christmas party was zpz everyone was just hammered and I thought oh yeah someone was like trying to do like the white breakdance thing but my version is extremely white and bad I could do like a few no head spins but maybe some windmills and some cool stuff you know that might have been like and then it just goes from there that's pretty happy yeah because the rumor had spread like wild yeah it's grey Warren was a breakdancing champion I'm like we have time all these things 33 years old yeah all the places you've been cuz you that's the first time I saw you was on that show solo hunter I think ya know I think the first time I saw you was on Steve show and then I saw you on soul Hunter as well yeah cuz I was actually supposed to go on that first hunt with you guys but I had to guide that week when telling Hannah no I wish I would have made it you have to you have to go into the woods with Bryan Callen yeah you will it's it's a problem you will not stop laughing really cuz yeah he's he's way funnier than me like with a captive audience like he's like it's almost like he's wasted on stage like we're on yeah yeah yeah where he's at his best is a bunch of friends just hanging around small group you small and he would just he would just be he's so fun he's like it's almost like there's no art form for what he does hmm it's like he can take it to a stage in front of a bunch of strangers and 300 people and whatever on a cried it'll be really funny don't get me wrong he stand-ups really really funny it's one of the best stand-ups in the country but it's not as funny as when you're alone with him in the woods he did this thing about he had a character that he created called the ravine comer where he would jerk off in ravines it's so stupid but when you're there and you're in Montana and his fucking 9 degrees out and you've been you know sleeping on the ground for five days and hiking around miles every day and you kind of have half out of it and laughing and you're you were in the middle of quartering a deer and he just starts guys guys let me say what I do this way John he just starts like pretending pulls his pants halfway down like it's jacket off into the into a canyon it's it's I'm not doing it any justice feel like that so juvenile it's definitely juvie is but if that's you would cry that's when your hunt you have to have that that sense of humor to keep you going and there's guys like that just when you're out there certain things that are just extra funny I don't know what is because you're just what's him he's like at his best when you're in a captive audience like I'm just that's not me I don't have that sense of humor I have a different kind of sense of humor but he's the guy with this like five of us like guys got a piece on you don't you like Hill just making you uncomfortable the next thing you know who you know yeah hey just it's so silly so that trip and that's when I knew to like on the first hunting trip and I knew he was like out of all my friends he's one of the ones that I knew would be able to tough it out yeah all the other guys are urban guys stand-up comedians like what are the odds that I can get one of those guys to go to Montana for seven days camp yeah then I go they're like fucking Brogan my just bring me out here the Callen was a trooper Oh next time we do it you should go because we're even hired we're trying to put together something now we might do it in Mexico oh yeah I'm actually going there next week are you I think he's there now yeah yes yeah yeah they're there with with Ben O'Brien yep and in the honest and coues deer right yeah you say coos our cows keys some people say cows it's it's one of those things it was originally pronounced one way like the state of Nevada is not Nevada what is it it's Nevada everyone who lives there calls it Nevada Nevada Nevada Nevada yes Las Vegas Nevada hmm I don't know what I say yeah I have to be alone without you influence information so remember when you when you think about next time gonna call it Nevada you're gonna be like a yeah big okay add kamek but there's just certain things that when you're there it's set a certain way well when we went and borrowed your truck when we went bow hunting outside of Reno yeah that's when I got to see the Nevada that you guys know oh yeah everybody thinks Nestle yeah everything's in Nevada as Vegas now Vegas in Barstow know this like mule deer and elk and now mountains yeah and there's more independent mountain ranges in Nevada than anywhere else and more big land outside of Alaska there's more public land percentage-wise Wow that's easy it's almost all public that's the that's one of the reasons why I'm so gung-ho for public lands yeah I grew up in a place where you never saw a no trespassing sign you weren't told you couldn't go anywhere that's amazing it's like the anti Texas it's the it is the anti Texas yeah nothing wrong with Texas but it's all it's all yeah I'm weird it's probably some public land we're guys hunting Texas right was public but they sold it all off did they sell it all no the state's got the land and they sold it off to people the state hardly has any land that's the worry for places like Utah and where they're shrinking their monuments and they're starting to sell off rights for drilling and mining and you know people are really concerned about this administration and their what they're doing with the Environmental Protection's because today Trump signed some new thing allowing for offshore drilling like pretty much fucking everywhere he just went see if he can find that but it's just it's it's rolling back all of the environmental protections from the Obama administration and his ideas like economics Trump's Trump's wrong word yeah it Trump's environmental and then what we really need is to just maximize our ability to earn money yeah Trump moves to open nearly all offshore waters to drilling nearly all offshore waters to drilling that sounds so fucking crazy if you see the BP oil spill like how many of those can we endure yeah it's it's there's a lot of scary stuff when it comes to the environment because we only get one there's only one earth yeah we're so interested in Mars think I'm just figure out how we got well I just he's all about business it's really weird to see a super pro-business guy that's in the White House it's quite strange the whole thing is quite it's it seems surreal like every couple of days I look at the paper and it says President Trump and I'll go oh yeah that guy's the president yeah that's right for what I do and I just get to unplug for very long periods of time just but that's not even the right way to go about it sometimes because then there's things that affect me and what I love and of course and then I get hit blindsided by it because they don't yeah I'm gone and out in the woods enjoying what I like and then I come home and everything's gone do you have a hard time relating to a lot of people your age that don't experience the things you experience because your life is so vastly different than the average 33 year old guy no I mean I think people I think people spects if you if you're really passionate about something whether if you were passionate about something that is even non-hunting at least I'm like well I give you respect you're passionate about it you're doing your thing and I think a lot of people get that with me whether they hunt or don't hunt and relate to anybody because everybody's kind of passionate about something because like sort of the people that have no passion and you're like okay yeah there's Portman later then but I feel like they were raised wrong yeah somebody didn't come along introduce him to something exactly something I mean everybody's got their thing yeah you know if you if your thing is whatever video gaming or whatever that's not my thing but if you're cool if you like it and you're passionate about and I can tell them and we can have a conversation about it because I think that's cool and people who are passionate about something oh yeah I mean it's very infectious yeah I watch people make furniture I don't want to make furniture yeah I watch people that are really into furniture like fuck that looks awesome because something exciting that's what my my like Instagram feed is like woodworking stuff I'm like I'm sorry yeah I don't know it's just like the people that are really passionate about where he is cool to see them build stuff yeah I look into that I like knife makers yeah a lot of watching guys George bleh yeah let's throw them down it's just there's something about tactile just actual physical things you're making and changing it I I'm fascinated by that stuff yeah yeah so it doesn't mean if you if you do it or whatever I think everybody can relate on some level to to things that they're into or their passions I'm sure but what you've done is pretty unique like I said that about that show solo hunter I remember thinking watching that like wow this is this guy goes out there yeah you're out there by yourself you don't really have a lot to save you know that that's my thing is I've I don't know what me and Steve are actually talking about this on that afognak hunters before the bear attack but it's just real shitty weather hard hiking and I'm just loving it you think you'll ever get sick of this you just want to go on on a ranch somewhere and drive around and not kill yourself but it's it's a different that's my thing mm-hmm I if I have two options option a is just this go hunting in a place that there's very few animals and you probably won't have any success and it's just really shitty weather and it's tough and big mountains or there's this one where I'm guaranteed that I'll get some big animal and I'll have a lot of encounters and I can just drive around I'm gonna choose the really hard one and that's just it's just how I am I like that I like the it's like a masochistic thing of I like to struggle I like to hurt for it like if I'm gonna kill an animal I want to have had some kind of struggle where I feel like I've earned some respect like I don't know it's like my payment I had to work for it it's my payment to the animals life it's a weird so it's just my thing don't you feel like also it's because you've had so much success it's not like you're hurting for me right this is like a desperado meat hunt yeah and I think that that's part of it because sometimes I might go if something's too easy if I go somewhere and I think man this sounds too easy then I'll look for an animal that might be bigger or harder to find or a certain one just to give myself some kind of challenge and that was part of the thing of filming myself while hunting and going out there is that added challenge of being alone the added challenge of filming myself all those challenges just to you know create that experience of the struggle of it I guess it's like I crave that struggle a lot as well it's a weird so weird thing it's weird but it's a lot of people do that yeah different stuff it's like exercise it's like I I firmly believe that a person who doesn't struggle with anything is going to be a miserable person because I don't think you're really gonna truly appreciate relaxation I don't appreciate relaxation unless I work hard if I work like if I come home from the gym I worked out hard I worked all day I worked out hard come home from the gym I'm fucking exhausted and I can put my feet up on the couch and I can enjoy a TV show I can't really enjoy it it's one of the only times I can because if I wake up in the morning and I eat breakfast and I turn on the TV and my quite a fuck you watching TV shut this shit off right well get something done yeah if I've already done I think this is the reason why people like working out hard is because your body desires struggle and I think that's the way human beings evolved I think we we evolved to have a certain amount of our reward system geared towards us a call pushing difficult things because that's how people survived yeah I think there's a lot to that it's a it's a an accomplishment feeling that you get it's kind of like releases those endorphins you okay I feel good about and you really the real hard times really make you appreciate the easy times it's just all easy can you just get stagnant like a rich kid not be happy yeah born like Silver Spoons yeah yeah you go you don't yeah you can't just keep buying I can't yeah you need you need some sort of struggle like I just I don't know if that's been mapped out if people understand like you need X amount of struggle to have this amount of happy it's like I really in most people just think oh you know just get a job and do your thing and you'll be happy and if you're not you take paxil yeah yeah I think a lot of people's goal plans don't and they try to find the way around that struggle part and I kind of seek out that struggle part your experiences have taught you that that struggle is where the happiness comes from and most people are they think that the happiness is avoiding the struggle it's a real cat it's a trade you know it's it's like that feeling that your body gives you like when you don't want to go to the gym like oh come on man don't go but if you push through that then afterwards like yeah yes I've no I don't feel and then also you see the results in your body whereas if you just give in to that I'm lazy thing all the time then you just have this dumpy doughy body then you feel like shit when you're naked lot of problems yeah your your experience you still doing yoga uh-huh not not like I should because my back's all jacked up now I think probably from not doing it yeah I need to get back into doing it for a while I was yeah and I actually I actually never felt better just the well I mean since I was probably 18 years old for most my most of my year wasn't was guiding hunters and that involved packing out animals so if you think about it I don't probably should I'm one day I'll sit down and try to figure out how many and we'll have carried out like heavy packs 800 pound packs probably and I don't even I wouldn't even want to guess it's a lot more than probably most people yeah ridiculously strong back from that but it's a weird yeah it's really yeah it's just very and now it's only been you know 1718 years of really doing it pretty all the time you just start feeling like all the back edge here and no and I think when I was doing the yoga more I didn't get those pains it's a little bit more flexible yeah the decompression that's a big part of what yoga is is yoga makes you move your body in a way that's almost the opposite of carrying weight I think yeah it's exactly it I mean you just got so much weighted down so much compression a lot of jiu-jitsu people have turned to yoga now to realize that they like there's a lot of guys that for the longest time me included what we did was like working out with weights maybe kettlebells like heavy heavy explosive stuff box jumps things along those lines and then Jiu Jitsu so the idea was that they're working out with weights would prepare you for the jujitsu but then everybody gets injured but a lot of guys have turned now towards yoga and Jiu Jitsu because there's something about the the rugged Smashing and crushing and pulling and yanking of jujitsu that it's complemented by the stretching and elongating and holding static positions and a completely non explosive actions of yoga I think there's I was actually talking one of my good buddies David wise he's actually a Olympic gold medalist for halfpipe free skiing I mean he's just like the top of his game for what does happen yes what does that mean so he does the halfpipe like it's a be like half a water bottle cut you know pipe um does the tricks in it oh good skis kind of like what Shaun White does on us know where he did oh excuse but we were talking about exercise that controls as little muscles for balance because he's big into hunting too I was like and he's when you're moving through the mountains you've got that heavy pack on sometimes when you see an animal it means the difference between you getting it not is the speed that you get there hmm so you just have to have that that ability that agility so when you set your foot on something know that that word that's where it's gonna stay right you don't get off balance there's a lot of stuff I hunts mountain type stuff cliffs and especially in Alaska New Zealand other stuff this dangerous country people die in that I mean Cam's friend died in an area that I was hunting that same year for $4 yeah you know and that's just like yeah and that's a guy that does it all the time like you need yeah it's very important to have that's that balance since those muscles that you can't lift for it's the weird being able to stand on one leg and move around in every direction because especially when you got weight on your back you're packing something out that kind of weird agility strength training and those guys that do those kind of sports like skiing and snowboarding and all that they're like cats over Shane Dorian yeah that guy when he walks in the mountains it's it's different like his balance he's so centered it makes him quiet and it's just like it's cool right it's all from all the surfing yeah if you do kettle bell windmills that's a great one for that as well yeah I've done that a couple of times something about holding that overhead and then bending all your body down touching the floor and extending back up it it puts strength into the core or a weird way especially if you can do it with heavy weights yeah like you can you have you know what Turkey Turkish getup that's that's what I've been doing Turkish kale of those men there so there's so non-glamorous everybody else do curls and stuff get jacked but for functional strength is very few things that are as good as a Turkish getup there's something about pressing that way you know on your back getting up to your knees anchoring your body up standing all the way up and then lowering yourself all the way back down again it's just phenomenal for all these weird muscles oh yeah your back and your neck and shoulder stability and all these people ignore yeah yeah that's it in the offseason I'll try to do see I'm out there a lot with the pack on all day long so it's for me I'd have to find something that's not that right to get more benefit and I think that that's why the yoga thing cuz you know if I go for to work out and put a heavy pack on and go for for work I do that for 12 hours a day it's like the one hour I go do it when I'm not working isn't gonna do much for me your back must be like really fucking strong for you think about 1718 years of doing that yeah I mean your back must be ridiculous yeah it's and you know you're not carrying the heavy pack every day but there's been a substantial number of even if you're doing it once a week yeah it's strong you doing it every day I'd probably break you down yeah but doing it once a week that gives your body a chance to break down and then slowly recover most I'm that guy that's like 55 years old and can't walk Yesi have you seen that outdoorsman's they think yeah that thing's amazing yeah that's cool I love hiking with that thing on right keeps the keeps the weight real centered I haven't actually used that just because the time it takes to take my bag off I've only got one of them self right right never actually use that but it doesn't make sense it looks pretty cool no it's very cool it's it's a lot of athletes are using that now - it's a they like it better than weight vests and yeah just sits on your body better you know that's cool yeah it's for a person who lives like say if you live in the Midwest like say if you live in Kansas where it's all flat and you want to prepare for an elk hunt what do you do well yeah what the fuck would you do I guess box steps would like a weighted pack over and over and over again you know I get asked that question a lot and I've kind of when I start when I was say late teens or whatever trying to I'd see elk and just trying to be able to get that endurance where I never had to stop and what I would do is I would go out and I would do something that was prolonged to where the point that I had to stop I wouldn't stop but I would switch the way that I did did it so say I pick a mountain or he stairs or whatever and you can run and then the point that you'd have to I'd have to stop I'd turn around and start walking backwards and then I would turn to start sidestepping and I would refuse to stop so I'd pick a point that I knew I couldn't or almost couldn't get to if I walked up a mountain one day and thought I have to stop now at that point where had to stop I would just switch the type of muscle and movement that Oh do so I thought okay like if you're some kind of workout mmm whatever that workout is but like some kind of say stairs or whatever if you're running stairs and you go until your body's like absolutely I cannot go anymore but keep moving in just a different muscle group like I do then hit the bag and if I'm if I'm doing like kickboxing on a heavy bag and I'm exhausted like say if I'm throwing punches and roundhouse kicks and I get so exhausted I'm almost done and I know there's still a minute left to the brown then I'll switch to front kicks and weirdly enough I have energy to do that yeah so I almost can't kick the way I've been kicking but I can kick otherwise yeah it's a weird way that I started just building endurance to the point where then I never had to stop but if you're a guy lives in a flat area you get that's that's exactly it I don't know you'd have to get like I've seen guys on those stair machines where it's a rotating stairs and they have a backpack on a heavy back I think that would be the way to do it and then not and then try to go for like five or six hours fuck nobody's gonna do that no that's the thing you you no one's ever prepared that's the thing is I mean I hate to say it but how do you prepare it well you just have to do it you can't you can't actually go into a go into a gym and think that you're gonna be able to carry a heavy pack for days at a time no there's no like for what I do at a hiking speed carrying a pack I'm really good at that but this year we went in we wanted to go in to this spot there's a little bit further and I got on a bike I got smoked - 65 years old he rides a bike all the time I don't right I don't even know if I I knew how to ride a bike when I got on it but it kicked my ass so it's just different it's like you know all the hiking every day with the pack I thought oh no this will be no problem and I get on that bike and get my ass kicked it's like you cannot yeah you have to do to do in a certain level but there's certain things like you could probably do you could I could pedal you know in a little bit then I'd be like on a stationary bike every day and then you more muscle memory for that type of action so if you did the stair thing I think that's probably the closest you could get to get that muscle memory yeah I think would be a stair thing yeah or finding actual stairs actual stairs running up the stairs yeah there's a good place out here in Calabasas that has several it's up the side of this hill like many many many stairs it's probably a quarter mile all the way to the top and I'll run it up and go down and run it up that's awesome that's what people in the Midwest where it's flat she'd open up gyms like rent stairwells you just have packs at the bottom people get a membership I can just go up the stairs as many times as they want up and down the stairs it's amazing how just carrying your body up hills is so difficult I think it doesn't - a person who never does it like oh we're hiking that's like walking but you're walking outside no yeah it's way harder it just doesn't seem like it should be you know every every ounce of weight on your body or you even your shoes people buy these real heavy mountaineering boots like those are the and then they never wear I'm in a mountain and then they try to go up the mountain it's like whoa what did they say every pound on your foots like eight pounds on your back yeah you get a parrot yeah five pound boots and it's a lot of weight but you do need some sort of stability right I mean the reason why those boots exists like if you were going to go to the Alps you need that stencil yeah and you have to actually walk different and I'm a lot of people don't realize that yeah more of a rocking step than a almost like ski boots yeah it's like walking ski boots and you got to walk on your a lot of people don't walk on their toes right that's a big problem well it's modern shoes people have started going heel to toe heel to toe humans are supposed to go ball the foot down to the heel ball the foot that's how we're supposed to run so we're supposed to walk but modern shoes it particularly ones with heels they just accentuate that heel to toe thing which is like real weird yeah it's not well if you've hunted like people - when I was a kid I learned to walk with my the pads my fingers just quiet right I'll stop around do you do you stalk animals with socks on do you still do the a socks or barefoot mostly yeah just depends you ever tried those like five finger shoes those jaggies is before yeah I got pretty tough feet so it's nothing to just take my socks off shoes and just walking my socks and real quiet what if it you're in like a rocky area I'll still do it really yeah you like where you were hunting in Nevada I mean that's I do I do that barefoot all do you really with socks yeah I'll go a couple miles and that stuff really yeah you just use you get used to it you never it's kind of a weird because I always thought oh your feet get tough your feet really don't get any tougher you just get used to the sensation of your feet hurting exactly well they do get tough if you go as far as that you ever see that duel survivor guy was guy's name Corey something or another he had the most disgusting feet ever just these offices walked everywhere barefoot yeah he would go to the forest they would do these Survivor shows it was like there was a series of shows after Survivor man came out that we're ripping off survivor man in a way and this is one of the weird ones called dual survivor those hammers everybody something it was like so staged like what do you think we should do well I don't know we need to make a bow and arrow and then be wandering through the forest and you see this guy's fucking disgusting feet oh yeah I mean that's barely a human foot yeah now that in that case I mean you're I guess I take that back your feet do get tough build calluses if you can get a rock right in that arch area yeah I still hurt but the bottom of the his volume we're just there there dark like a soul and like literally looks like he's got something on his feet because I really I take pride in my foot calluses they just if I ever lost them I feel like I'd start getting blisters and yeah those are that's next level well I've seen some people that go to the woods and they go hiking and they do they're not prepared for it and they give these horrible like areas of their foot where their skin gets rubbed off rubbed raw especially in the back like the heel area when I first started guiding this guy was from Pennsylvania and he just he just kept pushing himself was just cool he kept hiking and I always tell him you know if something you know you're gonna keep up you just because you're not used to it so just stop and I'll stop this that and the other thing and it's like if anything is wrong you know he started to get a blister but didn't say anything this foot started getting rubbed down why would he just had him duct-tape it up getting gangrene whoa yeah just from his foot getting rubbed inside of his shoe and then just keep pushing himself pushing himself for how many days it take to get gangrene not that long I think it was for five days whoa fifth day he had gangrene so what happens got a given to the hospital yeah yeah you get blood poisoning of some kind I think it's a weird Wow I didn't get gangrene from hiking yeah I think you know you just didn't usually go just toughen it out I'm just gonna tough it out and didn't do anything for it I don't and I probably didn't air cuz it hurt take the sock on it so he's probably right I don't really know what his situation was but it wasn't good putting the so he probably had it in a boot sweating all day rubbing on it getting sweat and bacteria who knows Justin gotten infected it was nasty I mean you you could smell it it was rotting flesh it's disgusting where do the wise folks put some duct tape on that just some duct tape on him you you take a lot of guys out that have never hunted before yeah how often you do that every year Oh a couple times a year I would say what is the did you enjoy that is that yeah I had experience no it's fun for me it's mostly guys that they may have tried and may have been successful or it might be their first real type big game type hunt or whatever I like it because I get to be a part of the experience and kind of help shape that first experience because you could go out with some I mean I kind of say some hunt there are hunters out there that fit the stereotype mm-hmm and it's a shame yeah I think somebody that's getting into hunting if they go with somebody that fits that stereotype then they're probably gonna have a bad experience and that's not what hunting is to me so I think that by me being able to kind of help form that first experience and make it about the experience because for me when I go out hunting it's not just about killing something it's about the entire experience around it's the that's what hunting is you go out into the woods you there's just certain things that I do that other people might not do but there are a lot of people that do it say I mean I pay attention to the plants that are there I pay attention to really everything you know the things that I noticed someone else might notice so I point those out to them and and just like give them an overall good experience of why we're out there and what we're doing and that's fun well I think a lot of people have an idea what a hunter is from television or from the movies or from duck dynasty or something like that and a lot of that is maybe even treestand hunters who are maybe overweight not fit and they don't understand that Western big-game style hunting like you do is really an athletic endeavor as well as a skill as well as like really comprehensive knowledge based approach to problem solving like you have to know what you're doing there's a so many factors so much that goes into it I mean you're backpacking you're you've got you also have to have a certain amount of bush skills yeah and I call it like there's a lot of people that do it but they don't have those those little nuanced skills that you pick up over over time there's a lot of things that I do that maybe people that have hunted their whole life's won't even notice just the more you do things the more the better you get at it the more you notice the more you've had times the more times you fucked up and then figure it out why that got messed up and then you try to remedy it in the future don't do it this way and you just start paying attention to really small things that other people might not pay attention to just like the way that I so it's really weird I've noticed even went from when I first started hunting till now the way that I do things is just completely different this it's almost like I have a method and a system but it's all based on the millions of times that things haven't gone right and trying to to progress and to be a better hunter right like you see this situation like okay I've fucked this up before exactly I've know I know what's going on here why is the wind at the back of my neck I gotta get out of here now I got it back down go around go around don't just try to push it when you pick areas that's what people that I hunt with I'll go into a new area and I'll be fairly successful for not going into that area but I've done it enough times to where okay I do things a certain way and it is constantly changing too as the environment changes but if I'm going into an area instead of going down that hill I go around the other way and look at the hill facing me or things that I don't know it's really hard to explain when I'm out there I can explain it a lot better yeah I can explain okay this is what I'm doing this is why I'm doing it and then there's other stuff that you do the easiest it's just more of an instinct than anything and I think a lot of people have those hunter instincts that was a whole point of that apex predator show was talk about just the instincts that humans have that we may not even tap into when you say as a father I think you just you have that instinct to protect your children at all costs I'm not a father I don't have that that instinct but I'm sure it's in there it's in somewhere yeah it's like that nobody has to teach you that you know we just kind of all of a sudden go you know that's a switch which is going something goes off it I I think that most people would they're caring their child in some kind of danger that he would do some kind of natural instinctive movement to get that child away for sure I mean that's literally why human being survived as long as we did yeah and hunting is one of those primal things that you just tap into and there's some things that are just instinctual and there's not a lot of there's not a lot of lessons that people can talk about as far as like what instincts are yeah it's something that you just have to do it's that's why it's an instinct it's not you can't put it into a category you can't go to a class you can you can't read a book on instincts you can know what they are but that whole instinctual it just has to happen yeah charges yeah something else takes over that's not it's not II Steve even said he's like it wasn't even a primal level it was not fight or flight it was just this this weird you just did what you had to do in that very second there was no thought yeah yeah it's you're you're almost like your DNA yeah your DNA is like up we've seen this before this happened to fattiest maximus he says 1500 years ago your great-grandfather was eaten by a bear yeah those genes passed on what's that time - if you've got you eat when you're hunting and you go like an animal whatever and you just have that feeling Irish it's here and then it works out and you go alright I got to go over this Ridge and it's just some kind of instinct that says to survive you need to do this it's hard to tap into it you're out there now if you start to pay attention to the things that that work and things that don't well a guy like you that has so much experience in the woods I would imagine that you're kind of like it's like your data chunking it's like you've seen so many like you like oh I know what this is yeah that's why I kind of like think of instincts is like a bunch of ones and zeros in the computer so you don't really think about all the ones and 0 pattern that are in your head you just enter a situation and then something you know your instinct is that data processing of okay slow down mm-hmm you might be there you know something yeah there's there's definitely parts of us that we I don't think we're ever gonna really experience it unless you're doing something physically you know you don't even probably know you have the the instinct to get the fuck away from a bear as it's charging or to Jukka bear until it actually happens like County here but the fact that your brain was capable of coming up with that move in that moment was 11 and a half foot monster fucking bear was coming down on you when I think the Yanis man hitting that thing in the face with the trekking that's crazy and he probably also I don't know you'd have to ask him but I it probably didn't even process what he was doing and those faces his table right just huge just and that that's what turned the bear I had no clue that he did that cuz I quit when Garrett was on the back he's like I was on his back it was like yeah I jerked it in the bear ran away yeah this is like no dude I hit it in the face with the trekking pole that's like oh yeah unbelievable is that that's the most intense experience you've ever had in the woods ah intense in that in a different way it I've had a lot of just moments area is there just intense in different ways but yeah that one was that one was pretty intense in the way that I thought oh this bears gonna fucking kill me a big part of what hunting is too is being able to stay calm in that moment yeah and because you're you're looking for an animal you're hiking you're exhausted day in day out you're out there for a long time and then all of a sudden it comes down to one moment and that one moment literally might be five seconds holy shit he's come out from behind a tree draw and it's right there and you have to just be able to be there yeah you can't be thinking about something else cuz you just fuck it and you can't be freaking out you can't go you're gonna go oh my god I can't believe this is happening you can't think that either anybody does happen I mean you can freak out you're even I've done it a thousand times you get that like rush of I guess it's that rush of adrenaline yeah do you have something that that you say in your head like when you draw back your bow or anything like that idea of like a series of things like a checklist that you go off a few things I just I guess with my bow the one thing I think it because I have a trigger release so I just try to feel the trigger in my finger in the corner of my finger so then I know that I'm not gonna like slap it or punch hitter so if I'm thinking about that but mostly I'm focusing on where I'm yeah I guess I my checklist it'd be like draw a back pick a spot feel the trigger let it go did you ever have any classic archery training you know no no I probably would should you at this point in time well yes I was talking to devil yeah he's like he's like you could pick up a rubber band and a pencil and kill something with it like you just have the instinct to do it but I've noticed when I started hunting with a bow I just kind of tried to pick it up myself and I did everything wrong but I would go to these 3d shoots and win them not like like real tournaments but just like local things right you know though I'm the best shot around that's great and then guys would be like hey you're shooting wrong you're doing and I just would slap the trigger and I never thought about holding still I would always just shoot with movement because I started shooting a like a longbow and I would watch was at the time tienen outdoors and this guy named Byron Ferguson have you ever seen this dude would throw up an aspirin and shoot it out of the air oh one of those over and over yeah and his whole thing was be the arrow that was my only archery advice be the arrow that's all I knew so you just be the arrow it made no sense but I'd be out there I had a ball on a string in the backyard and I would like a softball and swing the softball back and forth and just tell myself beat the arrow be the arrow shoot made no sense and then when I got a compound go I just be the arrow so I just move and when it felt right I've let her who let her rip but you've obviously made adjustments because you don't move yeah I done the shot right now so in the process of switching the way that I shoot had developed a few bad habits which now I think if I would have just stuck with it it had been fine but now that I've tried to switch then I kind of tried it all those bad habits that I had originally try to creep back in and it doesn't really in the end I do really well so it doesn't really matter but I like the idea of trying new things and there's always room for improvement you should talk to Dudley yeah you should go over some coaching with him yeah what's interesting to me is that I've seen a bunch of guys who are like very accomplished hunters and very accomplished archers and they they get real weird around him really because they know he's a master yeah he's a master of form and technique and he does it absolutely the right way and people do not like to get in like shootouts with him yeah when you have like little competitions he's too fucking accurate yeah he's ridiculous he's shot we did a video for on it where he shot a kettlebell handle at a hundred and twenty yards he shot in in the hand in hand yeah at night and the sparks because he did it at night like he set a lighted nock in there and aim for the lighted nock and and shot it through and you can see the sparks is the broad head hits the bottom of the handle yeah the the top phase of the kettlebell he's ridiculous shot but everything he does is textbook and writes like a technical he's yeah he and he does that when he's hunting too I mean he does that with everything so it's real weird like guys almost have this thing in their head like I don't want to fuck with it it's already already very successful doing this way I don't want to change anything yeah like I'm not listening you ba-ba-ba-ba like some guys will try to revamp their whole system but a lot of really successful guys won't and they get real weird around him it's very interesting to watch I guess see that old if it's not broken don't fix it but I'm not that type I don't really if somebody's really good at something I want to learn from them yeah like you know if he came to me and was like hey I want to know my thing isn't technical archery my thing is being out outdoor skills survival skills hunting being in the woods yeah you know if he's like hey man I want to know some more stuff about stalking mountain goats and wherever be like okay cool I can tell you what I know and I didn't ask him the same thing like tell me about some archery stuff because there's always where areas where I can improve yeah and I'm not so stuck in my ways that I need to do it the way I've been doing it I'm not there's definitely better ways to do things but you can definitely get by the way you're doing it really well here's John yeah okay so he put a light on it that's what he did yeah but you want to talk about a guy who loves archery yeah he loves coaching it he loves doing it like that's it's a perfect thing for him he loves it and he loves teaching people how to do it too but if you watch his form it's just absolutely perfect yeah that's cool yeah and that's what I mean I love bow hunting that's my passion and I'll still go rifle hunting depending on the hunt how often the rifle on every year that's a good question you know I might do one or two once a year I always the one hunt generally because I guide during the elk season in Montana so my thing is elk meat is my number one thing that I want in the freezer so I generally save a few days at the end of season you go out try to kill an elk with a rifle it's mostly just because I'm from dummy yeah easier you know and I don't and there's nothing wrong with rifling there and they're the thing about that I if I take a rifle it's also that challenge thing so I might go into an area where the odds of me getting something are with a rifle even would be a hundred or say multiple times less than the odds of me going into an area with a bone getting something right because low density load in sea mammals or even well with elk I think it's actually easier to get an elk maybe people be like nah that's bullshit but it's easier to get an elk with a bow than a rifle turn the RUS yeah during the rut because most archery seasons are during the rut that's the easiest time to it would be like a no-brainer with a rifle and during brother right cuz animals are all distracted and when you're trying to hump and it mostly across the West the elk season with a rifle a general elk season is it the absolute worst time to finding out just seeing an elk right is the struggle you might go five days and not see an elk in some areas it's probably really cold really cold archery equipment might not even work in some of those temperatures sometimes you draw like well icicles and your yeah rosin it gets wet and then it's frozen and he tried to shoot and how did you start going to Montana my grandpa actually lived there I just went there summers and grew up kind of in hunting that area part of the Bitterroot Valley Southwest Montana what's that near Missoula yeah I just grew up hunting there and you know with Bruce Lee's there no there's no Grizzlies there some areas in Montana have them some don't yeah correct what's that about well they have them in the park and then the main population and then they did the reintroductions and say-so glacier has them Yellowstone has them they reintroduce Grizzlies to certain areas yeah really outside of Glacier in some areas yes they do they get problem Grizzlies and trap them or something as far as I know yeah they did do some transplants or reintroductions but those parks have had them and then the ones in that Greater Yellowstone area have spread out and in that glacier you've spread out Montana is a very unusual place such a small population but the people there like I've only been to Bozeman and Billings when we went and hunted the Missouri Breaks but people are very nice it's a really cool area interesting it's like they're not they're not Hicks yeah no they're tuned in it's weird Montana has a small population but that population explodes in the summer with all the with the parks there right so its tourists type people coming in and that's why I mean it seems like I don't actually have the stats but it seems like the lot almost every year somebody dies from a grizzly now or multiple people it's a lot of people have been getting attacked and I think it's just the amount of people that are there and just think that they're cuddly cute animals and they don't really have precautions because I think if you go on a hunt in Alaska where we went in a fog neck you're probably a lot safer than the tourists going into Yellowstone just because you you're you should be prepared you've got the idea that these bears are dangerous and they're probably gonna come at you in some way you need to be ready at all times and you go into Yellowstone you're like or Glacier Park there's a lot of attacks around they've delisted bears they're right yeah they're there delisted now but they don't have a season open for hunting but that's under debate correct so the ideas there are populations have reached a steady or maybe even over that level yep yeah they're no longer they're no longer threatened or potentially endangered there's known they aren't gonna go extinct right yeah and they you ever see the short-faced bear you ever see images of the bear that used to live somewhere in the bering land mass yeah in US and Asia it's a way bigger than even a grizzly very large yeah they think that's what made of might have kept people from migrating to North America quicker that's crazy well they say they say that polar bears still actively hunt people you know which is a those bears they do have a different temperament now I think that the Bears in Montana just keep going back to bears but the Bears in Montana landlocked grizzly bears just seem to be slightly more aggressive than the larger coastal brown bears just because they don't have as much food they're always slightly pissed off they always see everything as a potential meal and everything is like they look at mammals moving around the ground as a meals because like the Bears and the coastal they looking at salmon salmon most of the year yeah they're not thinking of things walking around as being food yeah well the salmon are a very large food source but only in the fall right so for a quarter of the year did you ever see that BBC special or the guy they put him in a giant plexiglass box yeah and they dropped him off somewhere where there's a large polar bear population oh no my thought was I saw one where they did with the brown bear and the that got it to attack the thing no this was a polar bear yeah they put the polar but they put this box there and the guys inside the box and the polar bear comes up to the box this is it oh so is this like super thick glass thing with steel and bolts and rivets I mean it literally looks like some sort of a like something you would drop out of a fucking spaceship and this bear comes up and sees him and start smelling them as it tries to bite through the thing look at this Wow fuck this bad he's tightening everything down freaking out its licking everything and that's a big thing but is there's times where it opens its mouth yeah and the guys inside of it and it's it can smell him through these little holes see that where it's claws I went through that hole and it's trying to eat him oh yeah that thing is trying to snack on the ice right there yeah I mean it's not curious it's trying to figure out a way to get him fuck man that's pretty cool it was they're so ruthless that they're you know all of them are cannibals that's what's really crazy there's not a little there's a lot of food up there no the the source is that they do have the seals and things are just high fat content so they don't have to eat as much in Wales leave that yeah a picture crazy it's got its mouth open trying to bite through the glass and its head is so fucking big yeah I mean there's a heartbreaking video I don't know if you saw it was going around a couple weeks ago of a polar bear that starving to death and you know they're attributing to climate change I didn't see that yeah it's it's NatGeo thing yeah it's weird that you do not want that to happen right I mean the last thing you want to see is a polar bear starving to death but I also don't want to get eaten by that fucking thing yeah well just don't go yeah it's just I mean that's the balance right you we want them to thrive and survive we just don't want them anywhere near me yeah I think they're I mean I've never been anywhere that there are polar bears so would you be interested in going yeah I'd go check it out I think it'd be cool to see do they have what are those big furry things must muskox are they anywhere near polar bears yeah they're yeah they've got them in the Arctic the polar bears hunt those musk oxen nah I don't not that I know of and they're mostly go for seals and other things so what's next for you man you're gonna do any more TV shows I really enjoyed that apex predator yeah you know well I'm still doing the solo hunter stuff and we did I did some cool stuff in Australia this year and did went buff humming did like a little mission there I was with some people but then I did all the hunting alone just get out there's pretty like far out it's still doing the solo stuff and then yeah I've got some stuff in the works for the coming future that'll be it's exciting I just can't really divulge a lot of it yet but well I hope you do something that allows people that are more mainstream that aren't on outdoor TV to get a look at your approach and your philosophy and the way you look at things because I think that guys like you and Rinella and cam hands and Dudley very valuable yeah because people have this sense that you said were you talking about like the stereo typical idea of what a hunter is they have this idea of what it is and they see a guy like you and they go oh this guy's like more like an athlete like this is more like a pursuit this is more like an endurance skill thing on top of being a hunting thing like there's a lot of a lot of variables here that most people don't take into consideration it's why I think it's so important to that's why I really enjoyed having you on a podcast and having guys like you want to talk about the stuff so people get an understanding of it in a different way yeah thanks I appreciate that yeah it's nice to be able to kind of share what I do with a population that might not really understand it because I think if you really look at it hunting in general and the way that myself and I'm not the exception there's a lot of people that yeah hunt the way that I do especially out west I think that if you really understand that way then you kind of start to get a grasp of it's not bad it's actually a better system than some of the systems that we have around now and I think some of the stuff that I'm going to be doing in the future will really just give people more access to that and you know right now you can go get like there's solo hunter episodes we have a we we decide to put them all on our website and you like a solo hunter all-access kind of thing just like a subscription you can go on there and just watch anything that we've done there's just think that a lot of times what's happening with that just stories that are being told about hunting it's it's all everyone's preaching to the converted yeah and occasionally something comes along like this podcast where people maybe would have a prejudiced idea of what it is then they get introduced to a guy like you or Rennell and go oh these aren't meatheads these aren't dumb people like this is a different thing and then they realize like this is actually a very difficult honorable pursuit in a very respectful pursuit and really hard to do you were talking about like what the kind of physical fitness levels that are required of you the the knowledge and understanding this is not like some easy thing where you go into the mountains and just go find an animal that's trying to survive and kill it especially with a bow and arrow it's not no no it's not easy I think if anyone I used to hear those comments the people don't owe you big hundred they're in queue an animal with a gun or boat whatever go give it a try see if you can do it cause it's not as easy as you might think it's unbelievably it is it's very difficult I mean they smell you hundreds of yards away they like fuck this guy and they're gone yeah and you're never gonna come close to him yeah and a lot of people's interactions with wildlife are in urban zones or in national parks that's like it's like Disneyland it's like going to the zoo it's not like where I go into remote wilderness areas where the animals are completely wild and you have no support system no net of safety and you just have to rely on your skills and your ability and you're just another like you're just another predator out there on the mountain and there are things and those some of those places that want to eat you and you just you have to adapt and deal with it and be prepared and and go off those skills are those solo backpacking trips your favorite ones oh by far yeah I love that I love it in in those mouths there's some there's some hunts that I used to do a lot of that I try to like they're actually looking back on Manas way dangerous I probably shouldn't do that alone and then I still go do it but there's gonna be some point well where Rennell and I hunted and got attacked by that mirabehn in there very quite a few times probably three or four times alone solo what yeah hunting deer and a life in there yeah and and I think about it go yeah that's stupid terribly terribly but and to be honest there's times that I've been in there by myself and taken less precaution and I remember one specific time I was stalking a black tail and I pull I had my pistol in my backpack which now obviously I would never do again but I have my bear spray on my hip and my pistol I pull it out I have no bullets in the thing and I'm on a fog nag island thinking I would be dead I would have been dead if that would have happened and I wasn't by myself and I've been in that the shitty thing is I've been the thing that really kind of pissed me off later was thinking the amount of times I've been in those situations alone and just thinking man I got to relax on that why did you not have bullets in the gun is that just one of those things we've just been there too many times and just anything so well and I did I did have bear spray and I think oh the bear spray is good enough but now knowing the way that that bear charged in bear spray would have been completely useless does run right through it well the wind was blowing so so fast in our faces we would have blinded ourselves probably now whether you're coated with bear spray and it Ward's the bear off I don't know no I wouldn't know you want to whip out like jalapeno sauce you want to whip out bear spray in 70 mile an hour winds that blowing in your face maybe that time you're probably 40 50 miles an hour but that bear spray is not gonna work in that no that's ridiculous the bear sprays I mean I bet it works some of the time yeah I think in in some instances it's probably a lot more effective my friend Johnny rivet said he sprayed it right in the Grizzlies face and the Grizzly walked right through it he just closed his eyes and then shook his head and then walk right through it yeah I think that there's now I think I just carried both there are certain instances where that is probably better option yeah because I've got shooting something that's charging with the pistol is very difficult yeah in that situation I think caliber that was a 44 Magnum I think in in that situation you're really relying on it when the Bears on top of you oh it's just the last-ditch effort any of those and even those any kind of deterrent you have I think is just hard to hard to really like when it comes down it's either gonna go down and you're gonna get away and stare or you're not you don't do you think trying you can horrific experience made that place more attractive to you in about a year yeah I think so the answer before I asked it yes I was hoping cries the weather sucks it's hard walking around now I know that the bear attacks are legit okay let's go back I mean I'll go I'll go back there next year not deer for sure yeah and I put in four tags in a different area in there so I'll go back I wasn't it wasn't one of those type of experiences where you go I think even if I had got tore up a little bit I would still go back that's just Li yeah it's not tore up a little bit the fun like lived through it oh yeah what if you like lost half your nose I probably go I'd probably start bear hunting yeah I have once it was it was one of those things I thought I'll do it I had an opportunity and I wasn't I'm not I'm not really just I'm not like big into bear hunting the meat to me is it's good it's okay but I just it's not like it's not you know it's not my thing and you can't eat it medium-rare no exactly that's my yeah and and the other thing is there is like some of its might just be like you have emotional connections and certain things like I would I don't have any desire to go on an African lion it's just not like you just whatever yeah you know and not that I don't know I mean now if there's this thing where it's like you save the species you have to go hunt an African lion and I probably do it but it's not something that appeals to me yeah but that's like to say to save mankind you know you you have to go fuck Jennifer Beale but um I did I didn't hunt bears it's wrong with my memory that's weird I couldn't come up with a current hot chick how weird but you did I did yeah and I it was like a weird so what the area that I went into it was a predator control area and it's an area that the state of Alaska so the state of Alaska works different than other places so I actually went and met with biologists and kind of like it was like could what's the deal with this and so the deal was that there's the state of Alaska has to manage their wildlife populations for subsistence subsistence food sources it's like mandated by the state so in that particular area that the predator populations got so high that the moose populations and enjoyment populations were in severe decline and in danger of not being able to provide food an adequate food source for the people that lived and when I'm talking people to live people live in these remote areas yes they did and I've seen the show yeah it's a lot more real than those shows but they they live in these areas where there is no access to other food sources one of the guys that I met the only thing he eats for an entire year is bear meat he has no other I mean I don't know if he gets some kind of gross some kind of garden and forages as well but his main food source through the winter is bear meat which gun black bear in that area yeah or brown or it didn't matter whatever you could get so there's people that live in certain places that the only way that they live is from the animals that live there and that's the only way that could survive I'd like to get a scientist to study that guy yeah he was an interesting guy I mean the guy who just eats bear what is he like he's like ridiculously strong what they get him the gift no you you seem like it's normal as somebody that lives off greed is yeah so they but anyways this particular area the bear population was so high that it was severely hurting the undulant population to the point where there might it would be very hard to repair so then they open up these special seasons like for people to go in to hunt bears in this particular area with a certain objective and since they opened it now that areas been starting to recuperate and then they stopped the predator management thing mmm they they still you can hunt certain but they have so we've got a interesting balance and they they put a lot of time and research and into this whole deal this home there's something very bizarre about those television shows because they're they're captivating those people that live off the grid yeah but there's something really ironic about a person who doesn't even have a television in their house but they're on television that is weird weird yeah you know this guy is living as close to the land as possible but yet there's some millennial behind a camera don't ya yeah so I'm hey man can you can you pretend that you just found that again just put it down pick it up again like whoa can't believe this is here just you know give me one of those yeah yeah I think some of those people I I've met quite a few people that live like you that aren't on television that live in the and they're fairly strangely normal people yeah it's it's kind of you would think they some of them have they might live in a shack but they've got some kind of like Internet service off their generator that they run every once in a while it's weird you ever see that vais piece on that guy that lives in eastern Alaska hi mo hi mo right hi Moe's Arctic adventure no it's amazing he's been there since the 70s and he came out there I think as a guide or a forestry worker or something like that and built a cabin he's the last guy out there that has the has rights to a cabin really and that they allow his permits to keep this cabin out there hi Moe's Arctic refuge that's what it is hi mo Korff it's amazing man he's a hunter and fur trapper he lives off of caribou and he takes his caribou and he they're all frozen because it's all cold they're hanging from hanging from trees he just saws it and throws it on the grill you know like saws a frozen steak and throws it on the grill but he's remarkably intelligent and articulate he's not he's not crazy yeah he lives up there with his wife and you know she's a Inuit I guess and I said what you would say yeah yeah I know where is it okay to say Eskimo because some of them prefer Eskimo I'm not sure where the line is there's like some people think that Eskimo is a slower like you're not supposed to say it but other ones say no you should say Eskimo so it's like Rinella was trying to explain to me and I went in one ear and out the other yeah it's probably just where they live yeah yeah but this guy lives in this Shack that's smaller than this room smaller than the studio and it's just log thing and during the show a bear tried to eat his dog so he ran out in the middle of the night it's dark out he's of blowing his shotgun off boom boom boom chasing this bear through the forest and shooting it Wow and then I had to skin it and send the skull in and you know had to tell the wildlife people okay yeah I tried to try to kill my dog so how to shoot it yeah in defense of life yeah and she more defends of life or property technique yeah but this guy again like you're saying remarkably normal yeah it's kind of strange but yeah in that in that area I I did I went on that hunt and then the I ate because people have always said I'll bear whatever I ate it and it was fine it was better than black bear meat I thought was it really yeah so the whole like he can't eat him as we were deal because my own my one thing was if I do this I'm gonna eat it and I you know I didn't see anything wrong with him so wasn't coastal it was it was casta so it was eating fish is eating seals well maybe seals taste better I don't know it was it was summer times you so it would have been it would have been eating fish and seals and whatever can find dead dead seals mostly because I remember Rinella telling me that he shot a black bear once it would be nothing but fish and that they smoked it in that he borrowed a friend's smoker he didn't say it was terrible but he said he borrowed a friend smoker and he said hey man you got to clean that smoker out and he was wild smells like fish and he goes I've never smoked fish in that thing ever hmm and he was like what really and they realized like oh no it's coming off of the actual meat like the the bear ate so much fish that it tasted like fish in the fat and then when they they they smoked this bear ham and then sliced it thin it literally tastes like salmon carpaccio it's not yeah see that doesn't appeal to me I think if you get your head past it yeah when I got like salmon so why wouldn't I like that yeah it's a weird like a weird bear salmon combination yeah was somebody ask me it will mean Rinella on meat eaters ate that coyote in Mexico yeah yeah and it I wasn't at the time it just tasted like meat it was weird me it tasted like goose or something thinking back on it like I've no desire to go out and eat coyote again no no no there's things that's too close to a dog yeah that's too weird and I kind of like coyotes I like yeah I like seeing him around I mean they're like our weird neighbors so this is this year I got man I've got charged by a lot of stuff this year the I was hunting it where you were I sent you in Rinella I went back there you got charged with my thumb up there yeah so this is this is weird so I'm sitting there in this you see like that white sandy area up and there's like this weird white dirt up there so I'm sitting in this weird white dirt and it's the middle of the day hundred degrees out so I'm trying to get in the shade and I'm I'm actually had a trip coming up that we did caribou hunt that we filmed with Under Armour for one of their red Reaper series which I've done a few of those that my brother you did one and then my brother did a moose hunt that was just before that yes trees Australia one cam has a couple of yang cams got the he had the elk hunt this year and then the Austrian boys buck ones got the x cool job so anyways I'm I'm leaving for that shortly so I'm sitting out there making a list on my phone and I'm full camo DUP but I had no gloves on and I've got my phone there and I hear this slight noise behind me and I turn around and this coyote is running full speed at me like Full Tilt and I cock my fist back that punch it in the face and it like hits the brakes and starts skidding because it's running downhill so I think my estimation of what happened was I'm sitting there with my hands and camo'd and it saw maybe the flash of my hands working on the phone or maybe something in the flash of the phone and thought it was a small animal probably thought it was a rabbit or something I'm not sure this is just what I'm assuming it ran in so fast and so quiet I don't know what I heard but I happened to turn around at the right time and I when I turned around at things eyes I swear just doubled in size and he hit the brakes and his ass there skidding toward me because I was I was gonna punch it to do and it it started it like skidded and then started rolling and then got up within it could have grabbed it and just wheeled off the other direction 100 miles away but it was in full-on attack mode I don't think it realized what it was attacking I don't think it knew that I was a person I think it just thought movement movement small thing attack and when I scared the shit out of it yeah your hands a little squirrel squirrel or something you're just coming full tilt so quiet it's just so quiet I see how they can grab stuff have you ever had a mountain lion sneak up on you not sneak up on me but I've been in very close proximity I was in Arizona hunting coues deer with my bow probably I don't even know maybe even ten years ago now and I was going through this wash and I see a drag mark and tracks I'm like oh a lion killed a cow and drug it through this wash and I'm like sweet I was filming I had my video camera in my backpack so I'm bent over getting my video camera out because I'm gonna like film the tracks in the drag mark and then maybe find the cow well in the wash it's like sand and then a tree and some real tall grass and I'm bent over going through my backpack and I look up and maybe three four feet away so that cat crouched down just looking at me through the grass three or four feet away yeah within ya to arm's length support seat away so like right where I am yeah exactly and I look up and I walk eyes with it just and it it likes links back goes underneath the log and pops up at maybe 15 20 feet in terms of stairs oh shit and then I get the camera out and then it just like sauntered off well I catch it on film I think I got it walking away but I didn't get it when it was closed because now I'm like now I'm digging for my pistol crushes yeah where was my pistol it was in bag - but I don't know what my deal is keeping my pistol in my bag is stupid so then it went off well what it had done it had drugged the calf into that into that patch of grass and then they kind of bury it and had just been gorging on it and it was laying on top of it and I didn't even see any of that cuz I'm so focused on the tracks and everything else I didn't even notice it it was the way it was laying the the cow was tucked up underneath this tree and covered in stuff she couldn't see it until I went through the thick grass and that cat must have just heard me and slunk down waiting for me to go by and then it was probably just so full it had no and they're very fairly shy animals as well but I was very vulnerable position it could have easily jumped on me easily you know it's the only thing I saw was its eyes in there because it blended in so well I was one thing that I was shocked by when we were in Nevada is Nevada Nevada there it is so now I know I say Nevada that we were in Nevada how many domestic cows wandered through those areas yeah grazing and that they they spend I don't know how that works like they they pay money for permits to allow these cows to graze yeah you lease you lease it and then you pay X amount to the Forest Service for grazing atonement certain areas and then generally you have to have him off button October 1st so like me and Dan Doty were on a stalk and we're moving through this area and then we hear some noise and this fucking cows stand in front of us like this is just weird like you feel like you shouldn't be here yeah like am I in some farm somewhere but you're not they're just just resting their house grazing yeah and then they'll go up and horses and just round him up and push him down to the fields yeah so odd III didn't understand that I always thought that cows were in pens and that's just the way it is but no there's a lot of cows that are just wandering around on grazing land yeah it's all open range that was with all that Bundy stuff up in Oregon was about right yeah I'm not an expert on it but I remember them talking it was yeah he didn't pay his his fees right she's a half too is America news on BLM land right which okay yeah I mean with Bureau of Land Management weren't even that much it's a lot cheaper than having it on private land yeah well there's something that happens to white people when you leave them alone with guns yeah please leave them alone in the forest with guns they they almost always get a little squirrely yeah yeah that was a weird standoff though it was very strange because there was like shootouts with the federales and everything didn't they take over some kind of like forest like reserve area something happened refuge yeah some kind of federal little building out there so there was one of them was shot and killed yeah yeah I mean it was like a big uproar well a bunch of other fucking Yahoo's white dudes with guns flew there to sort of help out that's when it got real weird memory yeah big standoff yeah that's gonna see my own thought on it is it's it's public land it's not your land right its Pope it's our land yes so you can't go do commercial shit and be like oh you know what I'm just gonna go open up a hotel on the Forest Service land over here cuz it's my land yeah I'm a government I own it no what's everybody's everybody's that shit yeah yeah but people have weird ways to justify anything maybe if he's giving out his beef for free to everyone who owns the land that's one thing but he wasn't doing that so before we wrap this up you have any interesting places that you're headed to soon I'll be going on New Mexico next week and then you know is that Senora Senora yeah that's always down there yeah it's amazing down there how that's real Mexico right yeah that's cool it's awesome do you want that ranch that Steve goes to all the time um similar area different place yeah I thought that was amazing when they showed how they preserve Buffalo where they would cut it really thin than hanging on clotheslines to dry it make machaca yeah I said I've been to that place a couple times that place is pretty cool where they've got those Buffalo down there is that what you did that episode of solo hunter where you put the wolf Skinner apex predator apex yeah yeah and we still those apex predator episode can still go apex predator dot TV and if you just want to get them you can get the download still I think that's the only place they exist now but yeah I did that it was cool they show up sometime on DVR because I have you as a you know like oh yes in pass sometimes they'll just throw one on yeah that makes sense on the channel and I'll just pop up yeah that's what my buddies like they're doing an apex predator marathon can they do that did you want to do more of those yes and no I really enjoyed doing it but the other thing is I also liked everything else I was doing and there's a lot of well TV networks are dying yeah they just it seems like yeah they don't want to they don't want shows that are it was a I thought was a it was an extremely high quality show for that network and those high quality shows cost too much for that network to make as well I ended up being now is there a way to do something like that for the internet because I know that Netflix is starting to do Rinella shows Netflix and he's still on regular TV too right yeah I think they're just reruns I don't think there's any new stuff I'm not sure the new stuff is just gonna be on Netflix I don't know I don't I'm not really sure yeah I have to ask him but yeah I you know I think there there will be a place for that kind of stuff in the future when I think you know but I enjoyed doing it but I also didn't want to do 15 episodes of it a year right because there's other things that I enjoyed doing I enjoy doing those Under Armour pieces I enjoy doing solo hunters enjoy doing a lot of stuff I don't like just doing one thing so can you do a lot of New Zealand as well yeah so I'll be going over to a New Zealand this year that's a hard place yeah cuz that's a place where again it's all invasive small invasive species New Zealand and Australia I really liked Australia when I went there actually that video with Green Tree and cam actually swung by can I crash their party for a couple days but in there I'm taking us cool this one yeah I had a good time over there and then I went and did my own thing after the after they left for their Buffalo I kind of went often did my own thing somewhere completely different yeah you went by yourself right um yeah I I have a friend over there and so we drove out into Arnhem Land which is like Aboriginal and we got special permission and got all these permits and everything and we drove out there and went hunting for a week and a half two weeks something like that and and then we because we only had one vehicle between the two of us so we drop him off somewhere and then I'd drive out and then go hunt and then the next thing he would take the vehicle and I would go out and hunt so I was humming by myself foremost most of it which was I liked that experience because kind of dangerous Buffalo you but it's when you only have a bow and you're completely by yourself there's no you're not gonna get medevacked out of there in a helicopter because you're 13 hours by vehicle from the nearest town you know I don't know how you even get out you'd be in a world of hurt yeah you hear that out on green tree fuck that place he keeps trying to get me to go there stop it out yeah it's a cool place I enjoyed it it's a certain type of person will really like it and other people will hate it yeah people like you that's why you need to have a television show or yeah if not a television show some real in-depth show that they do want on the internet it shows like the preparation that's involved I just think it's something that most people are ignorant - yeah and I'm kind of obsessed with that the idea of explaining it to people yeah yeah I think that that hunt you can I filmed it for solo so you can watch that I thought that turned out pretty good but there's just something to you about North American hunting and we have so much awesome we have a lot of awesome places here a lot of people live close and probably don't even take an advantage of them but there's a lot of cool place and a lot of cool things you can do in the US and in the western US and there's just a lot of cool places around well one of the things that I said when we were in Nevada said it right yeah get it when we were up there outside of Reno it's like three hours outside of Reno somewhere like that I was saying this might as well be some alien world there's nothing up there no it's a lot a lot of public land and not much in between and these big giant hills and valleys where there's nothing in them but animals and it's just weird yeah it's not flat it no those mountains are 13,000 feet yeah it's pretty incredible it's pretty incredible it's just but it's it's also incredible that so few people understand that this is all public land you can go out there anytime you want you can go travel this stuff and that's one of the reasons why people like back honey country hunters and anglers and and conservation groups are so important they preserve your access to these places because there are so many places like that that are just fantastic and they're there for you and most people don't even know about it even if you have zero desire to go hunting just go and visit just go and wander through those woods in Idaho just go yeah there's some cool places that there's it's just cool to walk into a spot especially Idaho's got huge wilderness areas walk in there and look around and think it's what everything looks like when there's no roads when there's there's nothing you might be the only person for it's a cool feeling to be know that there's no one else around and it's not much different than it was 5,000 years ago it's not it's not much has changed start coughing up a storm cool fighting off a little bit of a cold here Remmy one oh that nasty flu it's not it's not a
