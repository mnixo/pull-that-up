the jello can experience he reminded me of when you talked about grabbing them in the laundry basket do you remember back in Boston you were out one night with Jennifer and I was home and I swear to God on my father's grave this happened I rented Batman at the Blockbuster and I put it in and I'm sitting at home and I'm watching it and then all of a sudden I see this shadow and then I turned my head and I see another shadow and I look up and there's a bat flying around the apartment and I'm like what and I'm scared shitless of bats like it's like my thing it's like ever since I was a kid my aunt had this bar near her and they had bats and they would be told me they were fruit bats and if they bite you you'll get rabies you'll die and and so and we would always be outside playing tag at night and I would the fucking bats would fly by and I'd freak out and so I'm alone in the apartment and as a bat flying around and Batman is on TV and so all I knew is they go in your hair which i think is like not even true so I put on a baseball cap backwards ha ha ha ha ha and I had on sunglasses and a tennis racket clad in one of my eyes he's gonna go for my ID that's a felony run around the apartment I'm swinging at him he's taking off he's like you know he's just they're erratic the way they fly it on her where they're fucking going and this goes on for like 10 minutes and then there's like a standoff and I'm waiting and then I hear you coming up the stairs and you came in and you opened the door and you go what the fuck you down there's a bat in here and you just see just grab the tennis racket out of my hand and he walked up and he was in the window and you just bashed him once and he just went down and then you just walked over and you had takeout in your hand and just went into the kitchen start eating it I'm staying there with sunglasses and an ax I remember that that's hilarious you have to gauge any given any given interaction of the audience you gauge who that you gotta let it fucking figure it out fast are they gonna are they going to charge the stage are they gonna keep heckling exact you got sorry you got a tyrannous stitches it stitches in Boston's you gotten like physically attacked you got a run sling match with some dude wrestling match no the guy came up he took a swing at me I ducked I hit him in the head with the microphone and then he was from the Israeli army he was a cab driver who was there his name was simcha I still remember that because I said you know that's the name of the village idiot and Woody Allen's movie love and death right and so he came up and he got me a fucking headlock and that dude was spinning me around the stage and knocking down tables I couldn't get out and about you know stitches it's it's the stage is surrounded by the crowd so when somebody stands up because they want to see the fight and the bouncers can't get up there and so it just fucking went on for a while and then finally the bouncers came up and two of my buddies you know Mike Gibbons Mike Mike and I there at the bar and they're trying to get up there they can't get out there and uh they got him out and then the owner you remember that guy Harry little dude Harry yeah he goes Harry and Susie yeah Harry can afford it he goes uh okay yeah okay Fitz you gotta you got ten minutes left and they reintroduced me I'm like what oh you got fucking done so I go up and I get on stage and I got a standing ovation because they would have a rather small stand I rather see a fight in his comedy show my first standing ovation in my life and then I went to the chiropractor my neck was fucked do you remember what you said to the audience yeah I walked up and and they clapped and once they calm down I looked around I go alright who's next yeah I remember that I wasn't there for it but I remember you telling me that and everybody else is talking about how you said that - it was like that's hilarious well actually Brian Frazier gave me the line he was he was the audience oh that's all there yeah yeah interesting man it's it's weird how Fame you can't predict who's gonna last with Fame you know like of the Charlie's Angels you didn't know Farrah was gonna I guess he kind of knew Farrah was gonna be the one yeah but you thought the other ones would be pretty big - yeah Jacqueline Smith I mean all she did was hair shampoo commercials for the rest of her life she was on as fuck hot is fuck my my kid is watching Charlie's Angels reruns right now I watched one yesterday try pulling yourself away oh I could stare at those chicks all fucking day it's also weird that your it's kind of like when you watch a show like that's not just that oh you know Jacqueline Smith's pretty but it's also like this is a time capsule yeah like this is they've captured this stuff that went on in the 1970s and you watch it again alright that's weird man that's a weird and their outfits let me talk about the bootleg jeans they were wearing the seven date encapsulated 70s fashion yeah no shit man you know like denim denim vests in the feather hair and they probably for in a big part where one of the reasons why became so popular right why the fashion did yeah oh I'm sure on those shows I'm sure like I guarantee the Dukes of Hazzard probably influenced a lot of idiots to wear cowboy boots daisy dukes definitely Dior yeah doubt right watch that dude she might have been the hottest chick ever on TV oh yeah see right who Chrissy from from fucking Three's Company yeah Daisy Duke no how dare you I'll take Chrissy's because you're broken your insides are rotten you have to go to a dog what keep telling you go to a doctor Chrissy's hot but she's not as hot as Daisy dude you know he's pretty hot even though she's he's a mole but she's older so you can't compare don't you go for an old pic of Catherine Bach you fuck I know what you're gonna do but um the chick from Modern Family Latino on it dick please older dude

doesn't push it up where it's straining there's a little bit of bounce a little bit about little jiggle but yet there's the there's pie there pie shape they're perfectly round she's stupid on pan and that accent puts it right over the top she's stupid hot and there's this element of knowing that this is not going to last yeah like what you are is you're looking at a flower that's been cut and you're putting it in the vows and it's just like something even extra beautiful about the fact that it's not even attached to the root anymore you got a day to look at it like this this is it net tomorrow's gonna be wilted the day after that you're gonna want to throw it out but right now it's the Hunter Thomas of hot yeah yeah Thompson what did I say Thomas Jesus Christ I go okay you know both of them are hot yeah but daisy dukes dirtier Oh Krissi's bending over like fuck me in the asshole but I'll tell you what like who's done a better job of keeping it together mom both of them both of them failed oh no wait kidding she did the exercise videos she had tights a little bit myth still do when I shampoo commercials that's not Jacqueline Smith though that's all Daisy Duke that's all um nobody worked by the way Farrah's nipples were permanently erect on that show mm-hmm they probably iced him up before every scene I bet they did that date because guys would get like pumped up guys do like push-ups and stop before scenes to pump up their muscles yeah like guarantee they did that okay they went for it oh yeah yeah that was everything that was what you were selling if you were selling it you're selling cars would you leave him dirty or would you polish him you got to polish the car you got to polish the car you selling cars you're selling tits what are you doing get that

famous posters ever yeah yeah yeah that's it right there look at her unreal and the nipple you can't see that's not high-def so you can't see the nipple but the nipple is very proudly displayed and

yeah he was beautiful we did a lot for the ladies on this actually since we don't feel it you know we assumed that he's hot you know I mean I see how you would be a truck no no I totally felt your energy when he came on so I understood that he was hot on the star doom doom doom doom about Janet Jackson early 90s no I playboy Kagura black-and-white it's never into that oh no I always found her to be so like need a racial I need a race pick a race well I just I just think someone is like a pop superstar's there's forcing them down your throat they never seem sexy to me it always seemed like oh here's this crazy person right let me uh what's your name uh Miley Cyrus yeah it's like oh they want you to think she's hot now but you know was Britney Spears was a child star and they forced her on and she was fucking hot yeah but she was hot in a way that like like if I saw a bunch of peacocks and there was a female peacott that was an exceptional specimen I was like wow that's a beautiful peacock yes like that it's like to me hot yeah I mean I yes physically yeah undeniable shape and all that very beautiful but right no no no anything is pulling me towards that everything's pushing me away from that yeah that's seized and that's madness it's craziness like that has to be part of the picture it has to be who's the person like can you interact with the person can't just be the way they look the way they look is great I mean it's important it's it's something gives you charge but if you know that their personalities all out of whack like you're like oh this to me but I want him a little out of whack the thing that attracted me as an insecure guy when I was single was a woman I got I saw the in I saw the dead dad left or you know she's got she's got like a unibrow you thought I would find that one thing I'll be like I got a shot that would make me so much more attracted the girl was perfect I felt nothing and it wasn't even that I didn't think I could get her it just made me feel like too much work well also like somebody who's a little fucked up they're gonna you're gonna fucking connect with them there's gonna be a charge between you cuz you both need something bad to complete yourself that's a good point yeah I definitely felt that way like girls had like really good relationships with their family like man oh I know girls like you know they want you to go hang out with their parents right like oh yeah not really now especially if you couldn't relate I want a girl who needs help finding her father Nicki Minaj Disney videos he's the one that fucking Jamie keeps going on and on about and won't stop talking about it it's so much but you know and it's like there's parts where she's fingering herself in the video what a good kid I love that my kids see this shit she's well her ass is ridiculous yeah they're all ass everybody's got ass if you look at it look at Miley Cyrus's Twitter avatar that she's cut that she put her own version of her album cover on it and it looks like she has a great ass too but that's an illusion there Photoshop the shit out of that that girl weighs 18 pounds still stick figure yeah she's a very boy like with her body like when that thing came out in the Video Music Awards and she danced around and rubbed up against that guy you could see like she's very like guy like or skinny she's a skinny girl Nicki no she's athletic it's not supple yes that girl is just a fuck house you look at her and you're like whoa but but I mean there's comics that go up and they're likable number one before they're funny so they can't bomb which is the saddest thing in the world because the audience doesn't even get that they're not even that funny cuz they're likable first you're not likable if you do well it's just cuz you're funny I can't argue I can't argue with what you're saying I always said that if I didn't know me I would swear I was a douchebag if I didn't know me if I just knew someone who had my characteristics and my jobs oh I live fucking most loathsome human in the world I got a whiny voice I'm fucking I think I'm better than people like oh you think you're smarter than me I'm like I really don't I think I'm a fucking idiot but I seem to have that air about me but it's part of what's funny though you know your real comic like if you and I are talking if we just happen to be on an airplane together and some really dark shit was going on right we could start cracking each other up right it doesn't mean we mean it doesn't mean it but you're going for the laugh like you you're like one of the first guys to go for the fucked up laughs like in the personal conversation like you just sit there hanging out eating lunch and then you just you'll go for that but you don't mean you're a really nice guy right you're like didn't I don't think people who aren't either immersed in the world of stand-up comedy or know a lot of stand-up comics I don't think they appreciate that right well yeah I think that to me it's about it's a cure you're commenting on normal conversation you're you're you're you're making fun of what a racist would say it is exactly exactly you know and you're being racist too right also being racist is we are racist aren't we this is what we are okay we are judgmental it's part of evolution we're constantly assessing our environment and sometimes we know this shit you're not supposed to say so we say it because it's funny and it's also funny because there's some truth to it and it's fucked up but there's some truth to it and god I wish it was wasn't true I wish stereotypes weren't true I wish Italians I wish my own relatives weren't apes I really wish they weren't savage untrustworthy Apes but they are that's what they could watch fucking Real Housewives of New Jersey and what are you saying about Italians what are you seeing my people my people are savages right I wish that wasn't true but it's fucking true yeah it's hard to it's hard to fight against the Italian stereotype because here's a problem with Italians that there's many is that you're enamored with the fact that you're Italian so you won't evolve like every Italian guy you could meet some guy from fucking the Prairie Prairieland Midwest and if he's Italian he'll go it gets the pasta fazool because they've watched the Godfather and they've watched Sopranos and they want to sound like that because they want to be Italian whereas we're supposed to be all growing away from like you're saying the barbaric versions of ourselves should be in the past not perpetuated for generations I have friends back east friends I love them to death and I don't mind when they put it on I don't mind when they do the Italian talk but a little piece of me dies right right right one hey I'm I heard mom with the copper go with the God oh cool hey did you hey your mom is still making it coz good she's happy some will call me Giuseppe that's a big one hey Giuseppe Hey very rare that my Jewish friends call me Giuseppe if it might be Ari when he's high and I've never seen an Italian guy have a solo fight it's always a fucking group jumps in well there's a herd mentality involved in being proud of what patch of dirt you're on right that doesn't lend itself to courage yes that's not that that's not the right mentality it's Yeti the rugged individual that takes on the group and wins no that's uh fuck it Bob you bleed with this guy say toes Bobby where you go Bobby what the fuck Bobby's already Bobby's wearing a wire the entire time Bobby's in the backseat of the patrol car I was way to testify what the fuck Bobby we're family over here you out let this fucking shit go between us hey thing I was wondering why we call you to rat Bobby and he was with Bobby to rat that fucking cocksucker know he used to sit at my mama's stable eek Gaga Lucia think about it what is who's the number one most famous gangsters of all time they're all telling us they'll braggadocious Gotti types are Al Capone Al Capone over here Jimmy Hoffa savages my people were criminal savages Hey right make awesome food and know how to fuck that's it that's it girls oh my god and you're good-lookin girl hot Italian girl the hottest who can make really good food and likes to fuck all the time she might beat you to death in your sleep right and you don't mind it's worth it that's fucking crazy the crazy I love Italian I grew up around dark dark Italian chick I gave up on them last time chick a David took a swing at me really yeah back in the back in the Boston days right like that's it I'm good yeah I'm good can't date anybody like me fucking animals well that's it - you're not supposed to date within your own race that's proven I married I knew well actually she's half-irish half-jewish but you got it you got to get a little way from mom it's uh well the Irish were the most racist of all people because we're the fairest skin we look down on everybody I don't think so oh fuck man you think so really because we came to America at the time of the Italians came up basically the same time so when you go to the Bronx or Boston they're so gracious we fucking hate each other and they hate everybody else because we were the last ones to come over so everybody hated us we were the last ones to get jobs so we have selected the Irish were the last of them yeah that's why we were at first the first immigrants English the Dutch Dutch English Dutch English the Scandinavians I know so little about the immigration of different cultures in this country I always know about my own family right was the Great Depression my grandparents came over during the Depression yeah there's a great book about Cornelius Vanderbilt and it kind of tracks New York in the 1800s and as the waves of people came over and it's really won the Pulitzer Prize so called the the first tycoon my grandmother the Last Tycoon my grandmother grew up in the depression she was kind of insane because of it and she's still like hide things all around the house like she hide money in various spots in the house they didn't find it until after she died they wish it did she had she had thousands of dollars tucked away into walls but it's just but the idea was not just that she had money I mean she they were very poor yeah but that she had money that she had squirreled away into these weird spots all over their house right it's really weird I did you almost not find it before you well I didn't have anything to do with it his children did they when my grandfather died I was over here I think that's when they they started searching the house the people that were living in New Jersey they had it they had a some idea that she was like sure well no no they didn't know she had this she had had an aneurysm and she was sick for a long time because of it and during that time my grandfather took care of her my grandfather took care of her that's when I was staying with him and it was very fascinating time in my life because I had left Boston and I had moved to New York but I couldn't really afford to live in New York I didn't I had hardly any money so I stayed with my grandfather who was living on North ninth Street which was a really bad neighborhood in Newark the next-door neighbor they got a battering ram broke down his fucking door because he was selling crack and he had like an Audi like next door this is fucking Newark New Jersey it's a shitty spot I've shit and my grandfather was taking care of my grandmother it was just me and my grandfather and my grandmother it was like one of the lowest points in my life I just broken up with my girlfriend I had just torn my ACL I knew that I needed surgery I just moved to New York I was completely totally broke and I was you know taking this big risk moving to New York I'd signed with Sussman and I wanted I remember that trying to get my shit together and my grandmother like moans like she's hurt so bad she can't move she had an aneurysm 12 years ago so she's lying in bed like so from the aneurysm on she was in just paint all the time she's done she's done from the aneurysm on they gave her 72 hours to live she lived for 12 years yeah and it wasn't a good 12 years it wasn't good 12 years your grandfather was getting zero action oh I probably did whatever you wanted to see help you're saying mom's exactly what I was saying earlier mama roll it over put that fucking gook Boosh up in the air grandpa's coming in you cannot you can hide the fucking cannolis ha ha ha but you're not hiding that fucking balloon gun the gaku hey she's gonna be here we go whoo shit that fucking got go she could sing oh she got a big fuckin juicy guy who she sing but I'm gonna ma long at the end of it you my MA get on it is that's when you know you're done when you hit the Gaga get on all this broad when I fuckin do you sh inside of her my breath I don't know she's moaning cause of the aneurysm because I'm hitting a gosh you [Music]
