BAM ladies and gentlemen day 27 so Ezra yeah week 27 or podcast 27 the - in a week once yeah that was a crazy week ladies and gentlemen welcome once again to the weekly Ustream podcast really it's been fucking weekly man actually it's 29 we're waiting we're waiting podcast 29 it's amazing that we kept kept with it for this long yeah and it's also amazing I never did anything like this before it is you know it takes me so long to get into a groove with anything it took me so long to accept like email lists and MySpace and all that shit like for the longest time I was like I don't want to get involved in promoting myself fuck that you know fuck advertising shows just get on the radio and just do it like normal but then you see all these other dudes that are doing it that way and they're doing so well with it what happened in your shit I think myspace is the first one that actually went crazy you know like that made you realize the power the internet like fleshlight yeah well the myspace days that was the The Comedy Store days and we were using the when we were using the myspace fucking comic store were sold out like every weekend and it was just because of MySpace which didn't you know before then man you could never have like they would have to drive by and just know that you're there because of the Billboard or just know that you're there because of word-of-mouth but you know we could throw it up on MySpace and it was nothing now or a schoolyard of paper boys going miss that mr. nice - myspace is a fucking dinosaur you know why cuz myspace didn't adapt I logged in last night first time in I think like two months checked went through three or four pages of people that were fake people as needed it talked and stuff like that one new person going hey dude here's my Facebook page add me yeah every now and then I'll go and read a little bit of the fan mail but it's just not worth it it's just it's a graveyard it's like you know it's like going to Chernobyl after the blast and like talking to people they're still there like god man get out of here why are you here well you know using myspace for Patton Oswalt use myspace still though ladies and gentlemen before you go on a podcast is sponsored by the fleshlight I show it every week I don't know if that's like I feel like I want to Barker's beauties I'm supposed to be demonstrating the product but it's what it is is basically a masturbation tool if you haven't used it before we talk about it every week it's fucking fantastic it's far as beating off if you beat off I know you do it's way better than just regular beating off it's not that much money how much the money is across Brian it's like I don't know but you get 15% off your if you go on your way don't know how much at all I think it's like $69 $59 I know the seminar dork I did your tip though this week and it's kind of of course a crazy thing happened every time I do anything with a fleshlight some warm water thing no I put it outside and they let it heat up of course my landlords often go out in the back to smoke and because they work above me and and they see this rubber pussy out in the Sun they saw it out in the Sun oh my god because when I went to pick it up they were sitting out there this if you go to the fleshlight says this website contains explicit adult material what how crazy is it that you go to a website that has rubber pussies and they have this crazy fucking warning you're about to see explicit adult material I mean do they have porn on their site okay they have a guy not even nudity those girls have clothes on there's a guy and a girl in bed but the girl had a bra and panties on and if you're looking at all these flashlights man it's like okay yeah it's a rubber body part is that really like something you need to have a little warning to click through you go to the sites we see violence you know you don't see shit like that yeah why can you just walk into a hustler store without them stopping and telling you the same thing so a lot of hustler stores out there in the world is there there's stories just like it like porn stores that is one of those weird things when we go on the road and we see these these fucking towns like you know like if you go to like what's a good example of one that had a bunch of them Youngstown Ohio I was doing chosen Youngstown Ohio and it's like there's a bunch of those little sad 24-hour neon lit adult shops and that's just that's just people that's just like reluctant body maintenance like poor sad fucks in those places just wandering around looking depressed pushing those beads apart it's like why did I have to use beads beads make fucking noise right when you push those beads apart and they click and you go back into the dirty dirty area and see all the cocksucking videos and shit I used to work at a video store that had an adult room and it was open 24 hours a day and it was kind of cool cuz you'd walk you know somebody walking up like a hot chick and you're like please let them go in the adult room you know of course they just walk up and goes you know where's the designing women' season two you know or something but the craziest thing happened is a an old teacher of mine first grade teacher went in there woman and got porn and I could only hope it was for like a party saw her yes she I waited on her she probably didn't recognize me because I'm you know I was like 20 and she was like you know older lady so this is your first grade teacher yeah first grade teacher Wow and first grade is what seven six six I don't know some of them and because I rang her up I also saw her last name was like Miss ba ba ba and I'm like oh that's totally her anyway she got the that's when I found out that Sylvester Stallone did a porn called the Italian stallion and that's what she had got and so I hope those real porn though I think is one of those like Showtime through 5:00 in the morning porns right so I think that I I thought like oh this is for a gag this for a party I accept this but see I could also see her a whole history and it was like big black dick five you know it was like we only rented porn Wow 68 70 maybe she was 70 that bitch is a freak that's crazy just keeping it alive huh yeah whoo so you don't think that Italian stallion was a report I don't know I never watched it talking out of my ass but I'm pretty sure it wasn't I'm pretty sure it was like some fake 3 o'clock in the morning shit we had at that porn site I saw a chick that I used to date in one of those fake through o'clock in the morning porns or a dude was fake boning her just like to do is just a little too low right like she was like a PI a little too high and you know it's like you tell her their groin is really touching right one of those you know I know it was really freaky I was by myself and I'll slip through the channels and it's like whoa here's here's a person that you know I hadn't seen her Yii is a long time ago so it was like I dated her over you know 12 years ago 13 14 years ago even so seeing her it was like wow this is kind of strange like I'm watching someone that I used to know and then they're fucking in a movie even though it's not real you know what do you think it's like if you like your high school sweetheart turns into like sasha grey or something like that I could take you guys right I know what it's like a fucking it's weird man I don't even like thinking about it no no you don't know what it's like because in your situation the person that if any person we're talking about is an actual real person right these are people that you met when you knew that there did that thing right it's a big thing to have a girl have it be your girlfriend rice is my girl how they see my chick and then there's some fuckin brute just doggystyle in her yeah and sweating and spitting on her and shit uh fucking did you like that he like whoa that guy's fucking the shit out of my ex-girlfriend yeah as well especially real porn yeah I've never found like old porn of like a girl I've dated have you ever done that like you're going through like their old photos and I'm not a Snoopy motherfucker dummy like real wish them I get ups I mean have you ever done that like we're like like they're going through photos like oh this is my old boyfriend oh you don't want to see this photo and then like no but I do I do always um get sad when girls try to make me jealous like I've always been sad like my whole life I've always thought that was like one of the weakest things ever when someone / you can tell the only reason why they're bringing this up or they're talking about their axe is to try to fuck with your head like it never works all that it makes you feel uncomfortable but the uncomfort that I feel is oh you're not as cool as I thought you were and yeah now you're creepy and you're trying to fuck with me okay can I talk you out of this can I tell you that this is not necessary and we're just you know two people that are enjoying each other's company getting to know each other you know we don't have to play any stupid games that we've already played in the past we should all learn right right I played some stupid games when I was a little kid you know I I had to learn that they're dumb so when someone doesn't know that games like that are dumb like jealousy games I'm like fucking really you know come on man what am i fucking child cut the shit so another guy fucked you you that's crazy get out of here I couldn't I can't believe it you're hot and you're 26 and another guy's fucked you already Jesus Christ was this recent was this with the pictures probably sucking somebody's dick an hour before she picked you up you know she's fucking crazy it makes me wonder if that shit ever goes away because it doesn't seem like it is like my mom get in a fight with her boyfriend and you just do stupid shit like yes it goes away for sure it goes away which with maturity everything evolves it's the problem is when people get they go from one shit relationship to the next shit relationship and they never get traction as a human being never get traction and never realize and if you have shit friends on top of that which a lot of girls do man especially pretty girls a lot of pretty girls their friends be hatin you know it's tough man because for them it's like if you're out with a pretty girl if you're a girl and you're out with a pretty girl no one is gonna pay attention to you everyone's gonna pay attention to her and she didn't even do anything to deserve this she was just born this way and you're so much funnier and so much cooler and you'd be so much better girlfriend and you you will get crazy for that bitch and you'll try to trip her up you'll want her to fail you're hope she falls and breaks her fucking nose you know like literally like you're tired she's stealing from you she's stealing male attention from you you know that's how a lot of chicks feel about hot chicks man they don't like it so anything like that man if that's your situation if you around people like that they're douchey to you and you've around ex-boyfriends what do she do you just you can get into a bad grind where you just automatically get douchey first because you think they're gonna get douchey first and you want to get the upper hand you know you ever getting those relationships we can tell if someone's fucking with you just to get the upper hand and oh yeah expecting more oh it's so an inverse is when you go with it to see where where it goes oh the worst for me is if I get involved in it I haven't been working out especially when I was younger dude when I was younger I did not have such a good judgment and I still don't sometimes about when to argue and went to Jessica without fucking my arguing over back down I just argued automatically I'm like you're not gonna stop me from arguing fuck you and it would just turn ugly every time every time I got an argument somebody it would turn ugly but as I got older you know any any kind of relationship like that when shit comes up now I just I try very very hard now to just look at it and go what is the purpose of all this what it shit if you're right who gives a shit if you're wrong who here's what I want I want to be around people that I enjoy talking to and I know there can't really be this many problems that we fight all the time if there's this many problems we fight all the time where is that coming from that's got to be a personality thing because I don't have that many problems in my life my life's pretty smooth most of people my life were very nice most of people in my life we enjoy each other's company the very few doesn't mean everybody has like here and there there'll be issues with any human being or someone sees something totally differently but you can talk it through and if you're really good friends you work it out and everything's cool and nobody ever gets ugly you know but the real key man is find other people that go along with that because as soon as you go with someone who is used to douchey shit and is used to insulting you and is used to playing games as soon as you go into that you dive into that world man you're fucked no progress yeah no fun and it's so hard to get out so and once you get out of it you're so sad because you got out of it yet to get back in it just because it felt so sad from getting out of that well being a lone man when you just got out of a relationship and then also you're alone and lonely those are the darkest emptiest most hollow moments as an adult human being that feelings a terrible terrible feeling most people just aren't equipped to understand rationally what's really going on like why are you so upset how much of this is just evolutionary how much is this it's been designed into the whole human mechanism too dreadful to feel dreadful every time you're left alone to feel terrible every time you rejected you're being rejected by someone you don't even know is brutally painful why is that why is why would you even care if it was a dude who didn't like you if you had no desire to fuck that person if you just came up to a dude and dude was like look at you you don't even good-looking you'd be like what the fuck you faggot you know like you wouldn't care at all it wouldn't change your opinion of yourself at all but when a chick does it - it's like devastating Oh totally especially if it's a chick you're attracted to that's all but it's all evolution it's all set up that way to try to get you to be as attractive as possible and to make very stringent standards that what people find and don't find attraction attractive it's to make you operate at a higher level I think it's all just too designed to make you work harder as a human being to become more impressive as a mate and in doing so and becoming more impressive as a mate you get to contribute more to society you'll create more energy you'll create more money you'll create more whatever you do whether you if you don't technology you'll innovate more if you're an art you produce more art you want to prove your worth and so that that craziness like allows people to shine you know I can't find that girl though you know I can't I can't find that partner was on the same level as me it seems like they always act like the same level but then once you get into it they're just they were just like kind of mimicking what they thought that level is that too but it's also that they want you to be something that you're not it's you know they want you to be and not even a real person you know they have this a lot of people have an idea in their head that's really almost kind of based on movies you know uh what was it like like before the 1800s based on movies totally about it yeah everybody but that's how it is you know you see movies and everything works out fucking awesome in the movies and you go well that's what life is like right life is like this this is my model of life Sandra Bullock movies you get you get trapped in your head thinking well maybe this isn't maybe he's not the one you know maybe there is another one like god damn what is this crazy the what about you are you the one right you're probably not the one you know shove the mic it might be you you know the fucking problem might be you over and over again with everybody it's kind of like like The Fight Club relationship where the whole time it actually is you yeah right well dude I've been that guy I've totally been that guy we start arguments relationships for no reason just because I was frustrated with my own life specially when I was really young like it was like 20 when I was like 20 and 21 I would start stupid arguments with girls I was dating over nothing but it wasn't really them that was the problem it was really me it was really me like being frustrated all the time with my life and trying to like being like hyper ambitious and trying to like get ahead in my life but really terrified that I was going to be a loser so I would you know always be like under stress and if you know anything annoyed me about a check I would like been like why do you even talk like that like what meanwhile that's such a douchey thing to do to take your frustrations out on someone else but when you're doing it when it's when you're wrapped up man especially if that's like every one of your family that's at everyone you're friends with you know that's like the only way you know it takes a long time to learn to not communicate shitty to people if you're stuck and like a shitty communication pattern fuck that's hard to snap out of that very hard very hard to recognize how other people are seeing you like so many people don't think that they come off as assholes they think they're just playing around and everybody's like oh this guy's such a douche get him away from me so we didn't fuck you can't take a joke it's not a joke if I don't think it's funny you know it's not a joke if no one else is laughing but you that's not a joke that's you being a douche bag and laughing about being a douche bag what the fuck Brian how do we fix the world I definitely not alcohol because it sounds like more fake the anti fixture Vegas really taught me a lot about alcohol you know like just just seeing people and alcohol is just weird how close it does terrible things for your judgement I enjoyed myself so much more Saturday night I had water drank water all night we went to that party smoked a little weed it was fun you know the problem with alcohol is everybody else is shrinking too and you wind up getting in stupid conversations over nothing and we got to hang out with Doug Benson and I've never really even talked to him before you know I've seen him a couple times but hanging out with Doug Benson stoned with a couple beers in us fucking hat dance off with him for what two hours meet him me and him were dancing you and that that's why never finds a good dude we really enjoyed hanging out with him he's a real good dude he either really I've done his podcast before you know I've seen him like hearing their clubs I talk to him every now and then but this is the most time I ever spent with him by far we went to dinner with them and you know talked to him a lot he's just cool man really cool and I you know I always questioned how much he really enjoyed pie and I will never question in his pot likeness again he fucking really no question dude that's so funny that stoners Rose doing that legit you know why and I totally fell for something that happens to you every day almost is where you go up to me like dude come on smoke weed my smoke a joint it was like no right but I mean it's also like you know we're hanging out with other comics at 7:00 right so it's a little different but still that happens to me how often every day every time we're out at a club it seems like every time everywhere and like you don't know who these people are like they could have crazy shit in there we'd get you looking on a sit I got a drive home and you know the double rainbow what do you talk about double rainbow look up double rainbow on YouTube every Seekers a dream is not I want to see the rebase oh no no I just I saw about two months so I even watch the whole video I watched like half of the video and I shut it off I get it I get it he's freaking out over rainbow the remix they did the robot voice what you know with the boys and they edit it real quick kind of like auto-tune auto-tune and edit like Tim and Eric style through that auto-tune should catch on what the fuck have you got t-pain on my iPhone do you yeah do you like that stuff it's it's kind of cool just like singing something that you thought of and then just changing the lyrics and next thing you know you could actually make it into a real song they don't if it's like you're going to do that song that Drake song it's over does he use that shit auto-tune because I kind of like that song yeah I think everyone uses Aude it really in the pop industry right now the Popish like Lindsay Lohan should be using pot or the pot OH - Lindsay's gonna do some time now huh yeah 90 day and if you don't know there's gentleman brian says where'd you read this off of i watched it live on CBS live you know they put it on video live courtroom she's gonna do ninety days in jail yes crazy just to turn herself in two weeks unless she suicides but she still has to wear the the bracelet so she can't drink everyday and they made it like a big deal like we want to switch to a blood a blood thing instead of you know the scram and the reason why she wants to do that because if you drink alcohol at midnight like by 4:00 a.m. that's not in your blood anymore and that's why Lindsey wants to do that also it's so funny that it with the thing that really got to me was where the judge like heard Lindsey crying and stuff and the judge finally goes alright you did lied here you lied here you lied here you lied here next case you lied here you like here you went through like like four cases of like seven I don't know if locking someone up in jail is like the best way to deal with this but this should all be a bright example to people a really a prominent example to people how you shouldn't your fucking kids famous how many kids have to become incredibly fucked up from being famous child actors before we look at it and go this is nuts there's no way you should be doing that to a child there's no way you should be the developing as a human being getting your shit together getting your ego together is hard enough as it is but to have that developing getting your shit together and then mix it with Fame dude can you imagine like 10 years from now will Smith's kids going to jump on your back and slicer next three I know he's probably just gonna be sad or her nose Manuel is a really brilliant guy he's a very smart guy he might figure out a way to raise his kid correctly through this but what an incredible fucking chore and what it would have incredible responsibility and the amount of pressure you put on the kid because kids you know they can get spoiled so easy their perspective can get fucked up so quickly they haven't really developed character they and to have a kid really be in a position where he never really has to overcome the same adversity that the rest of us have he just doesn't have the opportunity to develop the character that the rest of we're going to us are going to have the regular people that have to go through life and make their way as an adult and evolve as an adult and be an adult without money where you're in a situation where like wow I got to figure out a way to get through this and you know to not not have any Fame whatsoever you know have to get by on your personality instead of get by and the fact that you're famous when you were six I heard that that the first eight years of your life you learn 88% of what makes you who you are today like the things like from eat from walking all the way to how you react to certain things and the risk is what you have to deal with like you're your RAAM almost right right right yeah I've read some stuff about it up to two years old I didn't read up to eight but it makes sense I mean a lot of who you are as a human being is based on what kind of input you got when your your mind was developing it only makes sense your mind is going to prepare for a certain world you know they say that babies born into an into really high-stress violent families where there's a lot of shouting and yelling and you know too many people like if you're in a really bad neighborhood and you know too many people in your house there's a lot of stress all the time people babies born literally are wired different than Bay born into calm households babies that are born into calm households like the less stress you have the more chilled out the baby can be but if you have like a really really tense mom that kids going to come out just ready to snap that kids going to come out recognizing danger I had this long talk on a plane with Michael Irvin Michael Irvin was on a plane to Australia where we're all going to the UFC he was going there to do some football thing Russell Crowe and I had met him because I did best damn sports show period and he was on it and he said real cool guy man and very down-to-earth normal dude and so he and I were talking and we're just talking about kids getting involved in martial arts and kids getting involved in sports and he was talking about like what he was like when he was young that you know he's trying to like teach kids you know about controlling themselves keep teach kids about keeping their shit together and this was right after that dude that I don't remember the football player but he was chasing after his girlfriend he jumped in the back of her truck and he fell out and died remember that I don't remember a guy's name yeah he was talking about that guy that that guy that would that was not thinking he was just reacting like you don't think you don't do shit like that when you're thinking but these guys aren't thinking they just react and he's trying to teach them how to like put some steps in there to like consider things before you act and recognize that there's a reason why you're so quick to behave like that and that these people these reckless type people are the ones who are always involved in like really strong competitive athletics like fighting and football and shit like that because they're they're so much more quick to react there's so much more explosive that a lot of it is just stress based me to so many fighters are born from shitty households so many yeah I mean it's a lot of prerequisite there's guys from strong families that still are great fighters because they just accept that you know they just love the challenge like George st. Pierre is a perfect example that very close to his dad but a lot of guys come from fucking broken homes man and there's a there's something in that there's something in that the fury is just a little more intense from a dude who grows up without a dad or dude who grows up in like a real shitty situation you know it's a fucking crazy man when you really stop to think about it it's crazy that anybody would want their kid to be famous the Lindsay Lohan thing this should be the last straw yeah well there should be some call no laws about it definitely but I think most of the people that have their kids it's because their their broken dreams and they're using your kids you know - do you think that's it was just a lack of awareness their lack lack of real real consideration you see nobody thinks it's an offensive thing like you know if you if you tell them you know all my daughters uh acting she's in a commercial they go oh good for you nobody ever goes wow what are you doing like why are you putting your kid on TV nobody nobody ever says that nobody ever says it like whoa you're putting you're gonna fuck your kid up you're gonna get your kid famous you know what the odds are if you got your kid famous what are the odds of your kids going to grow up and be a mess so like ninety percent why would you ever I mean yeah there's a few that get through it there okay that Jodie Foster's of the world that seemed to be adjusted but the fucking rare dude what do you do you making him wait the fuck is no I forgot to us video it's making them yeah he forgot did you really forget I thought did I really do something so fucking silly he made the lesbian lick the hand thing yeah I mean what the fuck man you to develop and to think that you're special right from the beginning me Lindsay Lohan was famous from that she was one of those these Disney hookers write so many Disney hookers there is they they breed them they make these little hot little hookers let's count them off who are the Disney hookers Krista Christina Aguilera she a Disney well-liked made it through Timberlake was he cool he got together dude that dude's got it totally down he's really yeah that's super six vessel right cool guy we're still super successful too though there's never a drop-off he's one way to drop office what are the top guys he's a Mariah Carey whatever when they drop off that's when they get nuts right right that's it's hard to rebound and people want to see how far you fall and crash so they kind of support you're driving right you know they turn their energy on wow he's really failing you have to hit rock bottom and then they'll let you come back up again but they you know you have to Britney Spears it you have to fucking just ride that boat right into the rocks now do you think Britney has snapped back or do you think she has just a new person at protects or non-stop you know like I am hired to make sure you don't fuck up ever again I think you don't fix that kind of crazy you don't fix it that shit is not fixable that's that's crazy to the bones man that's just you know knowledge is that she's fucking nuts she's they're not fixing anything that's a real simple case to me case closed they just they're just handling her or they married Brian Austin Green God fuck happen Oh what's-her-face Megan Fox you think she's she's wacky - well she's a fan Austin Green action okay young was she when she got famous she probably is a really cool chick if she married Brian Austin Green yeah right take about that like I said not even right he's not even working that's right let's play was chick ever well either that or Brian Austin Green is like a pimp of unimaginably mouschi up champ here doesn't she have his name tattooed on her yeah I say he's a pimp lady has to be you can hate all you want about watching I'm sorry you know anybody can you know you people out there you want to hate what if that was you no no it's if you're at the Peach Pit which guy would you choose you know peach pit the ones have to take it to some dark dark place this Brian Austin Green fella isn't he like a rapper now does any rap does it really yeah doesn't he I don't know I didn't think you did I think we need to find out right now this is the beautiful this is beautiful what a beautiful time to be alive and the internet if you have a question you just throw that bitch into Google so simple Brian Austin Green rapping we are about to find out ladies and gentlemen we don't have to go to the fucking library we don't have to you know go to a college and meet some experts Oh Brian accent okay that was on TV that wasn't you no see that's what I think it is I think it's I think it's just uh the key had a little into his wiki this was like a moment in rap history as that's around the same time his character on 902 100 David silver started rapping hmm among his lyrical stylings you're so precious to me am i precious to you the answer Brian is yes okay that was so pointless we missed the very beginning of it still point I think it didn't have his rapping I mean they had some of his lyrics I think they're just saying that he was a rapper but it was wack but we can't play it because then we'll have to pay him or something oh really you know something like that I was on vh1 well they were also saying that he's wack I mean they quoted his lyrics and that's pretty wack that sucks that's just like those lyrics were so whacked like you don't even have to pass a judgement on you just playing for people and raise your eyebrows and go hmm like you ever see that movie Jesus camp uh yeah crazy crazy fucking moving and the best part about the movie is they didn't cast any judgment they just showed you these nutty motherfuckers that are out there raising kids to be Christian jihadists you know you don't have to you don't have to cast anything and the people are so nutty that they'll approve it you could show them the fucking video and they would they would they would say yep that's our that's our message you got our message down sir that's a good documentary meanwhile anybody who saw that thing it was like a fucking horror movie taking little kids and the best part is when they make them talking tongues did you see that part they would say everyone now talking tongues so the kids would go sha lalalalalalalala it's like God talking through them in tongues it's hilarious they're five years old man five years old it's nonsense they love nonsense five years old loves to talk nonsense all five-year-old kids do so you give them like a time of the day at school all right kids time to go nonsense so they just go for fantasy ha ha and then tuck it in this made-up language and it's obviously not a fucking language because it's you're not saying anything like you I can tell what I'm listening to someone talk even if they have a foreign language I could tell if it's a real language you know you hear someone talking in like in Chinese like they're saying a bunch of crazy shit but there's a flow to it where you know they're not saying the same sounds over and over and over and over again which is what you do because you have to invent all these sounds on the fly if you're making a fake language like to have them very to the point where it looks like it's like an actual like language that's difficult so you start going Shamala by lemma which is what they all do they're all uncreated fucks and they're talking in tongues and they're just making nonsense noises that's all they're doing man and they're getting little kids to do this shit and they're telling these kids that you know you know you're you're warriors for Christ and that there's this one it was comparing them to how you know Hamas and all these terrorist organizations raise little jihadists she was literally comparing them she's comparing them like why don't we do that with Christianity like this would be a good thing there is one of these people willing to blow themselves up is because they indoctrinated them into the world of radical Islam we can do the same thing but for good she's like but we're good not seeing the other irony you know in the you know brainwashing kid she's talking well they're getting brainwashed with the wrong thing but if we bring wash our kids with the truth and Jesus and like whoa general lot of raised kids I had two guys knock on my door today that we're both my age dressed up in the white shirts and the ties and stuff like that is that a Scientology or a Mormon that's a Mormon right no I just I laugh women's are some of the nicest fucking people I have to tell might be but are so nice I can't stop laughing at them you know it's like it's ridiculous it's completely ridiculous the whole look it's all ridiculous though it's not that you know being a Muslim isn't ridiculous but being a Jew is everything's ridiculous being a Catholics ridiculous being a product is ridiculous being a Baptistery being a Buddhist is ridiculous being in anything is ridiculous you're a fucking human being and if you touch you attach yourself your mind to any ideology you're going to be on a road and that road may or may not lead you in a good direction but you're going to stay on that fucking road if you're attached to an ideology and it could be a terrible road it could be a road of you know circumcise your daughter's clitoris because that's a fucking tradition I mean these fucking crazy bitches in Africa that cut holes in their lip and stretch them out to put plates on why is that because they got on a fucking road and they stick they stuck with that road regardless of rational thinking they didn't use rational thinking at all they're just adapted a predetermined pattern of behavior that makes life so much more simple and that's what every fucking religion is the problem is no one knows you cannot know you can have your own beautiful personal experiences you could have been the person that was actually touched by God but when you start yelling and ranting that other people have to follow your lead or the fucking world's going to end and Christian is going to be taken away I know you're full of shit I know you're full of shit and you know you're full of shit and the real problem is that we can't say it because everybody's got this freedom of religion freedom of religion religious freedom the freedom to express yourself even if you're expressing yourself with nonsense nonsense that helps scared lonely sad people lock on to that nonsense so they feel like they're a part of something I mean that's what it is it preys on people whose lives fucking suck so it's all nuts it's not like your shits cool at Marsh it's not and it's not that you know yoga is the answer or fucking mushrooms or the answer there's there's just questions and until we're honest about that we're never going to evolve the human race is stuck in a giant quagmire when it comes to our behavior and our thinking about our behavior yeah totally and I you know in one thing is that they look like from the Geek Squad these are these Mormon guys their content speeds can you imagine though if they just like mixed it up and like showed up with like you know hairy chests and necklace isn't like rave clothes on and sunglasses how scary that would be if the Mormons came to your house like they started rocking it yeah I like they wanna tip Legos yeah pull up in like a you know what says new Chevy's ever ever yeah man I don't I don't think the world's ready for like a hip religion yet there was like some work they were doing with rock and roll churches remember yeah yeah they still have those and did they have them yeah that is still popular and wholly popular my name is a daughter else in it there was a girl that used to work at fear factor she's a very nice girl and she was you know trying to fireplace and she started going to a rock'n'roll church saying how much I would really love this rock-and-roll Church even though this guy's talking about God he's really all just about being positive and that's the vehicle that he uses for a lot of people man religion can give you some inspiration but there comes a certain point in time what you have to pop the training wheels off and you have to recognize that all this morality that you've developed is good because it's good to treat other people good it's good to treat other people the way you would like to be treated yourself it's like a fucking golden rule and there's a reason for it and that reason is that we're connected in some strange way that we don't totally understand unless you are good to other people around you unless you are kind and friendly and warm and loving you're not going to fucking enjoy this life you're just not you're going to be problems everywhere you go you're going to have problems everywhere you go you got to figure out a way to enjoy this fucking life it's not because of Jesus it's not because of Moses it's not because of anybody that may or may not have ever existed it's because that's how you fit in better in the world that's how you stay positive and it doesn't have to be some shit that was written 5,000 years ago on fucking animal skins that doesn't have to be the Golden Rule because it's old you know that's dumb we need to figure out like now today what what is you know the best way to live your life what is that you know there's got to be ways you can be putting forward the most positive energy I mean we know objectively what's causing pollution we know objectively what's causing birth defects and you know and what are we're taking you too much chemicals and not enough vitamins we know objectively all this stuff we know how to organize our world and yet we don't do it we know how to organize our health and yet very few people do it we know all these things the right path to like being like a happy healthy person is to do all the shit that we already know you're supposed to do take care of your body take care of your health take care of your mind your stress meditate be kind to people we all know that you ask anybody they know how to get by and to be the the most evolved version of you that you can be I mean it's not like a magical checklist if you talk to people about it you said okay here you got a person you want to improve them what are the things you're going to do to them okay well if I was a life coach the first thing I would say is this guy's got to get on a diet that makes them healthy I don't mean a diet just to lose weight I mean just healthy foods in your body many many vegetables vegetables a lot of good good quality protein a lot of water stop the sodas stop the bullshit start working out your body and get a better sense of like how this machine feels when it's moving it's flowing better there's less tension in it your mind feels like relaxed and you enjoy every single moment of the day better step one everybody knows that step right what's step two be cool to people be nice to as many people as you can smile them as many people as you can have them smile back at you tip well when you go to restaurants just do the most you can be as as you can you know and just still manage to have people walk all over you just get through this life as nice as you can what else do what you want to do with your life right don't don't go be doing something you don't enjoy don't do something that's don't get locked into you know a car that you can't afford and doing something crazy because you need the money don't don't do that do what you want to do do what the fuck is it that you really want to do because if someone else is doing it you can do it you know I mean everybody makes their own path through this world but a lot of people don't follow the path that they really fucking feel pulled to you know theirs for whatever reason they got negative programming you know when they were kids someone told them that couldn't do it or told them to take the shortcut or or take the the shore route that's a sad thing man when you talk to dudes especially like talented dudes and they don't follow up with what they want to do you know not about like that I don't know but I was just thinking to your list that I think you should never stop tickling people and I don't know why and it's looked down upon because I enjoy my people laugh in all don't you including to forcing them to laugh I don't like people to learn why you ticklish yeah ticklish yeah I think tickle you know do you know we're ticklish this is an interesting subject you know where this comes from well now it's an evolutionary trait and it's from being freaked out instantly and immediately about spiders and insects crawling on you really you're sleeping on the ground yeah because if you're sleeping on the ground and sometimes you fucking move like that that's what ticklish is you're trying to avoid these instant reactions to these weird sensitive areas our body especially things where things can crawl like under your armpits you touch my armpit I'll jump through the fucking roof I've fucking but that's what it is you know I'm saying it's like this is all it's an evolutionary thing it's not another ham makes sense of course why else would you have this extreme reaction on the bottom of your feet I am single not ticklish at all though I mean like because the ropes and they're supposed to die because you know I dated this girl that I even went to there what unit that the world you have your answer she's willing to date you so you know that fucked up all right that's a B um she's she's ready to be bitten by a spider right I always go for the butthole as the last move though like if you're not ticklish you're a ticklish in the bubble and then I usually gets them you ever watch a porno where a girl's got a rubber butthole and you're like this is ridiculous how is this chick taking this the ass skin right found in the ass yeah how do they do that I don't know but I'm you seen The Belladonna one yeah dude she's crazy and so it talked about them the podcast before we we looked it up and then we found out there was like we looked up baseball bat porn because we thought it would only be the one belladonna video no it's like a bunch of videos of chicks with bats up her ass I think it's once a girl puts a bat up her ass then the other porn guys leave they come to the other chicks and go see look she's willing to do it well you don't want to do it you don't work you just can add it to your resume that's an eye connector job that you would get that you know you wouldn't have got before you know to dark roads on it's kind of weird I would like to see like the resumes of some of these girls like we'll do baseball bats Oh donkey ass here's a fucking funny story there was a dude that was uh friends with a friend of mine I didn't know the guy that well but he was dating a porno star and he was like trying to be cool with it because he didn't have any money and she was you know paying the bills and shit he was I think he was a musician and she came home with a contract and he was just you know it's just sex man it's no big deal yeah I'm a lot of fuck other girls I'm on the road too you know we're just open it's no big deal and she doesn't fuck any of those guys when she's not working with them you know the whole deal he had this whole rationalization thing and then he got a contract and he's going over the contract and he goes what's this what's this what's this airtight what does that mean and she goes airtight it's one of my mouth one of my asshole one of my pussy and he goes this relationships over that's it he just fucking threw the towel right that in there he's like what what what what what at the same time one in your asshole one year and they have a name for it okay and you're about to go airtight and yeah God done that's it put a fucking fork in it hooker go triple rainbow dam first of all you know any girl that would let you do that any girl whoa any girl that wants to do that and any girl that is in a relationship with a man is like cool with her doing that you got a whole lot of problems there was this girl who was uh there's this guy I'm not I uh salami was his name Stewie I think lives see I don't know cool dude he was a porn producer didn't like it got out of it he said the whole business just fucked up it's all crazy and everyone's a mess and he just wants to be a healthier person so now he's teaching jiu-jitsu super nice guy so anyway um he tells us hey man come come see me we're we're doing a porno shoot come come watch it it's pretty fun so I was with Tate and we're like alright fuck it we'll go we just got back from the road we just landed from some gig and this one Tate was staying with me so before we went to my house we just drove to this guy's fucking porno shoot me right out of the airport right we walk in the door walk in the door and there's this one guy with guns tattooed on his body he's got like guns like yeah one of those dudes and then the other guy is just this regular muscle looking dude and they are ruining this bitch they're ruining her one guy is pounding her asshole with his dick and one guy is fucking her mouth and every couple seconds they pull her off off the dick and spit in her mouth so this girl goes to this terrible day of all this spitting fucking around so fucking a pussy and then when it's all over she goes into the shower and she wants everyone to piss in her mouth so these porno starts start peeing in her mouth and she sits there with her mouth open and then that she wants a director do it you get over here so the director goes over and he pees in her mouth and I am watching this whole thing I'm like this might be the saddest shit I've ever seen in my life this girl is on her knees in the shower okay the water is pouring all over her she's totally wet she's been pounded in the asshole in the mouth all day two dudes have taken turns spitting in her mouth of three dudes cuz the director did it too he's spitting them out to everybody was spent in her mouth and now she's on her knees and there's a dude pissing in her mouth and they're filming it and I'm like wow so then she goes my boyfriend's gonna pick me up at blob you know four or something like done and we're like your boyfriend oh man bloody dick and I didn't want to talk to her I didn't wanna be mean I didn't want to be judgmental I didn't want to say anything I introduced myself hi Joe nice to meet you I'm gonna watch it fuck thank you please me my friend Tate here we're gonna sit and watch you get fucked so we were sitting like maybe fucking 10 feet away from this standing standing like maybe 10 feet away why this these two dudes were piled on this chick and then these guys peed in this girl's mouth and then she starts talking about her boy was your boyfriend - he's a cook so like a sort order cook at some like Denny's or some shit like that and uh you know and I go is your is your husband cool with all this yeah he's cool it long as I keep bringing up checks he's cool with it and so take OHS does he allowed to fuck anybody else she was he better not I'll fucking kill him oh my god whoa he better not I'll fucking kill him like what did I just watch this is just this might be the nuttiest fucking scene I've ever been a part of in my whole life like this is so strange that's awful you remember her name like our name or anything no idea I wouldn't remember her face or name anything I've never seen her before again there's so many of them dude there's so much porn going on out here there's so many dudes that I know I know so many guys from jujitsu Tyler night I know him he's a porn dude very cool guy he's got a really awesome blog too he writes about gangbang scenes and shit like that and Jake steed he's training Machado's and then there was another do that you should train the Machado's TT boy and then John the four that's his real name I'm not supposed to Vince VII Vince for is another fucking male porn star there's like a gang of a man there's like all these porn guys there's so many so much porn going on out here it's ridiculous they're all girls come out here with like you know whatever issues and you know looking for a dream and a lot of them it doesn't work out and next thing you know they're doing porn and then his girls that just I've always wanted to get into porn and then they just fucking like Sasha Grey type chicks they come here when they're 18 like good to go ready to suck dick on film mm-hmm whoo it's kind of depressing actually but it makes you know the grocery store 2:00 a.m. a lot better you know because you're just walking around there's some porn chick wasted try and get cantaloupes it's way worse when you have kids dude and I'm bad yeah I have a hard time beating off to porn these days yeah I have to like shut off the compassionate part of my brain really yeah compassionate part of my brain months ago okay what if this is my daughter with you know my daughter was doing this and guys were holding her eyelids open and jizzing in her eyeball you know I've watched out the other day and I'm like what the fuck is someone's baby someone's a little baby girl you know someone's fucking her mouth like that maybe she likes it you know some cells do like that so you can't can't say always that it's terrible but you know for a chance azar if you're getting pounded in a porno film that's not really what you want to be doing you should try to figure out something else that you can masturbate to like start like getting attracted to something out that is exciting someone's going to come up with anime porn yeah just go with some fucking awesome CGI you know use the quake 4 engine yeah you know once it gets to the point where pornography can be artificially created then it'll be way better it's Karma free porn today's the day that Doc's set the time machine to go back to and back to the future really yeah Wow that's hilarious yeah how do you know that somebody tweeted it earlier today I didn't research it so it might be fake could you imagine if they really do invent a time machine one day because the real thing about time machines that people aren't aware of there's like scientists that actually try to like study time-travel whether or not there's a guy's and fucking awesome story his name is Ronald Mallett dr. Ronald Mallett I believe from Connecticut see if he Google that shit see if that's his name but anyway the guy has a fantastic story he's he's like the leading scientist when it comes to theoretical models for time-travel always the thing Ronald Mallett from I believe University of Connecticut and he he has like a working model yet is Ronald Mallett he has a working model of mal le TT or one one tier two T's tt who else Ronald mal le TT look him up on Google e there's some videos about him but his dad died it's a crazy story his dad died when he was a kid and he was so hurt he loved his father there's old photos of him and his father and his father smile and he smile and he was so close to his father when his father died it crushed him and so he dedicated his life to creating a time machine he dedicated his life to creating a time machine so that he could go back in time and save his father so his father would be with him again so that was the entire focus of his life and he got to a certain point where he realized that you can some day it is possible to travel back in time but it's not something that you're going to be able to go back to any point in history you're only going to be able to go back in time to the moment that the first time machine was invented so what would be able to be possible is you'll be able to the moment there is a time machine invented you'll that day from that day on you'll be able to go to any point in history that you want so you can go to you know assuming the human beings around you know assuming though the world hasn't been hit by another planet or some crazy shit you'll be able to go to you know 1 million years from now let's see what the world looks like 1 million years from now because there will be time machines functional back then or in this a year but the problem is then this is the this you know is all theoretical but the problem is that any moment in time could also go back to the moment the first time she was invented so if you can travel back in time from any moment in time that's like millions of years in fact infinite if people are still alive of time of years of people going back to the moment of the first time machine being invented so it's literally like the whole notion of time gets broken you know there's no there's no like real future it all kind of happens all at once so literally fucks with the entire fabric of the universe everything can come back to the moment that the first time machine was invented it like breaks everything so this is like real shit they're working on like this this guy is like really convinced that this is a possible thing that's craziness beyond isn't here's something else I Back to the Future 3 if you look at the very end of the movie when docs has his kids and he's like telling like CMIT everything is gonna be good you know look at one of the kids the kid starts going like this like come here or put something in my hand at any points to his dick what it is so ridiculous and just got snuck through somehow it snuck through but I'm talking about like a six year old do people were so stupid back then they didn't even know yeah so you could find YouTube like Back to the Future three points to package is that one of those movies that you go watch it today and it would disappoint the shit out of ya yeah not so good not so good I mean I saw the first one the other day and it was okay but then I saw the third one it was just so dumb I didn't want to watch it yeah man the evolution of movies has been pretty fucking pretty obvious well the evolution of what we accept you know yeah like people talk about avatar being silly and ridiculous but still you see Toy Story 3 yet no I heard it's awesome is it yeah those deaths all that animation stuff just freaks me the fuck out I was reading and wired there's some insane amount of time for like every frame for as far as like rendering some like seven-hour fucking time for each frame to render is that insane which movie doe this can't be a Pixar man oh really yeah that's crazy hmm bit illegal that seems like it would be better than I could go into the living room and go get that a that magazine but I don't know exactly where it is and I want to get up but the idea is that it's still even in to this day it's very difficult to do the whole even if my time frame is wrong the whole why don't you look under wired Pixar Pixar not pixel but it's it's still not quite there yet as far as like the technology that's that's going to exist one day where you can create instant artificial people you know you remember like the editing that you're doing right now just with Final Cut you know I'm just doing on a regular home computer an apple I mean that this is the kind of shit that ten years ago is like fucking dreaming right now you're dreaming bitch like you know what you're going to be able to edit and and how fast is it going to render you know push it together it's that easy 20 years ago science fiction right 20 years ago science fiction 30 years ago super crazy science fiction that's like ridiculous you're taught you're talking about something that's just like people would look at in the movies and go wow you know like Minority Report type shit yeah but they make it look like you can do it now but it really it's not gonna exist for another hundred years or so what did you say how many hours I think they said 7:00 yet that's what they just seven hours right at seven hours here seven hours per pixel yeah yeah what the fuck man and nights like this that's like a supercomputer - right don't think he's like a so I'm sure they use yeah a huge cloud of computers definitely that's ridiculous those movies took a lot of fucking time but goddamn they're cool as fuck so seven seven hours now so in ten years that means we could do Pixar movies on our phone oh yeah yeah that's inevitable right it's gonna be awesome hey dude check out Toy Story 80 huh if they don't break the universe before then add all right that's my latest theory the human beings create the Big Bang I've been talking about on that stage I think that's what we're doing I think that's what I think that's why the big I think 14 14 billion years ago plus was the Big Bang I think was a lonely dude in his basement figured out a way to break the universe and he had a switch and he wanted to see what happened they clicked it and the whole thing to enjoy yeah I think that's what happens and then and then you know people get curious and we developed to a certain point in time where we repeat the process isn't that possible I mean nobody knows what the fuck created the Big Bang right but when you see scientists working on shit like the Large Hadron Collider Large Hadron Collider is this crazy experiment that they're participating right now in Europe where they've got this 22 kilometer long machine and it spins these atoms around and collides them it's just just slightly slower than the speed of light and they're trying to recreate a thing called the Higgs boson particle now they believe there's actually five different Higgs boson particles or trying to figure out like what what existed they call the god particle for lack of a better word and it's what existed just a millisecond you know a fraction of a millisecond even right after the Big Bang so when they get that when they figure out how to do that and if they do recreate the Higgs boss and if they do really you know find out it's not just a theoretical particle but it's real when they do that they're not going to stop there but I have to stop there they're going to keep going they're going out what's the next thing this is they got 10,000 scientists working on that this is the biggest project in scientific history and it has nothing to do with making our lives better technology at one point in time was all about making your life better technology was about you know hey we need to get water and we don't want to you know just have to drink it out of the river every time we we need to get it and bring it back to camp what do we do we figured out how to make a jug you know I mean that's technology technology today the shit like the Higgs boson particle shit like the Large Hadron Collider shit like making time machines like what are you doing like cooking what the fuck are you doing you're not fixing the hole in the ground in the Gulf that's making the oil pull up shouldn't we pull all the scientists off everything and go okay we got to fix this before the whole ocean gets poisoned i've always wondered why they don't do that anyway so with cancer this is anything I just like all right all you guys we're going to you know take all the senses at once to cancer one year do it yeah yes you know these guys aren't experts in their fields obviously you mean I can't know everything about everything it's a silly concept I mean what I'm saying but it would be great if they took all the top scientists from all the different disciplines that would be involved and they immediately allocated funds to get them to work on the project instantly and just the government stuff I mean I'm not in favor of the government stepping in but in this case I would say this is not just a natural disaster this is a fucking catastrophic disaster where apocalyptic disaster where they need to step in and do something about this immediately they need to like impose like almost like a martial law like type of a thing take over the whole you know but then again who's going to be good that's doing that for the government the government would have to involve the private sector and then the private sector would try to make a lot of money from it and try to fuck people over and it would be a big scandal would be like Halliburton and they'd find out billions dollars are missing from the you know whenever my fucking idea sucks you see that baby in China it was born with a second food I did and I didn't want to look I saw it and I shut it off that should depresses the fuck up it's it's pretty amazing now it's I mean it's just second face it kind of looks like what is that movie Phantom of the Opera or whatever but it's I mean did you did it say if they're going to be able to fix the kid I'm going to do it are doing the presses the shit out of me just like the one that I saw the other day where there's a baby that was born it was like a fish baby and like that the skin had this very strange disease that shit so depressing to me man you know fucked at Birth yeah and especially man it's depressing when you find out that it's due to birth defects because of chemicals people that worked at factories and people that were given chemicals they should have been given while they were pregnant man China China is a tricky place right now man China has some of the most polluted cities in the world have you ever seen the videos on there you're seeing what is that the same where they're dropping on like all old computers and cell phones are all going there is that China laterally no do they go to China yeah does somewhere they go and it's just cities that are like kind of like was that wall-e movie where it's cities of just old computers and stuff like yeah let's find out where they go what's final because I never heard of that before right no but I do know that you know China has terrible beluche pollution problems there was one city where they showed it was it a VBS TV dock some dock that I watched on the most polluted city in the world and just one day in the city just just breathing the air is like smoking three packs of cigarettes a day Wow so every fucking day you're there you're smoking three packs of cigarettes a day that the sky was brown man it was crazy like you couldn't see shit like it will it took smog to a knock LA's nasty dude when you come over like when you're coming from the valley and you come over that Hill and you see everything brown and you can't even see the fucking mountains outside of like Pasadena you can't see the mountains and you look at it you go what the fuck are we doing to the air that ain't shit compared to China right China's five times worse than that it is the nuttiest shit you've ever seen in your life they I don't know what kind of laws they have I don't know how they get away with shit like that but the factories just pump shit out what is this so we have a photo you found the dangers of old computers as a computer wasteland does it say what country China China meaning Gary China is about this mess in remember ah yeah I mean everybody keeps going off about how great the economy is in China and China's you know becoming like a capitalist economy and you know Chinese people you know the whole countries it's changing and flourishing and we owe america owes China so much then you look at what China is really doing like Khan cam you know or a Foxconn rather write is done the name of the company Foxconn Foxconn is where all those guys who are working for Apple keep killing themselves they help make our iPhone speaking of how do you like your new iPhone I had a new one yeah okay how to get a new one what happened it wouldn't accept the SIM card kept saying my I didn't have a SIM card oh yeah crazy I don't know what happened I just kept doing it kept saying no SIM card no SIM card and so finally eventually out of bring it back to him yeah said you want to see live me going from three bars to zero service oh okay this is the thing where if you touch the bottom it says it does something there's a show it okay if you don't know nobody can see this man this fucking web camera sucks okay at least you have a couple bars right well just just do it and tell us what's happened yeah it's going it's going from I just went to three it was on four actually it's now a - oh wow and it's now going to go to one any second now so just slowly drops yeah you know what Apple says they say that it's an error in the phones while drop down to one that's great it's going to go to no service now they say that it's an error in the phone's computing and that it is it's not an error how saying it's just in searching it Wow okay let it go now and then he'll go back up and so apple's trying to say that it's not a real problem they're trying to say that what you're getting is just a more accurate representation of the signals Wow now let's go to signal yeah which is whack that doesn't make any saying what this thing is like if this is wrong if you don't have three bars right now you actually have one bar and covering up the antenna will make you go down it's so stupid it's a stupid thing to say because okay so you're saying that the phone just calculates the bars incorrectly and really when you touch it a certain way then it calculates them right what do you what is that the truth button the fuck are you talking about you have you have a button and it's a part of the phone and if you touch it it tells it makes the phone honest with you that's stupid that's a hardware problem you cocksucker right it doesn't deal with the case which which is good because I never use me I found without eyes anyway you get signal here man yeah you should get so yeah I got and when you had no signal that's not normal right but what problem is is what are they going to really do about it is this software update just going to make all that everyone that just not happened you're just going to always have lower signal than normal I don't know I I don't buy it somebody just made up a wack excuse right because if they did make up a wack excuse they would have had to have some massive fucking recall yeah he would have gone nuts there's class-action lawsuit in the works yeah but they said it's it does it on the 3g and yeah you know there's yes but I tried all my 3GS I couldn't do it real good choice Biddy bottom line though try don't hop oh really yeah I couldn't do it maybe they broke theirs or something maybe maybe there's older models yeah no man it's a stupid way to deal with the issue they'll tell people they have to buy a bumper especially when you're selling bumpers for 30 bucks which is kind of douchey in and of itself yeah you know yeah why how come if I drop it it's fucked right so you let that bad so you give me this little thing to put around it oh how much is this little thing thirty bucks this is 30 bucks right and only Apple makes it and it should've came with it fucking you got a blackberry the other day it came with a leather case I can't get a little piece of rubber I know you know so I went to a Best Buy and I bought two of the only cases that Best Buy sells you know that covered the back run so the first one I put on it was so tight and poorly made adding was Belkin that the top button just automatically was always pushed down so it was just resetting my phone over and over so I had a second one that was going to give to you and I opened that one and tried it again same thing went online found out that's the problem with the case so then I bought this other one from Griffith that had a plastic back to it and every time you took a photo it would flash and hit the plastic and flash back into the camera and every photo look like shit oh I went back online same exact thing across the board so the only case we can get right now is this one that will protect the pinna fix that how do you think I have cases for an iPhone come on Apple where's what all right so if I break this you're gonna replace the back because there's no other fucking case what and what is the deal with this this glass on the back why do you have glass on the reception issues but that means look at what it is yeah it's what's supposed to be for its but suppose be for a better reception wow it mean come on you're carrying a piece of glass in your pocket what are the odds that thing's gonna break and stab me fucking like you cut your dick right for the first person to sit on the back of their phone and ghettoes up their ass oh and they die what do you think a month to imagine that that's how he died yes got an iphone it went up your ass and that killed you yeah what was that guy that used to shut on 30 ways to die or whatever 99 ways to die he put glass things up his ass and sat on them remember he had like this fetish of putting it oh whatever who has a bad suit at one of those episodes yeah really yeah that shows disturbing fuck I like that all the way at different people who died spikes doing good with their shows that's an old one yeah that's a good short attention span show you just slip in and you know any time you flip it through the channels and they'll start like a real kind of like a what's the word just a hokey sort of a reenactment you know where it's this like a certain amount of humor to it you know they know they're going to show you a fucked up place and what I died yeah it's kind of creepy alot so bright it's interesting to me because then I think about all these have that extra fight every time you know I want to shove something up my ass I know I might die for me you know you know you don't mean oh I dunno I dunno it's a hard edge to resist shoving things up your ass sometimes just overcomes you or or just crossing the street with my eyes closed you know whatever you seen or you showed me one guy one cup didn't you somebody did one guy one cup I think you showed it to me man I don't look for those things anymore that was the one where the guy put a jar up his asshole right and then he sat down and his asshole crushed the jar and chunks of glass and blood start falling out of this guy's body and he doesn't even freak out that's the most disturbing part herb you know I still don't know if I believe everything anymore oh I believe that one I don't know if that's a fake glass even more that guy if that's not fake someone needs a goddamn Academy Award to be Annie pan Olympics with fake no it's not yeah a lot of those not fake no it is all fake people say it's fake I don't believe in that that knows the most about I have it on my side parts of that were real wasn't that one more wasn't one of them the ger cut his finger off huh was not to be any no no no limpet over there just chopping their balls off and stuff like that we to me man they're all the same tear and that's sad why is it yeah they're all the other violence our videos go together I know there's one where guy cut his finger off where it's absolutely real yeah I'm sure that might be real there's fucking crazy peace guy with the jar up his assholes rail dude it's really pretty pretty obvious it's real you believe didn't know we landed on the minute it don't just nasty I don't know what the fuck happened that dude when he was a kid it made him want to shove bottles up his asshole I have a crush inside of them and then drop out and what happened what is it Lindsay Lohan's your mom do you think that will do it yeah fuck yeah imagine Lindsay Lohan is your mom and fucking the dude from jackass steve-o as your dad do you think she can get pregnant uh now she's probably so good but like you said that you we just saw that she was 24 yeah I thought for sure she was like over 30 I forgot all about Gina right yeah I don't know I wonder if I could hard action man that chicks out there doing it every night yeah you'd want to told me that she got a tooth pulled just so she could get back on vicodin well shit supposedly when she got that scram bracelet on or whatever it's called that she immediately had a dentist appointment like the next day that was supposedly priorly you know uh prior to this whatever and she had like a tooth pulled or she had something that she had done but it was like oh now she's allowed to have vicodin that's really that's nice for her so the so she's got this crazy bracelet on so she has to stay sober and the dentist gives her like it first of all she don't need to give fucking vicodin I've had teeth pulled I've had shit happen right you just deal with it it's not that bad I have a knee surgery they take pain medication I took vicodin when I had my first ACL reconstruction it made me feel so stupid it just made me feel so dumb and I sold them some do to the pool hall student named Jeff you did not do that yesterday so don't sell them I sold them to my let Jeff and Jeff sold them all throughout the pool people gobble those vicodins up love them I had a friend who was a guitarist used to say that it made him more creative what that's the opposite effect it does to me to me it makes me feel fucking useless and dumb that's all it does yeah but I think everybody's brain is working working differently man I mean slightly I think we all have different levels of different chemicals and different you know his music was probably fucking retarded then well not he was uh no he was a classical guitarist he was really good he was um like you know he went like competitions shit it was fucking bad-ass worst song ever competition no man he would play songs that already existed you know like Spanish our Inca songs that kind of shit he was just he's a brilliant guitarist and he said we take vicodins it would make him more creative I don't know but you know everybody's brains he's a fucking crazy dude who was a former Taekwondo champion my friend Dmitri and he was a big fuckin burly manly giant dude from the Ukraine you know as family's a bunch of fucking savages bunch of Russian fucking animals and maybe the Vicodin just helped calm his inner monkey enough so that he could you know he could tune into his creative you know yeah everyone's different right this this dude's the only dude that I've ever talked to that said vicodins made him creative that's that could easily been it you know everybody's got their own fucking thing man I mean how many people you come across where you go this guy's just broken his brains just not wired right his body's not wired right he just got the wrong levels of all kinds of shit when he was in the womb mm-hmm totally poor Lindsay that's our message for Lindsay hang in there girl you could you are going to get out three months and I think that's when little Wayne gets out too and you get together and make a fucking bad-ass CD how about that his Brock says put some underwear on how about if Lindsay starts fucking rapping while she's in the in the pokey and comes out like some badass bitch rapper she's gonna get fucking laid so much it's probably she's probably in jail yeah she's probably just gonna fuck her in jail chicks dude she's not heaven she's gonna come out with us man hell yeah she is how do you know those what she stood date Samantha Ron Ronson or whatever those names alone really sweet DJ you know DJs I know Sam I know one DJ I don't know why I know because was talks about that guy tiesto Craig burr sorry one of the dudes who works with UFC I think he was one was telling me about this the guy sells out these gigantic fucking stadiums might have been Craig I'm not sure but he's like this huge huge huge fucking DJ where he sells out like just gigantic events all over the world man they come to see this guy dude DJ and he makes his own like electronic music it's huge I love it but how do you know how do you find out about these guys I used to do my space but now Penn Pandora Pandora yeah just put in more myspace if you want to start off slow just put in Fat Boy slim and then make it radio station based off that or something like that and yeah we talked about this Pandora's pretty badass yeah I like the idea creating your own radio station mm-hmm good stuff so Brock Brock Lesnar and Shane Carwin that was crazy Brian was there yeah unemployed the one I'm so glad they just a nice man oh yeah Brock is one of those people that they don't have to worry about stopping it's gonna take a few trains and to really stop the guy some blabbering you know I mean you know trains to the head but I mean that he they didn't stop it so I was happy I was just I was so scared they're gonna stop it yeah well you know it looked like the rest stop it I mean he was just covering up and Shankar was bombing on them and props to referee Josh Rosenthal because it wasn't for Josh Rosenthal that you know someone easily could have pulled the trigger earlier right now there's a few guys that I wouldn't have trusted in that situation but Josh saw that he was okay he's gonna get through and he saw the chains punches were coming slower and slower and Shane unfortunately just blew his wad he you know he had an adrenaline dump I'm sure the excitement of the fact that he had the champ hurt on his back and that he was on top and he's like this is over this fucking thing's over and he's proud of a pound of a pound and then also has like fuck there's two minutes left to go in this round you know and then he's got to keep going and by the end of those two minutes there was nothing left he got back to his corner and literally could barely get up his legs were barely walking and then he was fucked he said is he's like seized up and he said he just went out there and he tried to do whatever he could but his body just was not responding he just completely adrenaline dumped and completely blew out all of his energy but goddamn does he hit him hard before that holy shit that fucking Shane Carwin can punch he hit so hard he's so big but I think he's too big I think maybe like his he he had to lose like 17 pounds to make 265 so he's you know walking in like I'd like somewhere around 280 ish you know on the day of the fight so I think that might be too big for his frame you know I think maybe he might be better off if he was like 250 you know just a little lighter but with more endurance his punches are still going to be ridiculously powerful nobody could stand up to the way that guy hits his punches will still be ridiculously powerful but he'll have a little bit more cardio you know Brock is just physically a bigger guy man Brock Brock really has a 270-pound man's body means so wide he's just a big giant freak carlins not as wide you know he's still biggest fuck a big giant hands and shit but you know I think Brock maybe can carry a little bit more weight naturally than Shane can these guys when they when they train really hard with weights and and powerlifting and shit like that yeah makes you stronger gives you a lot more muscle and that muscles got to get fed it's gotta get fed by blood but goddamn it was exciting as fuck were forced for I was over how do you still have his mouthpiece have you yeah I got Brock Lesnar's mouth we put in yet tasted that tasted the taste of a warrior it's right over there um he stuck it in my pocket I had to was over I said I'm gonna sell that shit on eBay but I'm just gonna hang out to it yeah that's cool fucking I'm a fan it's a trivia moment plus it was a what a comeback when he came out for that second round his hands are up high and like you know you just knew like this motherfuckers not going away he got hit with some bombs and he was still there and still in really good shape and that was really the big difference he took Shane down got in Shane's half guard past got on top of them got him in an arm triangle and put him sleep it was fucking sweet or put him you know to tap he would have gone to sleep he really cranked it tight and Brock is so gigantic you see they also called a side choke there's two different versions of it there's one like this you do it like this and that's why it's called an arm triangle but the way Brock did I think he did it with a gable grip where you do it like this or it's more it's really more of a side choke but Brock is so big and so fucking strong when he just crushes down like that like you really don't have any options man you're gonna go to sleep he just got much too much power he's just gonna crush that whole area between your arm and your neck and everything's going to get smushed and there's not going to be any air that's one of the best UFC's I think in a long time right that was dude I was standing up during the the Lesnar fight it was so exciting I couldn't fucking sit down I stood up that's awesome when they when when Carlin hit him and you know he went to the ground it was like it was the whole thing there was so much energy in the arena it was so unbelievable and then when Brock took him down at the end it was like the whole thing was just so nobody tapped like it was just fucking craziness man there was so much energy I stood up like three or four times right I don't do that man that's the only fight I've ever had to stand up in the middle of because it was so crazy like as far as like sheer entertainment value what a fucking fight there was a bunch of sheer entertainment value fights that were just off the charts like Leoben and Akiyama holy shit that was crazy man God for sheer entertainment that fight was better than any fucking movie that's ever been made I said we're going to need photos of his face since then Leoben yeah Julian's probably fine it probably looks today like nobody hit him really yeah he's tough as fuck he can take a shot dude he got nailed his legs went rubbery he bounces backwards for a second and then starts walking forwards again like a fucking zombie it was incredible he was he was like literally like right out of 28 days later it was fucking crazy he can take bombs but he takes him right on the chin and keeps going the only person's been able to put him away as Anderson Anderson is just way too fast way too technical way too fluid what just way too gifted Anderson's just on another level but for a lot of other people man you know it's like Arturo Gatti couldn't fight with with Floyd Mayweather he got in there with Floyd Mayweather he just couldn't compete he couldn't compete with the style he couldn't compete with the technical superiority the speed the reflexes that the training everything was superior and he just got lit up but when he fought someone like Micky Ward who was like in his ball you know in his his range he put on some of the most incredible fights ever it's just a matter of getting on the right opponent and leaving keeps getting better and better you know he he's like you know he's beating like high-level guys you know Aaron Simpson the guy he beat before he beat this guy is a bad motherfucker man Aaron's a serious fucking wrestler strong as shit incredible endurance I mean he's just uh he's fight with Tom Lawlor he got nailed from pillar to post in that first round and then the second round you know he came back and he fucking started taking Lawler down in the third round he came back and won that round - and wound up getting the decision when it looked like he was a dead man the first round he was getting battered so this guy's tough as fuck so when leave and put him away it was like wow like that's that's strong that's a strong statement you know and then the next fight to go right from that two weeks later fight Akiyama you know and Akiyama is a fucking bad dude man knocked out Denis Kang's fastest fuck awesome judo real solid grappler you know he's a good dude so leaving - fucking sweet wins in a row and how about that Christoph's izinski Stephan Bonnar fight that was probably one away that's my second favorite of the night there days and then I just attacked like a man possessed yeah I was awed he knew that like it was do or die time he had lost - Coleman he had you know had the fight with Suzanne ski like he was fight look that guy will always have a home in the UFC because he's a part of the biggest fight in the history of the sport the most important fight the fight that got everybody to pay attention the fight with him and Stephan Bonnar when they were on Spike TV when it was a finals The Ultimate Fighter the very first season people were so many people were tuning in while the fight was on that I think the the amount of people viewing the fight by the fight by the time the first card start by the first fight of the card started - Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin Forrest Griffin's fight they did it like doubled tripled quadrupled at one point times some insane number like six to ten million they estimated I forget what it was but like some what something crazy was watching that fight when nobody is watching a spike TV before that just people were calling their friends they were like dude you've got to fucking turn this on turn on Channel whatever these two guys are beating the shit out of each other and Forrest Griffin and and Stephan Bonnar had like a movie fight I think it wasn't even real it's like a goddamn every which way but loose Clint Eastwood movie you know him fighting tank Murdock they beat each other all over the fucking place and kept coming they just went after each other for 15 solid minutes they'll be back down for a second you know so he'll always have like a strong place in the organization though they'll always have a always have love for that dude but he also knew that he wants to be you know back in the heat at at-205 he wants to be fighting up to his potential and he knows he's had some good outings and some not-so-good outings that John Jones why it was a tough loss had three tough losses in a row so he stepped in like a fucking wild man fought like his life was on the line I was actually surprised to see him back since last one yeah but I'm glad I always liked that guy well you know he got he got um through when Coleman got cut man Coleman fogg kotor he got caught but right before Coleman beat kotor or lost to go to or whether he beat Bonner you know so are you surprised that like Kimbo was not given an extra shot or yes and no I see the point you know really if he wasn't Kimbo you would have to cut him Matt Mitrione beat him down and it looked like he was you know it didn't look like he was in the right kind of condition it looks like he got really tired his technical prowess wasn't up to the level of material and Mitrione improved much more from his time on The Ultimate Fighter and you also have to wonder about kimbos body Kimble had some real knee problems on the show and the knee problems that he had on the show they weren't like fixable things it's like bone on bone type shit like he's worn off the cartilage in one of his knees which means you can't train it's hard you can't sprawl and you can't you know do the kind of wrestling training that you need you can't get your legs kicked the way you kind of need to get kicked you know he's got like a pretty serious problem that problem kept him from fighting in the main event or getting another shot at getting back in the heat of the show member he got eliminated and then they offered it to him they offered him a fight and he passed on the fight because it was knee right that's not something that gets better so it's like how would unless he's got some sort of a cartilage replacement surgery or I don't know what they're even able to do these is he's got a problem with that knee and that knee is going to keep them from being able trained way the way a GSP trains or Thiago Alves trains or you know any of the killers so it's you know I don't know I I think you can still make a lot of money off the guy the guy still wants a fight I look at it as like you know Butterbean member and butterbean was king of the four rounders you know doesn't mean you don't use butter bean on your car just gonna beat Larry Holmes you know get butter being out there fuck it you know put him out there it's it's it's it's still entertaining you know it's like Chris Leben I mean Chris Leben is you know he's battling it out with the best the world he's beaten Akiyama beaten you know he's he's starting to move up in the chain but the end of the rainbow for him is always going to be Anderson Silva you know Anderson I mean look anybody can beat anybody on any given day is Zig when you should have zagged you run into one a Chris leaving punches you could be in a lot of trouble but technically that the two are so far apart you know Anderson is in such a different level athletically the you know the his ease of movement you know it's just like what do you do you're not gonna cut leave and why would you cut him he's one of the most entertaining fighters in the world so even if he can't beat Anderson you got to keep him around even if he can never beat the best guy in the world which I'm not saying he can't you never know never fucking know and he's improving and shit happens and weirder things have taken place in this world but if even if he doesn't if he'd never if he can never beat Anderson he should still be around because he's awesome you know he's fucking fun as shit to watch so I think that about Kimbo - I think Kimbo is fun to watch and even though he's not like the at the level that you know Gino Santos is or Cain Velasquez is he's not at that level I mean you just got to match them correctly just just accept the fact that this guy is never going to be a title contender and even though that's not really what the UFC is all about the UFC is the very best guys fighting the very best guys and does maybe hurt throwing a young gun in there with a gatekeeper make Kimbo a gatekeeper you know make them a guy that you test young guys with I think that's key that makes it kind of interesting as long as Kimble wants to keep doing it and if he keeps losing and then you know gets to a point where nobody wants to see him anymore then maybe stop using them so what give him a chance though what do you think Dana why would to say about having a UFC bar that was just in the middle there was an octa and every night you just go there there's just people fighting constantly you couldn't do that do you have that many people fighting now no you know it would to be too hard to sanction it it would be too hard to ensure that everybody had their proper medicals it'd be too hard to find qualified fighters because they can't fight but you know mein Leben fought Aaron Simpson then two weeks later he fought Akiyama very unusual for most people there's a few months off in between fights and a lot of that is because you get beat up and you got to relax and rest and and heal up you know if you have any injuries they have to you know be fixed some guys break their hands you know some guys pull ligaments they have to get operations you know Shogun just got an operation on his knee he managed to know that they did that like in Vegas or something I think a better bar solution when since the UFC has this gigantic library of 116 events right the best idea is to serve good food have a cool bar and have the UFC plan date on all these different fucking um television yeah a steak bar UFC everywhere and then when during live shows they have like huge movie actors yes during or they have it on every goddamn TA in the room doing a live show they have it on every goddamn TV in the room and you have to pay 20 bucks to get in or whatever it is and calm down they would clean the fuck up now we're going to the UFC bar because really it would be it's it's really there's a cool thing about watching it live I love watching fights live because it's crazy and you're right there when it's going down it's really nothing the experience is nothing like anything you've ever had before if your seats are good right but if your seats aren't that good you know if you're in the bleachers you know it's kind of cool being there still but it's pretty fuckin badass to go to a place with a bunch of other people and watch it on TV you know like havin a UFC bar where people you know if you can't afford to go to Vegas you know you live in another city everybody all your friends going to go to the UFC bar and watch the fight totally I think it'll be for MMA fans alone and everything I think Dana could have like is only men you'd like Davis deserts Brock's I think Barry Joe Rogan's ravioli ravioli why don't have ravioli it's you attack whiz maybe that would work that would work but having live fights I don't think that would work I think that'd be a little too much yeah but seriously yeah you have situational you know yeah I'm sure that's doing good too I don't know I'd only think about it pretty crazy some dude uh Facebook me from a UFC show like I'm the manager of UFC gym if you ever in town you want to work out all right buddy I think that sounds like a great idea fucking do some squats at your UFC gym take a goddamn tae-bo class right I wonder what kind of class is gonna have they're gonna what kind of liability do you have if you let dudes actually beat the shit out of each other I know because if you have sparring the bottom line is you're not going through like extensive medicals when you have sparring like when dudes spar in kickboxing classes I've never taken a blood test I've never taken a fucking cat scan I've never never taken shit but that's like any workout any gym and so I just sign here we're not responsible get do you know it sign anything at boxing gyms it's mostly absolute shit Pam the places I've worked out and they'll just slap gloves on you and you climb in the ring with another dude that you don't even know and you say you know okay so you know just go easy go easy let me see what you can do and you're fucking throwing punches with some dude that you don't even know and you know who knows most of time dudes are cool but every now and then dudes would try to take your head off they don't know you might have an aneurysm just ready to pop right behind your eyeball and he touches you in the chin your legs go you fall you hit your head on the back of the mat and that thing bursts and just fills your eyeballs with blood and you fucking die right there that's possible I need to get it I when I went to get my eyes checked a while back they were like there's something the back of your eye it's probably nothing but you should take it to a doctor and like f oh you got a brain to him Lee I know that was like 10 years ago though I would know it right now go smoke a lot of weed wait yeah and working on a lot of vegetables 15 pounds to get drink my kombucha - you've lost 15 pounds over the course of how long since the 18th Wow Jun that's that's a lot of weight how the fuck you losing that much weight crack cigarettes hookers now I modified weight watcher at the weight watcher diet which modified meaning you take in less calories I well Weight Watchers does you have this many points you use them based on and this is the food like an orange is two points you know a sandwich is six points whatever so what I've been doing is doing the weight watcher diet but only eating 0 to 1 point shit so mostly vegetables most you do eat like little small meals to keep up your metabolism throughout the day that's like it's all like one point zero point shit and I'm not going anywhere close to my allowed 35 points a day I'm probably doing seven seven points a day you're like a little chick that's just like chicken you like your goddamn chick bro you look Lindsay Lohan starving yourself to death totally it's great no but I'm making sure I'm getting all like the nutrients and proteins and all that stuff since I've gone Bryan just for FYI since I've known why is your phone on that's not mean it is a alert you're getting alert since I've known Bryan he's done this like five times where he got heavy and then he got skinny you got heavy yes dieting is one of the safest ways to ski long jv8 your life well i'm jv8 he went from you were up at like how hot was the heaviest you were over at 243 243 and by the way he's how tall you 5 8 5 8 ok 243 that's giant he was a fat guy like his legs used to touch together in the middle I wear crazy pants his pants were always way too long because his waist his butt were way too big that long for that so they had his pants were like always like shuffling and then this guy got dumped by his girlfriend and went fiance fiance sorry it's much more devastating than just a girlfriend right 7 years they were together for a long time it's very devastating and he went on a goddamn weight watcher elliptical machine rampage and in over the course of how long three months you lost like 70 pounds I was 163 was the lowest I got then I decided that was in three months yeah that's that's so unhappy that's so unhealthy dude you basically starved yourself do you have pictures of yourself when you were a skinny yeah you have anything that would shock the the people at home yeah I do actually have something ready just pull that up so I can take a look at that because it was really strange he it turns out Bryan has a weird head we just don't know because it's always like it's always like embraced in a row of soft-tissue and you don't get to see the true shape of his head but when you just see skinny Bryan skinny Bryan is a strange dude I don't even know what nationality he is he looks like he's a fucking alien I'll find it where's Kenny Bryant but we got to do is we got to make your neck build up this to match your head it's very important you know you can have a big head as long as you have a big neck to support that big head all right you got a big head son and you don't have a big neck and that should look strange oh that's because that's because your head is used to be your body being gigantic right so what you got to do is you got to build your neck up you know that's when the most popular things in Hollywood though for actors to exercises they want you to have a big head what is that about I don't know it's a thing where maybe it's a more more brains thing but it can't be true because I know some people with big heads are stupid as fuck here's a picture of me holding my old pants up Wow well this is not helping the people at home now now I might find a better one I'll post on my Twitter later today well when you do I'll retweet it because I know people are fucking excited to see what you look like when you look strained there's one picture I have that's just scary but what was interesting is when you became went from being a fat guy to a skinny guy you also found out that you're attractive and you started getting girls girls were liking you man it was like you know like chicks should be into Brian and Brian was like wow like this is crazy look at what this like well then what happens and I settle in and then you get a girlfriend right a girlfriend I gained it all back never gained it all back now I didn't I'm probably 1 1 1 95 right now 195 Wow so at least you're still 40 whatever pounds right away from what you were right I don't want to get back to 165 that was way too I look like I had AIDS no you didn't I thought like what you're supposed to look like dude you're just so used to seeing yourself gigantica you did not look like you had AIDS I swear he never looks like scary skinning you never did it looked weird because like all of a sudden you worthless like the tiny person you know that's you that's ridiculous I thought that looks like a healthy person really I hate to say that they'll say a healthy person you problem is your heads too big for your body you got to start working out if you start working out to it you'd be a sexy bitch right there you're looking sexy as fuck yeah there's a dude that I know that has the tiniest head and it always trips me out whenever I talk to him he has that backwards he has a tiny his head ever is a very small head and all I can think of when I'm next to him was would it be like to punch him in his little tiny head haha I mean I don't want to do it I would never like do it but I just think and if you punch this guy and not even me like if a person did punch this guy in his tiny little head like you could just crush his head he's got a bird head oh that's weird yeah I'd rather I'd rather have a way big two head yeah way big two way big filled with smarts my fucking stupid head as smart as fuck yeah so um your um that's another skinny photo blind free put these up on Twitter I'm telling you dude that looks healthy I think I look like I think I look like a lesbian right Ryan that's what you look like god dammit you're gay lesbian underneath it all that's that's what you look like when you're thin that's a layer I don't want to be a gay lesbian but how come you can't how come you can't stay the same way don't you like monitor your weight and you see it go up and what do you do what's the process when you see it going up what good keeps you from just recognizing that cutting back on your food well it's not even a cut back on food it's it's I have the metabolism of a small goat where I like goats or skinny is fucking dude I'm talking about the lean it's a terrible example I meant backwards any other metabolism of a fat person yeah that's funny I fucking eat like two pieces of pizza a game so if you just gave up and just bore a sedentary fuck and had a normal 9 to 5 job we ate shit at the office and ate shit for lunch then you came home you were too tired to work you ate and watch TV you just be a giant fat huge I'd be crazy huge I wonder how many my grandmother was like 600 pounds hello on my dad's side really yeah she was humongous diabetes everything that's scary yeah my dad said yeah I wonder how many dudes who are like that have like a hormonal imbalance a thyroid imbalance or something that could be correct well it's so wise got mine checked and suppose I'm supposedly fine whatever it is I woods fun yeah but check your testosterone no I don't know she tattoos I saw this are not solves listening to Sirius satellite radio the other day and one of the things were saying about guys who gained a lot of weight is a lot of times it's just some sort of a hormone imbalance and that it's maybe a testosterone imbalance they could cure it with like some cream yeah but when I just get more hairier I don't need that anymore listen bitch we're gonna take hair and have some fucking energy and and night not become fat I shouldn't get that check honestly because I bet you I'm fucking no tired all the time I'm tired from waiting I wake up in the morning I'm tired guarantee you and especially because you don't do anything that forces your body to produce it you're not involved in any heavy lifting or anything you know I think that's one of the most important things when you're maintaining your health as you get older you have to do strength training you have to do stretch training that makes your body constantly regenerate tissue keep your glands pumping when I say I when I wake up I really feel tired like I never have woken up and like why I might have sleep apnea too I probably had that you snore yeah chicks tell you snore you know give her like gagging you know I don't do yoga well you should get tested man I got a new mouthpiece that I started wearing you know I got diagnosed with sleep apnea a few years ago and when the doctor created this mouthpiece it's got dr. Kuro peon and Tarzana he created some mouthpiece that keeps your tongue down and the problem is I have a big tongue and my my neck is big from working out all the time and my hole that I have in the back of my throat it's not so big and so when I lie down my tongue falls back as I relax and covers over the fucking hole and I gag and coughing like a lot of times it's fat people fat people have it but athletes have it a lot to anybody who has like a big neck if you have a big tongue it's probably going to happen to you so this mouthpiece kind of keeps your tongue down well he just invented a new one I just started using this new one dude it's incredible I wake up I feel so fucking rested mrs. Rogan says I don't snore it all anymore and I feel so much better and my dreams are super vivid man my dreams are really intense they're really like very very lifelike to the point where sometimes my alarm goes off in mid dream and I'm like wow that was a dream because it's not even they're not even like crazy dreams their dreams like life dreams it's like you know it's very strange they don't have a dreamlike feel to them they feel like I dropped another level below in my my depth of my sleeping you know some having these maybe I'm reaching a REM level that I wasn't reaching before because I was snoring all the time would choke and I have the sleep apnea problem because even the mouthpiece didn't totally cure it it definitely made it better right but I still snored this new and I don't snore at all is that a picture you and jenna jameson yeah when she was but when we were in Arizona yeah so uh what's the goal now you're at 195 and what's your goal trying to get to 165 yeah you should get your hormones checked out son might have problems should you know they can you want you can do things to cure it but one of the things that that works is squats squats and you know heavy lifting makes your body produce more testosterone makes your body produce more growth hormone it's very good for you but you got to not be a pussy not actually do them yeah you don't seem like your type of do this really into what straining I just seem like the energy I have per day is so small that to me how you look at it yeah like I feel like I am barely joining horses impaired and barely trying not to go back to sleep damn - you need to get yourself checked out yeah and what if you have a real issue that's how I did that if I had it it's been I've had it my whole life hmm if I've had it what do you think I don't know what I saw fucking damn kids get off my lawn we haven't looked at the foot of the the questions on on Twitter and forever oh here's the other thing that did last week that I forgot I actually gave my phone number out on Twitter yeah that's going on like that I fucked up royally I gave my phone number out I gave it to Doug Benson because Doug was going to come to Vegas this weekend he wanted to come hang out with us at the House of Blues and I said yeah man I said I can even get you to the UFC here's my here's my phone number call me and I put it in the main Twitter box instead of the direct message box I thought I was a lead elect message so I tweeted my fucking number to the whole world so I was like god damn it and then it just started vibrating and vibrating and the calls were coming in like they did never stop there's like one after the other because you know when yeah I've got a hundred and thirtysomething thousand Twitter friends and who knows how many ten maybe ten thousand might have seen it I try to delete it but it was too late it was out there and so then as I was driving to the Verizon store to go change my number I started answering phone calls like what's up just rügen like yeah man what's going on we do it like a mom away the Verizon store I'm turning in my phone I have to I would answer it here for you guys and show you but I'm a Verizon the Verizon doesn't work here where I live you know it's I did it all we kept it as a family it act very nice that you could have told all those morons who called you and ruined your phone number you could have just posted all those online and fuck them you know but you were nice about you take the high road people what are they doing they're just look I fucked up it's out there right so you're not going to take it away so everyone's going to be so cool that no one's going to call you on them that'd be great if everyone was cool and you know because some of the people just want to call to say hi honey why not if you were 18 years old and you you're a fan of some dude and also he's got this phone number online and you call him and he actually answers so clearly shit but that's most of the calls once the calls were people saying holy shit and they were all cool we think about failure we're losing the other UFC male who's never going to bring them in now and all these conversations about fucking attic conversations about comedy conversations about about MMA I had a bunch of different conversations about all kinds of shit and I was like I'm going to keep this phone fuck it so I kept it as a fan line you want to call it I really do answer it not all the time but I pick it up every now and then eight one eight five one seven two seven 74 that's my phone number that's my family now yeah I just said that I know I was like a real number right like shit he's given I thought that'd be kind of cooler to to actually give out the real number instead of getting another number and making it my fan line it's like actually kind of cool that you actually have my real number I mean that's like my my legit number that I've had for fucking a decade right so that's my number and that's the deal this weekend I'm going to be at the Ontario improv with the one and only Joey Coco Diaz and that's going to be a lot of fun Ontario's a bad Club its selling out quickly so if you want to get in I know a lot of people got shut out in Irvine I talked a lot of people that were disappointed and I'm sorry to get in but you know these clubs they only see like 300 people so if you if you want to come to a show especially the Friday's shows and the Saturday shows you know Sunday sometimes a little easier because you got you know less people are out doing things but Friday and Saturday those fucking tickets so quick everyone was awesome everyone last weekend every show sold out every show was cool people were cool as fuck it was awesome and then House of Blues was awesome too although I did get a tad too drunk just to touch what happened one shot over the line when I happened bad because I didn't see nothing it was nothing bad the show was great but I definitely got too drunk and I told the second half of a joke twice but is because I didn't tell the first half of it right the first time so I tried to like redo it and I and then I realized as I was saying it I was like already said this isn't it does that suck to you yeah he does but I just admit it do you admit it like I immediately just stop and admit it I just said what happened you know and Eddie Eddie's gonna point it out I go yeah I know but I did it because I fucked up this part of it right it's not a good enough answer it's it's did the answer it really is I was drunk that's the answer I mean I'm saying what I did wrong but the only reason why I did it again it's a little drunk right I just I didn't have anything to eat and I had like three shots in a row on stage which is two shots too many but still it was uh still fun fucking fuck fun like really happy crowd they were cool Sam Tripoli was hilarious yeah Sam was awesome he crushed it and it was really good and at that place could go either way you know sometimes UFC unites that places you know the House of Blues is just a madhouse you guessed it we fixed it you fixed it when we get rid of standing only that have changed the vibe of it so much because people weren't comfortable before and you felt that uncomfort from them because the fact they had to stand and watch a show and I made a lot more money than on those shows but I don't care I don't want people to stand up I think it sucks when we saw stand-up we saw Stanhope rather that shit cured me yeah no more stand-up shows I'll never make someone pay to see me stand up ever again and we fucked up in Memphis Joey and I did a show in Memphis and it had to be stand-up because it was a really tiny place and if it wasn't stand it would only seated like a hundred people and all these people were standing out by the bar so half the crowd was standing and they were all talking at full voice like bar voice like no one was like paying attention to the show when Joey went on stage no one was I was like maybe ten percent of the people in the bar weren't talking it was just a low Rumble and then you know it's like okay this is the final straw I'll never have a standing room show ever it's not fun to watch man you know the part of what is good about a show is you can kick back and relax we would be awesome as if they every fucking place you went had real comfortable seats you know if you could sit on a couch like this if that's how you watched every comedy show you know kicking back and chilling on a couch how fucking it would be way funnier because you'd be feeling relaxed you have no tension it's like you're you're more likely to laugh at shit when you're standing your fucking feet hurt that sucks first person ever would say that was Jimmy Norton and are Jimmy talking about it it was promoting one of his shows and he was talking about you know people were calling in and saying that they heard there were standing tickets in the back and Jimmy was like no no no it's gonna be this my show is a standing show and I was like wow he's like real adamant about that but I didn't think was that big of a deal I'm like well maybe he's just you know he's more rigid with his style or something and he wants to make it like that but then I you know I realized that's the right thing to do those standing shows those stand help shows I mean they're fun and everything but it's not as fun yeah it to me I don't know it was my age or what it the whole time I'm just focusing on the pain of my standing like how uncomfortable one each thing man I didn't like stand it up with a concrete floor when I was 10 yeah you know it doesn't feel good I just when I worked at Gateway I had to do it eight hours and weren't allowed to sit down yesterday so you'd find like the bet that thickest shoes and then you put like the best like inserts and shit's not good for it's not you know your body's supposed to be moving around too because that's what I do stand-up and I'm on stage for an hour and a half or whatever I'm on for it doesn't never hurt I feel fine I get off on feel I feel energized but standing in one place and not moving at all for an hour and a half that sucks that's terrible you know you if you're carrying your weight you know you don't even think about it but you're not even like moving you don't even get blood flowing through it and you're right next to other people so you can't like stretch your arms out and move your body and touch your toes and shit and unmoor like if you don't do that man your body feels like shit things very important if your that's one of the reasons why don't like doing comedy too much in bars anymore I don't like I'll do it every now and then just for a goof just to experience something different you get a different taste of comedy I'll do like a little one of shitty little Hollywood gigs every you know now and again but I think it's very important the right atmosphere it has to be said you know the same atmosphere that's good for music it's not the same atmosphere that's good for comedy you know you music you could go up and people could be talking like everybody doing out there and then you play your song man you don't you don't require their attention 100% their complete interaction you don't require that you don't require a response a definite response you know from them comedy though tricky very tricky setting up the atmosphere so tricky it's why it's important well I always go on the road with dudes who I think are funny I was going the road with friends it's so important the worst thing you could ever do is go on the road and a guy opens for you and the guy fucking sucks he doesn't just suck he like sucks like aggressively and like it's like bad material it's like badly done and like the totally different crowd that you would have you know that he would have normally - yeah most of them will never have a crowd at all yeah really bad ones yeah and I've been one of those really bad ones by the way I'm not shitting on them I mean it's part of the development process you know I'm in writing this book that I'm writing about a lot of my early comedy days it's making me rehash like old bombing stories that I forgot of like terrible fucking disastrous tales of the road and they're fucking crazy you know but a lot of it was just cuz I sucked I was just terrible I didn't know how to relax back down I didn't know how to do comedy yet I was really just fucking feeling it out so which is fine and good you know and it's a thing you have to go through but I don't want people going through it before I get up on stage because if they do it right before you it's like it taints the whole room it's like someone just came on stage and just shit into their minds you know then you're forced to like clean everything up and start from scratch you know it's you have to like do damage control you know yeah so where did this comic I know he's I I think 20 years old and he's just the nicest guy little kid ever you know he's only and he's always you know asking for advice to like Ari and me and stuff like that just a really nice guy and he's just you can't tell him how just how nice this guy is did you fuck him what do you say no well he just said that told me the other day he's gonna be like lead role in like a real movie now and his he's going to go from this device a nice little open my young kid now he's gonna be like lead role in a movie and it's just it's a big movie and it's gonna be well I think it's a it's I think it's a big movie it's like it's about what it is it's supposed to be like a Cloverfield but it's um it's like at a party with like Generation X guys or whatever generous in it becomes a monster movie no know how it's like recorded like it's like a bunch cell phone a cell phone stuff like that you know what man I'm not buying that anymore I bought that shit with like the I thought it was kind of interesting the Blair Witch Project how they did that I thought that was a good movie I mean it was really like for what it was when we saw the Blair Witch Project the first time I saw it was we were in Houston and Chris were Chris Maguire and I were working at the laughs stop and these this was way back in the day you know whenever it came out and this dude who worked at the movie theater across the street came to the show and after the show we're all hanging out and smoking weed and the dude goes hey do you guys want to go watch the Blair Witch Project right now we can all watch it like we'll set it up I got the keys we'll turn it on might get the fuck out of here you serious he's like yeah so it was like a midnight show okay so we went over there two o'clock in the morning and this dude had the keys unlock the place we got popcorn and shit and it was just him the dude he worked there a couple other people that worked with him like a guy and a girl and me and Chris McGuire's just five of us we watched the Blair Witch Project it was badass yeah was the perfect way to watch it freaked me the second time I watched it it was tired it not work not only did it not work there was some dude who brought his baby and this fucking Mexican dude and his baby was making all this noise it was like two you know and you know so a bunch of people like shush dum and he got aggressive with the people fuck you bitch don't fucking push me bitch and I was like okay now I have to fucking think about this guy and his fucking inconsiderate ways and he's got a baby and people trying to shush him and he's you know fucking yelling at them obscenities and threatening them I'll fucking kick your ass bitch and that kind of shit so now you got to think about him for the fucking movie oh so is a bad experience as you know I don't really like going to movies anymore you to roll the dice yeah I mean I especially when nowadays it's like I can get a blu-ray I can wait I can wait six months and that the experience at my house now is better than I think going to a movie yeah if you have a nice good size TV and you know your you got a good size sound system plastic afterwards I can Japan right yeah I can smoke weed yeah you can have whatever food you want you get a comfortable couch to watch on it's a way better experience but people like the event of being out there with other people you know people like that's one of the things people like about a concert you know if fucking Ozzy Osbourne was playing just to you and it was just you and Ozzy alone with his band in the room you probably won't even want to be there you know they'd be like maybe listen to a song or two you ain't be like this is crazies look them in the eyes and singing fucking you know you'd have to look at you you're the only one there but if you're you know one of 15,000 in an arena then it's cool there's then it's fun that's crazy but I think movie theaters need a reboot man I don't think they need to stop going hey we're charging you $14 for tickets eight dollars for a popcorn five dollars for a pop I think they need to do this kind of fuck that you have to pay that much just to watch it raise if you want to own it it's like 30 bucks in a few months not even that you can get a Best Buy for $14.99 on DVD you know $12.99 not blu-ray though blu-ray 30 bucks sometimes opening week or first week you know they'll have it on sale for like 17 yeah if you watch something blue right it's so much better so much more comfortable watching shit at home yeah I this I watched The Wolfman the other day again yeah I watched it again I don't even like it it's terrible movie but I think it's dope when it's once at home yeah what's at home I like that's not bad I saw in the movie theater I'm like I paid for this fucking stupid movie this movie's retarded yeah what did I say that was pretty good oh the crazies crazy dude the crazies good goddamn horror movie really yeah I don't want to tell you the premise because I didn't know a thing about it I'll give you the blu-ray I got it up here oh cool um I didn't know a thing about it I knew nothing but someone had said this is really scary movie someone twittered it so I'm gonna check it out because I don't know I love what I don't know anything about a movie I didn't know nothing I did I hadn't seen a single preview I saw a photo with a guy with a pitchfork that's it that's all I know I'm like okay some crazy shit obviously guys killing people with a pitchfork right great movie huh that's a I mean not the best movie in the world but a good goddamn horror movie good solid I holy shit horror movie and I'm like why wasn't this movie popular well why didn't this movie go somewhere in the movie theater it's pretty fucking good I didn't hear a thing about it did you hear anything about it I just remember the advertiser or the advertising how they advertised it The Last Airbender I have not seen it you know why because you're not fooling me again you fuck em night shamalamadingdong your movies are I think I'm terrible she's done I think I'm the other fucker happy interval in turn LSATs 0% of rotten tomatoes is like yes this is all-aware I know he had 0% of rotten tomatoes for a long time like six now or seven yeah he's got a few percent now there's a few fools out there or some staff members from and I Shamma Lamma ding-dongs fucking what makes me company more angry is the fact that the opposite is happening with Toy Story 3 because that's a movie I don't care if you're the most angriest person a road you sit there you'll go at least yet that was a good movie you know that was a those Pixar movies are always good man they were so good at it one bad one I think there's one or two bad ones it's just like really I want to meet these people and go what the fuck is wrong with you like are you really that angry of a person or are you somebody from a different movie studio just being a dick you know there's a lot of a lot of espionage and fucking double-crossing online for sure a lot of positive comments as well buy paid shills you know people accuse the UFC of doing that all the time on the underground people are saying how many egos are paid UFC shields as far as I know there are none but there might be I might just know about them might very well be they hire people to get online means it's effective marketing if you think about it you get online you hype up a fight you start talking you instigate comments you know do you think that you know Shane would have been knocked out by Brett Rogers you know or that I don't think it but I bet Lesnar would have been knocked out by Brett Rogers like sometimes it is I know it is I know but I know in the five days they used to do that there's just a lot of people also that's all they think yeah that is true but but as far as like a as far as like putting together threads and pushing real positive threads and talking about how excited you are for something it's a good move you know it's a smart move you know if you get a good thread together and the amazons reviews are that yeah well I pay attention to Amazon's reviews that a half of it could be total bullshit yeah I even try to read it to say okay is this sound like something like a publicist made or a the company made no one can stop you from doing that you could review the shit out of your own stuff yeah you know I've never done that with anything I've ever done I've never done that but I was pleasantly surprised at how many cool fucking comments I got on the iTunes thing I thought when I was going over the podcast I'm like there's going to be a bunch of douchebags I don't want to hear us yappin about things because this is kind of a free-form podcast a lot of times we talk about the same subjects we've talked about before but they're relevant to the current conversation I can't I gotta assume that each one of these two-hour things is its own thing try not to repeat things as much as possible but and it's also just hard to remember you know yeah what was 28 times - you know how many hours is that of trying to I also think that we get into subjects a lot deeper than you can if you're just doing an hour podcast right you know I like the our podcast format but I think there's something about like really intense conversations or you know we have these cool conversations you got to let them kind of take their fucking path you know and sometimes it's like well this is it we're just going to stop it now but you know there's more shit to be talked about you know but so many fucking people who said you know things on the iTunes we're cool there's a couple bunch of complaints about the sound which we did have problems with the sound but we fix all that shit if you think it's too low stop listening it on your iPhone speakerphone it's for everything Brian's very upset with this well some guys said and how low it was and so today I recorded myself going on like an Corollas you know all a couple of them and then and then ours figures out allow this this is good now we mean and I think this is the right way to do it too because I've heard things where people talk on lav mics and it's not quite as loud or clear yeah I think the reason why radio stations use these kind of mics and stand-up comedy using this kind of mics and this is this is the right shit to use so this is the way we're going to keep it as far as like putting up this green screen I kind of gave up on that shit I think it's distracting I might put up a banner or something maybe put up a big flat-screen and have a constantly changing logo make you you could put together some Nettie video and I'd be playing in the background what do you think let's move just Joey Diaz on toilet but I think I've given up on the idea of us being in space looking like a cable-access show you know um the fleshlight is our only sponsor and the like I said before that if it wasn't a sponsor I would still tell you to use it things the fucking bomb-diggity meet if it's awesome gigs this weekend I will be at the Ontario Improv Friday Saturday and Sunday with Joey Diaz
