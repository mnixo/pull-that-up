five four three two ladies and gentlemen live and available right now Everlast whitey Ford House of Pain you yes sir how are you sir how are you doing Missy brothers good to see you again been a minute you going Vegas this weekend for the fights yeah man we got a little party the night before we're doing a little show at the Brooklyn Bowl with my buddy evidence and no cell phones you don't know where I will put the headphones I feel like I'm alone here with the headphones aren't there we go no we're on the same team now we're locked in um this is out this is out right yeah it came out about three weeks ago something like that maybe a month beautiful I've been in Europe for the whole Munch's touring so this is like everything Everlast presents whitey Ford's House of Pain yeah it's it's you know it's everything in the toolbox I brought to this record so that's kind of where the title came from just you know it's been eight years since my last real studio album so I figured hey maybe this could be the last one I hope not buttons just like you know I mean like you know that my story it's like you know with the the family I've dedicated a lot more of my time to the family than I used you know yeah just because of some of the you know um extra issues we deal with which everything is wonderful and great now you know and dude I'm 30 pounds lighter than the last time I was here you do that I honestly it started here because I'm I purposely came here that day it was the first time if you remember it was a while ago and they've done a thousand podcasts since that day but uh it was the first time I come out and I started talking about anything like you know that was going on in my life in a public way mm-hm and uh you know III got a lot off my chest that day and I also planned that day to put myself in a position to hold myself accountable by this by stating I I don't feel good about the way I look right now and I reached out for I'd like theoretically for help you know and I got an incredible response from the podcast audience and my own fans I mean I got offered from everybody everywhere how to do this that in the other didn't really need that because within my own circle some people stepped up and I also did it to hold myself accountable to put it in the universe like I've thrown it I put it up there on the wall and stuff and stamped it and said here's what I want out of life right now and you know there's nobody stopping me but me and I sometimes some of the things I've used to do I used to get on and see you talking about I'm not letting this inner bitch kick my ass today and I'm just started taking things like that to heart you know and again now how did you change what did you do different that we started talking about the last time therapy you know I mean it's helped a lot for me because of this you know the the the added pressures our family faces with my oldest daughter having cystic fibrosis you know it just for a long time I was just learning how to live life with it you know and that got heavy there was some real dark you know heavy moments you know scary moments for her in the hospital you know so we I mean as a human you know you have this baby and you you're just trying to figure out how to not screw it up with a normal health situation you know this is this added thing so it took a long time for me to come to terms at first I got really angry I got into some real you know Lieutenant Dan war with God kind of stuff you know at the top of the sailboat flip you know as I was there all the way and it got to a point where I almost I was that I almost got locked up for trying to fight a cop that was you know trying to just talk to me about something you know I just lost when I was I'd know I had so much anger over so much that I wasn't dealing with and then I found a guy that just really got me therapists and and it it began the the ball rolling of understanding how to how to cope with a lot of that stuff you know Wow so um as far as like first of all you look really good I thinks your face looks great your skin looks good I'm taking a lot better care of myself it looks like it thank you are you what are you doing different as far as like how you eat or um just eating cleaner you know just trying not to you know to be more aware of what's in the food and what's in the meat and stuff you know I'm still part of the whole commercial meat system though I long to get it to a situation where I'm hunting and doing things like that it's just we had talked about that for what I wanted to try hunting pigs well I asked you what would be a the best you know starting point and you were like you know they got boar up there well to hone and I know some guys and I actually contacted them and I I just again this life it's not just this it's this the added stress of like you know I have a wife that when I go on the road she's the sole handler of these problems you know and so that these things you know pile on you guilt and this stress and all this you know and um so yeah it's just between that when I'm home I just invest myself I want to be home I want to do as much as I can to lift that weight so like I get caught about the things all the things I want to do I can't do all the time you know I mean but it started again now I'm taking care of myself like I'm actually about to start you Jitsu again you know which I yeah because I got forever I was so goddamn fat in the middle of hip escapes we're like you know everything I was hurting my back or my neck every other time I tried to do I just quit because it was getting you know I mean I mean I wasn't it's or advanced I wasn't probably pretty close to getting a blue belt you know I was about a year in on like four lessons a week with just the private you know I was with Marcus Vinicius if ever the hills you just sue for a while so now I'm just looking to see what I want to do you know I've talked to Eddie a few times I'm talking to a few other guys cron is that's my way doing any exercise at all besides that cardio not much weights or anything like that just you know keeping it moving at two hours two hours on stage tonight it's good to do something first I feel like I always tell people like jiu-jitsu so grueling that I think of why I mean you could just jump in and you will get in shape through jiu-jitsu but a good thing to do is like to find a place that teaches you kettlebells and take some kettlebell classes and just just get your self body strong enough that it can Marcus used to do brought Marcus used to run me around a gym for 30 minutes before we could even start a lesson like I literally had to puke for the first like months yeah that's that old-school way a lot and then it would take so long that he would be like all right you're past the pukin thing you've ran in but it was like at first I would like yeah literally be run till I was puke and then the crazy part of ours is fifteen minutes after you felt great when you were doing the lessons those and I'll work yeah those there's the old-school guys that's how they used to do it these two like all the old-school carlson gracie classes you'd have a grueling physical workout first hip escape push-ups sit-ups body weight squats all this different stuff there's a good thought process behind that not just that it gets you in shape but also that you learn how to do jujitsu when you're tired so that you learn how to just use technique and not use like relaxed training you almost have no choice but to relax yeah yeah yeah there's people that disagree with that though they think you should learn technique when you're fresh and it's and better but it's just two different schools of thought you know I don't think either one is right it's definitely good to understand what it's like to be tired and how to how to train and how to how to push yourself when you're tired Sean yeah I'm excited I'm really looking forward to it like I just started talking about like about two weeks ago really well that's a lot of weight to lose man that's a big accomplishment I got 15 to go to really to hit my goal yeah well it'd be 225 225 some good weight yeah you taking vitamins or supplements or anything like a daily um but I know I have restrictions cuz I take blood thinners and stuff cuz of this titanium heart valve I have so I like I have to have a vitamin that's the devoid of vitamin K because that's what makes your blood clot so I like a lot of things like a lot of the juicing things and like things like that when you want to go on a juice cleanse I can't do it because it's like a lot of its kale based and like kale is a heavy green whether it's high in vitamin K it'll totally like screw up my blood chemistry would you know because I'm going the other direction with blood thinners so yes Christ I have to otherwise like a clock could hit like stick to that titanium valve break off and wind up in my brain you know I mean and then some stroked out and that's the last thing we need fuck yeah I mean when you put the microphone up to your heart and you can't it yeah I'm so so like when I'm in here I'll keep feeling like it you can hear it anyway it's like all through this I hear it 20 it's white noise to me if I want to hear it I can hear I can take my pulse like this just by telling you Wow - yeah I can hear it in my own skull like I can hear it in my bones I can hear it it's in me how long is that good for ever ever ever as long as I take care of my eyes I mean they're it's been 20 years literally in in 2018 and a half 90 in 98 why and I just get you know as long as I keep the thin - blood thinners going and you know that gets checked in you know two times three times you you know and then the blood thinners are because if you got a clot it would somehow know that gets stuck in that valve o'clock good like or it and you know it's a titanium valve so the clock could actually form on it the metal like it could the block if it's the Bloods too sticky into you know has too much clot it could stick to the bow then break off and then wind up in your brain well you know so what do avoids let clots in general yeah right what's the difference between that and a break a regular valve what would happen well the other choice would have been a pig valve and those are good for about fifteen years like they usually open you up again yeah yeah I would have had to have a high B do yeah probably right now - I got B that go here I don't yeah yeah they do that for older people as what they do cook like you know when you get into your sixties they you know they'll really explore that because Pig I don't think you're gonna be around fifty more you know here just for now yeah so I was called a st. jude's st. jude's artificial valve powerful medical technology Eddie Bravo's got a titanium disc in his back now yeah he just had a surgery that's right yeah his back moves around great it like he was fully compressed where there was like nothing left it was basically bone on bone he was in pain all the time and they just open him up and put a fake valve in there I'm crazy or a fake disc rather in there but it's articulating so like moves around like a regular disc it doesn't it's not like it's fused even if you're seeing people that are off yeah yeah they get the few I have a friend that got that down yeah there was super stiff yeah like wherever it is is basically locked down there's no movement to it anymore but Eddie's is actually it moves like a real disc that's gonna be coming down the pipeline it's gonna be crazy man yeah I mean I know people with fake everything I know people with fake hips and fake knees and let's fake heart valves fake heart valves yeah yeah it's amazing I mean at a certain point in time they're just gonna replace your whole body and take your brain out and put it in just gonna be able to download your consciousness yeah that's what you want I'm saying yo you got a truck mad trouble he didn't really it made some noise man yeah but here's the deal dude when you got twenty five billion dollars all trouble is bullshit truth it's like good luck with your trouble yeah here in trouble yeah he's out there with a fucking flamethrower shooting rocket ships into the atmosphere that flame throwers crazy - does whatever he wants man he's basically like a little kid who actually by that is that like not near sale yeah he sold them all out like in like two days or something yeah I don't doubt it I wish I had him in hid what are you gonna do with it though that's just fun it's just you have a flamethrower but it's literally called not a flamethrower yeah it's amazing yeah it's basically what you saw in the movie aliens I'm over the second day when they're shooting the flames at the aliens that's what that thing is yeah I seen him on something just the other day they almost look like it was it here where it looked like you guys set the building on fire yeah that was in here yeah those are my Instagram yeah he's a madman the world needs more of those more people like him not more flame throwers yeah flame throws so while you looking forward to the fight this weekend I'm um super jacked for it man oh yeah we got this little show before is anybody coming out to jump around I don't know they have to think Dave you know I'm waiting for Connor did you know how does he not not on up that song well he comes out the Senate O'Connor right like he does like usually like that into like the notorious like song like the you know the yeah I don't know the note oh yes right oh yeah who was coming out to jump around Marcus Davis did he did I know uh Cavill oh that that there's a female fighter uh she's heavy oh thank you yeah I know she comes out to jump around right I met her at a fight she was super cool she was super super geek Oh quite a few people have come out to it yes I think Machida came out to it once really yeah yeah yeah he's over in Bellator now I'm not I'm not always sure they have a choice sometimes I just think Dana says you're coming out the job well he definitely takes away bad choices I might be the sub when there's a really shitty slick here throw that in but then Darren till came out to Sweet Caroline he came out - who is that Neil Diamond yeah he had the whole crowd singing a long way this is crazy crazy was it was that in Boston or in that area of the country no it was where was that fight Chicago Chicago makes sense Neil Diamond wasn't in Chicago you could know Dallas was Dallas that's yeah I was weird it was weird yeah it's just like you know that's a big deal like walk out songs are a big deal you can't have a wife that's the tone what the thing for me is when I hear one of my songs I'm just I'm just always like oh please win does stats on fist-bumps like how many times people fist bump Bruce Buffer whether or not they win or lose you know like and Diego Sanchez broke the curse in his last fight he fist bumped Bruce anyone so this grunt was a curse we were trying to figure it out okay cuz he he was like I think it's like 50/50 right now like whether or not people when they fist bump Bruce Buffer when they went and there was a bad streak for a while like three or four people in a row lost that were fist bumping you know Bruce gives you the intro you know you know in when he gives you the in and you know DJ cow nightmares yes he's a little fist bump and if you fist bump him back you know if you do engage in that like annek was like trying to figure out like Anika's kind of a degenerate gambler in the most most positive way I mean he's not losing his family or his life but he fucking loves gambling and so he's always like giving you stats on this and find something to put a bet on right I mean it's not even things he actually bets on but he's always thinking that way would you bet on it yeah I wonder if you could bet on how many people who fist bump Bruce Buffer you could find somebody to take the bed the thought process would be you're not totally in the zone if you got the time to fist pump Bruce Buffer I'm not sure if I buy it though yeah because it's also your moment when it's saying your name yeah yeah I don't know it's uh it's tricky tricky what sounds like it's about even so yeah just one of them things someone should do stats on it cuz Jah Nanak is only done like you know just off the top of his head some guys basement right now starting for sure write it down okay let's take the notes well you could basically been on anything these days right in Vegas yeah you can pretty much find a lot of things like wouldn't think you could bet on you that you can I don't even bet but I like the fact that you can bet on everything why not yeah condors coin flips it's also I like that it's freedom I don't like this idea that people are telling you what you can and can't do with your money like you can't gamble your money well you have to go to a spot in the desert like why says who says ooh like why can't you gamble right here you know why can't you have a casino on every corner who cares like well people are gonna lose our paycheck and wolves our family will they really will they really is that what's gonna do it said the casino may be in for a while but then people will be like you know we shouldn't go there as much yeah it's like the infantile ization of people you know keep them protect them from themselves you don't protect them from liquor stores or fast cars you know those things are everywhere everywhere good point right yeah I'm with you man I could never live in Vegas I can do could live in Vegas you know if it was between Beirut and Vegas I'll figure it out but you know it's just it seems to me like it's just the whole thing is it's built I mean there's shows and it's wonderful and there's neon there's great restaurants and all that stuff but it's also built on you losing money yeah the whole thing is built on you losing and what's the real population of Vegas like a half a million people like that of people that aren't there visiting gambling and for the fuckery yes I'm guessing like half a million people yeah I bet you're about right six six hundred thirty thousand I'm good pretty close yeah it's a good guess what that been that's close enough to win you back yeah yeah I mean if your surprises right yes so you got a real small town there that's acting like a city - its kind of you know well like what is the population in any given time with all the hotels filled no because it's just weekend's a big least double more than that probably I'm saying at least even like an off season off day you're probably at least double that but a lot of the folks that work in Vegas they live in like Henderson or something like that we can go in some nice neighborhood your kids can ride bikes in the street it's like normal there's two uh Summerlin - that's yeah that's really nice over there yes yeah there's a few of those spots yeah they don't like no actually like staying over there at that Red Rock that's not good yeah I don't like the strip fuckery man actually that's why I like you quiet if I want the work we all take a cab 40 minutes away actually says there's one and a half million people there but at any given time probably more like that yeah hmm so for the fights what about a big fight weekend typed in for hotels how many people are in the hotel rooms if there's a hundred and forty eight thousand rooms whoa dude they might be a hundred forty eight thousand Irish people there this weekend just screaming yeah if you're if you're there this weekend just pay attention because it's gonna be bananas the last time for the Mayweather fight there was a video that someone posted of Mandalay Bay and Mandalay Bay was not even where the fight was taking place and the Irish had this one hallway completely filled and they were all singing they were singing 6th Avenue in New York they

are we pretending that we we've had these jeans for a long time and they're special to us or do we just buy them off the shelf at Macy's pre-ripped like assholes where the fuck did that take place like if our grandparents who made it through the depression could come over here and see us buying ripped jeans would they would realize like what is wrong with this nerfed up softened down fucking shitty country we live in America it's too easy too easy to get by these wolves in the streets young Eric can't be running around with fucking fake rips in your jeans you know I'm Brendan Schaub one of my best friends does that oh who's this that's them with the fag nailed it I didn't even mean to nail it I didn't even mean that I just took a wild guess I don't know a goddamn thing about these

I'm basically wearing yoga pants I got these barbell jeans on these aren't even jeans yoga pants all genes are made of weird like the same tell me what these don't do these aren't even Jesus lead enema these are like they might as well be spandex I might as well be wearing yoga pants but most most pants for that now even the ones that look like jeans a lot of them are that yeah it feels better yes technology it's called advancement in human civilization yeah you want to drive a car with leaf springs like an asshole or do you want some new magnetic Cadillac Escalade the broom did you know cruise through your pants or you want to you know be sweaty oh yeah the breeze from fake holes I'll take the sweat like a man I'm gonna rock mine cuz I got skinny enough to wear these motherfuckers okay I respect I'm gonna wear this and wifey likes these motherfuckers too two pluses just don't wear cowboy boots oh we J we rockin that the sneakers for life dude my friend cam Hanes he wears them cowboy boots and I just shut my mouth look down those big old wooden heels I think Andrew Santino's bet never seen Andrew Santino's but he's got a bit about dudes who wear cowboy boots holy shit is it funny oh my god all that kid up on the tube yeah I don't even know if he might not even put it on a special yet but he's a whole bit about dudes dressed up like with cowboy hats on and cowboy boots fucking hilarious anyway but I digress what's this uh cow skull with the third eye what's that just a sweatshirt I liked okay I like it too well those Brando called adaptation hmm it has a fake hole in the elbow oh Jesus sorry dude I'm not going happening with the holes how did that happen what happened sorry dude I'm disappointing you so much the reality is this is what's fucked up why does it look better cuz it kind of does kind of looks better if you're wearing a shirt and it's got like even if it's a new shirt it's got like those little holes around the collar little tiny holes like a little bit a little bit of rip here a little tiny rip there why is it look better I don't know maybe cuz it's not maybe there's some psychological way of ripping things that some people are more talented at it that they just know where didn't make it cool they make it look we were young like if you had like a pair of Levi's where the knee was getting thin we would advance that shit you know there was something cool yeah you would like if it was like we didn't do it I was like rip them up like they do nowadays but like like say you had a pair of jeans long enough they you know the knees would get thin and they ripped a little you just kind of run with it maybe stress about you know well presenting the $1,625 designer t-shirt complete with tears and holes okay we can all agree if you buy that you're a fucking asshole if you spent $1,000 on a t-shirt your kind of man the only good thing about that is I think that's a ladies t-shirt and them holes are and all she has to do is bend over tire shoes and it might not be a nip slip there might be a nip poke through right like look where those holes are quite possibly if those tittays are jutting out right look at that you know how that works to that she might not even be wearing that shirt that might even be a person throw you me that might be a mannequin yeah they do things and they just put different shirts on shit with Photoshop and shit now then it's crazy yeah but that's a stupid shirt that's a 1000 there's a stupid shirt look this one there's a t-shirt that has a button down shirt sewn to the front of it what dude it was like on the blogs a couple weeks ago you know what I'm talking the sneaker blogs easing this to ease some of that shit leaks through and shit so I'm using like these crazy designer crazy do you ever jay-z's I have a couple pairs but I don't really wear them that much thank you I'm more of a Jordan guy you ever thought about lighting them on fire sometimes like when I you know I've got the dudes kind of batshit crazy crazier than ya and Sarah Palin oh look at this yeah that's a real thing oh that's a real thing so one side has a t-shirt yeah and then the other thing is sewn to the front yeah but like it doesn't even it looks like it's hanging there it is just hanging there but it doesn't even look like you're wearing it burning your shirt what go back to that price oh yeah 1,300 that's what I'm saying that it was worse than the t-shirt oh my god $1300 Wow for that do you see Kanye jumped on the table at a university was talking about leaving Elon Musk alone that dudes lost his mind man well that's going on I don't know one man that you know there's a lot people expect you late and that's all I would say this is from me just like ever since that man's mother died he's been on a downward spiral like losing his shit well you know I think he's suffering from some serious like no bullshit he did get into a serious car accident right broke his jaw seriously and drunk a few years before that is not a joke no like brain trauma and listen I'm not a doctor or anything you've remotely related to one but I've been around a lot of people who've been hit in the head a lot that shit's real like that that will change your brain chemistry it's 100% legit like getting hit in the head is no bueno and car accidents will fuck people up forever some people some people are okay they get they recover boy there's a lot of people that come back for some significant head trauma and just their scrambled man and he might be one of those and it also might be what I talked about in my last special triggered crazy bitches long enough yeah something happens you were talking about this soul-stealing succubi it might be true dude that was an amazing routine I got it well I was trying to figure out a way that I get away with making fun of Bruce Jenner without being called transphobic circuitous route it was brilliant I go along route decided reddit kind of been my first time yeah dude that's it's spooky yeah the bar Odom was like a world champion yes good ballplayer dude you just got cracked out Bush what happened to him Reggie Bush got wise and fucking but he was dead hailed he's got my old car he Reggie Bush has my 1970 Barracuda is that right yeah yeah I sold it this other dude and thus other dudes sold to Reggie and he drives around that car it's a dope car man he's a dope car yeah so he's got some taste yeah and he got wise weird things are going on over there man he's smashed and bolted that's how you do it and he's he smashed before the fake ass came into the picture too that's another phenomenon I don't even understand diaper but it is why well I'd like a nice round but yeah there's my car that's Reggie Bush driving it well it's not my car it says now yeah look at that Reggie you glorious bastard you had her first yeah not a really good car really good car look at how get rid of oh yeah that's uh the Ray J song right you wouldn't want to take second place the Reggie Bush to that guy he's built like a brick shithouse you know he was smashing that right whatever he'd damage he did did that he probably was like a car accident maybe all that fake ass shit came after him you get hit by that dude I read she used to wake up before him and get hot towels ready and put his toothpaste on his toothbrush smart yeah treat him like a king Hey probably just smashed it she's probably all day just delirious just from all the orgasms just walking around bumping into walls and shit there's a picture of him and her by the pool and you look at him and you go that guy must be just smashing that he's a super athlete I mean that guy is built like a fucking superhero all of them that's all they really date Yeah right for the most part yeah except Kanye yeah shouldn't you settle down Kent you're playing behind a basketball player to write that best right layer do the dude who was on the show all the time that guy was on the show all the time yeah no crazy I can't even see living your life like out there in fucking public just every fucking pity your business oh that would be a nightmare to me well it's also not interesting but yet edited so well that you you just go slack jaw and you just watch it's just they switch from one scene to another quick enough so that you keep watching it and when it's over nothing happened nothing you're like what the fuck did I do with my hour you gave it to them and they advertised like 18 in products and they made a fucking ass load of money when you find out how much that family is made you

that much money nobody that's just the way it goes yeah and you're I mean you want to talk about someone out there those fucking people are out there they got everything out there yeah they're living like performance art like living in a giant glass house on a pedestal in the middle of the city that's where all that comes from though is like you know the fake ass isn't on you so you got to keep the spectacle alive almost you know means yeah if it's not a spectacle it's not interesting I guess I can't change anything if it's not an absolute spectacle to the vision your brain will catch on to the my favorite word fuckery yeah I love that word too it's my favorite word it's a great word it's a good way it really is like a great first of all it's a word that you can get away with no matter what it's not a word that you you know eventually you won't be able to use anymore no fuckery is just gonna be around forever and it's just it is perfect for like nonsense yeah I've been my English friends for years we're saying fuck curry oh no that's the thing that's the internet it's only recently catching on over here yeah really no that's like you know 10 years I'm talking about since the eighties I've been hearing fuckery I'm trying to figure out when I started using that I started using in regards to martial arts like fake martial arts I use it in all kinds of so you can use it lightheartedly acid seriously yeah it works you they're working it's as versatile it's just plain old fuck yeah yeah Steve Maxwell that's where I got it from I started using with Steve Maxwell he was describing some fake martial arts talking about because you know Steve's a black belt in jujitsu and it's like it's a lot of fuckery it's a great using I just looked it up to see if there's a good definition and it says it's also a definition for another word for a brothel a fucker fucker holy shit dude you just like open my brain in a new way of course they call it are you going to the fucker fucker oh that's too good that never would have done had you not just a little vulgar slang uncountable sexual intercourse wow that was fucked up that which is fucked up is that which is fucked up addition is a fuckery that is hilarious of fuckery I had only used it in its verb form yeah it's actually a noun yeah there is a fucker fucker a place place we hate you fucks brand new that's like literally brand new the translation in the French I guess oh shit have you ever been a Paris oh I love Paris you ever go to that place underneath it has all the skeletons no I have not been to the catacombs the friends of mine of God no yeah I want to go man I want to go and see that didn't get tours and all kinds of Schilling what was that people that died in the plagues or what it is I think so and they just buried them yeah they do you know the church like who put them all in the catacombs do you know at one time Paris had a wolf problem and people are getting killed by wolves in recent history 1,400 oh look at that Wow look at those pictures all those skulls yeah there's a crazy story by happen to a place dad whenever I see pictures this reminds me there's a place in I want to say what country is Prague the Czech Republic I think it's it's called Kuna hora kayuu tiene h o ra it's like a church that's built like thousands of people's skeletons yeah that place is bananas man did you go to that - oh no I've been there I haven't been to the catacombs I'm saying whenever I see pictures of the catacomb but this place is like an entire church decorated and then they have like little dens of like places like officers it's like wow and thousands are like vertebra the spine oh no there's another one whiners whoa crazy that is banana Kunta aura and it's you know you can just go there and I think you pay like a couple of whatever euros and you can walk in there I got tons of flakes in there it's weird when you go to those places and you realize these places are fat like I was in Italy and there was a church that I went to and there was this glass floor the church was over a thousand years old and there's a glass floor that you walk on below the glass floor is the old church that the thousand year old church was built on they have no idea how old the old churches that's currently yeah each church was it it's in Ravello it's at the top of like there's a bunch of cute little shops and little hotels and shit out so extra small the purse there yeah it's the the the church that you could visit is more than a thousand years old I put a picture on my Instagram of this crazy picture of what they thought a whale looked like it was a story of you know who was the dude who got eaten by the way on the Bible Jonah Jonah Jonah in the whale and it's it's like in a mosaic on the wall but it's like what they thought a whale was it's like you know before they had photos that some dude would like draw you a picture some shit he saw like this is what it looks like my friend and then you know some other dude who never saw it well would make a mosaic of this shit and and put it on the wall it's just so weird we went to the place that got fucked up by the volcano to Pompeii Pompeii yeah sounds fascinating tis crazy think it'll just instantly twenty feet of ash just covered in ash just don't imagine yeah just one minute nothing and next minute little earthquake Paul and while you're there you can see the volcano it's right there so active yeah I don't know I mean I don't think it's not a real issue in a long time did see if you find that Instagram picture of Jonah in the well that's scary it's from July volcanoes that Hawaii everything going on there yeah that's nutty man just scary getting the I read a story like somebody didn't touch the lava they just got within like a couple inches of it and like burnt themselves like melted their skin like off oh yeah yeah not even getting like actually hit by you get hit by your shit's dissolving oh you can cook on it you slap a steak on that bitch it would dissolve no it wouldn't it's not the best conductor of heat you know just slap a steak on that sear it flip it they take one second there was a some crazy chef did this where they took molten iron and they poured it down this chute and as I was going down the chute they slap steaks on it I was like they were cooking on this hot molten iron that's crazy yeah people get bored whenever it tasted anything poor taste like shit yeah Kylie ruin a good steaks like molten fucking whatever yeah like molten dirt did you see the video of the lava consuming that Mustang did you yes if you got payments and you just fucking damn man this car is killing me these payments are killing me just parked that bitch why was that lavas coming in Hawaii yeah watch it get melted but set up a camp Adam imagine there's a lot of mustangs over there either a lot of American cars over there they buy a lot of Toyotas because they don't break and they're small yeah but it's also like you don't do you know you know everything has to get flown over there so you don't want anything to break super expensive yeah everything food stuff is more expensive there than like the only other place that was comparable to me was Perth really well because everybody sewed it's like everything same dude it's the furthest like city like isolated by itself in Australia yeah and you know I think and maybe in the world like real away from any other major city that makes sense right because Australia's as big as the United States yeah and it's really the only major city on the west coast there yeah how big is Perth it's like us I don't know how many people but it's like a city and you know do you perform there a lot I'm not allowed to spend probably ten years since I've been Australia I love Australia but I do not love that fucking flight bait stuff whoo that's a rough flight takes a minute to get over that shit yeah you landing where am I there it is that's what the fuck is that man it's like fish with a lion head like look that's what they thought Jonah in the way looked like that's hilarious a years ago strange right I was trying to make a run for it yeah look at Emily come come I got the fuck away from this that dude kind of looks like me that's a little disturbing I'm gonna get out of here bald-headed dude with a beard trying to get away from this lionfish with wings thing that's but that's what they thought a whale was craziness how you know I just imagine what it was like living a thousand years ago when there was no pictures at the glass floor yeah that's my feet right there so you're in this church to church the thousand years old and that go back to that last one Jamie that one that's that's the glass floor and then you look down and they have this entirely different Church underneath it that's way older they don't know how old it is been there forever could be several thousand years old the church is gorgeous though there's a lot of those churches and you've been to the Vatican right yeah that's the mindfuck of all mine from yeah that's crazy like st. Peter's Basilica and you're walking around that place you just like what my how how did people do this it's Crete Rd man it's honorable unbelievable whole Vatican's no no power saws nothing no no fucking cranes everything was like ladders and shit and the paintings and you are just saying stunning stunning billions of dollars with the art and the whole area the whole Vatican is essentially its own country yeah so they can keep those kid fuckers over there and they never have to export them you know that's this yeah yeah that's the darkest and over no you mean nobody can demand big they'll try people get mad and look I get it I was a Catholic for a little bit that's a dark dark institution there is no denying I mean they just they've just busted another group of priests and in Pennsylvania molested more than a thousand kids no moving them around not charging them organized religion in general is the biggest mind control that's ever existed you know trying to control popular populations and what's the best way I make you believe a certain thing you know I mean but there's there's better ones there's some that you go oh for sure you know sure one of the Baptist's have done what have they done so terrible oh there's no Baptist scandals like that large-scale scandals even the Mormons like they've had a few like dudes who wanted more than one bride that got greedy more than a few like part of their thing that that's how they still live but and there's some sex sect SEC T's that branched off and got real real freaky on the scale that the Catholic Church has done things and I'm it's unprecedented unprecedented completely yeah because they actively shield these people from prosecution yeah and they mean aren't people actually getting like like I've heard some things like they're going after like Cardinals shit like but criminally the last Pope had a step down because they wanted to prosecute him for crimes against humanity oh yeah because he was one of the dudes who orchestrated a lot of that exactly the guy right before then he moved a guy who went on to molest a hundred deaf children yeah I remember reading stuff about that it's dark man it's dark and it's one of those things where people you know it's been a part of their family it's been a part of their families family it's been a part of their history they go to church they pay their respects everything's okay they they don't want to hear it people don't want to hear it but it's over the old what evidence it's just so overwhelming there's so much so much bullshit that's interest employee I mean I think right no I just think again people like you're saying you get I was raised Catholic I just by the time I was like I did this thing called confirmation mmm-hmm just sort of like this a similar thing to what this the time that you're becoming a man you're making choices an adult because it wasn't just men but yeah by the time I did that and realize like okay okay this is there's not a lot or you know there's a little too much magic going on for me you know I mean like going on with this like I like just factual knowledgeable things you know like if these people really existed you know and what are they really like I'm not buying into the fact that anybody on this earth didn't take a shit like I took a shit we all take the same shit it'd be nice if someone came up with a good religion a real solid locked-down one I mean there's there is one you we I mean we'd all just would have to agree on it how about just the the Golden Rule that you know I mean that could basically be a religion in US of the Church of universal law you know do unto others as you would have them do unto you and you could hold corporations to that you could be like alright we stuck what's what's more powerful than ten million people on a Facebook page that are watching these corporations in a minute they say hey you're not giving back to the community or taking care of the people that are taking care of you that's easily done but it takes work it's a good point it's easily done if everybody in the world just really treated the next person like they wanted to be treated themselves there you go and did it as a law right and then we we help people accountable to that yeah you are not responding to the universal law universal golden golden rule you know it sounds super simple but I mean took a lot of work but it's the principle is simple right and all the other stuff like all other forms of Commerce and everything else would still fall under that just like you could do whatever you want as long as you're treating people kindly exactly like ideally Commerce and capitalism all that stuff should be real simple like you have a great CD you want to sell it you want 20 bucks for it so many gives you 20 bucks they're happy you're happy that should be commerce right yeah it should be you sell something people buy it everybody's good greedy if we can figure out a way to go into this market and keep other people from selling this or selling that or we got to stop people from growing this because if they grow this and sell that you're not doing what's best for you're not doing what you would want them to do for to you exactly so it's directly law violation the golden know if you know that's what I've thought about it obviously before like hey man what would be you know nothing like you know that'd be a really cool thing to do you know that would be the way you know there's somebody with enough charisma you know could pull it off you know get people to get behind it that's really all it would take is people getting behind it yeah but the problem is there's so many people that just we're seeing this with politics right like I'm fascinated by these Cavanagh hearings like a watch little clips of it before I just have to tune out and talk about mary talked about fuckery I mean I don't know what that dude did or what he didn't do but I think what's happening is more than that what's happening is first of all he's involved with he was a big part of the Patriot Act he was you know he's involved in some some issues that a lot of people are very concerned with in terms of like how his position is stance on privacy and on rights and absolutely yeah there's more to it than just did you fuck with someone in high school did you sexually assault someone did you do that when you're 18 did you do you remember like there's more to it than that there's there's like they don't want that guy in there and then you're seeing all the people that want to pretend that he's the best guy ever and all the people it's crazy yeah it's fascinating it's really fascinating it's fascinating to watch this is essentially like a less like the the clients Thomas hearings from was it like the 1980s I believe Clarence Thomas I feel like that was eight 80s early 90s yeah somewhere around there Clarence Thomas that was like with Anita Hill or he had sexually harassed her they were working together and she came on whatever coke or something do you know that he's now the longest-running member of the Supreme Court he's he's now been in the Supreme Court longer I think I read that check make sure that's true isn't gru skater kids Bader Ginsberg's should be on their longest surfing 26 years as of October 4th well yeah crazy crazy yeah so it didn't work Anita's hell's out there then with the memory of pubic hairs on coke you know and a movie now an HBO movie not too long ago oh yeah did you watch it I saw it was was it okay it was pretty good movie it was just you know we live through it so it's like it's like whenever I see movies about like the OJ trial or something I'm like no I saw that we saw it live like 700 days yeah I'm always fascinated by those movies because of creative license like if you do a movie on Richard Nixon right would you sure he said that or even crazier you'd do a movie on Lincoln bitch you don't know what the fuck he said you can't be possibly unless he wrote it down you're having him say a bunch of shit day-to-day talk to his wife and kids you don't know what the fuck he says you just making this up this is weird that we're allowed to do that you're allowed to just put some words in George Washington's mouth like you don't know what the fuck George Washington said you know dude it looks amazing Donald Rumsfeld Christian Bale is a fucking bad motherfucker his acting as Dick Cheney is off the charts I mean he does the voice he got fat for it everything that's him whoa dude there's the video of first of all him and Sam Rockwell is George Bush he's amazing too Sam Rockwell is one of the most underappreciated survivors movie vice vice it's amazing dude Sam Rockwell nails it as joy here play the trailer well will they pull us if you folks who are listening this on youtube we can't play this for you but I mean huh that's weird they wouldn't want you to like play their trailer well they want everybody to go to their trailer true oh yeah screens that shit man yeah I'm yeah you're right it's just so good he just does an amazing job of the voice the mannerisms and so to Sam Rockwell yeah well did the other both incredible actors here see Sam Rockwell in that movie moon the moon or moon I'm not sure it's a movie where he is the only person in the movie the entire movie I don't want to spoil alert it but it has to do with cloning and it's him on the moon like him him like or him in space it's fucking amazing it's an amazing movie and it's genuine Chuck Barris yes amazing movie dude he's a beast this guy is a fucking incredible actor and he just doesn't get enough credit I met he's I think he might be married to her now but he was or maybe they're still dating but he was dating leslie bibb when i did a movie with her and i got a chance to meet him and i was a little bit starstruck I'm a big giant fan of that guy but he's one of those guys so I feel like I want to say like dude you're fucking amazing like I don't know if anybody's telling you because you're fucking amazing cuz there's like you know you hear about the great actors you hear at Daniel day-lewis you hear Gary Oldman you know you hear Christian Bale you hear the the great actors Faye Dunaway Sigourney Weaver you don't hear about Sam Rockwell why not Jamie why not goddammit maybe you will after this movie maybe he's never been nominated for anything probably was probably was from moon just nominated a few things that one that just came out last year the three billboards oh yeah that's what I was thinking I just remember hearing about him he was getting you know he's just one of them dudes too like when you're that good of an actor you blend into these movies so good it's not it's not it's not Sam Rockwell right know what I mean like you and that's almost a compliment to the dude now should he be more of a leading guy and doing those big roles yeah I agree he's an amazing actor but he's gotten he's done some really big things man he's just he's one of them do is it just blends too good no who's another one like that Viggo Mortensen yes like everything is in you just lose it yeah in it like these that guy yeah yeah the the one where he was the four Eastern Promises yeah the Russian mob movie yes and then what the year of violence that he did that was a good one so it was a good one here the road freaked me out I turned it off when who's teaching son how to shoot himself in the mouth feels like done we're good I don't need to watch this he's fucking crazy so I heard yeah I've heard the books too crazy dark man like that's that stick it's one of the things like it's like it's a taste that stays with you a little too long those movies that are just so depressing when you leave you're like what did I do like I don't want to be depressed oh god I know that it was good I know you nailed it I know you you dragged my mostly myself once on tour I fuckin it was like back when you got to eat when everyone the Tower Records and those things were still around like on Tuesdays the movies and the records would all come out so we're on tour we would stop and buy a bunch of shit for the bus by records this I bought a bunch of movies and I threw on Magnolia had just come out I watched that and I was like oh wow that was fucking fucked up and then without looking I just grabbed the next movie and put it in and it was Titus Andronicus and I don't know if you're aware like hip to it it's like when the darkest fucking Shakespeare fucking plays ever about this I mean you I just ghost if you ain't seen it when you got the wherewithal to sit through some real fucking darkness Anthony Hopkins is fucking insane in this movie as Titus Andronicus it's fucking dark so I watched these two movies back to back and for two weeks Joe I can't shake the like just depressing like oh my god there's no happy endings anywhere the worlds from then on I'll only watch comedies and fucking like Pixar movies and old Warner brother hang in front of them I do I do you want to know you're never gonna watch this right he's about to cut them up and make dinner out of them and serve them to his own and to their families like it's it's dark man it's really dark it's one of the dark it is the darkest Shakespeare like thing I've ever read or seen okay that's enough and that was right after magnolias double whammy French dude Oh horrible remember that movie 21 grams yeah that movie swore me off at depressing movies after that movie was over I left the theater I'm like why did I do that to myself yeah house in such a good mood yeah who wants to wants to leave a place with that feeling don't doesn't doesn't life give you that enough I was all happy I was all happy feeling good I walked into that movie and I left going what in the actual fuck what am I doing here as DJ Kali would say played yourself myself yeah other people said it before him but he's like known for it it's funny how that happens right or dude just says something just right and then everybody just connects it to him he had a string of them yeah a bunch of his little you know I'm in a meeting uh you know he's got the New Deal alert sees it just sees if he's a bastion of these little sayings that people catch on to he's got a lot of good things going for him he's unthreatening looking cuz he's kind of big chubby guy people like him because of that you know there's a lot of good things going obviously like Charlotte of energy like shiny flashy shit the black people like mmm yeah and he can afford it yeah this is nice hashtag ballin yeah gotta do it yeah I guess so yeah part of that lifestyle that's a crazy lifestyle Kanye's a part of that lifestyle too right but in a weird way he's a weird part of that lifestyle I'm never gonna jewel that jewelry bingo I mean like but he's big on design and you know Ferraris and Lamborghinis and beautiful houses and showing that aware of like woody I know ya design yeah I know it's yeah I know just from what I know of him that he longs to be Ralph Lauren like that's really his you know probably like if you said who is your biggest influence or who would you want a better Ralph Lauren yeah that's kind of hilarious why he just loves design right loves clothes I guess yeah I mean why not somebody's gotta I mean he you know like that stuff he was doing was looking like homeless people clothing into it was like Darrell eat right now fuckin Zoolander did you see that one video picture that Jamie showed me he was walking around with slides easy slides on but they were like four sizes too small I didn't make any sense he's like heels hanging off the back of him well that's the way he designed them exactly that's like he's probably trying to push a new thing yeah he's like here tiny easy slides too small for your feet too small easy slides there you go yeah that's the new look like you know if you're crazy you might think things like it's crazy because there's an era of his career that I look at and I'm like well man there's a lot of genius shit he was doing musically a lot of Records he was doing and then I don't know what it is but to me to me now and I don't say this really in a judgmental way but he's a professional troll now just like that's the most successful people in the entertainment business now if you're not an amazing actor or a super amazing you know yeah whatever is like just keeping people trolling everybody he literally dropped a song like at some point like eight months ago where that was like boopity scoop scoop Adeeb Adeeb ooh boopity boopity whoo yeah and that was the song it lasted that long yeah Jamie came and played for me or you told me the lyrics and shut the fuck up you know but it's like it's again Jamie you stop putting this evil in my head it's the spectacle like I mean I mean I made this album here that's music yeah I mean this is music like people don't give a fuck anymore well you're not that guy you've never been I need publicity guy well here's what it is here's what that is is like people like to fucking speculate about what I do or my career you know I mean I'm written a few songs in this life that I could go somewhere and sit down and just sit on a fucking stump and eat food for the rest of my life I'm never worried yeah I mean I can feed my family and all that off of a few songs I make music so I love making music you know and of course you want people to listen you want fucking two more people to you know you want people you want but I don't I'm not I'm not again one of the first things the first time I ever came on your product has was like I like going to Ralph's and sitting at the Olive bar and fucking getting my olives while my songs playing on the radio and the guys standing right next no fucking idea I don't mind that at all that doesn't bother me I love ya you're not a need attention kind of a guy and some people are and that's sort of part of their business like it's this whole Kanye Donald Trump thing I just I wonder if that's trolling but I also wonder if what we're talking about earlier about car accidents and brain damage I wonder if that's it could be a little bit of everything but also the reason I say it's trolling is because there's likes and stuff when you get to Kardashian Kanye West levels of and I'm sure you know this just you have four fucking million Instagram followers I didn't write Instagram till you told me to I know that but what I'm saying is like you could monetize that shit really easily those four million people you're not that kind you're not selling that shit out these people they are definitely monetizing I should fucking when Kim Kardashian gets on there she doesn't give you a commercial but she'll tell you I'm just using this new cream on my shit you know I mean here yeah somebody paid her on her fucking fifty grand for that post you know it's like yeah that's that's so the more eyes the better that's really what they're monetizing is like I can if I had ten million people on my Instagram I could sell fucking posts the real problem with that is people don't believe them you know what you but their eyes are still if I if I say I like something it's because I like it like if and this is people Baku's me and having ads I've never had a single ad on my Instagram if I tell people about a product and people like what do you do you getting paid for this like nope nope nah I just like it yeah Sharon some I thought you might think is cool is it cool done a few times but I usually say hey I'm not getting fucking paid I'm just telling you plus I ain't got enough Instagram followers to keep saying you need 70,000 I don't I don't you know I don't yeah I know you don't give a fuck but if you did if you were check with a fake butt you might be able to get a little I might have 4 million followers yeah you might right you might have 20 look at this Kim Kardashian's got a hundred and eighteen million followers Wow good googly moogly okay and let's say what do they say if you're if you're actually good at social media maybe ten percent of your audience engages you so that's still 10 million people that will engage with her that's a lot of people fun I believe I'm through that number out there just kind of yeah a lot of goddamn people whoo yeah it's a weird business Matt's famous now like when we were young famous was you know if you're on TV or the radio you know or you know movies did if you did something in life wrote a book yeah wrote a play or a movie you know I mean yeah did the plane that's what got you famous now you just got to keep eyes on you you ain't fucked up shit I was thinking about that today while I was watching gladiator because what I was watching that movie I was thinking the in the Roman times there was no accountability like for Emperor's you could do all kinds of fucked up shit and no one could do anything about it they killed you eventually or you got away with it for a long period of time but today you know like there's so much there's so much accountability people find out what awful things you've done they find out you've stolen money or had people killed or you know took over this or dominated that like to be a like to be a dictator like a kim jeong-hoon like someone some along those lines today you have to keep those people locked up like and he's barely keeping that together they barely haven't have you it amazes me how they can like you know like there's not a whole scene there of people with the internet like sneaking it in and you know what they did everybody rats and everybody else there they'd have like a whole system of Wratten on people they have a culture of rats yeah and they believe they're leaders of God or something of that name they just don't want to die man they're scared and they're hungry and they don't have any power and they don't have any energy because we're eating just rice and fucking starving to death even imagine it when they catch those dudes that sneak across the border you know that make a run for it and when they get them and bring them to a hospital and patch him up and shed they find all these crazy parasites in them massive malnutrition and these are soldiers like North Korean soldiers they're just all fucked up and this but that's a window into time like if you went back into the Roman days this that's how everybody was rocking it they were all dominating their people and using iron fists and keep you know keep these generals well-fed and keep the army well-fed and use it to dominate the civilians and who I mean I know gladiator is just a movie and just fake and you know fun but still you got to wonder like that how close was that to life back then and how bad did it smell oh how bad I mean like tubes have shapes to be a show and HBO called wrong like where they had like and they had this one scene I remember it like where they were all in like a public toilet a shitter II shitter II sure shitter II and they handed him like what at the time was I guess the toilet paper which was like you know calfskin rags or something and they booking like white dress and they walk out and throw it in a pile it's like how could that have smelled if that's accurate if that's accurate you know I mean well that Roman public toilets only would go into like a tube and that tube would go right down the street yeah I imagine how the whole city smell shit well that's one of the reasons why all those people got sick like when a disease would spread through the city I mean there was no sanitation it was terrible but I mean how did they didn't have like flushable things right nothing flushed had developed aqueducts so they just had a system of flowing water but it wasn't pressurized or anything so I just had to pick it up one of the things that that was cool about Pompeii was they had a sauna they had figured out how to boil water and then they had the water would go through the floor in the walls they had like like double spaced walls so they had one outside wall on the inside wall and the heat would go through and it would go like through set and so you could go into this sauna and you'd just like a regular sauna here and be hot as fuck in there yeah there's Pompey Sano that's it like they figured out how to make things pretty cool for what they had but fuck living back there but meanwhile tell me people are gonna think like that a thousand years from now about us those dummies shitting into a ceramic bowl and then hitting the water to flush it away idiots I can't imagine what its gonna be like dude we installed these toilets here that shoot hot water up your butt you know those up or just cleaning until right in the hole Wow it shoots right in that hole you got to be careful feels like you have to take a shit cuz it gets up in there shit again but no it's just the water is literally getting through the door but it cleans your butthole so nice and after you have one of those you're like why would I ever use a regular toilet yeah it was like in the 90s in Japan yes Japan yeah yeah that's why I experienced it too yeah yeah but me for me was just a few years ago but Jamie says he holds a shit is that correct preferred versus at home like why would why should at home if you like it makes I have to ship you like I could keep this one and at bay for me obviously honestly I mean like is Europe up a day as a normal thing in a hotel room it's not here as much this long is good though I have a bidet in my house and never used it once it's a magazine rack I throw magazines there yeah it's just weird it's weird it just doesn't work it is it's and I think it's more for women like no yeah it's a cooter cleanser yeah but um here's here's something funny's like I just did this tour Europe and we started noticing like and I'm not gonna name countries like you know because I have fans and all my don't want anyone to get upset but we noticed there's a difference of some countries you can you get wash cloths in your bathroom in some countries you don't hmm and me and my band you know came to the conclusion that from now on whenever we come to these countries where you don't get to wash cloths in your hotel room we're not gonna shake hands with people the head mini why don't you have washcloths in the bathroom I don't get it yeah what do you wash your hands with bro wow you could wash your hands like this what are you watching your arse with man in your hand crack up right what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing I don't mind if you wash your face with your hands I can't find a washcloth this summer they have garden hoses attached to the toilet they don't fuck around with all that hot spicy food they know it's gonna come out messy so they give you a goddamn garden hose to clean your asshole where was this Thailand in Thailand everywhere even the airport what's the toilet the airport right next to the shit box was this goddamn garden hose I mean like one you would wash the car with like the pistol grip one yeah whoa just get that fucker back there and whoa whoa there it is right there garden hose bomb gun they called bomb gun was in Thailand keep yourself clean with a squirt of water yeah a squirt that shit that she could move a boat across a dock yeah Wow the direction our conversations taken today before you use it the British call the toilet hose the bum gun for a good reason the nozzle at the end of the hose is shaped a bit like a gun with a trigger the press to release the water yeah Wow yeah they don't fuck around in time Vinitaly obviously it's beautiful there people are so nice it's one of the like friendliest places I've ever been in my life like universally friendly and everybody looks at you they all do this they make their hands like a lotus flower that's what they do they don't shake hands a lot they just touch their hands together and give you like a little bow yeah there is there is there a washcloth they just it's the tie their hands are tired from holding onto that hose squeezing that bum gun something but the food there is fucking amazing if you like Thai food man you learn like from like the way they cook it in the motherland you know with all those fresh ingredients I love Thai food you a spicy guy oh I've been sans being in Thailand this spot I was in a place in Melbourne Australia we spoke about earlier the hottest Thai food I ever had in my life like so hot you're sweating and you can't stop eating it because the minute you stop eating it you're gonna catch fire I've never been to exotic Thai over on Ventura and Woodland Hills I feel like I have Oh super legit monic time bunch of Thai people running super nice people food is jamming you know there's a spot right here close not far from general area Jasmine Thai oh yeah yeah there's a bunch of good Thai restaurants in LA you've heard - what's that place on Sunset that's open real late oh right there next to our lame white boy Thais great - man that's a that's a great late-night spot like legit Thai food you get it two o'clock in the morning the Thais T they're amazing that shit's terrible for your diabetis though there's like a hundred and eighty grams of sugar yeah that's tough but it's so delicious here it's so delicious but honestly you know I did say I used to drink so much coke and that's that's another when we talked about wait that's the first thing I got rid of man was drinking coca-cola weight falls off about 20 pounds of the 30 in that crazy five now just falls off yeah you realize like what was I doing yeah was i doing to myself that in just a little bit of cardio and I was like every other day I was like whoa I just lost like like I said 35 now because I dropped five pounds out on the road that I didn't even realize not even weren't trying Wow just continuing just because L think that and I think that food in Europe is a lot cleaner just in general yep yep well they don't have a lot of our first of all their wheat is like what you would call heirloom wheat yeah they don't have a lot of the complex glutens and our wheat to make it a little bit more difficult to process this is all a real thing like people think there's some sort of uh like that people are exaggerating the effects of gluten and gluten intolerance the issue is that at one point in time bread was different it was just wheat was different but it was a lower yield so say like if you had a crow an acre and you were planting wheat on it you would get way less wheat out of that acre then you would with the newer wheat and the newer wheat is just more complex glutens in it and you get a higher yield and so that's what they're looking for and but when you eat it it's as hard to digest and it's just when I was in Italy man everybody skinny okay they're all eatin bread they're all eating pasta they're all eating pizza they're all skinny at the most these dudes who don't work out at the most get like a little punch the most they're drinking wine every night they got a little punch they also walk a lot more than us they also write bikes a lot more than us like though all those things a lot of time in Holland this last trip and you couldn't find a fat person just biking everywhere biking everywhere and they're eating cheese and bread all day yeah it's like literally every meals like cheese and bread with your meal they must be pissed that weeds legal everywhere else because people used to go to Holland specifically shops over there and they're like yeah there's there's a lot of fuck what's going on right now is there's um if I understood what he was telling me right Canada is investing shit tons of money with the government over there to like corporate to like start growing corporate we'd like and they're gonna phase out the locals and take it over like coffee shop because they're it wheat isn't legal in Holland rights decriminalized if you own a weed shop you can only have let's say 500 grams of time in the shop legally all right if you have a good shop you're moving that you know in a fucking afternoon right so and getting bringing weed to your shop is illegal like it's like it's a smuggling operation that's to be in there once it's in there it's okay once it's in there you can sell it but getting it to your spot is wrong it's it's fucking illegal to move that much weed it's fucked up like these guys I have know a couple guys I own a couple coffee shops and they're just like it's fuckery man you know didn't it's like a constant it's like half a criminal operation they're running and it used to be that you get mushrooms you should be able to get mushrooms used to be able to get like a bunch of shit and now you can't not like hard like narcotics like coke or anything like that but anything natural like mushrooms you could get acid when I was first in there I don't know if that was legal cuz I was really young I just well Holland just a wild ass place I mean that is the spot where like some of the best kickboxing ever came from it's weird one little spot in Europe and they created Ramon Decker's Rob came in Ernesto Hoost like some of the greatest kick boxes of all time yeah oh this one Jim everywhere everywhere you go you see them with nugget Jim it's amazing yeah I mean it's just amazing that this one place became a hotbed for real source of their prize for kickboxing or probably the top two things I mean they literally have created some of the all-time greatest kick boxers and it's not a big country it's really and some of the greatest kickboxing coaches as well but some it's amazing really unusual really unusual that that happened there and it's it's hard to describe why like no one really to be an interesting like documentary figure out the roots of that somebody went to Thailand you know somebody brought it back in Ireland and yep switched it up and put their own little spin on it yeah and a few guys went over to Thailand fuck some ties up too because what they had done is they incorporated a lot of Western boxing like Ramon Decker's in particular was one of the greats and what he did was he was a small guy like the same size as the Thais which was unusual because a lot of the people from Amsterdam are big people it's one of those places where I think the average height for a person who tops terms like six feet tall yeah so it's an unusually tall place biking yes shit going on yeah some fucking Viking DNA I was watching that show for a while Vikings I got deep into that show that show was pretty dark but mrs. Rogan got tired of seeing people get sorted up and slashed to pieces she got bored with this it was pretty dark people just getting fucked up with arrows cut open and it's the whole show they're always going to war but they did their Viking yeah and they they took a lot of mushrooms they said pillage I believe is a Viking Way of life if you could go back in one time to like if you had like a time machine you go back and watch one time in history what what do you think you would go to see hmm you go to see how people lived well at being very smell sensitive it wouldn't be that far back no that's not true I probably like you know King Arthur yeah like that kind of thing I was heavy dungeons and dragons yeah it may be good good cuz see if there's anything to any of that dragon shit you know they go holy ground I mean any of that dragon shit yeah I wonder what that was all based on like why there's so many dragons in in folklore in Chinese folklore and European folklore there's so many unrelated dragons I mean you know there's people in a vixen you know yeah I watch a lot of ancient aliens so they'll always have an explanation man with the air George's is a podcast a long time ago I love that guy dude is amazing this much favorite dude on that show man he's good dude I don't necessarily agree with everything they say not everything but that stairs a-coming there's merit to some of it man there's a show you watch with your boys and like 1 o'clock in the morning you get baked and everybody laughs you ever watch the Vice version we're like the Action Bronson guys are getting bleep fucking nonsense but it's if you're high it's fucking fun to watch he came on the podcast I never seen a dude smoke more weed in my life he smoked by himself at least 6 blunts during the podcast Wow that dude abs so hard man I don't think the weed really fucks whatever anymore man I can think it takes that much weed he just kept going I got paranoid just watching him I'm like oh I mean I smoked a little bit with them but I mean I got to keep the ship on the water let me keep my hands on the wheel sir like he just kept going with that we took a photo of the ashtray after it was over was preposterous I was like look at that that's one show wait that's easy he's a crazy guy man fun dude though no he's a good guy I love that fuck that's delicious that show you know that's a great show you you know without alchemist is a good friend of mine I've known him since he was you know they're good buddies I've met him upon what a few time he's a really fun guy man it's a unique idea for a show because you know Action Bronson used to be a chef yeah yeah so seeing him like interact with food and she's like he's really knows about food it really understands for you no I think you should have a cooking show we actually you know can whip up some fucking mean food yeah right like we like now that Bourdain's gone but we need more of those kind of shows that explore food and Bourdain show changed the way I feel about food I used to think of food as just something that tastes really good I didn't think of it as an art form and then I watched his show and you know the reverence that he had for chefs and for the creation of food and made me realize like oh this is an art form that I was ignorant of I didn't think of it the right way on all levels not just like the high chef's level he brings it to like the home front where it's like even local was making sandwiches yeah no you're right man like on street food level he loves Tony loved street tacos and shit he would go everywhere in buy Street food I mean honestly when you're cooking you feel like that don't know you cuz now I see you cooking all the time whenever you're posting it should never invite me over to have someone else's good it's gonna set it up here I was gonna set a thing up here but they can never figure out how to get ventilation here we have a grill back there that's never been used it's just sitting back there look at me he's taking a steak I wonder why see this is how house Tony his show is like they let him wear a shirt that you can't wear so they had a blur out of shirt that's such a Stoney thing okay man you can't wear that shirt all yo I got it all that's it this is what I'm wearing so do what you gotta do exactly so they gotta follow him around that blur thing drives me nuts like what is it what could it possibly be tits oh but it's there's there's times when I see sake that back all right back when he had that loser video the first thing that comes up on the video is him in a mask that's blurred oh right and I and I was like what the fuck why would why would where he was purposely done like I think sometimes maybe it's like yeah it's like what the fuck being a weirdo yeah but what it makes you go like but what the fuck is it he's a fascinating guy too you know he's a devout Scientologist yeah which is his dad did is an amazing string arranger like an Orchestrator and he weren't he did a couple like of my albums where I'm gonna had string arrangements and stuff really yeah yeah I mean he's a legit musician not really a magician Mecca is next level you don't hear about him that often again another damn thing I think it's the same kind of thing dude it doesn't he's not playing the game we just I mean you know he makes music just an artist when it's time to make music it's time to make music yeah there's still I mean in other words it for me I'm sorry too you know but it's not it's it's like okay this is a product this record right but it's not a product to me it's like I just eight years of my life yeah I mean I didn't make it because I was concerned about kima otherwise that's why the guy the guys they got to put a record out every year those are the guys I'm like whoa how do you fuckin that's all--that's you know right that takes a lot to put a fuckin ring especially if it's gonna be good so anybody they can put out a record every year that's good that's next level yeah well Louie CK was doing that for a while with stand-up yeah you know that is hard to do George Carlin did it every year George Carlin did a stand-up special every year and to us to all stand-up comics where we all get together and talk about that everybody kind of Gries it's almost impossible he did it but very few people could do it and made it mean not to criticize Carlin because Carlin did it and pulled it off but most of us feel like that's not enough time like you need more time to let it cook need more time to add and twist I've never had a record come out like I think the shortest period would be was like two years two and a half years and that's you probably just constantly going out and yeah any time I wasn't touring or something and we get locked in a room somewhere trying to make music now when you record when you will like say if you're gonna lay down an album do you have everything completely mapped out before you go into the studio or do you fuck around with it while you're in there well the process for this album in particular was wild because again when Leila was born and the disease we we found out she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis I actually was planning to not tour any of that anymore but I was gonna write songs I was gonna go to I went to Nashville started hanging out with a few songwriters out there and wrote some stuff one of the songs it ain't easy which I played years ago on your podcast is on this album so I wrote some songs with people but the intention was it was they were gonna be for other people so I recorded them in a very kind of plain-jane way not my spin on what they would have been and after a few years like I just never really pursued it's too much of a sales pitch I had what I had you have to go out and like be that smoother selling your songs and I just never repealed to me and so after a few years I'm just I did an acoustic record and then I started touring that for a while just old songs but we recorded them acoustically and then after that was done and I realized alright you know I need to keep working what I'm gonna do I went back and revisited some of these songs but I realized after we record him that's why I didn't see that they were my songs because I recorded them to my way that I thought other people would want to use them hmm so I went and re-recorded about I don't know five or six of the songs that were already here and then my buddy evidence from dilated peoples got involved with me and we recorded a few of these rap tracks and it started kind of coming together and it kind of started coming together in a similar way that the original whitey Ford sings the blues record that's why I kind of also named it what it is there was a lot of similarities and I feel like I just pulled everything from every part of the toolbox that I've learned from since I started you know what it was the ice-t years or the House of Pain years or the whitey Ford years I just drew on it all and trying to see what you like I said it was the eight years of life it's not like a literal representation of what's happened to me but it's an emotional journey of like all the kind of feelings and shit that I'm a lot of struggles and a lot of it's it's it's it's my best record you know but eight years right here so I've never been in no rush that's a big statement that it's your best record it's my best record ever I'm confident in it sees it available everywhere like oh yeah streaming shit out of it I own my masters how does that work if you get more than this dream well if you own your masters you get paid outright like you know you're the label I'm my own label so the reason the people that complain about not getting paid by streaming are people that are signed to record deals that are getting a small piece of what the Masters getting if you own the master you know so streaming is viable for someone who owns the mail yeah yeah I mean it's viable period I mean kids I mean that's the way it is it's just the it's the future I mean now but the people who say it doesn't pay they're in shitty deals yeah I mean cuz it pays no I would like it to pay a little better but it pays it pays alright who was it I think if you take a million streams it equals out to around eight thousand dollars that sounds like it just in general like that's the payment from for what that is to look to a label like it would be around a label yeah yeah like a million streams is about the equipment about eight grand and uh that doesn't sound like a lot but a million streams is like you know a thousand guys that or people fans of yours that stream your shit whatever a thousand a hundred times everybody you know it's not it goes quicker do you think like I think Drake like streamed a billion streams his first week right you know that's a nice chunk of change man David Crosby was tweeting about how bad streaming deals are but that is because he has a bad deal as he doesn't know his master yeah if you know if he's like recording a deal for another record for the record company you know I mean and he's all his older songs oh that's yeah then he's probably got shit deals and I mean some of my older stuff I don't get paid on what I feel like I should but it's like this stuff since I've owned my masters which is the last 15 years of my life you know I mean it's fascinating for me on the outside looking at what happens with labels and how that how they do things it's it's just it's amazing they're sort of survival instincts how they figured out how well their labels are signing podcasters now because of streaming streaming like you should be getting checks from this Joe I don't don't allow them to stream me but what honestly you could be coming Doris Spotify I say nope well you'd probably have to be exclusive to one of them as the deal too well either way what they are is just it's not just streaming though digit your YouTube views are streaming that's that's streaming I just doesn't have to be with the streaming service but you you should have a digital company that is representing you that's collecting all that if you don't ya know just make sure yeah but that's streaming it's you know the YouTube thing the most fascinating thing about it is that there's only YouTube that's the the crazy thing we think about how big the Internet is and there's really only one thing like YouTube it said it was a good moment they came and the branding and everything they did I mean I saw like I don't know if it was a documentary because it wasn't full-length but it might've been just like a little like feature like it within a news kind of segment thing about how they you know the original videos that were huge on on YouTube were like a kid biting another kid and like the original first for the longest time the most played video on YouTube was the Charlie bite in the chaos on it all came from like it almost came from America's home video like Funniest Home Video kind of thing YouTube kind of filled in that void for a long time they were memes before they were memes they were just viral videos you know what's crazy it's like a decade ago and well I mean the necessity of having to change the music business is what changed YouTube you know because they caught on like RI TVs doesn't play videos anymore right and nobody's buying records so we gotta sell you know the old the whole thing for the longest was like when the bottom had really fallen out for a while of making any money off of actual records was like well you can bootleg my record and you can download my record but you can't download the t-shirt right so the game sell the lifestyle so the music became background music to the you know everything else it was part of the lifestyle and the cars and this and all I wanted you to do is really go buy this limited edition t-shirt that I'm so mean right now you know right that's what that's the game changed into and still that you know I mean that's why the fuckery and the troll ISM and all that because people want eyes on them so the next thing they have the opportunity to sell they can sell yeah that's what's interesting to me about labels is now labels get a piece of everything they do these 360 deals yeah don't just say easing that you what that was unheard-of you can give peace knowing t-shirt sirs you get pieces they get a piece of live money yeah ever you know it's like how it used to be like I had to pay you I used to be like alright a record label would give me half a million dollars alright and I'd go and make a record with that I'd I could spend whatever I wanted making the record and whatever the rest of money leftover was mine that 500 grand was mine expended all making the record or I could spend 50 grand making the record and pocket the rest that was up to me and then after that my job your job as a label is to sell that record my job was to hit the road and go tour right and I go tour for a few years and at first I'm not even making money touring you're giving me money to go out there and tour it's called tour support that used to be and that I could get added on to your bill you didn't get paid no you would get like money for tour but like it wouldn't cover like a bus and a band and all this so that write the label would supplement that with what they call tour support which would also become part of the debt you owed the label right but as you built your live audience your guarantees would go up sooner or later you could stop taking that money and then your record sales would pay that off hopefully if you were doing well enough and now you got your own stream of revenue with live t-shirts all this other outside shit that it's yours that's that's what I came up now it's like that's not a deal you think they want it all they sneak that in well if because when Napster and shit dropped the bottom out of the record business and nobody was paying for records labels weren't gonna and give you a half a million dollars just for your record because nobody was buying records they want to sell your t-shirts to it's not amazing note they figured out how to stay alive like that just because they always knew that people are gonna be needy it always it all boils down to this - and I host somebody one day like really investigate system makes some sort of like documentary about it is like they had so many opportunities to be ahead the movie industry didn't take the same hit they took hits and they dealt with piracy but they the music industry had a moment if you remember there was like some kids that got in trouble for downloading ridiculous amounts of music and their parents were being held responsible yeah and the music industry backed off of it because the news wasn't good the movie industry never backed off of that kind of shit they told you we're gonna fucking suit your life off for you some people did get sued for your music but the music industry backed off though they would have peddled down and keep the foot on the neck like you're gonna steal this this cost you gotta remember back then if I were to got a half a million dollars I probably would have spent up to two of that on a record two hundred thousand dollars just on them making studio time whoever's got to be involved engineers producers 200 grand off top just that's minimum we would have spent on a record and then it gets you go out and people steal it right yeah I mean it's the same you know would you ever download shit for free um my thing we could not at first my thing became later like okay this is what this is the way whatever but if I doubt my philosophy was if I downloaded your shit and I liked it I would go I'd go buy it meet you my god if I if I downloaded it it was trashed invade I looked at his like a taste test that's okay yeah okay maybe cool it down did that do things would but again the record industry had plenty of opportunities to jump ahead of it and be they didn't there was technology out there already that people were dealing with some bringing it son I'm telling this wave is coming so when the record industry was making so much money at that time if you look at the amount of money they were making off of the boy bands and the Britney Spears is enough the more it was retarded how much money was in the record business and they let it all go down the drain because they when they thought they had all the answers and they thought it had all of money and what could they have done to stop it I'd have to go but I have some like books on its technological forestry well there were people ready there to help set up things like nasty and how to monetize it in controlling there was ways to deal with it there were ways to be part of it instead of like wait till it was too late well think about the movie industry too though is that like people want to go to the movies like the experience is not as good Apple music saved the music industry like Apple at first iTunes why didn't the recognized trees like there were people telling them this is coming and I didn't mean interrupt you but I did darling they could have made iTunes first not called iTunes but like the record industry itself should have digitized and been ready would have been that simple come up with their own version of iTunes and invent and they could have invested a lot more money the music industry is booming but artists are losing big because most artists are signed to record deals with just 12 percent of revenue twelve percent forty three billion dollars a year was its most profitable year since 2006 you know listeners are spending more money than ever largely on streaming and live music with consumer spending totaling more than twenty billion dollars last year Wow yet artists aren't feeling the increase of that twenty billion music industry entities such as record labels took home 10 billion musicians taking home just 5.1 billion with the majority of the revenue coming from touring and concert sales it's amazing that's amazing that the it's like a parasitic industry it's like you they don't people don't necessarily need them the way they used to need not that like they used to I was gonna just play devil's advocate and say well it used to be that I'm the guy to put up all the fun if I'm the label I'm putting up millions of dollars in advance gambling it on you now when you win you want to take away my lion's share now fuck you now it's totally different now you can do this on your own yeah yeah I mean you could start an Instagram started YouTube start this and you can make beats on your laptop like living rapper right isn't that the guy who does everything everything he's done is his own shit online sure sure you don't believe it exactly Oh Jamie's got a conspiracy theory not conspiracy buddy he's got more support than he would say now he does yeah now it does maybe but I mean he basically he's become huge all on his own right and you look it's like so many viral music hits you know they get they get big online just because kids share it and they like it and then it becomes gigantic like with the music industry the the industry the the labels have nothing to do with that right no there's labels that are doing their thing out there they actually know what they're doing and marketing wise and only there's still a lot of kids that are being made you know famous by label so there's some benefit yeah I mean there's a lot least a lot of the reason with some of these artists are only seeing five point one minutes cuz they're signed to record deals you know jay-z ain't only singing five you know five percent of what you know he's do because he you know he's been in the game long enough you know and they started out with their own label they started getting roc-a-fella records was independent so that's the kind of you know those kind of guys are never gonna lose as long as you know they can still make music that people buy yeah they figure out a way to rope you in early to where like even if your record is successful the second record you it's not like you're gonna be able to be independent on the second record they'll you they own you for several down the line right usually I mean it used to be I think the standard was like eight eight yeah yeah but it's it's that but that's it that's it's it's it's misleading because it depends on your firm to there's also like you know if your first record is very successful and you have a lawyer that has anywhere with all your renegotiating before you do second record you know I mean these things you learn but like if you're struggling that right eight record thing to also if you study the record business it goes back to like when actually artists used to be built that like over what nobody expected the first album to do anything like when we would sign bands like in the 60s about you know they had a plan like my album three and four here's where we'll be you know they were just a build artist there used to be a NR they actually used to nurture and fucking take care of a band for a long time and watch them grow you know that's the way it used to be until like you know the whatever was I maybe the 80s had changed I had a record deal for my comedy album in 1999 I had a record deal with Warner Brothers I was like a real record deal like met with them they promoted it the whole deal like I went through the whole record industry business there was always a comedian or two on label I don't have that anymore because how many albums do yourself well such as that you definitely can do it yourself but comedy albums just aren't that popular anymore for some strange reason well because it's a it's it's a piss port which is also the art form you want to watch it exams about to say it's some it's so visual that now comedy albums were big when everybody didn't have a TV screen or everybody it was like you could listen and imagine what we would he was doing or saying something guys translate super well like Mitch Hedberg translates amazing to CD to just audio only because his he basically just stands there and tells great jokes like he doesn't have like there's no it's fun to watch him more fun to watch him but one to know what he looks like and how he does it it's like kind of cool to listen to it on the album's I was just talking about Steven Wright the other day - only Steve Wright was genius he was amazing yeah but that that style is hard to do see what what Mitch Hedberg basically did was do that Steven Wright style but like a more stony drug style yeah but but the drugs allowed him to come up with way more of those things head per could just go on for days he had so much fuckin material man that guy wrote constantly he was always writing till the end in the end you know the drugs got to him obviously they killed him but he was his that's a that's a non-sequitur style that's the hardest style of comedy you say one thing and then you say something totally unrelated the next joke and the next joke totally unrelated no no sequencing or no man and you you know it's all segways I'm sorry yeah but sequency - it's like they don't don't fit in together in any way way shape or form they're just total non sequiturs just here's a funny thing I thought of here's another funny thing I thought of you know and it's but his style was so unique just the way he delivered things were so unique he was funny just talking about nothing like talking about anything one of my favorite jokes are his he goes he goes somebody asked me if I want a frozen banana I said no but I want a regular banana later so yes just silly joke but it's such a great job that's a STONER joke oh man all day he's got like one of the best his albums are some of the best donor material of all time maybe the best it made me go listen to some oh here's incredible man I'm familiar I just haven't listened to it hurt any of I'll throw come on every now and again when I'm on my way to the airport I used to listen to on serious all the time the comedy channel that the dirtier darker one you know the more grown-up one and he pop on there everyone yeah yeah yeah yeah I haven't had serious and forever do you still know that you still listen to that no because I didn't yeah I just I don't really honestly my favorite thing in the car is silence really yeah my my myself like I get a lot of thinking done driving I guess or like if I'm ever really like stumped while I'm working on a song like because I don't write things down or anything like just I'll get in a car and driving and somehow it'll work itself out I can really just relax been behind the wheel yeah I know what you mean unless I'm in like the middle of like fucked up sure I'll be like at night I can get in a car I could drive on an open road and it'll just it really relaxes me I have a car that I take to the comedy store all the time and it's a 1993 Porsche doesn't have any radio no radio it's manual transmission no power steering no air conditioning it's just it's just an old car and everything like when when you drive it you feel every bump and mmm you shift it but because of all that I have to think and it makes it fires my brain up because I'm doing all these different things hitting a kludge shifting the gears you know managing this heavy steering wheel and all that jazz and when I get to the store my brain is like charged up because of it it's like I've been doing a bunch of things it's like exercising your band I'm not like in the back seat sleeping you know waiting to get to the show and then I leave myself up I love to drive you still got that crazy Audi no now right now I have a guy just bought a truck actually and I got a CLS 63 s couldn't bring the kids in the Audi but I'm actually I miss it so much I'm actually about to get another one they have a new one you know it's a piece I was like alright I got to hit the road for about three months I'll be back for that car it's an amazing car yeah it's a good time if you're into cars they've got a lot of crazy ass fucking automobiles now yeah when I did have the Aria man I was just like and then I lived much further south actually lived off 215 like below the 91 and I would when I would shoot two sometimes it off to Vegas for fights I was just jump in the r8 like on a Thursday night like 11 o'clock I'd be there by 2:00 I get there like 3 hours like Jesus I mean I was ready on the 15 I wasn't coming from DPLA still jeez yeah how do I do like a fucking box yeah the whole way that fast that's a four-wheel-drive car to that detect cars glued to the ground it's like on fucking rails man it's one of my favorite cars I've ever driven yeah it's thick in the style like it's still relevant like they've kept that style basically with just a little few will facelifts and improvements for a few years essentially like a mini Lamborghini right it's the same engine yeah it's the Cardo the same engine as the guy orders a video I mean it's more than enough power the crazy thing about today's cars are so they have so much power it's just ridiculous like every year it's like a new faster zero to 60 time new records on the Nurburgring it's like what are you doing like where are you taking this like what are you gonna drive this thing that fast you know it's gonna be teleporting fit the new Corvette zr1 has 700 and something fuckin horsepower that is how does the house even stay on them you know it barely does that one of the drivers from GM one of like the head execs from GM took it on a race track like when they were first releasing it and crashed like immediately spun out and slammed in the fucking wall you gotta know what the fuck you're doing if you're throttling I mean you have to be able to navigate that throttle with 700 horsepower because no matter what those wheels are spinning I'm gonna how much especially rear-wheel drive no matter how much traction control you see that video see finally it's fucking hilarious it's a good video to watch to let you know like this is a crazy vehicle that you people are selling you're you're letting people get a car that is so much faster than anything that was on the road five years ago I mean it's a fucking insane mobile and the speed limit ain't changed yeah you know where that car comes in handy Germany yeah yeah GM exact crashes new Corvette zr1 I mean he got this before it was even released this dude Sammy and I got an extra one he ain't sent me that one yeah funny I was talking about this kind but I'd like liked a picture his so long ago and like here it is like this guy mm-hmm play that again watch this play it for the beginning this knucklehead started too quick I'll see if there's more angles on no no no look at this right away this is this guy hey I know how to drive I'm a fucking executive Wow yeah he's driving like an asshole he doesn't know how to drive he's sorry sir put the foot down yeah he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing dumbass look that's a car that you have to know how to navigate once aside when the ass end kicks out - he was just stomping it yeah I'm sure he got he felt a nice amount of shit at the next board meeting well he should look at that fucking car though good lord what a beast of a retailer for it's more than a hundred I think it's like a hundred fifty hundred sixty thousand probably fully loaded but it is a monster see but you know where your r8 has a huge advantage your heart your r8 is a four-wheel-drive car and 755 horsepower good load good low winds I'm saying good lord but the the problem is it's hard to keep all that power down on the on the ground with a rear-wheel drive car you're just gonna get a lot of sliding and if you know how to drive you like that people who know how to drive they want to kick the ass into out sideways and yeah but like if you drive a like say a Nissan GTR it's perfect example one of the best things about that car is a regular person can drive it pretty fast because there's a lot of electronics and what they were called nanny controls it sort of keep everything in order so that car has been around for a long time they really haven't changed a whole lot about the way it looks they've but they've made these incremental improvements and performance and to this day that is one of the Beasties cars you could drive that car is a mother fucker I ran in one of those in Austin last year holy shit was it fun it's a crazy car to like does it defies logic like it defies physics that's the Nismo one you don't want that one unless you want to take it to a track because that shit's harsh as fuck you just want the regular one the regular one is beastie enough they're amazing cars though all the pop-up windows trying to get you to buy it come on buy it I'm sorry this my buy it buy it buy it but really if I was gonna get a brand new Japanese car the real car to get now is the new NSX it's a new NSX TJ Dillashaw has one he brought it in here and I was checking down outside fuck man it's got electric engines on top of the the regular engines it's a it's an amazing car just fucking amazing and it's gorgeous other accurate okay and they have a 2019 ones coming out then as even more improvements but it's hard for them to sell these cars because like look at how good that looks look how good that looks God still kind of partial to the Audi out he's a beast yeah I love it look it's just it's apples or oranges it's just what you're into TJ's got that color to that blue pull up 2018 out er 800 look at that gorgeous come on son you got to get silver too cuz it looks like a fucking spaceship that's a monster car look how beautiful that is that's one of the best-looking cars I've ever seen whether they like a book 82 something like that monster monster vehicle just ridiculous before loads of car yeah and easy to drive - it's one of those cars it's just it's glued to the ground four-wheel drive electric power steering or electric engines controlling the wheels crazy brake systems amazing 159 cheese Mo's that's a lot of cheddar cut out but it doesn't have the sound that your car had see the thing about the Audi is they have that big-ass fucking v8 or the v10 depending on which one again that that's that's a different thing man it's a different thing what does that beast alright oh what the fuck 2019 r8 LMS oh that's the race car that's a monster that's gorgeous pull up 2019 ow d r8 people get mad we talk too much about cars I could even afford these cars bro what are you talking about these cars see cuz it's fun that's uh that must be the camouflaged one actually hurts all right I saw on Twitter someone posted a picture they saw one like this driving around was like this weird paint job I've seen that yeah yeah they drive them all over cities and everything like that to test honest them yeah they do that for quite a long I've been around a few of those cars you ever see the one at that date today I'll do it with regular cars I remember when the remember the PT Cruiser yes when that was first like long before it came out like about a year before it came out it was like we'd see this ugly fucking thing driving around these magnetic like covers all over it like so you couldn't see the car but you could totally tell what the shape was right it's fucking hilarious nobody gives a shit about that car anyway what they're gonna steal your design dude I drove one once I had I've rented one cuz it looked kind of cool so I'll take one of those that's kind of cool-looking oh my god with a deathtrap I was driving I was like this thing has zero control like you can't corner in it the brakes suck it's just you look like an old surfer car way worse I've rented a Hummer h3 once I would never even oh good lord and I took it on a dirt road I was in in Colorado we drove up this hill that dirt like every time I was going around a corner who's kicking out sideways then thinking like zero traction it was a terrible car here you have a prowler oh never know interesting Seibert Chip Foose designed that same guy who built my Barracuda or designed by Barracuda not built it yeah yeah no thanks yeah disgusting that was like the hot wheel you hated will you put a firecracker there yeah give me that old Corvette fuck this little thing yeah they tried those they tried those for a while you know it's an interesting time for cars though Val they mean and people are starting to go towards a lecture car so if you driven a Tesla yet No that's a goddamn space machine those things are rocket ships they're so fast they don't even make any sense they don't make any sense they're zero to 60 in like two seconds that's crazy they're so fat there's there's no there's no gears right because there's no trends the transmissions not the same because there's no it's not a combustion engine as to feed in the transmission the clutch just kind of like when you just that roadster press forward on the remote-control cars right it's just exactly just electric car that goes 1.9 second son zero to 60 what in the actual fuck and it can go 620 miles before you have to charge it that's crazy yeah that's gonna be a monster and it yeah and how long you gotta wait to get one probably a maybe you got a word in with your buddy yeah I was not ready yeah it's 2020 they're not gonna start selling them I don't even think they've they're not even in production meanwhile he shot one off into space look how pretty it is though God when nothing comes out that's a gorgeous car that's a cgi though right no real car because I was the one they made remember they had one they shot into space look at that look how fast that fucking thing goes 1.9 seconds 250 plus miles per hour I mean what the fuck that's gonna be one of the most amazing cars ever once it actually comes out yeah that's cuz I'm cool save it be cheddar 200 jeez whoa 250 fully loaded whoa it's just a quarter brick dog that's it founders series reservation what that mean yeah that guy was a weird guy to talk to cuz I couldn't get over all the stuff he does I'm like how do you do all these different things how do you make these and then you make roof panels and then you're like drilling tunnels and then you shooting rockets into space SpaceX yeah okay he's doing everything just because alien you said he was maybe we should listen said it was an alien he might be might be a higher thinking life well he might as well be right if he was an alien and he looked exactly like that I'll be honest when he grabbed a joint in the way kind of looked at it I was kinda like it seemed kind of like a guy who was kinda like oh I'm not familiar with this practice but or maybe he's so smart that he thought it would be funny if he pretended he didn't know what a joint was could be I don't think he didn't know what it was I'm just saying as he was about to partake he kind of had this real inquisitive like yeah but there was a part it was a blunt and he almost seemed like you didn't know what a blunt was like you've never been I believe that really I can believe that the glass tip could have thrown him off because that's a little unique if you're not if you're not familiar not everybody is hip to we culture man as we think you know I mean right but when he said that Tesla was going private funding secured at 4:20 which is 20 million dollars for that joke that joke cost him 20 million dollars the SEC got mad and they find him you know it's almost a little manipulated your stock price is a little bit well that was one of the thickest and your shareholders into a panic Jamie was concerned that they were gonna contact us and see if we arranged that pot-smoking part like if that was something that been arranged in advance because it crashed the stock that was I was like Jesus we didn't do that did we we didn't yeah that was organic folks that was amazing dude that was amazing strange that's what this podcast is for yeah for strange shit strange moments you can't get on NBC well you can't even get it on Netflix you know I mean liquid nor McDonald's show on Netflix like he's uh he's got that thing that he's doing on net with Netflix is probably the most unrestricted of all networks of all things you're trying to do and in terms of comedy there's nothing ever been like it's the greatest thing Netflix for sure is the greatest thing that's ever happened to stand-up comedy ever never been just fucking special you want they give you no feedback they don't they don't give you they don't fuck with you at all they don't they don't censor you they don't tell you what to do they don't me they have some people have said some things that they wanted to edit out what's a number 33 has to be like way way across the line before they they know what Joe Rogan numbers are they you know that's when they come in and they say here's your special we're gonna do this what they know what they know they don't they know you who you are what you do they know they're signing what you are doing your special with you because they know how many eyes you're gonna bring to the channel yeah they know what they're doing but it's still that just having this ability to have something streaming I was like there's never been like if you if you're if you were a person who said oh I want to do a show on you know this network forget about Netflix like if you just decided that's almost like I don't want people to watch this I want people to watch it one time I want it to be on 10:00 p.m. Saturday October 17th and that's it cool how fuck wants that like nobody wants a you want someone to be at the airport with their phone and be going huh I want to go watch the Chris Rock special let me check it out right now BAM amazing and then you're sitting there on your own just watching it there is no live TV and all that's gone the wayside it's useless it's I see commercials now I start laughing it's like ha you fucking dinosaurs but your bullshit ass commercials I just I just finished Ozark did you finish it the second season don't say anything don't say anything I'm still on second episode it's so good Monty ever so where they just where the hand a guy blew the hand Oh earlier don't you should spoil alert that sir what nobody knows why I win or have don't it's people out there I'm just saying Netflix is killing it it stranger things you've watched that you know I'm goddamn Netflix here's what Netflix is for like for me and my wife that's like one of our things we find a show yeah spend some time together it's yeah Ozark she found like you know I mean stranger things I think I found but yeah we that's that's our thing like well like hoseok has been kind of tough for us because we watched the first episode of season two and then I went on tour for a month so we just watched the second one that's like and I gotta leave now so it's like and we can't we don't have time to binge the whole thing so is there any other good ones that I need to know about people occasionally tweet me ones and I forget there's a weird German one called I think dark I mean it's Trent it's it's subtitle this stuff but it's crazy black mirror of course oh yeah like me that's the I watched that shit but that is a weird one that's one of those ones that I watched like I'm stoned I come home from the Comi store and I'm smoking a little weed and I watch that I bet you were talking about the one the star trekky one and that's what made me go look at it and I was like let me go look at it I think I watched in the beginning I think I tried early on and it was the one where the politician at the fuck fuck yeah yeah so and that kind of just was like alright sorry whatever this weird shit and I probably wasn't I was like I don't want in there but then when you told me about that when I went back started there and that was the last season and I worked my way back and actually got to that one again and rewatched it and I was like oh these are all pretty crazy did you see heavy metal you see that one that's one with the drones the drones coming after people oh yeah yeah whoa yeah well that's too close to home I binge-watched black mirror pretty tough over just two or three day period and like for like a couple weeks I was convinced I'm living in a simulation like after watching especially the datings ones were there was nothing that Elon must freak me out about he was saying it's quite possible that we are living in a simulation oh dude I'm always playing with that idea like is it like you posted something the other day of that was like some money oh it was the truck thing we think was that a real t-shirt but it's well it's a real teacher that you can buy but it's not from Donald Trump store it's a company that sell them it's like Trump store dot shop yeah that's fake news it's not fake news it's a real shirt I know it's not his but eat the fact that that's a shirt it says I like beer and it has a guy who's run I mean they're trying to put this guy in a Supreme Court it's fucking hilarious the whole world now the whole world hilarious it's all fucked up yeah but this is one of the cool things about black mirrors like black mirrors showing you like where some things could go in a total dystopian way like where do you see crocodile see that episode is the one where you can we you can record memories and then yes I seen all of them I just don't know the tightest lady remember this lady uh-huh remember this lady with the car accident the beginning and engine company remember this remember this this is that's the darkest of the dark ones that one was so fucked up that one wrecked me oh that was the one where the people could rewind each other's memories and play back yeah yeah which is very hot all that is coming oh that's easily call this shit is coming and there's the one way it was it wasn't super dark but it was that where the chick was trying to up her status in the world yes stars up the Star Trek ones my favorite I think that one was fucking amazed as it going it was amazing and it's just and that is this sort of weird blend of current reality a possibility where it was the chick section and like she doesn't know where she is who she is whatever and everybody's recording she's the murderer that was a crazy one too man it's a fucking amazing show yeah I only did and if you hadn't mentioned the Star Trek when I probably never would have Reba no it's so good there's so many good shows now what else is good what else I need to know about have you seen it it's not a show it's I think a documentary ish it's like kind of like half documentary and then they did some like recreations it's called wormwood no it's all about the acids CIA MKULTRA program is that a Netflix thing it's on Netflix yes wormwood oh you got to check it it's it's dope you know what my favorite one they did you know what operation midnight climax is it sounds to me they ran a brothel and they gave they gave John's the guys would come to the fuckery and they would they would give them acid to run tests on and love to give people acid to shit back in the fifties didn't know whatever wormwood yeah it's really good man it has like a really good actor like doing the playing the main role like when they do the recreations you'll recognize him I forgot his name but he's been in that toy he was in that movie that about the Marines were with a Gyllenhaal where they were in that rack he was his party no no jarhead yeah I was his partner in jarhead he was that guy then a lot of stuff I can remember saying he's really good actor though this is just almost too much good shit to watch today oh yeah another one I watched because he was the the the the documentary uh wild uh oh wow wow wow country and then it all started coming back like I remember that news when we were like when I was young like this game for that at all that started me like oh man I kind of remember this you know I've been reading know what I just watched what three identical strangers mm-hmm oh dude about is a triplets - oh dude I can't even Aspray with it go watch that dumb Netflix thing tense it's it's if it's not on netbooks I got it on I rented it on iTunes for like five bucks three identical strings yes it might not be on Netflix no no but it's it's basically some triplets that were separated at birth and and did I say birth at birth and the story that come in and that's that's the the first 20 minutes is amazing after that it gets crazy like and dark really yeah okay oh yeah making a murderer is that so is that Netflix three identical strangers it didn't say it's a documentary I don't know it could be well wild wild country is just goddamn amazing it was a CNN film so it could be on Netflix today but right now it's on iTunes and you have to rent it so I don't think I found it on Netflix you know what's weird about wild wild country and it's weird about all these crazy sex cults it's like part of it you go yeah like think they got something going on that's right like they're figuring out something like there what I couldn't figure out about that was where was the flash point where this guy became this guy like what was the thing he did that make everybody believe cuz that was never made clear to me right I never understood like okay I can understand people getting this excited about it but what was the thing that he did or said or that and I never understood that part I've been reading this book and it's actually pretty interesting actually right here the art of living and dying and he wrote this book about one yeah he wrote this book after he became Osho or maybe they published it after he became Osho but it's a very good book it's it's weird he's like he had some very good idea you know what I think I left it at home oh no he had some very good ideas like it's like he's philosophically he's a fascinating guy or it was a fascinating guy and there's real good evidence that his followers fucking poisoned him like there's a lot of people I shouldn't say there's real good evidence there's a lot of people that followed the case very closely that believe that people close to him may have poisoned him and taking his making his money so the whole thing it the you know I mean the whole thing was just a massive mind fuck those houses are still there in that place like that that ranch that those guys set up there yeah they're all would have mentioned down they showed at the end of the documentary and you're like wow and there's an interesting another dude I don't know if you ever heard of a guy named dr. Malachi York no did this he he started in New York doing this seems like sort of Islamic sect thing he did and then he brought it into like aliens and and ancient Hebrew stuff he like brought all this stuff together there's all these philosophies and he made this utopian like society in like Georgia oh but like the dude was like doing mad criminal shit and they got it I don't know if there's any movie about this but this dude was like smiley he is yeah um it's it's an incredibly crazy story damn they put him away for a hundred and thirty five years yeah he was doing some quays like stuff like sex cult stuff was going on with stuff in it and always becomes that you know Wow who live yeah there's it's so and I've because I've never seen diff I've read this and that so it's like there's motherfuckers who say it was like he's set up and all this shit and that he had such a perfect society going that they nobody wanted that I would succeed you know that's a you know but like I mean I'm pretty sure it's been proven that the dude was doing some pretty criminal she here's two things that seem to happen whenever anybody runs any kind of crazy cult or any sort of like weird community outside the norm it always becomes sex it always becomes like the dudes as a you know what god I think that's what got him in trouble I'm and I feel like I remember some like it being some sexual yeah children that's what they like if they wanted to bust him on something I mean if they really wanted to bring them down that's what they would accuse him up I mean you can't true once someone accuses you have sex with children even if you're not guilty it's arunya on you forever but the thing is like these no one has ever pulled off like a utopian alternative society never it's crazy it's really interesting because the entire history of the United States no one's been able to do it like they try it they'll try it for a little bit and then it falls apart every single one of them that's amazing it's amazing that no one whether it's Waco no one it's like this I look at it like the line from the matrix it's like you know our first version of the matrix kept failing because it was all too good and too nice we had to fuck it up a little for everybody to accept it it's just to me it's it's quite fascinating that you know we stick to a standard way of living which is you know our modern industrial Western civilization and that is it and any deviation of that is scrutinized to the point where it's dismantled and the government steps in they always have guns - those have guns and any gun way too many guns because they want to protect their way of life and then someone's banging people's wives and taking all the money fascinating it's weird that not one has figured it out not one group has just got it nailed well it's probably part of the thing that power corrupts you can't have one person that's like the Almighty know-it-all around of a thing cuz he's gonna take advantage and then somebody smart within the clique is gonna say hey this is not right and it's getting fall apart and it always is one person or there's gonna be a person underneath that wants that position and is gonna do something to get it but it's always like one charismatic person that seems to lead these things like whether it's Jonestown or whether it's Waco's Manson yep yep yeah it's always one one dudes like this this society's fucked up man to Hitler yep sure I mean yeah one guy gets everybody's attention mm-hmm next thing you know yeah it is weird isn't it like this desire to have like our big a big daddy who got all the answers who's better than us because we're all so confused it would be very comforting if someone came along who really understood it all yeah I've got the solution and they have a big-ass giant crazy white beard like oh sure did and then they bowed you or if their answers blame the people you want it to blame and make you you know I mean that's another good technique isn't it make sure you alright what does everybody want to be okay that's what we're gonna put on we'll focus our hey do you know a lot of these things don't work out because they have to be based on what we talked about earlier yep doing unto others as you want them to do trust fully living that lifestyle yep alright when it doesn't happen like that it's what cats get the power they get in charge they want to keep that power they want to stay in charge oh well you know there's and they're not gonna treat other people the way they want they're gonna start intimidating people because that's the way you keep people in line always people want to be you know subjugated man like you saying they want it they want that you want somebody to babysit and into it no oh I can just sit over here and just be dumb okay cool and if no one was in charge someone would come along that would want to be in charge and someone would say you know the problem does organization is there's no leadership we need a strong leader we need someone who respects the values and principles this society was founded on but someone will also understands how to be a leader and then people who yes yes that makes so much sense yes guide us they just want to it's it's it's the same thing it's the it's what goes on in Instagram everybody wants to believe everybody's got their stack got his shit together hmm that guy's got his shit together man fuck I want to be like that not knowing that like behind the scenes he's falling apart falling the fuck apart man I know they're just trying to make it look like they got there she had a friend recently no names or anything but like a friend in a couple you would never ever in your life think they were that anyway I mean I was like man I just want to have a relationship like yours you know I mean and no fuss or mess anything one day I just turn around and they have they're just instagrammed names are different no sir not call them what's always like oh yeah we just didn't work we couldn't fake it was like I don't know if that was if it's that Syria but some it was like just shows you none of that shit is real because we don't put you know we don't put our shit moments up for everybody to see yeah Ilan must talk about that to the people you see on Instagram that you think are on social media you think are the happiest smiles are fucking struggling the most for sure yeah well they're trying to project that they're always trying to project you the best version of what their life gets the best response all over my Instagram when I post about my family or even our struggles mm-hmm like this this is rough right now but you share it you say huh but we're gonna get through we're gonna be all right it's one of the things that people like about you you know is that you're real you're not I mean you even though you're a famous guy who's been a successful musician for a long time I used to be you're you you're a normal dude you know I'd take that as the highest compliment you should it is the highest contact out of you seriously I gotta wrap this podcast up because I have the shit man before we do unfortunate amaro night the Brooklyn
