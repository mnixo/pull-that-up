my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night okay well that brings up them this the thing that's going on this week with Conor McGregor we got caught off guard last episode Jamie and I were talking I don't know it's just breaking news and Jamie brought it up the connor announced his retirement and I said I thought he was trolling you and I had the exact same reaction I saw he's trolling he's like no look at this it's all weird he would he'd be more yeah eloquent than that he'd be more people would have put it out better than that but and then the news started coming out and I also started thinking well maybe maybe something happened in training or maybe it was because of that guy that died recently and people are saying you know they were shocked that I didn't know the full details in the guy's death honestly with things like this like you know it's going to happen and it's unavoidable it's there's a certain amount of risk involved in any extreme sport plus that's the exception yeah like that's gonna happen that's the exception it is like so mad at peanut butter when someone dies it's like I'm studying the peanut you know it is exception but I was waiting for all the details come out I don't think they've done an autopsy yet they don't think they know no I don't either and I look I didn't think that was Conor and I love this is I don't think it's sharing too much information when Conor and I had lunch together I just talked about and he kept bringing up is a reoccurring theme when we were talking he goes that the media man like for this it's such a beast he's like like I've done energies before but you know it's different like he's not a guy where when any other fighter sit down to an interview they're really not selling the fight the time out their camp and they're doing the same thing over and over Conner's up fucking master that we've never seen do it before so he's coming up with original content non-stop he's on you know like when when he came on our podcast you could he was on he did the whole car wash he was exhausted and we came down you could tell he's thinking and just started spitting out gold he's just a beast man so to have that guy fly around the world and do all this shit I mean at the end of the day we got to remember this is a sport this is not the WWE so to keep putting on the spectacle like it's similar w/e at some point yes a man what these guys do is it's a real real when the her business he asked a focus man and I just feel like I I think Connors to blame to Dane is to blame I think both him just need to talk because if Connor before is bad planning him bad plan on Dana if you just went do listen I've sold this flight more than any one man this is not I have to if I lose this next fight I'm screwed though a problem is it sets a precedent now if I'm looking at it from as a businessman if I was a businessman let's pretend okay I would say the sets a precedent you can't let someone decide what press they do and press they don't do like you have an obligation to fulfill certain responsibilities like with the media for sure like like create hype but the question is but the question is like when do those responsibilities move into like a purely digital realm and when do those responsibilities only in showing up places physically old-school retro going places because like there's nothing wrong with the occasional press conference right no but but also you can accomplish way more with a few fucking viral videos than you ever could going to some weird interview with two people that aren't MMA facts and I think you made a really good point about that doing this fucking these morning shows they make them go do where you know nobody knows who the guy is or the girl they don't give a shit about everything yeah they don't they don't want to talk to the way you want to talk to him or I want to talk to him you know what I'm talking to Conor like before a fight I'm I'm trying to find out what's going on in the head of a guy who's going to engage one of the most exciting things and I'm gonna see all year no you're not going morning children how about that cauliflower how'd you get that shut the fuck up but I girls like that I know but Congress a guy where he's crossed over into pop culture he's such a big star now a tweet from him will hype the fight if I guarantee if Connor and Dana had conversation and Dan was like I'm an understands the big fight cause I remember if you were to lose this one now you're losing your golden boy the biggest star by far by far I also showed you if you could just focus let's just let them focus a little bit well I also feel like the magnitude of this the dilemma that's in front of them and Nate Diaz is also very apparent this is not a guy you can half-ass and even if you are a hundred percent ready you've never even fought him at now you fought him when he had eleven days notice what he'd been drinking in Mexico I mean he put a sterile match up man and then you want to fly them on a plane did anyone think man the I if you're looking at that with three months away though okay but still Connors exhausted man from doing stuff and also you know I see some fighters go but it's our obligation to do these press conferences slowly roll homie you're not Conor McGregor press conference that's a big dear friends right and and a loss to him you're talking millions and in the UFC if I'm looking as a businessman I go alright man he's going to a press conference but we're going to come to him did anyone think to do that well first of all Connor is one of the most charismatic guys seriously of all time in all sports no doubt about it I mean he is a fuckin marketing machine like the just the quotes and his style he later interrupt you but his tweet yeah is the biggest tweet by an athlete this year yeah beat Kobe Bryant retirement and you want to go to a fuckin interview for ESPN well they don't know the sport oh why I watch you spean every morning they were talking about LeBron James the playoff game tonight they interrupted this shit with breaking news talk about Connors not retiring that's how big he is now the PR team at UFC could not get this they could not get this sort of attention even if they want to Connor can it's a different age man those old interviewed little press conference you have a legit fuckin superstar man who makes more money than anyone the ice skates totally forgot what I was gonna say serious point sorry brother I took a shit sometimes I just go now well you knew you have you have all good points all valid points and I get this contract I get stuff like that but there has to be where you can't have a pissing contest you can't say well we're gonna run it like a business this time and not this time because it's good for the company with Conor McGregor and this big of a fight if he wins this dude you know how much more money you're gonna make not the fucking press conference well you're absolutely right these one most charismatic guys of all time but Nate Diaz right now is goddamn gigantic and I think we're gonna realize nas big is gonna close but he's goddamn gigantic he's huge and see what happened at scholars of that that's part of that fight part of that fight is that Khan is also fighting another mercurial superstar character I agree especially now after the first fight I agree Joe but let's say Connor doesn't fight you see 200 and let's say Nate fights Woodley or Robbie Lawler let me know how's ratings go we don't even break fighter 1 7 annulled well let's say right at 155 let's say fights dos Anjos let me know how those ratings yes here's where it won't be as close we may be a quarter of it I wonder it'd be close maybe half maybe what has to be how dense the maybe half half makes sense but half would still be pretty spectacular you know what not even half I'm done being Jeff and I love me he's the biggest there's no doubt about it he's the biggest yeah well who knows it's all speculation but here's what's interesting they offered the fight apparently to nurmagomedov but he can't take it cuz it's only four days after Ramadan fuck yeah so he's very religious so he does that whole fasting I had a buddy of mine my friend conchal a li from back in Boston he used to do that shit when I was highly light he would do that um he would fast when he was training it was crazy just you you have certain rules where you're not allowed to eat anything what how's it go you're not allowed to eat anything or drink any Sun up Sun down right now yeah upside obviously do it you can't there's no food or water Sun up Sun breezy and at like 6:00 p.m. they have this feast yeah but it it can weaken you and so Habib said it would have a real be real problem if you had a fight four or five right I get it and I would love to see that fight Habib nigga Murdoch verse Nate Diaz America met on him enough he's such a beast right he's phenomenal yeah to us who are balls deep in the UFC world yes no you're right ESPN ain't covering that fight dude you should start a promotion look at you you're a goddamn promoter you know how to do this I'm not I've been through it and when I see a guy like Connor comes in once in a lifetime if you think there's me another Conor McGregor you're batshit crazy I I think when we invest in odds you'll see they keep going I think you're crazy I think Connor is a special dude and I think there's a few other I think Brock Lesnar was I think Rhonda's there's very few players is it possible that this is a calculated gamble based on not thinking he has enough time to prepare for Nate know I don't think it's impossible em so this is just this is just a matter of digging your heels into the ground and saying there's no there's no way I can do this much crime percent I think it's just like do I'm exhausted only on this world tour is it can I please get ready for this it's not the WWE man go go ask go as a major superstar LeBron I know you think it's not the same but LeBron any of these guys these superstars and sports Ronaldo gone these world tours not get paid sell the fight when I quit but my social media will cover way more than this go fuck yourself but we have no one fighting like he he can't say anything you say anything look you got pulled from a card so more is not better there's a certain amount there's a certain amount you do we had a certain amount you're doing it for the UFC you're not doing it for the Conor McGregor brand you're not doing for the Fighters brand you think by him going to ESPN he's get what more followers but do you think that there's like a certain consideration that like it looks good to have file of fighters show up on like ESPN he's been there he's right he's on breaking news he's been doing it maybe the week before do it but when he wants to prepare for a camp and you have a guy of his magnitude coming off a loss and he's like man I really think doing all this press and all this stuff is fucked with my capabilities be a fighter I need get back to that will you please let me focus make some very hype the fight it totally makes I get well you can't have exceptions no no motherfucker you can because you do make exceptions well here's a certain people in the UFC roster where they can't you know I'm saying where they pick and choose when they fight or who they fight there are exceptions right and here's another thing to keep taking the consideration one of the most important things that anybody any athlete does while they're in training is get proper rest it's one of the most important things and what fucks up when you go traveling all the time you're rest so number one thing that wrecks you you know anything how much you travel dude I just I just flew in from Seattle this morning I got up at 5:00 this morning flew here got right off the plane and drove right in here yeah that's that's what happens man your body gets your immune system gets jacked from that so I'm good I just think it and I think this is great for the sport it's a good discussion half because now future superstars will say I'm only doing this may never use this this much before the fight well maybe when all this ain't gonna happen maybe there's a debate maybe the debate could be held as to like what is the what's the amount that you need to do what's the amount that you should do you know like what how do you have it set up and what would be them would be the best way for the performance of the athlete the the consideration of their their their time and focus to put a hundred percent effort into something not leave anything on the table because they really weren't rested enough because we were or distracted too much because they're doing too much press but who's it who's it helped in the end the UFC and Dana White like I use a pay-per-view if they have pay-per-view buys and they get a percentage of the buys it helps it helps everyone play but if the fighter I mean this should be a desert direct if a fighter is a percentage of pay-per-view which got like Conor does yes the more pay-per-view deals or maybe he does it a title fight we don't know what his deal is so I'm talking about these eyes for sure I would as a matter what I would have shown yes um but so the more press he does the more things get sold the more money he makes but in his point of view like tweets and things that he's doing right now are getting more attention to it than any of these stupid and if you couldn't pay for this kind of you can't licit e and you can't argue with that that's absolutely true but the question is like where we're you know there should be like a contract and the contract should state from X to Y you know pick a date and time I would be left alone if you saw to wants to get me I'll be up in Iceland freezing my dick off throwing sidekicks come get me I see I think this whole thing is a miscommunication I see Dana side and I see counter side right as a fight I definitely see counter side I think there's some miscommunication I think if before all this came out if Connor was like listen man I can't be doing all this fucking I guarantee of Dana was sitting right there would be no miscommunication I don't think I don't think he would agree that it was a miscommunication I think he would say that Connor just doesn't want to do the press and I when I say yeah you got to do the press and to me that's miscommunication okay some miscommunications a disagreement no I disagree because I I disagree be in this is why Joe Hill I think after after even though we fought although he expressed do I need chill on these interviews he he beats uh Nate Diaz or he loses Nate Diaz again he's like dude this fucking press is killing me so he's been voice in it I don't know if his camp has had the discussion with Dana but at some point maybe they haven't we don't know maybe it's all speculation we may get this down and come up with a schedule I guess you got to leave me alone for eight weeks but what if what if Dana and Connor had a conversation right now man-to-man Encounters listen what I'll do I'll film videos every day I'll do this after my practices I'll put all this social media out for you guys Craig this fight no one has the poll that I do right I can create this many views for millions and millions and no other fighter can don't pay me for it just don't make me travel you don't think Dana and Yossi would agree to any of this mmm I bet they'd be open to it you know it's interesting a Kevin Hart he was like one of the biggest stars in the world one of the biggest comedians ever as far as like sales and volume like not even no one even close he crushes it he sells out like what did sound like 50,000 Soldier Field it's nuts anyway um that's not important what's important is he's he's like gigantic on social media super active and he does it all himself so if he doesn't movie like he'll do a movie and they'll say oh great and you can use your you know 5.8 million social media followers and it'll boost up moving is like whoa whoa whoa whoa that's mine that's mine no if you want that yeah and we got to talk about that the first guy for a granite ooh dude they like that all the people that were in those movie meetings must be like oh shit cuz then the rock goes huh yeah because there's a giant difference between a guy like the rock like what he can do to sell a movie with social media and the average person the average actor I mean he's he's constantly on it he has a dedicated loyal fanbase cuz he's really funny and self-deprecating followeth works hard so he's shown pictures of it alarm clock it says like 4:15 in the morning he's up there fucking doing deadlifts he's an animal right so a guy like that that's a business on the side that's his that's his like he's got a hype business as well as a business to promote himself but he can also hype things you know what every once he give me some money huh like Kevin Hart when he does that I'm sure he's got it worked it was talking about it hon it's got it worked into movies now so it's like oh if you want a part of the Kevin Hart money machine that I put together well you got to give me something bitch why should I be any different you're right you're right in that respect as a superstar now not every fighter can pull that card you little legitimately have to be able to sell out giant stadiums and be a superstar yeah and he certainly can especially if you give him the right matchups you know if you give Connor the right matchup at 145 like I think honestly I mean I'm excited about this Nate Diaz fight because I like watching them fight I like watching Nate Diaz like I like I love the attention he's getting but if I was if I was in Connors camp I mean I understand that he's obsessed and he wants to get right back at it I would say go fight Frankie Edgar go fight max Holloway have a rematch with max Holloway that shit would be epic I agree if Aldo whoever Aldo doesn't you know they mix it all up fight a rematch with Aldo all those been talking mad shit about him you know I think although genuine ability genuinely believes that he fucked up and if you get to hold this dude this time you can punish him which is awesome fighting awesome story I wanna see the CEO honors can't think those fights are still gonna be there if he leaves his Nate Diaz I think it takes some of a tickle shocker a lot of star power already got taken away too much of a risk there way too much power got taken away in that second fight not 100% not however say he's still the biggest draw but he was uh an assassin before that fight understand Mayweather is there was something going on like when he flatlined Aldo with one punch and then did it like was nothing and smiled and and I was talking to him in the interview and he's just saying you know there somehow I get no power just just put it put it right where it's been ever seen anything like it yeah I mean the way he gobbled up the pressure and the way he controlled the shit talking this is the thing Joe we've never had a guy of his capabilities and his mass appeal go pale I don't want to do this like everyone else has jumped through these hoops I don't I want to fucking train man this is ridiculous I'm already big enough we've never had a guy really do this he's also a guy where I think if he wanted to if he was involved with the UFC let's say Dana which would never happen cut does go do it fuck I'm sick you go do what you want he could sell out a giant Arena and Dublin against Donna 5,000 every Saturday that's how powerfully that's why literally making just make more and more money well I don't know about that because I think part of the excitement about him was building up to that Aldo fight that was part of the man who would be king story was that he was going to fight the longtime king and when he flatlined the longtime king he reached this level of legendary popularity that it happens once in a hundred generations when it comes to fighter correct there's this this is moment this boom how many guys reached that moment like when he flatlined Aldo with one punch and then it was not 13 seconds of the whole world was like he fucking did it the answer is not did it yes it's fucking crazy yeah that was epic but the lustre gets taken off by the Nate Diaz fight and if he loses to Nate Diaz he's got a very good point that you know he can't lose because he wasn't given the right amount of opportunity to to present or to to prepare himself because he had to do all this pressure like right now the Conor McGregor fan base and guys hugging his nuts which I might be one of them but he you know they're going well you know Nate Diaz is way bigger and he kind of caught him off guard with all that good and there's a little asterisk I guess if you're this Conor guy well now if he loses again there's no more excuses we're cuz the fuck there's no asterisk Nate had 11 I saying that I'm saying it you could you know I'm saying I'm not saying there is Nate straight-up beat him with 11 days preparing sipping Coronas on a boat and came whooped his ass I thought Nate was gonna beat him just by first of all the size and length and deceptive boxing skills that's what I thought I was like this is gonna be the first guy that Conor's ever fought that's been in wars with like a legends I mean he's been in there with a lot of fucking super high-level monster he's a monster I'm like this is a big big fight and this is not a fight you want to take even if he's not ready on eleven days notice you got to get ready for this dude and his jujitsu is off the chain man his jujitsu is at a superhot level in engine bigger than comet there couldn't be a worse match up right bars with Andre Ward world champion and Joe showing on a regular basis no man is brother Nick I know gilbert melendez Jase she'll know no joke no joke dangerous fucking fight man or what's stressing me out fuck what a tree no pilot but the guy who were not talking about knowledge is Nate Diaz because even though if Nate Diaz and you guys can say whatever you want you'll see Juho still gonna be dope I get that that's all fun and dandy for the absolute fans if there's no Connor Nate doesn't make the same pay day so he gets fucked man you're right and I want to see guy like the dudes that Nate has paid and remember the Diaz brothers were the first guys ago now fuck that man I don't think it should be done that way and you got appreciate that man in a land full of fucking sheep they were the first kind of wolves killed now fuck that man this ain't right well they're also the first guys to put a ridiculous emphasis on extreme cardio yes and shows in their style yeah I mean like Nick doing marathons and triathlons and I was it's funny I I keep quoting this and Nick corrected me the other day I said that he swam back from Alcatraz twice he just corrected me the other day goes five times now it's fucking not five times he swam from Alcatraz to the fucking mainland they didn't think you could do that they didn't think it was possible that's why they put a prison there because they didn't think people could swim well this motherfucker is a STONER and an athlete he's not even a prisoner fucking let don't lock that dude I'm gonna swim right the fuck out yeah crazy a bunch of guys like him in prison but how crazy are people these days dude doing things for recreation my god the only the only guy who could bring Nate Diaz money is George st. Pierre George a pair yeah I think we might begin honeydicked if George st. Pierre does happen just show up at UFC do Hunt's like wait a second well George has openly said that he wants to go through a camp and decide whether or not he could do at the end of it he's done it did he go through the the prep camp that's what I heard when did she is you got an sides good dog I mean III know he's been training a shitload and I know he doesn't care about belt or anything just wants to take the fight you know what the holdup is what Reebok that's awful oh well you're George st. Pierre sponsored by Under Armour and then how many fights you have Andry boxing like yeah here's whatever 50 grand where these Reebok pumps he's like what fuck no man I'm George st. Pierre so he's saying either the us he has to make up for it in his purse or Reebok cups make up for it so I think it's a money thing right now really that's what you hear is this an inside scoop I don't know we just scooped a shit out of it I don't know that's right here well I've been hearing rumblings of negotiations but uh you know it's one of those things you don't want to hope you want to just wait but also I think I can save the code well he would he would most certainly save the card oh my god you know which would be crazy would be him and Connor I mean that's fucking nuts Damon Connor Madison Square Garden - what you would it's not enough seats there no there'd be full of just fucking GSP versus it looked like the Oscars it just bees crowd full of celebrities regular folk can afford the ticket special if you get angry GSP GSP that wanted to punish BJ Penn GSP it I think it's me tough to bring him help in like you talk about project come out rush yeah yeah man he was a motherfucker Oh GSP was something one of the weirder guys because he was such a nice guy at all times but when guys fucked with him there was this this switch that would go off in that head and he would go on seeking destroy mode and he was so good at it man when he fucked up BJ fucked up Fitch you watch those fights and you just go that is arguably the greatest welterweight of all time I agree I mean his ability to mix up the strikes and the takedowns we never knew what the fuck was going on his constant victories and scrambles you know and the BJ fight to where he was punishing BJ he wanted to punish him and when he when he beat him down I didn't stop them and they walked over to the wall and fucking punched it afterwards that's the motherfucker now does he come back or do we get that that safe GSP because a safe GSP versus Connor I'm not trying to say that there's a lot there's a long time gone who knows who knows it works yet we're talking about GSP and BJ I mean BJ Penn's coming back - yeah well I'm excited to see what that looks like BJ's fighting dennis siver and he's been at Jackson Winkle John's camp for quite a while now so I'm assuming they're not letting him cut any corners oh no really running them through the real paces yeah if you're at Jacksons there's no cutting corners if you do is can you're asked molly-whopped in there you wouldn't be there that long right and get back on a plane go home and why would he send me he's been living out there for quite a while no I doubt a pretty legit GSP negotiating you buck UFC return but Reebok deal consider his robe Locker there's a story mmm-hmm yeah man I don't know just this whole thing bums me out it's complicated yeah we'll see we'll see what happens but man okay that would be the 200 to end it if well I think you saved for Messing's quick I'm fucked you think that would be Nate versus Jess P if Connor doesn't do the car so Connors not on the card anymore well today he said I'm down to fight he even goes I will fly to New York and do a press conference when I gotta go back so he's given a little wiggle room I think it's time to drop the egos come to agreement and save 200 let connor fight mate we have is Brendan Schaub the reasonable one I was this possible haired dude houses fucking ketogenic diet you know kid I was hot she's carmine and Lou I like everyone and I hope they work that out for UFC 200 to be even better story if their work thank you they do guarantee they do I would almost guarantee they do or they do a GSP Nate Diaz fine then we got honeydicked and then some smells fishy something smells fishy for sure if GSB is like what hey I've been training well if they come with the cash they come with that fucking Reebok make up money I bet you I bet you everybody is a set of Reebok pumps in six million um there you go push it in push it in we're all in for GSP I think I bet they figure it out yeah I bet I bet you Connor ends up fighting you'll see 200 that's why that's what I believe it and that's I think Dana and the UFC brass is gonna figure it out I think GSP Nate Diaz takes its place and they use it as a negotiating tool because the pay-per-view numbers are bigger than any of the Connor fights because the UFC has in fact grown through their strategy see I don't think the numbers beat Connors what if they do well then yet then and then Connors GSP over main Diaz are fucked up yeah counter fucked up I don't think you beat those numbers up
