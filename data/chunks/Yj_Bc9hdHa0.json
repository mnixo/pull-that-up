and we're live all right Sean welcome aboard man thank you thanks for doing this appreciate it thanks for having me Joe you were one of those guys that came up so many times on Twitter I had to reach out to you so many people were like have you checked out what this guys doing he's eating nothing but meat and he's a doctor he's super healthy I was like okay let me check out what this guy's doing and I saw you and I was like he's serious about this and I was like okay this isn't a gimmick you're actually an educated guy and you you are pursuing this carnivore diet yeah I mean it's you know if you would ask pull this thing up close see if you could there you go if you would have asked me two years ago I would have said that's fucking crazy I mean it's a you know if you to ask me even five years ago I'd say yeah doesn't really matter much just train your ass off cuz I had been an athlete just training my whole life and you know I didn't really until I got in my mid-40s and all of a sudden I was like crap training and work and I'm just getting fat I'm getting you know high blood pressure you know probably pre-diabetic and I you know I went down this you know this dietary journey where I went from you know doing the low-fat low-calorie fish and vegetables almost vegetarian training three days three times a day just about trying to try and get lean and then I went down to you know that I was like manna sucks I'm miserable you know I can't scan can't maintain this you know then I went on the Paleo diet started looking like man bacon looks pretty good and then I went and I started reading some more then I went on to you know a little carb high fat and then I did ketogenic for about 2 3 years because I think you do stuff like that do you I do and then I just started reading about these people that do this carnivore diet and then I want to started reading where'd you read about it well there's there's actually a Facebook group it's called zeroing you know on health is guy named Charles Washington he's been doing about 10 years and so they got about 10 there's about 13 thousand people's right people so he's been exclusively on a carnivorous diet for 10 years 10 years so no vegetables no carbs no nothing nope I mean he basically eats you know I think eat steak and pork ribs and stuff like that there's another guy I mean is more impressive there's a guy named Joe Anderson and his wife Sean they've been doing it for years and then you know I could probably show you a picture I gave it he I mean he's 16 he looks like he's 30 his wife is his mid-40s and she looks like she's 25 I mean they're I mean by looking at these people you're like they're crazy healthy you know what happened was she had Lyme disease real bad was kind of overweight and really sick and he started doing like a same stuff I was doing he's reading about these old scold bodybuilders you remember I don't Vince Gironda so he promoted this steak and eggs diet back in the 1950 60s and he was just jacked I mean he was like this is you know 1956 it was kind of before most of the steroid stuff was hitting you know I mean there were there were still some steroids back in the 1940s you know the Nazis play with that with the troop but you know I didn't really get into the body-mind culture Toldo than probably the 60s you know and then the seventies not you know not everywhere right but he was doing this stuff on here if you look up if you look up Vince Gironda and look at his physique from the 1940s 1950s friggin pretty amazing and he's just eating me he was even though his diet was basically I think it was five days of just eating meat and eggs of steak and eggs and then every every one day like every fifth or sixth day you could eat you know whatever so that's what that's what he did so that was his night so that's what he looked like back in nineteen yeah that's probably the 50s you know so that's pretty decent for back then you know Ajax well I mean for infrared for a non-steroid guy I mean this is yeah also taking into consideration how little they really knew about training back then ya know I mean if you go back into history we talked about that but the nerves a guy named Larry Scott who was make the first mr. Olympian he was another guy that was eating just tons and meet you know four five pounds of meat a day and he won mr. Olympia again you know there's some of those drug use you know and some of this stuff but I was just reading about this stuff and I was just like well I'm you know I'm gonna athlete I like trying this stuff and so I said well I'm just gonna try it for a month so I did it for a month and I was like man I feel pretty good alright so I was like oh I'm gonna decide like I did a month I'm like I'm gonna go back and come back to my ketogenic diet and so I started or that day today I did I was like um I need some apples a little almond butter or you know had some berries and creamiest stuff you didn't normally do as a treat and I just didn't feel as good you know like my back started hurting a little bit and I was like well maybe that's where someone saw that I once said well I'm just gonna go back to eating meat again well your back started hurting from eating apples well I mean it was just like you know this is one of the things that I've seen I mean we can talk about this you know in detail but I've seen a lot of people what they'll say is you know and it's what I saw you know when I was working as a surgeon when I put people on a ketogenic diet their joint pain was starting to go away right this is a pretty common a lot of people believe that joint pain is connected to the consumption of simple carbohydrates well I think it's you know I find carbohydrates I don't know what it is for sure but it's something we eat most like you know a lot of cases not always but I think there's something out there we're eating I'm pretty convinced is not meat you know that's what I can tell you for sure from what I know you know whether it's you know sugar whether it's you know process gluten or wheat or stuff like that whether it's vegetable oil whether it's you know or even some vegetables potentially and so this is what I'm seeing this is what I saw you know I studied these large Facebook groups like an anthropologist you know like they used to study these people you know 100 years ago they'd go out you know Weston Price we've got and see all these people and study their teeth and stuff the problem with that is you know you don't speak their language you know he's pretty remote you can't you got to translate and so some of those observations you know while they're valid they're hard to do now you know but so when you're going these groups and you just was like reading this like a scientist going okay this guy went on this diet his joint point away this guy one of the night and his thyroid disease went away this guy one on this diet and his skin got you know psoriasis one I kept seeing this over and over and over and over again I mean thousands of them but the big thing for most people is removing refined carbohydrates removing sugar and a lot of people dairy yeah I would say that that's a good strategy for most people you know here's the deal I don't care what people eat whatever makes you healthy you know I think this is a thing we have these national guidelines to tell people to eat but they're they don't work for most people you know obviously I mean look look at our country I mean it's just it's sad to see all these people that are you know really really getting sick and so I think you know there's got in vineet order to has there's no sugar no grain I think that well that will successfully help a huge percentage of people you know but I think you have to be objective about it you have to do it long enough for it to have an effect and you know I think you have to you know even be really cool to be really clinical about it and so one of the big problems I see as a physician and this is a big problem because people will go on low-carb diets or ketogenic diets and they'll say I feel the best I've ever felt in my life I mean I my mood is better my mental cognition is better my joints feel better my guts don't hurt my skin is better my sex drive is better everything you would say is that means you're getting healthy and they'll go there doctor they'll get some blood drawn and their cholesterol be high and the doctor will say well you're gonna kill yourself you're gonna have a heart attack alright so people get scared away from that and they go back to eating their other stuff and then they feel crappy again but they're like well at least my cholesterol is not bad so one of the big problems and I've kind of sort of basically preaching this stuff as I think and this is a problem with healthcare in general is we have so gotten away from just defining what's healthy you know if somebody comes into your office and you say you know you talk to him for two three minutes cuz healthcare is just you got ten minutes to see a patient make a decision so what you're going to do is like how you doing or a bunch of labs you look at the results of the labs and say okay this labs low this labs high this labs normal going this drug or you know do this or that and the patient may be saying what but I feel great or maybe converse they may say I feel like crap well your labs are fine so go exercise a little bit so let me bring you back to the beginning so you you're you're a physician right so you understand a lot about the human body do were you worried when you decide to go on this carnivore only diet were you worried that you were going to be deficient in some sort of nutrients and vitamins and fiber and all these different things like and were you cautious yeah I mean I was very very I'm still skeptical I mean I'm you know that's just the way he should be but I mean I was well aware of what's not in me you know if you look at the RDA you know look at the RT and it says meat is low and in vitamin C it's low in manganese it's low and you know potassium it's low and you know vitamin A about of me there's a whole bunch of things it's low in you know on paper right so I was like why don't I can't rectify why these people are doing so well you know just eating mean and we know historically that there are there are populations out there the you know at the Masai the Sammy and all these people you know and anyway it's probably the best example right because they had an extremely low incidence of cancer and no vegetables there's nothing up there yeah I mean I mean you know if you go to you know if you go to northern Alaska in the winter time good luck trying to find a fruit or vegetable I mean not so but what people would say when they would they would just they would justify so yeah but they ate a lot of their organs and I got some vitamin C from their liver and you know some of the some of the whale skiing handsome so they were just trying to justify that and try to make this as how it worked and then the same thing with Messiah they would say well sometimes they would eat some berries once in a while too it always trying to justify and I'm like you know those things aren't available year-round so you know you can't get berries you know especially in Alaska or wherever the anyone are you know you can't you can't get that 12 months out of years well that's not what's having a significant impact on their diet I don't think it's it's coming from the meat itself well this is this is what this is what I after doing a lot of research on this stuff so we've known so it's interesting so when we look at the development of the already age you know the recommended daily allowances those were divided those were developed back in the 1940s and they were developed basically for soldiers to figure out what the heck you supposed to feed people so they couldn't survive and so they did research on this and what they did was they take populations of people that are consuming a normal diet like you know back in the 1940s you know people would eat a mixture everything was fairly high in carbohydrate not as high as it is now by the way but it was a mixed diet and so what they see is you know if you eat that diet and you're deficient in this nutrient if you don't get X amount of this nutrient you're going to develop some sort of nutrient deficiency syndrome so they said okay well we know that this level of nutrient deficiency causes disease so therefore we're gonna recommend this you know everybody gets this amount right so but they knew what they found out back even in 1897 there's a study where they're looking at animals and they looked at something called thiamine you know what they didn't know its timing back then but they saw that certain animals if they're on a lower carb diet they didn't get this disease or animals on a high carbohydrate did get this disease disease was called beriberi and so that's a thiamine deficiency which causes neurologic problems or congestive heart failure type problems and so they were noticing that these animals are on a low-carb diet even though they're fireman levels were really really low they weren't getting diseases so if you look at that and you look at all these other nutrients you know things like manganese you know manganese is highly required for carbohydrate metabolism and so if you're on a diet where you're not taking any carbohydrate all of a sudden you got to say maybe I don't need as much manganese II despite with the RDA says and you can look at that for nutrient after nutrient glucose and vitamin C is a huge one all right so vitamin C you don't if you don't take vitamin C and you get really really need to get scurvy you get sick you diamonds they'll kill you I mean you end up with bleeding in your joints your teeth fall out your gums rot your skin opens up with sores horrible disease and these people are not getting scurvy and so what's happening is we know that a molecule of glucose and a molecule of vitamin C are almost identical and so they compete for the same transporters and so if you don't have a lot of glucose floating around you need way way less vitamin C really so there's a newsom and this has been known for quite a while as well so well that's fascinating because obviously orange juice tons of glucose tons of vitamin C yeah right they basically cancel each other out and so I think what's happening and this is one of the things I think potentially and this needs to be investigated but I think that a lot of people that we have all these vitamin deficiency vitamin D deficiency magnesium deficiency a lot of that may be caused by just ingesting too much carbohydrate and creating and creating a higher than normal need so basically we're creating higher needs for vitamins now you do blood work on yourself I haven't you know I haven't yet I'm gonna probably do it once I get you know I'm a year at this you haven't done any no I don't you know here's the deal G I mean I've got a lot of people to do it all the time I'm not that interested in it because I just don't I don't think it makes that big of a difference for me I'll do it just out of just to satisfy other people's curiosity I don't really have that much curiosity personally about your blood work no change in your diet where you're just consuming only meat I would want to see what kind of results I'm getting well I mean it depends you know if you can tell me what blood test tells me I'm healthy and I don't think you can't well I think if you get a really good doctor who understands different genes HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and free testosterone available and all the different nutrients that are essential and if you get someone who really understands out and kind of a comprehensive examination of your blood work I think you benefit from it greatly but also the the knowledge that you can tell them like how do you feel I feel great you know and they can get a look at this what are you eating and what kind of meat are you eating what are you getting in it yeah so that's an interesting point cuz I you know we've started this you know you know and again I was I started doing this and got public on it and Twitter and a lot of people were saying well yeah you're you know you're doing well you're you know I'm breaking some more records and stuff like that world records you break so so I'm gonna athlete my whole life I've got done athlete you know I'm about 240 right now but I mean I was you know when I was when I was younger I played rugby New Zealand I was playing with about some of the All Blacks you know at a high level this before it was profession is the name of the team by the way history it's kind of an interesting sort of things so back you know back in the 1900s in New Zealand guys were so fast and there's forwards and backs for select alignment and the backs of the fast guys and they they were also super fit and so they said they look like they were all backs but somebody type made a typo there but they're they're like the best rugby players in the world you know some people say South Africa is pretty good New Zealand's pretty much the best so I played nine out of those guys and then I went into weight you know power lifting and I had an American record in the deadlift I was there looking close to 800 pounds as a drug-free athlete back in my 30s and then I went on to I did some strongman stuff for a few years and then I went on to throwing you know I track and feel like discus and shot but and then the Highland Games where you you know you run around with a big caber and wear kilt and I won the World Championships in that and then you know what I got in my mid 40 cuz I was about close to 300 pounds back then I was about 280 285 and I was like man I just can't keep me doing this inside so that's what I started dieting and stuff and so I got down to three lean about 240 ish where I'm at now and I started doing indoor rowing stuff which is not a concept - so you remember I don't you know kind of McGregor on his how do you remember that machine he was rolling on me I'm sitting on the amendment you guys know that so I got on there and I started training for that and so what I did was there's a 500 meter row which is you know and this is connecting to this highly highly glycolytic I mean it's it's like it's not like running a marathon like like Zack Peter explained glycolytic so the like oolitic means you're burning glucose you're using muscle glycogen no I know you had who's a Phil on a couple weeks ago pressure no the other guy was Annie Galpin okay you gotta have glycogen and I'm like well-to-do highly glycolytic activity so this is a highly highly glycolytic activity takes about a minute a minute two minute 30 and that's that's intense you know like you're going all out right and so I was able to break the world the 50 plus world record in that and it was when I went home when it was when I got 250 it was 1 minute 18 point 3 seconds and so I put it down all the way down to 114 so I took 4 seconds off the world record without a single gram of carbohydrate totally I mean but doesn't when I mean this is one of the issues with the ketogenic diet if you eat too much protein your body converts that protein back to glucose that's one of the things that they were saying that you have to have like the you're supposed to have like somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% fats 30% proteins right so this is uh this is another sort of thing that I think a lot of people sort of have have questions about one things we know about gluconeogenesis so that's converting protein or fat into glucose is its demand driven so your body doesn't just make it so if you eat a lot of protein it doesn't just say I'm just gonna make a bunch of blood sugar for the heck of it because you might doesn't need it and so one of the things that glucose is extremely important to the body I mean we need it I mean it's absolutely so the nice thing about it is if you regulate it really really well and the best way to regulate it really really well is just to make your own so rather than you know getting it from kombucha or you know heating a bunch of carbs you know where's gonna be all over the place so this is what happens so is so ketosis again I probably spend you know significant periods of time in ketosis but I'm not always in ketosis and that's not the point of this you know but I mean I think ptosis is probably a good thing you know periodically but I don't you know like I said I don't think you know we can talk about evolutionary why would it me for interrupting you but why would it vary of your diets not varying why would you be in ketosis or out of ketosis if you're not varying your diet if you're just eating only meat right so you know because it depends how long ago between meals so if I'm not you know going to intermittent fast so I I intermittent feast so so I this is what I think is you know I think this is probably more pride I will often go well here's funny so I was in Denver couple nights guy went to the big Brazilian you know get down all-you-can-eat me place and I just to Haas Korea yeah yeah I just pick over - ow so I went there and I just I had them come back 50 times Wow I click I clicked everyone I sighed 50 freakin orders of food about 6 pounds of meat I'm just putting away in one setting you ate six pounds of meat that's insane dude yeah yes I would say I put away about six pounds and then I'm not hungry for like 30-some hours so I'm basically it's not that I'm intentionally fasting is this Thai feast it so much that I just don't feel like eating so I think here's what I think huh you know you haven't why do you think we have an appetite I mean what's the point of an appetite tell you one to eat right right that's exactly right but if you're eating the crappy wrong food you know your appetites all screwed up so one of the problems we have people eating the wrong food you know we have this all this processed garbage it's full of calories sugar and crap but it doesn't have any nutrients in there so every time you're hungry your body's saying give me more nutrition well if all you do is pour in garbage your body you're always gonna be hungry so what's the insulin spikes all that stuff I mean so you want to eat insulin is not you know we need some insulin right we need this one for muscle growth it's an useful thing the goal of insulin is not zero that's what people need to understand it's not we know what our glucose to be zero when you are going to be zero but we don't want it always always always spiking and so you know when you eat a big meal of something you're supposed to be eating and I'll argue that I think meats a pretty damn good meal and we can all right we can talk about how it's complete or not but so when you do that you know you dislike the next time you're hungry it's time to eat right the body said I need somebody to energy so you get from fat when you meet but I also need structure and so by you know eating meat you know you're basically giving your body what it's asking for and I think that works pretty well whose phone that's very interesting because most people would say you should eat a balanced diet right most people would say that in order to be healthy you should consume certain amount of fruits a certain amount of vegetables you should have some some whole grains you should eat some meat and if you come along and tell people like this is what I'm doing I mean six pounds of meat and I don't eat for thirty hours like this guy's out of his fucking mind yeah I mean I agree I'm it sounds crazy you know 2017 it's crazy it's crap I mean I can I can point to thousand 1000 people and do it in excellent health which is interesting but I mean you know balanced diet is just a frigging cop-out I mean I don't know tell you so I'm gonna tell you the moms diet I wish you'd done some blood work so you should get us some data I mean it seems like someone who's espousing this diet like it would be nice you had some hard data yeah so I mean you know cuz I didn't know I was gonna do this I just started do it I'm like why I'd you know I've already noticed I'll probably get some you know so what what do you just decide like hey I'm gonna try this for a month and then just keep going I've try said I'm gonna try for a month and I just felt so good I was like well and you've been on it for so I started last December so here Wow so holy the whole year I've just eaten me you got a do some blood work and well I probably will I mean you know but the point is I'm the point I'm making is what is it gonna tell me here's the thing we don't know one of the things is you know I'll tell you a little problem because I've seen hundreds of hundreds of people who've already done blood work so I know it's gonna show basically you know so I've gotten we've got this study going we've got all these people are submitting blood work but the you know probably my HDL will go up my triglycerides will go down my blood sugar will stabilize to a low level my inflammatory markers will be normal that's because I've seen lots and lots of other people's blood work already so I know what's going to show my cholesterol may be up or down and that's and that's something that we have a lot of people worried about that and you know I can talk about cholesterol in my view is a pretty worthless marker you know by itself you know you have to take it into context and so there's a you know there's a couple people that are really really intelligent about cholesterol that are really testing this sort of stuff one guy's name is Dave Feldman on Twitter his name is Dave Kito there's another guy named I ever Cummins who's in Australia needs both engineers and so this was what happened this guy Dave he goes on a key to getting diet his cholesterol goes sky friggin high it's up 400 you know way way up there and his doctors freaking out and he's freaking out so he's like I don't understand this I mean I feel great everything about me is just best health I've ever felt my life so what he does is he starts drawing his blood every single day he gets a blood test and what he finds out is that his blood cholesterol is all over the place one day it's 300 the next day's 200 one day it's 350 the next day and so when we go to the doctor every six months or a year and they get a blood cholesterol you assume well that's my cholesterol was always that way well he found out that it's so variable they've actually known about this since the 1950s but no one has been talking about so what he figured out he's a systems engineer and he's engineers or some smart guys I mean I there's one thing I kind of talk about it's just because somebody's an MD or PhD doesn't mean they know everything there's a lot of people that are plumbers and whatever they don't have any formal training that can figure they're smart people and they can figure this stuff out so he's an Asst he's an engineer a real smart guy and so what he does is he figures out the cholesterol is basically all it is is it's traveling around in your blood based on energy flux so how much so if you've eaten a lot so if you've eaten a whole bunch of food and your fault your liver is saying I don't need to put out a bunch of fat because you weren't fat as fuel no even if we're not on a kidney Jane died so what it does is it transports fat so when you're hungry you haven't eaten it for a while like you fasted for a blood test your liver says we need fat and the Cisco's we're low on energy and so it shoots out all this fat and what happens is cholesterol is it just cruising around for a ride so it's just sitting there you know you know as a passenger so depending on how much you've eaten one you've eaten now change your cholesterol and so it's not a very good marker I mean even you can find studies that show for all cause mortality like if you're like you and you and me on cuz you're your same as I am I think you're right 50 yeah we're both 50 so if we look at you know and again associational studies are not that great but if you look at that and you say all cause mortality if I'm am I gonna die or not if your cholesterol is high you're less likely to die if your cholesterol is high you're less likely to get Parkinson's disease if your cholesterol is high you're less likely to get a bunch of cancers you know so it's like so you're saying that though but most people hear this thing go buh buh buh buh buh if your cholesterol is how you're gonna get a heart attack well here's the deal we're gonna die yeah here's how here's the deal heart attack so this is interesting because of you know vegetarian - vegan I don't mean to pick on vegetarians of beings because you know I know some great ones they're great people and I think you know there should be a war between this but vegetarians or vegans the number one killer of vegetarian vegan is heart disease and that's what kills them - it kills everybody so it's just like you know you know do you trade am I gonna die of cancer or am I gonna try to have heart disease you know which won't pick you for most people don't understand that the sugar industry's hijacking of science in the 1950s where they paid all those scientists to literally false advertise the idea that sugar is safe for you but that saturated fat and cholesterol is what's causing all these issues with people and heart attacks to this day people just sort of repeat that like they think it's gospel yeah I mean it's in it is it's part of that it's part of the the framework of society now I'm it's like what was the push that got you to say I'm just gonna eat nothing but meat was there anybody that you knew that was doing it really well that you were talking to did you get some well like I said it was just reading about people online you know you know there's a you know if there's a tell you whether there's a guy named Joe Anderson on Twitter and his handle is Joe Charlene 98 88 90 this guy you know it's just the guy he's been doing it for 20 years I'm just like this is pretty cool like I said reading back on that stuff and then just because I've been an athlete I'm like and I don't you know I'm never taking drugs and stuff like that and I was always like what can get me to the next level as far as athletic cops because I'm just a really competitive guy I mean I just I just like to you know push myself and see what works I know a lot of savage people that eat mostly meet my friend campaigns eats almost all meat he occasionally eats like something else but most of what he eats is meet my friend choco willing yeah when he's tired because I need more steak it's a freaking health food totally is I mean any others a guy named Bobby Maximus who's a fitness guy he was too many guy years ago or something like that but I know he did this steak everyday thing and I said if we look back into the into history I mean there's all kinds of accounts of people using meters and athletic performance enhancer you know back in the original Greek Olympics those guys knew that they ate a lot of meat there perform better you know the bee feeders out of London you know these guys were the the guards for the Kings you know they gave them extra meat cuz I know they would fight better the you know the Mongols you know they just decimated you know all through Asia they basically just ate their horses and their meat that's what they didn't I travel with that you know and so you've got all these historical examples of people performing better you know the intimate they were laborious they were known to have this incredible work capacity and all the you know late was seal meat and and reindeer and you know stuff like that so what's a typical diet for you look good give me a normal day you wake up in the morning so what I do well I'll tell you what today I mean you know eating wise some you know generally eat in one meal or two meals depending on what my workout training is gonna be so this morning you know cuz I know I was coming up here I trained real early morning wow that's fast I you know I said a new record by the way in my personal record just doing that but I had a couple of New York strips I had them out two pounds so you ate two pounds of meat oh that's a snack is that your phone man to keep it good you look just like you yeah so you had to New York strips today yeah yeah that's some pounds of meat you know it took me a while to build up to this before you know like a pound of meat would be you know that'd be tough no I can I can put down four pounds at one time with people looking at you would go well he's super lean like obviously whatever you're eating your body's processing it really well I mean you don't have a you know what someone think of as a steak heat or gut like you tell a guy someone guy eats two steaks a day and like oh you must have a gut that's all the mashed potatoes cheese and just you know I put like I said on that Instagram page I've got you know exercise that was something you talked about outside the studio right before we came in that the studies that have been done on people consuming meat and I brought this up as well that there's a lot of misconceptions about these studies because they're not very clear when they say that people who eat meat five times a week are more likely to get cancer what they're not telling you is what these people ate along with the meat are they eating cheeseburgers or they eating grass-fed beef or it's grass-finished grass-fed you know high in essential fatty acids healthy for you or are they eating some bullshit cheeseburger with a sugary drink like what is the rest of their diet are they consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates are they consuming a lot of sugar are they drinking alcohol they smoking cigarettes all you're saying is they're eating meat five days a week it's not it's not specifying in any way their actual overall diet yeah they don't they don't sort that very very well out so they've got all these epidemiology studies basically a meat-eater is basically someone and you know we statistically we know they're more likely to smoke they're more likely to drink they're more likely not to wear their seatbelt they're more likely to be an accidents are more likely not to go to their doctor or not they're more likely just not to care so you've got that's what I mean why is that what's this because people because if I tell you as I say Joe eating meats bad for you and you say if you I don't care I don't care about my health right right so you just don't care so this is it so they can't separate that out so they've got all these studies were they they try to separate it out and say well what kind of even up to smokers but they never can take that I don't give it up you know I don't know I don't give a fuck right thing out of it and so you've got this stuff and then all the studies are really really low strength so if we look at you know and we can talk about this about me being me being a good causing cancer because there's there's some concern about that with colon cancer but if we look at smoking you know when they determine the smoking caused cancer the epidemiology showed a 2,000 percent increase in the incidence of cancer in a lot of studies when they compared that to meat and cancer they found an 18% increase which is nothing I mean it's like it's like it doesn't even matter it's so 18% isn't high not when you look at relative risk right so if your risk if your risk of getting colon cancer is 1 or say your risk of getting colon cancer is 5 in a million right uh-huh and now it's 6 in a million I mean it's like nothing I mean it's like it is so minor but if your risk is going from 5 in a million to 300 and a million then you're like well that's pretty powerful right there's a problem so it depends on the incident so if it's to begin with and you only raised about a tiny amount it's so small and so what we know there was a guy named Bradford Hill we talked about statistical correlations on when this things actually matter and not to you get to 200 percent or 300 percent does it even matter you can't draw any conclusion from that the problem is 203 and percent difference out of like a thousand of two it would be six yeah right right so instead of being 18 percent more likely you're two hundred percent more likely those numbers are confusing to people though the way you're saying that's a lot of people right so so you would have to double or triple around your risk so 18 percent is not double or tripling we're only putting it up backed by a fraction right right so when you when you separate all that stuff out and then you know there was a you know the World Health Organization two years ago last year two years ago declared that red meat was a class two carcinogen to processed meats was a class 1 carcinogen you know they said it's like plutonium and smoking and you know every runs and runs all over the place with that why did they do that so here's why they did it so first of all and you can go on their website and you know they'll tell you what their what their conclusions were so this was done by an organization called the International Association for research on cancer they're based out of Lyon France and they are you know that's what the World Health Organization uses to determine their stuff and so they're written and this is you know besides appointment right now the IRS C is under under investigation by US Congress for using crappy science and you know promoting a political agenda so I don't know if that's true or not a part of that's generated by probably B corporations you don't like the findings but so they're under investigation for that but what they say is we have some weak epidemiology which is this 18% stuff but we think we have some strong mechanistic reasons for this right so if everybody you know there's there's a doctor named George Eid Eid EE who's uh who's a psychiatrist out in Maryland who's got this distresses the whole thing she has a website called diagnosis diet calm so she did an analyst analysis of all the 800 studies they used and she found that what they ended up doing is most of them showed me didn't cause cancer there was a small percentage it didn't he looked at all these rat studies there was about 20 20 25 rat studies and they found like three or four of them showed me you know if we gave this type of cancer if we gave this rat a certain you know amount of meat and we genetically bred them and we gave them a medicine that makes them get cancer that they get a little bit of change in their cold that might turn into cancer what medicine makes them get cancer no I don't remember something there's a special way to make rats get cancer so they have this model did it makes them get cancer really really easy so what they did is they felt how did they do that if it trying to find out if something gives something cancer well because they want to make it they want to be a differentiate as quick as possible this is a real fast way to show up they get cancer but the problem with that and she explains it very well is that we don't know that they would get cancer it's and it's not shown and the other thing we talked about this before is it if you want to look at rat studies and it's not to say that plants give you cancer but there are pesticides in plants that have been studied in rats that we eat every day natural foods and vegetables and fruits that also give rats cancer and so the only difference is we've got you know some it's really this decides you mean things that natural compounds that plants extract or they want to create in order to discourage predation exactly so these natural substances when they feed them to rats they isolate them and feed them to rats gives the rats cancer 52 they kept tested 27 them this is just normal foods that we eat on a daily basis care people how to eating that stuff and what it's just saying that's how much BS this stuff is based upon but it just seems to me to be so crazy that they would they're doing a cancer study and they give the rats something that induces cancer in order to find out what gives them cancer more so they give them this compound then on top of the compound and they check their diet right they also feed them sugar with it you know it's kind of like it's just a way they do it you know and so I you know you can extrapolate does that really matter to humans or not it's just so hard to tell and I mean there's so many things that animals can eat that we can't it's just the whole thing is bizarre yeah I mean we're not rats you know that's interesting you know it's like the same thing when we talked about you know cancer rates a new historical population so you know what massage they didn't have much cancer you know so we started feeding them you know the nineteen forties thirties stuff like that none so till we started feeding them all our crap I think that they started to get those diseases mmm yeah that's uh it's all very strange right when you think about diet and and health you also have to take into account geographical the the geography that your ancestors evolved in and what they what were they accustomed to eating like there's different adaptations for the Inuit for example adaptations to cold they probably have requirements for certain amount of dietary fat yeah I think it's you know this is what I think I think we're all you know this is one of the things that people talk about their psyche you know everybody's so different we have all this different genetics we all need special diets I tend to say that you know in certain circumstances that makes sense but I think you know evolutionary you know we we sort of split from primates you know we shared a common ancestor with you know primates chimpanzees bonobos gorillas somewhere eight to ten million years ago we don't know for sure you know it's back and then and so what happens is you know the human the pre humans kind of went one way and then the apes and chimpanzees went up to swing we know we went up into the trees and if you look at you know even the difference between a chimp and I'm in and I'm in an ape you know an ape I'm not an ape of gorillas it really crushes all these you know these all really fibrous food lots of fiber and stuff like that chimpanzees can't tolerate that as well because they're they're they're : got a little smaller well humans Colin's got way way smaller right and so what happened is why you and I can throw a rock really far you know in the chimpanzee you know a chimpanzee can throw on you know if you go jim-jams you a baseball he can throw about 20 miles an hour it's not very strong you and I can throw a baseball you know 60 miles an hour average guy you know if you get you know major league baseball players or throwing at 95 plus right the reason we evolved to do that is because we were throwing shit at animals we were hunting right that's what drove I mean our scapula is rotated you know if you look at a chimpanzee scapula it's you know on the side it allows them to crown climb trees and do this stuff and so these strong climate based evolutionary pressures which drove us to saying you know there's you know you know there's all this Ice Age stuff going on the the climb is drawing out the fruits and then jungles are going away now it's all this grassland and you know there's not much eat in the grassland you know except for some animals people eat some bugs and stuff like that for a while and that's what you know chimpanzees even chimpanzees you know 3% of their diet you know there's a lot of people say we're frugivores and always she gives fruit but even chimpanzees eat about 3 percent of that comes from killing other animals I mean there there's this red colobus monkey somewhere and you can tour somewhere in Africa the chimpanzees are hunting this thing to extinction yeah they're they're good little hunters but yeah there's a David Attenborough documentary on it it's terrifying you see how organized they are to kill monkeys and they have chimps at one end of this treeline and they're coming this way and they have chimps on the side and they chase them in and then they they corner them they ambush them they get them in the centre and they just swarm them that's amazing I mean it and you know think about their brain is not even half as big as ours I mean so in humans sort of and I think that's I think it's pretty clear that what drove a lot of our Evolet evolution our ability to communicate to strategize and some of the anatomic things was based around hunting I mean I think I know you're a big hunter Jill and I know it's it's not an easy thing to do you've got to think a lot you know you've got to be pretty smart outsmart these animals I'm supposed to be when you're in big groups and back then when they've got you know I got a Spears basically you know you look at there's a population in Central Europe called the gravitons right so if you look at population markers for nutrition right the one of the things they look at is population height so if there's a real topic tall population means that they had really good nutrition and so if you look at the tallest people that probably ever lived were these Corvette Ian's these guys just decimating mammoths I mean they were so efficient at killing mammoths and so that's probably basically all they ate you know for the most part they might have middle vegetables but there they were their average height was like 6 foot 2 and this is like 30 thousand years ago that's crazy so these things have been giant there were giants and so the people that have sort of genetically are related to those people now are the people from Croatia in the Netherlands we're turning into tallest people in the world the only yeah other group that rivaled that are the neurotic Africans which are like the Watusi and the Messiah which are all about six feet tall and average and their diet is primarily as we know livestock based and then the other tall population historically were the Plains Indian particularly the Cheyenne injury and they just lived on mostly Buffalo so it's kind of its kind of interesting as far as what's the best food for nutrition you know and you know that's what I'm finding from a performance standpoint you know it's just what makes me feel the best about do you supplement do you take vitamins or minerals or anything you know I don't you know I just you know I kind of you know just yeah well I will say I take some salt you know uh salting I mean you know I'll have some Himalayan salt or some regular salt how do you normally cook you you cook for yourself also time yeah I mean you get pretty good at cooking steaks yeah so I'll either reverse here you know you know reverse sear a steak you cook it slowly like medium rare and then I throw in the pan for a couple minutes and sear it up and they need it or less throw it on the grill you know depends where I'm where I'm at from California I got a grill here so I'll throw it on the grill if I'm back you know another in New Mexico I'll just I'll do a girl there so mm-hmm you know takes she must do a lot of supermarket runs is that get expensive it's got to be an expensive diet yeah so I mean it's you know it depends you know it depends on you know again how much I'm probably eating more than yeah the average person that does this diet that I'm orab she only goes about two pounds two pounds of meat and so they can okay I'm down a day right and so a lot of people you know people that are that are you know don't have the budget Elvis to like ground beef and stuff like that and you can do you can eat two pounds of ground beef for you know under ten bucks a day which is right weight you know it's 2 cups of Starbucks you know something like this yeah it's actually not that bad for a lot of people now there's also people that have ethical concerns about the consumption of animals especially the consumption of factory farmed animals sir on a mass basis um you're probably responsible for a whole goddamn field dead cows yeah so I mean I think I mean I think I have a concern I think people that eat meat should be concerned about and we're the ones that primarily need to make sure that's not happening and so I think you know as you know you know I would argue that you know since evolution began humans have been eating meat and that's just what happens in nature you know if you look at how an animal is killed in a wildly if a lion takes down a zebra it's not a pleasant experience for that animal and so most of the way that humans kill these animals now you know from it from humane say it's pretty darn humane I'm even as a hunter you know if you hit an animal you don't get them you know you don't hit him the right spot you got to track him down he's gonna may take an hour yeah so the issue is not necessarily even just the eventual death of the animal it's also real life the end oh yeah I agree with that so I think that you know you have to look at you know if the animal is like if you got chickens and cages and they can't turn around right and their business cramped in there that's awful there shouldn't be a lot one of the reasons they put chicken in cages because I'll pick the hell out of each other you know they don't sever and they'll just tear each other out so that you know there are different considerations on that you know if you have an animal that you're you know cuz I talk a lot of cattle ranchers and most of them I mean most of them they really care about their animals around the snow and the rain making sure their animals are fed making sure they're sheltered you know if an animal goes down they're taking care of that so you know there's probably some bad apples out there and if we know about that stuff from some vegan documentary guy wants to make him film out that then yeah those guys should be saying hey don't mistreat your animals you know don't you know intentionally hurt them don't have them standing in a pile of crap you know give them some giving some you know fresh air and some some ability to move but you know you know if you look cows or handles in a while they're hurt animals anyway so they hang out together anyway it's not like if they're indoors now if they're indoors and they've got you know room to move around and they go in and go out I don't think that's a big issue and so I think you have to kind of you know you can't just make it all black and white right there's some people that are good at it some people are bad the bad ones need to be made not to do that anymore I mean it doesn't change the fact we all need to eat there's a company called butcher box that'll sell you grass-fed grass-finished beef - they sent it to you they're one of the sponsors of the show and I've eaten their meat it's very good and if you're certain if you're in a place don't we have it like a isn't there like some sort of a like a like a password or something that we give them to see we could find that but there's ways to get you mean you have to search for it though it's not know that you get you don't really exactly know how the person is raising it it's it's hard I mean you mean unless you go to some sort of a farmers market or something like that okay you can get $10 off plus free bacon by using the codeword Rogan at butcher box comm so butcher box is one option there's I'm sure there's like I said farmers markets are great too you can actually meet the ranchers and you know get a sense of how they raise these animals but I think for health-wise it's really critical to get grass fed grass raised to get the best do you pay attention to that or do you just take whatever you can get yeah so I think I think you know I think you're right in the fact that if you say what is the most nutrient dense what is the best quality I can get in grass-fed grass-finished it's going to fill that bill now if you compare that to something that was you know fed corn right and given hormones and given antibiotics and what else do they do you know so you know you've got those things and it's fed you know grain the difference nutritionally compared to you know because you don't have any money and you can't afford this young compared to the rest of the crap in the supermarket is you know so so I'll use it I'll use a MMA and algae for you so if grass-fed and grain-fed beef is you know Conor McGregor or GSP right then this other stuff is say some guy who's like the number three contender or something like that really it's that that close the difference isn't you know because you look at hormones and beef you know so you don't even or most in your meeting right right you don't want antibiotics in your meeting either right so you're in your grass-fed even though the elk you kill you've got hormones and that stuff because the animal makes it now over horse so you're getting a little harder getting some very low level and so what they do is they give those animals generally the same hormones it increases the percentage a little bit more compared to what you and I make normally so if they if we look at like nanograms you know maybe I can't remember numbers exactly but the scale is what's important so if they give you if grass-fed beef gives you five nanograms of estrogen okay green fed beef gives you 10 nanograms of estrogen and then you compare it to eggs which give you maybe 90 and you compare it to Dairy which gives you 110 and then you compare it to you know if you look at phytoestrogens you know that's a know that's an millions right so things like soybeans and stuff like that and then you compare it to what does your body naturally make and that's like thirty or forty thousand and so it's a really small level so I think if you can afford grass-fed and grain-fed you know I'm not saying how can you solve the world's problems I think if you're just - if we just isolate for health only say you're a poor guy and all you can afford is you know I can't afford this grasp it mean I can't for 20 bucks a pound for this stuff right in butcher box is still too expensive for me then that's probably still a better option than going back and eating you know the other crap gonna crow the Cheetos and the you know all this other stuff and even though you like the organic fruits and stuff like that you know it's just expensive for people so I mean I think it's you know like I said it depends on who your audience is you know if you've got unlimited resources and most people don't then you have to say what's you know what's you know from a health standpoint what is most affordable and what's practical how do I get my health back because this is you know I don't like I said I don't really I'm not like saying this is the best diet in the world for everybody I'm just saying you need to find out what works for you right ways who are saying is that grass-fed beef is better but it's only slightly better for you right I mean in the grand scheme of things right so if you're saying I want to be as good as I possibly can be and then I said probably grass-fed grain fit on the craftsman is probably better if you're like saying I'm just sick and I don't want to be sick anymore then I'd say get what you can afford so you really think that meat is in some ways a panacea for health you think that it really if you just eat more meat that your body will be what more vibrant more healthy like what is what is it about meat specifically well I think it's you know so this is another sort of misconception so I think a lot of P it's extremely well absorbed in our body I mean it's look at the end result of why we what do we do when we when we're eating okay what's the end result we eat for two reasons we eat to get energy and to build animal tissue I mean you and I are animals right animal tissue the most efficient way to do that is just to eat some because your body has it has it says everything and then the proportions that we need it right right and it's you know it's a misconception you know when you hear a lot of people will say you know if you get to meet a bunch of me just gonna sit there and rot and your intestines it's gonna purify and stuff like that so they've done Studies on people who have had ileostomy x' and these are people that have had their colon removed right so you've had colon cancer you know inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn's disease where they take out your whole cold and now you got a little back which you poop into this little bag right yeah so they've looked at people and they've looked at what comes out when they eat meat almost nothing comes out there's a little bit of liquid right so that means all that meat is being absorbed you know but when you eat a bunch of fiber and vegetables and plants all that stuff goes up in the back cuz you can't digest it you got to have you have to have bacteria in your colon to do that and humans are not really good at it compared to other primates we're really bad at it what about probiotics so I think probiotics you know the microbiome is fascinating and there's a lot of research going on there's a lot of people just talking all about this stuff how it affects your health one of the things that we we try to say is how do we define a healthy microbiome you can't yet we just don't know enough there are you know we can't even we don't even know everything about the human body and then to put in tens of billions of different bacteria all different different species and say this is the perfect combination that's perfect we're so far away from knowing that we're in the very infancy of what that means so what I would say is if you're healthy you know if your joints don't hurt if everything's going good then probably by definition your microbiome is fine if you're eating just a meat based that your microphone is gonna be different in the probiotic so probably not going to make a difference for you but if you're eating yeah if you're getting a crappy diet you know and you're feeding your got a bunch of sugar you're gonna get this dysbiosis which is bad you know bad bacteria and then you know maybe the private probiotics might help in that situation I'm not convinced you know I don't I just I just don't think there's a you know enough evidence to show that that's a big deal that's interesting so you think that perhaps maybe the probiotics exist or maybe the probiotics are healthy freaking out audio levels yeah too loud no no no separate so the probiotics you think maybe only beneficial of people are consuming a lot of variable things are a very diet like carbohydrates all sorts of different things and maybe the the probiotics are necessary to sort of balance you out is that what you're thinking I mean that potentially could be the case so you think that the microbiome of someone who eats meat is probably designed to eat meat well it is I mean I you your your microbiome reacts to whatever you do how much sleep you get how much exercise you know how much you eat you know how much stress is in your life is very very adaptable it can change in a day right you know so whatever you're feeding it chronically is gonna change what wouldn't like what bacteria live there so you know it's like this thing about you know again back to this meat putrefaction thing so if we look at the definition of putrefaction you know sounds awful right it's putrifying right putrefaction is the act area of bacteria on protein right so protein gets in your colon it'll appear to fry right so again when we go back to these ileostomy patients they study people that were getting soy protein and meat and guess which one had more protein going into the colon soy protein yeah so meeting about the soybeans stuff means more proteins going into your colon and you're getting more future facts in that way is that rumor like I know very little about what so I supposed to do to you in terms of like raising your estrogen levels is that supposed to be a real thing well I mean there's a lot of people think so I mean there's some studies that support that I don't know for sure I mean I don't I don't think so is a particularly good food for us I know some people will say that fermented soy you know is a little better yeah right that's good for you actually right they called not to not oh yeah I think it's an Asian type thing yeah you know I think that you know there's certainly some people that I think there's a lot of associations guys getting gynecomastia and stuff like that for meeting too much soy guys really done that I feel like that's one of those things where people just tell you you bitch tits you know I've got no idea guys getting that from anything other than steroids yeah I mean they're they're they're suppose we are I don't know for sure you can't say I can't say for sure entire yeah so now that you've been doing this do you plan on you've done it for a year now do you plan on continuing this for life is this your diet now are you gonna mix it up a little like right so I'm gonna you know I seriously doubt I will not eat a ton of meat you know I just think I feel - good I mean I think I want to feel good and perform as good as I can for as long as I can so whether I say and this is what I tell people you know do it for a couple months it's you know because this is one of the problems so many people have health problems and I think a lot of its food-related and it's really hard to sort that out you know if you're eating a hundred different types of food which one is I don't know I'm going to I'm going to drop this out right right so and it's obviously variable in terms of like your own individual by alright right so but I mean when you drop that and just meat then it's pretty easy you just say okay I'm only meeting now if I add fruit back in does that F me up or not you know if it does and I'm like man I shouldn't probably eat that right now if a dairy back in so probably there will be a point when I'll say hey I'm me you know maybe once well I have a you know have some berries again you know and then just see how I do with that I mean there's nothing wrong with that there are a lot of people I'll tell you that so these guys have been doing it for five eight 10 15 years I mean they're like me and that stuff - the best screws me up and I don't want to do that who was the guy that you were saying did you find that gentleman online young Jeremy the did you get the tab the guard that he was saying Anderson I couldn't actually couldn't find him that was can you go on if you go on my Instagram there is about no about a month or two ago I've got a picture I put up four of these people these are all people that have done it for total of 55 years okay and there's one guy as a marathon runner and then these other two couple have been doing it for twenty years another gal there's nothing gouging Kelly Hogan that she was like big morbidly obese woman and she went on a car virgin she's not for eight years and she got super lean she was - totally infertile couldn't have kids all right super lean carnivore got three kids later happy as can be all she does is eat hamburgers every day I mean that's society I mean it's if you know the stories I get you know this is cuz now I'm this kind of central point and I get all these crazy crazy stories of people this just from talking online just from talking yeah it's kind of fascinating is that well that's kind of like a little movement I think I think what you'll see over the next year or two there's gonna be a lot more people doing this just to try it you know and I think it's a crazy some people are gonna do it just to say hey it's cool it'll be a carnivore I'm just gonna I'm going to screw around but I think there's people that honestly are doing it and they're really seriously improving their health I think whatever works is what you should do well I think that the removal of refined carbohydrates almost helps everybody know I agree if not the removal the severe restriction just restrict most car I mean I think a day a week just have at it you have a fucking slice of pizza who gives a shit go to town I don't think there's anything wrong with a cheat day but I think overall refined carbohydrates just do not seem to be a healthy nor normal thing for your body to consume well if we look at you know historically I mean you know we didn't start consuming dairy until about 12,000 years going to start farming till about the same time so those things are in relatively novel you know we didn't start eating all this processed stuff fell about 100 you know Crisco came out in 1910 or something like this all that crap we've been invented in the last century and then when high fructose corn syrup came in in the 70s all that stuff our human body just hasn't evolved for yet so I think we're getting we're getting seriously messed up that stuff yeah and if you look at the change in our diet there's a corresponding uptick and diabetes and all sorts of other obesity factors and health issues sugar and refined carbohydrate still the two big ones though the other debate is whether or not eating all this meat is healthy for you and what about diverticulitis have you ever heard about people getting next I know that's what Brock Lesnar got and one of the things that they said that he got it from just eating mostly meat yeah this is interesting because there's actually got imperii PE are wide to study 2014 he did colonoscopies right so he actually looked in people it was one of the first ones to do this and he looked at people on these diets and he found that the people that ate the highest amount of fiber and had the most bowel movements had the most incidents of diverticulosis so diverticulosis precedes diverticulitis so a diverticula is just a little pouch that shoots out from your colon it looks like a little sack so what happens is that eventually gets infected then you get diverticulitis some people that were developing diverticulosis and most in his study he did two or three like this show the ones are reading a bunch of fiber and there's also studies on so that fiber gets caught or some things that potentially so the question is what other thing people don't understand you know because a lot of people when they talk about ketogenic diets and they cut out their fiber they're like you're gonna get all constipated right I mean you know I saw basically I haven't had a bowel movement in a year you know it's gone yeah it's not true obviously but so what happens is you just don't make anything I mean you you know all that meat it goes right into your small intestines absorb some next to nothing gets to your colon and so really anything you take little tiny poops exactly what if you like one of those do is it's backed up you don't even realize it and you got like twenty pounds of undigested isn't that always the funny yeah that's what happens is what was the story well he died with a colon full of stuff but they said you know look at this Joe if you go to the bathroom and eat a bunch of corn he looked down there sometimes there's some corn floating around every time you saw a piece of steak floating around in the toilet bone it's total myth and so when we talk about what causes constipation is probably a neurologic things probably neuromuscular the coal is not correct contracting correctly it may have to do with electrolyte deficiency it certainly varies depending on my diet when I eat a lot of vegetables man it just comes flying out like well it's cuz you just put more in alright so you're not constipated you're just you're just put your stuff and want your to shovel more stuff to the tube sort of but it seems like it comes out quicker like when I drink the craziest thing for sure for me is kale shakes when I drink kale shakes whoo well you're gonna boo I mean you're getting a bunch of you know liquid fibers getting in your colon like what cleans it all out makes me feel good well maybe you know some people do but there's no real prize for the most part when you thin of your life you're not gonna get an award for more having more about moments you don't you don't you don't shit yeah are you sure well I'm not a hundred percent sure so but that's my - again but most people think that just in all seriousness sort seriousness that that consuming fiber is important for like bowel movements and you overall intestinal health and all that stuff yeah there's no doubt the more fiber we eat the more babbling so you're gonna have but what happens if you if you get constipated there's another study about this they looked at people with chronic constipation that were always constipated the only thing that helped them was taking all fiber have their diet really yeah there's a study but that's crazy because that's what people like you what does that come you still what does that stuff useful music what you have is you've got a neuromuscular problem or the colon is not contracting the right way and so you're blacked up and they need to shove more flour in there and it just fills up more and more and eventually just come maybe you might be it'll force it all through but but that's not you know how that's you know it's a lot of people will say that I will tell you there's a lot of people who'll tell me fiber just jacks up their intestines I mean they feel awful when they taking a lot of fiber huh I have heard that before when people try five or supplements that they have issues now do you very do a lamb occasionally or wild game or yeah I mean if that's what's available I mean you know I'm pretty happy with was with beef but I mean when I was I was in France earlier this year and I had just a bunch of lamb you know that's that's easier to get I'll have sometimes about chicken you know having a game mean well I wasn't getting gaming since I've started this but I used to have eating elk before and deer and you know chilies and stuff like that so that's that's fine but I mean but you don't necessarily eat a lot of chicken huh it's mostly red meat yeah I just find it there's a lot of people like me to do this they just find chicken is not as satisfying it's just it's probably not as nutritious you know it's just kind of it doesn't feel as sad it's fine when you're eating it ya know it's it's probably not you know I think it's just harder yeah I'm always trying to figure out like what is that response that you get when you slice into a steak and it's juicy and delicious your whole body goes like oh you know I think that's a primitive thing that goes back a hundred thousand years I mean yeah that's like that's like the point of you know all this hunting we did and it's just what what kind of satisfies this why I always try to explain to people that the difference between like domestic beef versus like a slice of like moose tenderloin like the difference in the richness of the flavor and the darkness of the meat and the nutrition content to the food is so much higher that the hmm is higher to like the one you slice into and you're like oh my god just your body's like that more of that there we go that's what I think it's a primal thing I think it's just like this is satisfaction well the vegan Army has they've got their troops pointed in your direction right I'm sure yeah yeah bunch of tweets about you and one that one of the tweets was talking about your record as a doctor in New Mexico and stuff that you and I went back and forth sure sure so let's let's get that out and try to figure out what the issue was all right so so you know I was you know like I said that's good in my background a little bit so i you know i go to i go to medical school you know go to you know degree in biology then i go to medical school then i drop out of medical school to play professional rugby you know i just kind of crazy crazy career then i go into the military and i launch nuclear bombs for you know five years nuclear bombs yeah that was a nuclear bomb launch officer for about five years where do you still launch nuclear bombs well I mean up in Wyoming and Nebraska and Colorado and they actually detonate them no no you that's where that's where you shoot them from right okay so you can actually launch them but you were was a guy that if we went to war North Korea you know they do all this crazy psychological screening to make sure you're not some psychopath you know so I'm just like straight ethical guy that's just like you know you know good you know just a good solid guy that the top secret clearance all this stuff so I do all this stuff so then I go play rugby and then I get tired get my head kicked in you know I was playing you know I remember my last match just playing some Russian team I'm laying on the ground and they're just teeing off teeing off on my head kicking me in the head I got blood coming out of my ears I'm like I'm 30 years old I'm like f it I'm gonna go back to medical school so so I go back to medical school with military pays for it this time so then you know I might I'm and you know go through go through school with my training and graduate top and you know right my class in medical school because give me an orthopaedic you got it you got to be like it's one he's real competitive steel so you got to be really at the top of the class to do that so I do that stuff do all my training bust my ass do really well get all these awards and training then I get to military and then they sent me to war alright so they send me to Afghanistan and this is how if it's ok I'll give you a little bit of yeah so I'm you know I come out of training that long I training and me and this other dudes name's Tom large is excellent excellent surgeon good one think it's a great guy great people me and him are the only two guys at the main center in Afghanistan so you fly out there it takes you about three days you go to Bangor Maine and these old ladies give you lobster bisque on the way out it's kind of cool then you fly in a turkey and then we sat there for like six hours on the runway wouldn't let us move they won't let us off the plane when they fly into Kurdistan which is they used to be part of the Soviets in your Soviet Union so we've got a US base and Soviet Union so we stay there for a while it's freezing cold and then we get on this c-130 which is a military plane you know you're packed in there with the cargo and you fly in Afghanistan they're shooting at just they turn off the lights so that you know hopefully they don't hit you they're shooting at you come in so we get in there and then I get off the plane and then they put you in this gentleman hall with like 300 guys on cots first night of then we go to the first day to go to work right and we're taking over from the army and I was in the Air Force at the time so we're taking over for the army the first thing I roll is Anders is poor I mean I remember this man I was it was like welcome to fucking war there was a guy Canadian guy who's 23 year old kid his special forces guy you know full beard because you know the special force guys who wear beards cuz it was so they could blend in right both legs blown right off I mean what can i oh shit you know this is like this is you know stuff just got real so every day on boom-boom-boom trunk crazy trying we would get people blown up by bombs I mean their whole their legs are being on I mean the sect third day we got there we had a kid he was 17 year okay this is an enemy we were taking four enemies to right he's setting up a roadside bomb to kill our guys right he's from he's a 17 year old kid from Pakistan it blow he blows himself up blows up both his legs above the knee blows off one of his arms and most of his hands so he's basically I mean he's got nothing left so we're operating on this guy we do all these operations just basically say the kitchen life even though he's an enemy because there's a physician you just that's just your job right so what happens to this guy is so we fix him up it takes us you know month to get him stabilized and they take him out the gate the Afghan army just goes and shoots him in the head well fuck you know we're like what the hell are we doing here you know it's like we're doing all this work and he's got and kill these people did they did that because they knew who he was an enemy and so you know they don't you know they don't play games so and this happened the other way too around we saw that seems like a lot of wasted money it is it's a waste it's heartbreaking you know you get in there and so we're getting them getting these people they're blown up by rockets or whole things get attached to I mean this looks even if it's the enemy like you're in the military you're working as a surgeon you're overseas you're taking care of I mean obviously it's a 17 year old kid right at the time and these guys are like you know if you don't come fight for us we're gonna kill your family right so a lot of these little kids are out there damn sure that they don't know what they want to do it's not gonna be guys so you kind of do I mean it's like you know it's like hey you know it's not my job to punish these people it's my job to take care of these people are you there when they shot the kid did you see what was heard about him or like what happened to him well they killed you know we heard about several of our patients this happened - it was pretty pretty frustrating so we get in there and there's like people like I mean little kids we're getting these little kids to three year old kids stepping on landmines legs blown off we had one little three-year-old kid I mean he was I mean he was I mean somebody drugged him behind a truck for like a mile and they drugged this kid through the streets to the rough pass Wall Street and they the legs fucking ripped off I mean his kids Road Rash actually his legs were ripped off he was burned everywhere and we're in here treating this stuff why did they do that to him I don't know just mad at their parents I don't know it's just this is not this is not a life friendly place right this is life is inconsequential there there was a guy there was art but we had a pediatrician who was talking to this guy who was a farmer right and he was tell us about his tractor right he was real proud he has a truck because real expensive to have a tractor in there so what he would do because tractors real valuable he would have his kids walk in front of the tractor so they didn't hitting land mines oh my god so if your kid had he's like I can make another kid I can't this is the mentality there you know it's just crazy stuff so we get into imagine you have kids could you imagine telling your fucking kid to walk in front of landlines I can do it I mean it would be it would be it would be awful oh Jesus Christ so we get this stuff and then it's you know Disqus scheming is this keeps getting worse I mean it's like every day we get these people with you know their blown-up inner you're looking at their hip socket was completely gone you can see a spine in his hip socket day in and day out were seeing this stuff we get we had this one we had so he's headed so Dick Cheney was a vice president right yeah so he flies into the base right and it was supposed to be secret no one supposed to know about it but the Telamon guys found out about it right so what they do is they go to our gate set off a suicide bomb and they just kill I mean tons of people and we get all of these casualties you know most of them most immersive millions right so we get all these civilian casualties little kids and adults you know in their suicide vests they put all these more you like these metal bearings you know like half-inch thick metal bearings and they cover them up and cover them shit so they get infected and they blow through people I mean you get people with stuff going through their brains and shattered bones everywhere and all these people that are just you know dinosaurs chaos you know all these people you get swarmed and there we were getting this stuff all this time this was the base when we had and so we were I mean we're literally 40 hours straight you're working you know you're trying to save people's lives you know I'm operating with the general surgeons on people's bellies which I'm not trained to do but I'm just helping you're trying to do this stuff so in the middle of this operation we're in there operating you know take turn take care these people and then you're right and then the operating room is just a little I mean it's like a little metal storage building you know it's like a like a little like a little like you're moving your little pod things you know they stick a couple of operating beds in there and we're going as fasting we're wearing body armor and we have nine-millimeter strapped to us and we're operating you know it's hard to move around it's real small and we're sitting in there and they say hey guys we think there's another bomber inside the hospital you know and the hospital that you pull off so you're going you know your butt hole tightens up and you're like oh fuck I got to keep operating this guy's in life so we keep we just like well we're gonna go we're gonna go alright so we just keep you know we keep operating fortunately they you know they didn't know they thought I did say somebody snuck in as a casualty so they sometimes do that they blow people up and then they sneak in as a casualty and blow more people up that she's memorized so it's like you know it's kind of freaky and so I'm you know I was like what an insane environment how long were you there for six months yeah yeah so that's that's that's pretty crazy stuff so you know we get out of there and you know it was it was just it was a tremendous experience I mean it was just like because there was nothing I could see that after that it was like that ain't nothing everything I saw after that as a sergeant was like this is no big deal right right so then I get out and then I you know I get out of the military what other five years just taking care of normal guys in military right doing you take your troops and stuff like that doing fine I work for all these other hospitals and did fine I never had any problems and then I get to this other Hospital you know I you know I joined this group and they make me the head of the group right we're not a group it's just like an orthopedic surgery group so and then when I got there they were like two guys and they weren't doing hardly any business at all I was like really slow no one knew they were there you know they were in part of his big huge group and all these other doctor but he know they existed so I got there and I said well this is crap and one of the reasons because no one was seeing anything they were refused all his patient I got there and I said hey man I'm gonna go talk to all these other doctors and let him know we're alive that we're here and that we're gonna see anything you want to send us and we'll take care of it if we can't we'll make sure it gets taken care of the right way so that happened and we started growing right so we went from two guys to 12 guys in about three years and so and we were very very busy real busy group in the rival group from out of town from across the street didn't really like it that much because we were taking millions of dollars from having tens of millions of dollars in their business right because it's worth Pedic surgery is very very lucrative for a hospital here's things like cardiology where they're putting in stents and serve all these procedure based practices make a lot of money for hospitals so they really like it right so they're really happy they're happy with me I'm like the you know I'm like a hero right because you're like man you're making us a lot of money the group across town doesn't like me very much because I'm taking all their money away and so they approached us and they said you know why don't you join our group you know we'll take care of and I said no I don't want to do that but to my partners did they eventually left so I'm the only holdout guy but I'm still going I'm still building the group and so I'm like the head I'm like the head of the snake - Ryan all right but here's what kind of happened so I'm busy I'm doing well my patients are happy I'm doing really well I've got a low real low complication rates you know you know everybody's you know I'm very popular you know I'm on billboards and magazines I'm on radios you know I'm you know I'm just I'm just their poster boy basically right so then as I found with my diet I started seeing patients getting better by just changing their diet and when you look in the orthopaedic you know like bone disease like Earth right there's nothing about diet in there I mean you were study about it if somebody comes in your office you know you'll tell them you know we can give you some tylenol we can give them you some you know another anti-inflammatory drug we can we can sick some cortisone in your knee you know if that doesn't work maybe well you know if they need a physical therapy might put a scope in there and if none of that works you know this is an end stage and we're gonna replace your knee right so what I was finding you know as I started doing this with patients is that these patients are getting better just by changing or not put him on a ketogenic diet I was at that time I was doing keto so I was like hey man try this so mine and my nurse and I had this and this is one of the things that kind of I'm very jaded about the way the business side of medicine is now this has been a pretty pretty interesting experience for me so I had a nurse it was just I mean she was a wonderful person I mean the nicest sweetest girl in the world she would work so hard for these patients he would take care of you know anything you needed done you tell her hey take care and she was just awesome right the hospital said you're staying too late we're having to pay you overtime and she's like well I'm taking care of patients well we don't care I don't want you to work late because it cost us too much money so it's just like it was one of these things where you're starting to see that you know it's all about the money and then we were like so all these surgeons are you know one as a certain you get used to using certain equipment you know it's like you know I'm using this particular thing to replace people joints and you do it for years and years and years and you get pretty good at it and so what the hospital said is hey we got a bargain deal with this other company so your guys are gonna use that you know we're like no we don't use that we've learned how to eat this won't even know how to use that stuff so they force everybody to do this you know just to say you know with some new surgical equipment is that we're saying yeah well basically you know there's a system it's like if you drive a Ford truck your whole life no I understand what you're saying and then they say no you're right but this is surgical this is so messed up this is the whole reason is that we're gonna save you money all the scraps were bitching the ones guys were already using like I don't care and this is the other group we don't care but our group was like we don't we use this stuff man it's it's stuff we don't even know how to use this guy right you're not adapted to you're not a deaf and you're gonna compromise person care a little bit for this so you know this is one of those things Robin I was very vocal against this I was like man I don't you know this is BS you know this is this is what we're trained on you know we're gonna we're gonna end up you know there's many patients gonna be problematic from this stuff so that wasn't a side thing and then there was a system where it's another thing they put in the you know this is one thing that all physicians hate it's think on electronic medical record it's a computer-based record not that it's a computer-based thing but they're awful I mean they sit there and their main function is to collect billing and to do coding so it's a capture as much information as you can so you can bill more right that's that's you know why hospitals like them so they put this on you and it's like you know no it's like really hard to take you know to put good information there cuz all it does is generate a bunch of data that's totally illegible you can't you look at it's like you get 20 pages of BS and run two paragraphs of stuff you need right so where did it all go bad so then we so basically what happened is when I started telling peach people I don't want to you know I'm sorry I start talking people out of surgery right I started saying I don't think you need surgeon then I started talking to the administrators and say hey guys I really want to spend a day a week just doing lifestyle counseling I don't want to you know I don't want to you know constantly do this because I think this can work honestly you're making the cutting motion like research right so they basically said no there's no appetite for that your skill is a certain we want you there you know in other words keep making us a lot of money right right so I'm like you know you know and my nurse will team and I was printing out I made a list of all his reading you remember like Gary I know he had Gary Thompson and I had his book and I had and Nita tackles his book on and I had it's got him butter Bob Riggs you know all these ketogenic things references and I was handing them out 2025 single day and I was spending time with the patients you know because normally you'd only get like eight eight minutes to see a patient you know figure out the problem figure out playing go go go and I was like now it's spending twenty minutes talking these guys about diet and so you know that I'm seeing less patients and the hospital keeps saying you know you know we don't really like that so because I was ahead of the group and I was well liked by everybody really good patient records I mean really good patient satisfaction you're really little complication rate I mean they were they're like no we don't like that so then they go there's something called peer review right so they can just pull your records and say we don't like the way you did this and you know we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna criticize your work and so they did that and they went through there and this is one of the things they said well every surgeon will have X amount of complications right it's like you know if you do you know a hundred surgeries about 5% of the time there's gonna be some complication somebody's gonna get an infection something's gonna bleed too much time he's gonna get a blood clot you know if it's north big surgeon maybe one of the screws you put in brakes or something those things are all complication that happens to everybody no matter what so what they said is there's there's a low threshold right there's like you know we're gonna say every year we're gonna give you two complications that were your fault right because most of the time you have a complication it's like there's nothing I could have done equipment failure yeah they'll say you made the wrong decision that little complication so let's say you can get to a year right and it doesn't matter if you do a hundred surgeries a year or you do 500 surgeries here the numbers still - right I'm like you know cuz I was there for like five years and like every year was like one one one one just nothing minimal all right one year one year they go back so you hit three this year I'm like yeah but I did five times as many surgeries than anybody else and I said well it doesn't matter we're gonna we're in still put you through peer review so what they do is a high remember this other group that I was pissing off and was taking ten million dollars a year from they hire their guy that guy to look through my stuff why would they do that because that's what they wanted to do but why would they do that if that person on that other side is the competition because he was in the position to do it right so and that's not supposed to happen it'd be like if you were a Bella tour guide and they said I want the bellator guy to the UFC all right I think Joe Rogan sucks is an announcer and I have a villa tour guy go after him right so it's total conflict of interest right so I you know I mean I'm like this naive ethical guy that's like well you know I know I could care and rest we're doing fine and then you know I was just like okay well okay that's fine and so they get it back in the guy and they looked at they looked at a dozen cases which they've selected you know they could pick whatever they want they said well he said I think sixties cases were below average you know I don't like you way you documented stuff and this and I disagree what you did so I'm like fun they said well that's okay you know you know you're fine I said what do I need to stop operating some way they say no no no you're fine what we're gonna do is we're gonna get an independent review right this is supposed to be someone with no conflicts of interest right so the ways this is supposed to happen is that they were supposed to let me see what the cases are and put my comments in there right and they were supposed they supposed to be totally in there so what they didn't did instead is they wouldn't let me know any of the cases they told me you can't see anything right and the guy that would had the conflicts of interest they gave him all of his findings and set him to this guy right and this guy and I you know I don't know the situation for this guy but you know I found this out about six months later he is either senile or totally drunk I mean it was just like you know so he gets this report right and it's just bad it's like looks really bad and I'll talk about some of the details in a second but it just looks really bad and they come they pull me off and say we got this really bad in an independent report right and I'm like what cases well we can't tell you but it's really bad and we're gonna we're gonna suspend you privileges we're not gonna let you work here anymore so essentially what you're trying to say is they targeted you and they targeted you because you were changing what you were doing and you were trying to counsel people with lifestyle and they decided to pick on you and try to find things that were wrong in some of the past surgeries that you do I think there's a combination I think there was a combination of you know problems where we're not some people were doing intentionally but there was there was definitely possibly some of there's some of that going on but anyway so they get this report and the guy there's there's two people they bring me office say you know we're gonna shut down you can't go to your clinic you can't talk to anybody you work with we're gonna deny you access to all the clinic charts we're gonna shut off your email you can't look at anything right like I'm like I just committed murder like I'm some pariah and then they say then the guy and I'm like you know I'm like I mean it's LexA my kid just died I mean this is something I spent my whole life training for you know I'm doing this stuff and it's like you know I mean it's like you're like dazed and confused and um I mean I'm like no I'm like I don't know I'm like I'm like I'm gonna drive my freakin car off a cliff you know you're like suicidal almost you know so the guy comes to me and goes hey man we got this really bad stuff on you it's gonna go really bad we're gonna take it to a committee in a couple days and I think the best thing you can do is just say you're sorry write a letter I'll even help you write this letter you know basically say confess that you did the wrong thing so I'm like you know I didn't I didn't a lawyer at the time you know what's going on so I said okay I'll do this and so I write this letter saying yeah you know I probably dunno stuff different I don't know what the cases were but probably and so so you're saying this without even have reviewed the cases that they're condemning you on absolutely oh fuck did you not get a lawyer I did afterwards you know I've been a straight-laced ethical guy my whole life so when you did afterwards did the lawyer go back and look at that confession or whatever you would call it she said well this is preposterous because you're not even talking about a specific case well she said it was probably something he shouldn't have done yeah callously but this guy was on the committee that condemned me right so this is a guy they set you up so in some way so this is you don't want to say that since you still wanted to be a doctor well so this is so basically they take this committee right and they hand this report it says all this bad stuff and they hand my confession right and this is all I had this is basically what they have to go on no one knows anything about the cases and this is all these people that are doctors but they're not surgeons right all they are is it would be like if you were reviewing MMA guys like so let's say you want to kick somebody out of the UFC because you said his performance isn't up to snuff and you went to a bunch of tennis players and golfers and said okay hey man we don't think he hasn't his takedown percentage sucks so these people have no friggin clue right right no clue and they don't have specification no specification I'm not allowed to talk about this because I don't know their specific cases so then a railroad job so so then I you know I kind of come out of this haze and I look and I said we'll give you a fair hearing this is what they call it a fair and federal law requires us to give you a fair hearing right so I get a lawyer and this is expensive this shit you know I'm an income anymore so I'm spending all his money on the lawyers fees and it's taken the hospital it drags out they won't release records for like six months so six months goes by I mean here I got four small kids I'm like fuck am I gonna feed my kid my kids are in school I want an autistic son and he's therapy and you know this is this is tough you know so going through this stuff it's a six months go later and then I finally get the cases right and I started looking through the cases and what the guy wrote and not only are there errors there are egregious errors and there's multiple them and they're just horrible I mean they're just so wrong I mean I just watched it again dress senile or drunk and I'll give you a couple examples and any worth Peak Surgeons was listening to us know immediately what I'm talking about but I'll try to make it make sense for other people so of these twelve cases two of them were something called a reverse shoulder replacement so what happens is you have your shoulder wears out you can replace your shoulder right shoulder replacement some people yeah yeah yeah what do you put in there like some sort of an artificial joint yeah so this is what it's what I'm talking about so normally it's a ball and socket joint right so there's something called a reverse shoulder replacement which you basically switch it around you put the ball where the socket was and the socket where the ball was which sounds totally crazy right all right this was developed in France in the 80s and then the FDA approved this in 2004 all right so 2004 was approved in the US and originally it was approved for one reason right if your shoulder is totally arthritic you know real bad our thing you don't have a rotator cuff anymore and it's completely gone right so that's what it was first approved for but over the years over the next 5-10 years people started using it for all these other things and getting really really good results with so if you come in there with a blasted apart shoulder that's crashed and broke and you're an older person people do that all the time and so that's that's what I did I basically put a no you know a reverse shoulder and a person that broke their arm and just twice and not only did the patient do well I'm patient was happiest can be they're great they're like no one knew the outcomes of these patient where this patient as happy as can be but the guy writes because he's old I think we're drunk or doesn't know the new record he hasn't read a literature and he writes he put it in backwards no he puts it's not indicated for this isn't the only reason to do is for an arthritic guy with a missing rotator cuff but he doesn't know that over the last 10 years all kinds of different reasons to use it so he basically tells his committee he's doing the wrong operation when anybody today knows that's not the case right there's another case there's a guy it's okay we don't have to keep just going over case after case but what where does it stand right now so basically what happens is so they drag this out for a year and a half right and they finally you know and at the end you know I tell it cuz it because they I gotta tell you this part so I go through this is important I go through and compiled all these cases right and get all the data refute this and pull all these references in textbooks and all this stuff and I'm like this is a walk in the park right I'm gonna anybody that sees this in the right mind is gonna see that they screwed up in their zone all these errors that's wrong so I see in discovery process you send all this information in and then they fit then they realize that wait a minute there's a lot of errors in here so now they have to pick a hearing officer right who's like the judge right his word goes they pick another they get another search they give me a list of surgeons to choose from you say you can have any of these guys you want and I look to listen there's one guy you remember that group that I was competing with him he's in that group and I'm like I don't want him because he's on the other group right and they said no he just retired and we went we're gonna make you use him right so they picked the judge and then on top of that they pay him okay so they're paying this guy all right so they review all this stuff and I've got this stuff and I'm going through case after case where I'm like the patient didn't get the patient was doing great they didn't get hurt there's nothing wrong with them and the lawyers from the other side are like well you can't do this no harm no foul stuff like what are you talking about you know no one got everybody's doing great but he's like well I think you know you could have done something different or something like that and you know like if you look at a malpractice case the first thing you have to do is prove harm right if no one gets hurt there's nothing there and it's not that anyone knowing I'd heard no one did but it's just like so think it's so the guy at the end of it goes through he says yeah there are a lot of air right and they're paying this guy and they chicken challenging him but I think you gave patients too much choice in their care which is I'm like what are you talking about you know so if like if the criticism was that no he said it was really bad errors and and they said you gave patients too much choice and you didn't document stuff as well as you should have right and I still think that they should have just suspended you so this is this is a decision they make based on that and I will guarantee if anybody was on that committee that knew me because those people who knew me on the committee knew I was a good guy they never had problems with me so that's why they were shocked when this came out but if they knew that information I'm 100% convinced that would be a difference so where does it stand so then you know I get done with that and then the state gets involved because they have to respond any complaints the state state gets his complaint I stayed in New Mexico and it's kind of weird cuz my next-door neighbor is on the state board I'm just like totally avoiding the guy cuz I don't want to influence anything right I'd be giving them flowers no but I just didn't want to deal I even told him I said hey my next-door neighbor is on your board right so I don't want to be totally ethical about this this is the story so I you know they they said dudes on like flowers yeah so then you know this the board gets us and they say hey man this is this is a bad recommendation and we're gonna give you two options you can suspend your license you know you can voluntarily suspend your just surrender your license or you can go to trial you know we can do another hearing which probably take a year it's gonna cost you tons of money you know which I don't tired of this I'm tired of lawyers spending all this money and I'm not I'm still figured how am I gonna feed my kids so then you know the state says or what you can do is we'll send you to a place to evaluate you independently and then if everything goes well we'll give your license back so that's I said okay that's what I'm gonna do because I'm tired us I don't want to spend a hundred thousand dollars in one a year when I can go this place and spend twelve thousand dollars and get evaluated and go from there so I was that's where I was this week in fact I was in Denver being with these other Serbs and they're just like going through all these case case case what would you do what would you do what would you do and I am clearly you know even though I haven't done this stuff in two years I'm clearly convinced that they're gonna say hey man you're fine and they're gonna say here go operate with somebody for they allowed to look at those cases where you were judged upon poorly they're not they're not they're not because I wanted to be totally in fuckin saying so how do you make a lemon now I'm living off my savings you know I saved up some money so I living off that and that's that's immensely yet you know so I'm just kind of slowly watching my savings going down Jesus Christ that's gotta be stressful it's kind of stressful I mean you know I've got a girlfriend it makes a good living but I don't want to be you know but I've got kids we've got kids I've got a kid with her and I've got three kids with my ex-wife and they're all young kids and so I'm back in so I said I'm travelling back man back and forth you know trying to support these kids you know I had to pull my kids out of school that's put him in a different school because the income wasn't there anymore and so it's kind of a pain it's kind of it kind of sucks so where's this tan as far as like getting your license reinstated yeah so probably so I just in Denver this it'll take about eight weeks so they'll give me a give me a plan and they'll say okay we think that you know and I am almost 100% convinced they're going to say you know we need you to go work with some dude for a couple months cuz you're out of practice and I think I'll brighten up doing that then the board the State Board will review what they say and lo they say hey man you're you know what you're doing they'll give it back to me so it's saying yeah so anyway it's it's you know it's again I don't blame the State Board I don't blame the people who are on the committee because they were clueless I didn't know what I blame something confidence by the administrators you know and and just whoever reviewed me you know if it were a caveman times Josh I get all the big club and like what though right you know I understand man that's that's very disheartening but it's I've I have a friend who's going through a very similar type situation who was also a surgeon there's uh yeah it's there's I think people need to understand that the medical business is in fact a business no no we think of hospitals as being these completely you know egalitarian places that just they exist to heal people and to do the best job they sort of do but they also they need to make a lot of money well I got to pay the light bill yeah I understand that but there's a point where you know it's kind of like you've got to make a decision between patient care and you know ya know they do that with animals too I mean you gotta be really careful I had a friend who had a recent situation happened with his dog where they were telling his dog him dog needed to get some crazy surgery and he didn't have the money for it and he's like are you sure he's sure they need and he said I had to ask them over and over and over again and he said and finally the veterinarian said well we could try a steroid on the dog and see if that works fucking fixed it a hundred percent yeah and the steroid cost like 150 bucks versus some thirty thousand dollar surgery but they kept pushing the surgery which would have fused the dogs discs they were like this needs to happen need to do this and he's like there's no other options we've exhausted all possible options and then finally after asking over and over and over again she suggested meekly this which instantly fixed it yeah that's it in like two months the dog was 100% you know it's cuz I know he hit Chris kress around here while I listen to a little bit of stuff and then and his premise at the beginning which I have read his book yet but I think it's great I mean here's a problem western medicine you know we're facing this I mean it's like a war against chronic disease it's like we're being invaded by you know remember Independence Day with that yes you know and doctors we got BB guns I mean it's the stuff we are shooting at them doesn't work for chronic disease now acute stuff it's different you know there's some stuff that we have this to wonderful technology but the run in the middle diabetes and obesity doctors are great for fixing broken job I saw every day you know if we were trained properly in nutrition and exercise you know that's what I've done my whole life you know I know what I'm doing exercise wise but you know if we were allowed to do that instead of training all these you know radiology technicians and blood draw technicians and nursing assistants if you had an army of preventive people we're ahead of medicine people you know and we train all these people to go into people's homes you know I think Russ was talking about that and just get the crap out of their diet and show them how to be healthier you know I mean you would you would save you know it's funny watching the politicians debate about health care how to fund it you know it's like you guys are arguing about the Titanic and it's coming up in an iceberg and you're not you're arguing about the color of the deckchairs I mean we are going over a cliff and then we're not fixing it by keeping putting you know band-aids you're not gonna write it the technology's not gonna fix diabetes nutrition is you know the essentially dealing with the problem when it's already gotten to a point where you're in the hospital yeah I mean there's you know like I said there's a guy Peter at TIA I don't know if you know he is but he he talks about when he was a surgeon he felt like he was at the bottom of a building and somebody's throwing eggs off and his job is to catch the eggs so instead of it we should be investing you know we talked about prevention but it's bullshit we don't do anything for prevention it's so little and then the problem the problem is a lot of it doesn't work the way we designed it you know yeah there's a there's a lot of money in fixing you there's a lot of money in telling you and but it is a changing climate though with because of people like Chris Kresser and Rob Wolfe and dr. Rhonda Patrick and a lot of others they're giving out really good nutrition advice and people changing the way they eat and think about food and it's having a massive effect on the information that they carry in their body I know so many people that used to have joint pain a great example is the primal kitchen mark Sissons book which is fantastic and his story Mark's story about having his own inflammatory issues with his hands he had some pretty severe arthritis that he thought was just gonna be with him forever he changes his diet reduces all the refined carbohydrates it goes on this protein high fat diet and it all goes away I mean there's so many examples of that and I just watched this documentary called what's with wheat and it's all about glyphosate in the we roundup and how when they say it's safe for people to consume they say well it only affects plants and bacteria they be like what about your microbiome your microbiome is filter bacteria and you're killing that stuff like we don't think of that as being an issue you know we don't think of sedentary lifestyle as being an issue when it comes to the the ultimate cause for you to wind up in the hospital needing surgery but it absolutely I can tell you one of the things I used to see cuz you know when you're when you're surgeon you like someone comes in with bad arthritis and you place their knee and they feel better for a while and you're like oh that's great man I really help this person then they come in next year and there are other knees all jacked up and you better place that well you should have just done something so they didn't need our threat it didn't get you know didn't need surgery or any other time I've had conversations with people that their dad that needs an artificial knee and I'm like are you sure yeah are you sure like yeah he's limping bad I mean he really can't take it anymore like have you exhausted all possible options like what have you done about the diet no you won't he's not into that he's always not into that well here's a problem because no one's demonstrated the diet works but I will tell you this is this is a man you know well no one's demonstrated it in terms of like scientific right but I will tell you that you know just because I told you no because I'm a freak because I'm just eating me and I'm doing this athletic stuff and ever he says you're an outlier your genetic free whatever Brett you're an N equals one so we made his website called N equals many minutes other Air Force guy that he's also a carnivore we got this thing we said well what if people started gathering this information together and we could start documenting then that's what we did so we I put out a survey on Twitter I said hey how many guys would be willing to go 90 days and just eat eat a bunch of steaks and I had like 400 I don't have that many followers by like 400 people yeah we'll do it that's amazing so we put the wheat you know we developed this website and it's called N equals menu icon for people want to see so we developed this website and we start getting these first an equal sign or EQ EQ spell I don't know put N equals so we do this and we get all these people that sign up and we ended up having about a close to a hundred people just do 90 days it's just eating meat and then we and it's and again there's a lot of scientific route things you can criticize about this you know it's just guys eat meat anecdotal stuff and go stuff but you know when we got done and I've got the results of week we just we're still analyzing today because we're all doing this for free you know we're trying to get people to help us analyze the data and you know but of these hundred people you know there's not an 85 actually of these people we ask them what happened to your general health would happen to your sexual health what happened to your exercise capacity what UGI health through skin right every we asked all these questions and um there was maybe one 1% where they said I got worse 99% got better much better or say to say you know so it was just like unanimously everybody got you know pretty much either the same is it possible that there's some bias in that group because they're following you absolutely that's that's you know that's but it's interesting but then we're getting some mo lab data cuz I know you like about lab data so I get people and I don't have access to all the data and I didn't want it I didn't want to have access to they I don't want to bias myself against it so I'm getting fed the data and I'm seeing that people's blood pressure is normalizing people's hemoglobin a1c which is never a measure glucose is normalizing people's inflammation markers are normalizing you know all these markers of disease are going in the right direction you know we're just seeing good stuff you know because a lot of the people will say meat causes diabetes meat cause of hyper teams you see yeah that only time I've ever seen meat causes diabetes isn't that wacky what the health documented which has been widely disproven you know we had on it rewrote a whole piece about that debunking that and like how much stuff in that is like fake science like what they're saying about meat causing diabetes there's no evidence of that yeah I mean they they look smus they use some associational stuff and that's all they ever do I mean it's like some associations yeah but they're putting it out as if it's a hundred percent factual and like the sounding the alarms like this is what's causing diabetes it's meat meanwhile they're completely ignoring the consumption of all these refined carbohydrates these people are eating with the meat yeah my hundred percent I mean that's totally true I mean the you know and so one of the thing is so nice about studying these people they're just eating meat I'm you isolate that's very very good isolate so we know what happens when you just eat know are they allowed to take supplements during the time we had we had so many we would the what we said with document it yeah we had them document stuff and some of them do some you know it's kind of like one of those things where we because we'd never done this before and like we're eating we made them document all kinds of stuff and a lot of people some of the people initially dropped out cuz we made them document too much stuff like it's too much my house or other stuff so we had certain percentage dropped out because it just didn't wanna document stuff we had a certain percentage of dropped out because they didn't feel they felt like they had a little energy right and so a lot of people when they do this they just can't eat very much I mean I'm full and they're not eating enough and so that's one of the biggest things I tell people when they switch over this eat me like it's your job that's why I tell them you got to eat initially didn't they just eat til they're not hungry anymore well the problem is you the problem is a lot of people lose weight on this you know a lot of people get lean on this stuff is that you know your hunger goes down pretty low because you're you know you're eating a lot of fat you eat a lot of protein you know especially if you're eating three and ribeye steaks you know that's probably about 70% fat 30% protein something like that so I mean it's it's really really satisfying and so you know they they tend up they tend under because no one's used to like if I sold you Joe eat four pounds of meat a day you're gonna be like I mean I know you like eating meat but I mean even that's probably a big disel ah it's a lot you know and so to get used to that it takes a while yeah depends on your activity level because I work out pretty damn hard and I do it pretty often so I mean you do some crazy shit man let's how you box jumps yeah you know this is like I said this is uh you know back to that glycolytic stuff I do I mean I'm you know I'm my capacity exercise is great one of the things is cuz I felt no difference I'm sorry to interrupt you but you felt no difference between going from the ketogenic diet to eating meat or did it feel like you had more energy I had more energy I had better libido you know you wake up every day you know you're ready to go you know it's like you know I've had a couple people that and I haven't test this but I had a couple people have done this and again we need to get more data I've had a couple eat was done I said their testosterone level went up you know they went on all meat their testosterone went up about 20% you like well that's interesting you know I don't put a lot of faith in just a couple of anecdotes that happens to a lot of people to go on the ketogenic diet because the cholesterol is actually the precursor to testosterone sure absolutely yeah it's kind of interesting if you look at you know red meat consumption in the u.s. since my 1977 so red meat has gone down about 30 to 40 percent really yeah we used to eat way more in the 70s we ate about 30 to 40 percent more red meat than we do now no kidding yep and also our testosterone levels have dropped significantly and population testosterone levels have dropped about that same amount I thought people eat a lot of red meat I would've never imagined me be less now we ate way less than we used to Wow yeah so here's another interesting fact Hong Kong right Hong Kong right now if you look you Google Hong Kong life-expectancy they live the longest out of anybody in the world right they eat about 40% more red meat than we do in the US and then and they have the longest lived people in the world which is interesting yeah I'd read something that said that a hundred percent of all people that live over a hundred no it was some high number of all people that live over a hundred consume red meat yeah I don't doubt it you know it's interesting cuz you know that other vegans really like the point okay now it's a blue zone and I suppose they look at the people that lived over 100 in in Okinawa none of them were vegetarians all of them ate meat you know so it's there's not a lot of not a lot of good solid evidence that being a vegan is a solution to a long life well I mean you know that you know obviously there's different propaganda out there and I think you know here's what I'd say you know if you want to do veganism then it makes you healthy fine most people can't do it we know that about right but the thing is we're not just talking about if you want to do it we're talking about people that are proselytizing like they have this idea then they push this idea down everybody's throats but if we're just looking at the actual data the health data like what's good for you once bad for you it's it there's no like overwhelming evidence that the vegan way is the way to go no there's not I mean they're their studies they like to push but there's also studies that show the you know the opposite effect you know if you look at the epic Oxford study which had about 60,000 people in it you know they showed that vegetarians beings live no longer than meat-eaters there's no difference right even though the meat eaters are probably the guys that don't care about their health true so they made not only is it not protective it it may be a negative you can look at a study out of Austria they looked at 240,000 people called a 45 and up study same thing vegans vegetarians no load no lever no longer life no better health so it's kind of like you know who do you believe and these guys have their studies that they're gonna quote and you can share I can cherry-pick all day and other people can cherry-pick all day it's just BS so my best advantage vice is and this is I think the best advice you can give anybody you know until we start seeing dudes walking around that are in shape and jacked in 120 years old you're not going to know what's the right thing to do is and so the best advice you can have is to get strong get healthy you move well do everything you can to make your health good and that's the best you can do because if you're healthy today odds are you're gonna be healthier tomorrow so you know the fact that you know enjoy you're still got a lot of muscle on you have 50 means you're more likely to have someone you're 60 I mean there's this note that's the biggest correlator the best one of the best predictors of long life is your exercise capacity and I think we should bring this up while we're talking about vegan diet versus other diets if you have a standard American diet of even eating a bunch of shitty food and fried chicken and bullshit and cheeseburgers and so it is an you go vegan you will be healthier sure because you're gonna remove all that shitty processed food out of your diet all the nitrites all the stuff that's unnecessary all the preservatives if you do that you will be healthier but it doesn't necessarily mean the vegan diets the way to go I mean it just it means that the American diet that everybody like rightly criticizes is the wrong way to go vegan diets certainly better than that yeah I mean you can do about any diets better than that I'm yeah that's liking a lot of things yeah this is another point I bring on you know because one of the one of the differences between what I sort of think is healthy and I don't I'll come out and say I don't know for sure I'm still learning this stuff but I'm willing to investigate it you know I'm willing to put my body to the test and have other people you know give me data but what I what we one there's a big group out there says you shouldn't eat a lot of protein you should really restrict your protein there's some data that talks about something called an mTOR that you know maybe you know it causes cancer may be inhibiting and then these lesser animals like mice and little tadpoles nematode things and you know right and there's another group of scientists out there was going to do it Phillips out of Canada it's looking at that and it shows that you know the more protein you have especially when you get older the longer you're gonna preserve muscle the better quality life isn't likely longer you're gonna live you know and so what you know what happens if you autopsy an old person you know you get some of you and you go to an old folks home their brain has shrunk I mean their muscles of shrunken away the protein in their bones have shrunken away their kidneys have shrunk their heart is wrong their skin has shrunk everything's shrunk has lost all this protein and what happens is as you get older and older you lose some of the capacity to digest meat and so what happens is where does your body get that protein from it just starts taking it from yourself you start AutoCAD and cannibalizing yourself to sustain function you know it's sustained cellular function so if you're not getting that replaced you know through diet and meat is an outstanding source of that you know you're gonna be frailer and frillier you know we have an obesity epidemic but we also have a frailty epidemic there's people that are just I mean by the time they're 40 I mean they may be obese but their weakness can be yeah there's so many people that just sedentary lifestyles one of the biggest killers of your body for sure and there's so many people that you look at him like I was talking to a guy the other day and it looked like you could just grab his arm and pull it off his body like his his shoulders were sunk in there was like no muscle tone at all and he had no exercise there was none in his life ever like maybe they made him do gym in high school and that was it and he's just younger than me and he was falling apart like a knight you know you and I had 50 are like the bar for a healthy 50 or normal 50 year old is you know way down low and you know we're like total outliers you know this the fact that we exercise and have a little muscle I mean that that puts you in the 99% all right it's interesting if you just continue it the thing about it is like I if I take a week off man boy do I feel it more at 50 than I did it third no it's crazy that's true but I could still get back in shape and once you get back in shape you just got to keep it going and if you just keep it going it will work for you your body it's what we compare it's really interesting because what we compare in terms of normal body function like the normal capacity that your body has we're really generally looking at people that are just the average person well the average person doesn't really exercise it's very hard they don't so we don't have a lot of data on people that are in their 50s it's still go you know what I'm not letting this go I'm gonna keep this fucking body strong I'm gonna make sure I lift heavy weights I'm gonna do hard cardio I'm gonna do sprinting and kickboxing and a bunch of shit that requires explosive energy and if you do that your body can stay vibrant but you have to be diligent it's very important for people to understand this this is not if you're just a casual person who just kind of like half-asses oh maybe we'll take a spin class good luck bitch your body's gonna die it's gonna rot off and fall apart but if you just decide to be militant about this you can keep a functional body far longer and it's not just about ego it's also just about the use of your meat vehicle like my body could do a lot of shit that most people's bodies can't like if I want to pick something up I don't have to call somebody I just pick it up you know and that just that alone you know to know that you can carry yourself to know that you can do 50 chin-ups to know that you can move your body around in a way that most people find to be almost impossible it's like I want my body to work better you know it's like having a race car and you can choose what horsepower engine it is based on how much work you put on it I mean that's essentially what your body is you can choose how much tread you have in your tires you can choose how good the suspension is how supple it is and how well it can maneuver based on how much plyo genic exercises you do or how many different explosive maneuvers you know clean and presses and things along those lines you can get that body to work right yeah I think that you know if you look at animals in the wild right you know if you're looking at a pack of an older getting hunted which one's gonna get killed which one are they gonna pick out there for the frail the slow weak one all right the old ones so if you're a human and we don't get hunted by a Lions but if you're a human if you say you know my when was my peak athletics ism you know maybe 25 maybe 30 you know somewhere in our 33 35 somewhere in there that's like your that's your top performance for most people yeah the closer you can maintain to that ability as long as you possibly can to do whatever it takes to get there the farther you are away from death I mean that's just that's a simple nature you know the slow the weak they get eaten they die they get diseased they become disabled I don't want to be a you know I'm 50 now I don't wanna be a 60 year old guys walking around limping around you know needing assistance somebody that you know lifts my groceries forming this what we have or even a woman I mean women should be out there strength training getting stronger swinging and heavy kettlebells gentleman that's the other thing that you brought up explosiveness because I think we're finally starting a you know that we finally went away from jogging right you know we went from the 1960s to the you know early 2000s everybody's jogging that's what you do for health then people started discovering strength training so now we get people there in there lifting a little bit but I think what you also have to do and this is something because I've got this little training system that you know helping people with but I think you have to do the explosive work - yeah I do you know I get in there in the medicine balls and I think a lot of people are you know I take medicine balls and I try to break the fucking things I mean I throw them as hard as I can you know I'm jumping like I said I'm jumping with a vest on you know the stuff you have to build up two and a half two has to be done in a safe manner you know and I'm springing about an Aerodyne bike have you been on a diet for here no no here's what I would tell you to do okay so company called octane fitness it makes an Aerodyne X it's probably better than that Air Assault bike really yeah pull that up Ock twins are called octane fitness there's Cara dynex 9x what's better about it it's just solid I mean it's always gonna be I mean it's just it's just you just you know in my view you know cuz I've done everything trained I mean I've broken world records on the concept too so I know how to do the intense stuff that Aerodyne those type things the best thing you could do for the short Sprint's I mean there's there yeah they're so metabolically demanding I mean I don't know if they charge I mean I think they're the only thing that I've always had reservations about it's like the sitting-down part as far as what well I don't feel that like you would get more exercise if you're supporting your body weight well I mean you know I don't you know there's a skier you can do stuff like that you know right but but I mean if you if you get on that thing and you go as hard as you fucking can for 30 seconds or a minute in a minute even worse I mean every time I do it for a minute I feel like I'm literally gonna drowned I'm gonna die you know it's just like cuz I you know here's what I do I tell I call these things chain saw intervals so I tell people pretend there's some fucking maniac with a chainsaw I've got it I've got I don't have that at home I've got the regular air down version I keep ranking the damn thing cuz I go too hard you know it's just not strong enough but when I go to the commercial gym there's a guy that they just made that and they show they totally had me doing that head there's another MMA guy that I mean I can't remember any of member's name but he was like a pride champion guy I'm like pride 6 or 7 they wanted and he's at the gym I'm at sometimes in Southern California but but I mean that thing is you're just trying to do do you have a look I'm sure those guys would come up here and let your demo it you know and just get on there and go you know this is the thing I talk about when I talk about high-intensity interval training you know a lot of people they don't get the high end steep part you know they'll do tabata is where they'll go 90% of the first one and by the time the third when they're down like 60% right because the rest intervals are too short so I'm like man go like somebody's gonna kill you for 20 seconds and then rest 3 or 4 minutes and then go again cuz then you keep hitting that high and that's what I do with exercise when it comes to weightlifting I take big breaks now you used to for weightlifting I used to do like I just try to burn myself out go to failure short is like if I get 30 seconds break alright come on next set and exercise I mean I don't do that anymore the problem with that is you're just tired that's not what you're training at the time now there's a time to do the training you know like I said you know what I break it up but I tell people how to train I'm like look you trained it for explosive me that's the only thing you care about you don't get tired cuz you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna waste you're you're not gonna be intense enough the same thing with the sprinting the same thing in the lifting give yourself enough of a break so that you can focus and do what you need to do then when it's conditioning time then you can go get tired right it shouldn't do it with light weights you know I think CrossFit there's a lot of good elements to there I mean there's a lot of people that do well with it but some of the exercises they pick you know like when you get tired doing snatches the odds are you getting fucked up or hot
