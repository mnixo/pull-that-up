and crazy you don't want to be here you want to be in the mountains Montana yeah no you taught in Colorado and he was too many fucking mumbles okay fucking money came in to fake fucking money and bought the hillbillies out the real motherfuckers that you needed in case you've gotta go they're like Woody Creek to find those people like Woody Creek is that still fucking Abbott just really what your fucking booze is up there really you got to go deep deep in the mountains of Gunnison and shit like that Thunder tsin Gunnison Brian you got your volume on we're echoing Gunderson Gunderson where's that that's down south what do you think about all that shit about the Denver Airport do you know anything about the conspiracy behind the Denver Airport is it the Denver Airport first of all they moved way more dirt than needed to and so there's this all this thought that there's some sort of subterranean tunnel tunnel system it's all based on the end of the world shelters they fucked up Stapleton Airport was a brilliant that what it was like Burbank you could smuggle a fucking dead fucking kilo of coke to man nobody said money and all of a sudden they came up with a bright idea let's fucking make an airport 90 miles farther out by Kansas so when it snows we really get fucking buried we have no protection that's a bunch of cowboys bro making decisions and then trust me they're too stupid to even know what conspiracy theory is the people that built it maybe but if the government was really truly behind it like all these people think what it is is that they made an airport there but in constructing the airport they also built some sort of underground safeguard yeah well you know if it's close I mean that would be a move right normals an airport and then build some shelters I mean that Airport is it was easy man when I lived in Denver or in Boulder it was easy to drive there a lot in the drive fuck an hour nothing never any tramps I'd be 25 minutes here's the deal though bro there's no traffic out there don't matter used to be 20 fucking Tunes crack the window a little bit they built this monster to spend money yeah they'd built this monster this monster to to just you know like when I went to fucking Newark to see the fight with you okay we did Newark they built a soccer stadium right in soccer Stadium in Newark let's spend the money left and right but they still can't put a left-hand turn in signal so if you got to make a left twenty nine fucking miles of people well they're trying to keep up their reputation as the carjacked capital of the world and if you got like some left turn signals you get something out people can escape can escape the drama that's the thing about that it's like you know they think that's a there's something really going on inside that Denver Airport there's all these documentaries dedicated to it and one of the reasons for it is because there's these crazy murals that they're painted up in the Denver Airport and they're really disturbing man their apocalyptic like one guy's got a fucking gas mask on with a giant sword and there's like pictures of children and coffins and there's fire in the background have you ever seen that shit yeah but yeah we've actually talked about it on this podcast before we did yeah but do you think that has anything to do with with that I think you putting the tea together I don't think that it does definitely but it's interesting you know I mean I don't have a pinion one way or another I've listened to the people talk about how it's some great escape' base and then 2012 there's gonna be you know fucking asteroids gonna hit that they're tracking it's gonna kill everybody except the people that are in this underground bunker I don't know I watched a TV show on those dudes those dudes that have they've they've bought like fucking condos out in these shelters out in like death valley and shit have you seen those people have space in Death Valley and so they have like a condo inside this underground bunker thing it's out in the middle of fucking nowhere you have to drive and you go out there and they had these shows I forget who was the host of the show but they they took you on a tour of these fucking but I might have been Jesse Ventura no it wasn't him because they had a sense of humor but they whoever it was was like really and they'd taken his fucking tour of these underground bunkers that they have set up where they can survive a fucking nuclear bomb I mean these guys are like a half a mile deep in fucking earth so you survived the bomb now it's you and eight fucking multinationals looking at each other listen just live your fucking life these people that dig into that shit and just live your fucking life we got hit by a bomb the best thing you could do is move on to the fucking next life and pray to God that'll be fucking better you hear that doors music dude fuck you imagine being living your life consumer what happens a bomb drops after 1960 those people that shit wore off in the 60s they all moved into buildings with underground drops with little fucking sandwiches that's how bang was fuckin invented I didn't invent a Tang for so when we go in that fuckin tunnel of doom after the Russians fuck everybody in the ass we come out we got vitamin C from the fucking tang but guess what our fears aren't the Russians anymore it's a lot bigger than that whatever's gonna hit now right now there's a thing going on in Japan well we don't fucking know they're lying to the people just like everything else then lying a 20-mile radius that shit's horrible that shit is horrible radiation is fucking horrible and the best is all these people are raising their hands now we have radiation in Key West don't blame it on

from Miami because it's almost like they're like retarded people fucking I mean and they're always oiled up and this is something about it like you can't relate hard even jerk this thing in Japan is a lot worse than what this thing you think so fuck yeah what makes you say this just just know our society which was fucking Japanese start coming out with six fucking highs and she's looking at what is that better so you can see better but maybe you know maybe that's 2012 that'll be our next mutation there's an adaptation to radiation animals besides roaches that are really good with radiation roaches is supposed to be the best at it right yeah you can live there Eddie but is that is that even is that even just like a wives tale yeah I don't know someone should do us a favor now we know that the Japan is fucked Santa box cockroaches over there with a webcam on it let's see what's up if you love America go over there and do that stupid fucking water all that soil no no what the fuck's going on you know what now besides that we'll all spread out with Libya we're in this fucking plan what the fuck I'm we love Ian razy are you fucking crazy these guys are just sitting there waiting it's like it's like you're just waiting for us to wear out before you fuck us in the home or something we got this like mother fuckers will just light a fire on this Kansas CNN breaking news I get CNN breaking news sent to my phone Paula US intelligence source CIA is operating inside Libya to help us increase military and political understanding what that means though is about to get jack bitch no horseshit quote is that Oh the CIA is there to increase military and political understanding no this is what we want you to do do you understand okay here's the political understanding we got the bombs bitch okay we got fucking robots that we can operate from Nevada okay and you don't even see them because they blend in with the sky and they don't make any noise because they're fucking solar-powered and they can contain hell fire missiles Hellfire that's what I decided to name them not you know the beautiful flower missile or no lick my asshole missile no Hellfire Hellfire missiles and they're shooting them from another fucking part of the world imagine the lag they have they must have to really like plan a shot in advance like it's just like playing quake online when you got lag if you have like a 56k connection and there's some asshole you're playing against it's got a cable modem and you know he gets to move quicker than you because his downtime is ping time between connecting to the server and back is much quicker so you're fucked these guys must have like super lag listen Doug in 1985 we went to see we're in both two and that motherfucker took an arrow out one explosive at the end mm-hmm nobody shot it all of us lost time right nobody liked the black people black people love that rose and explosives I've seen that movie I was 78 years I've never seen black people in my life when Rambo came out of the mud and his eyes opened up and choked the motherfucker black people went bananas like yelling we should have thought of that what is it about black dudes they love it they love anything special like a dude doing some crazy shit like oh that motherfucker got a gun in the shoe check that shit out there's something about a dude pulls his shoe off and guns down the bad guy like oh shit no he didn't what is that what is it just very vocal they're excited shit we got no as bombs and charts we got a bomb that comes out as a car that follows you to the gas station or you're pumping gas it turns into a bomb a guy pops on those shoulders that's the shit we got we got shit that comes to your house just look like a cake happy birthday and when you're gonna block the candles it just fucking blows up we got some shit now you know what I saw that was really crazy they got this Rover there's this remote-controlled drone Rover that's moving around that can jump in the air it gets up to a fence and I think and go like eight or nine feet in the fucking air and it moves up to the fence and then it just goes blank and flies to the end lands the other side it looks like it basically looks like like some sort of a flat box you know where all the electronics is with like two tractor two rubber tractor things on the side of it I guess and the fucking thing flies through the air I mean what what's next you know that's the other thing that people are thinking about a lot of the shit that's going down in Afghanistan a lot of the shit that's going down in the Middle East period is that the CIA has got all kinds of shit going on all kinds and blowing up Inconvenient spots to spark anger and you know you know they've always done that but the bottom line of this what do you think is really going on they figure some Libyan doctor figured out a way how to grow 50 kilos of heroin that Jack that motherfucker Gaddafi's got an army and motherfuckers around this guy with missiles and explosives but the United States is jacking this guy some dude H it's not something to do with fucking why we're over there in the fucking first place the whole nucleus of this thing people are dying in Detroit from heroin yeah it's fucking war and we're still now we're gonna take over Libya boxes of money bro isn't it amazing how many people who think you're crazy when you start talking about the fact they're in Afghanistan for heroin people go what are you talking about they'll look at you like you just fucking just ate a bowl of shit they'll look at you like you all your ridiculous person yeah we're at war for heroin what do you know much money we're talking about they can ignore that you're fucking crazy we want to take over a country so we get you better gyros that's fucking yeah that's the bottom line it's a lot of bottom line there's also loot over there and there's all sorts of loot in Libya - I mean it's it's is it a fucking coincidence that for whatever reason we decide to attack Libya instead of going to Mexico and straighten out that bullshit that's right next door but all Mexico's gods burritos burritos and hookers and donkeys and tequila it's not a lot of shit to offer Mexicans though but listen that's some crazy motherfuckers though man well they got a they got to clean up their problem they got a big problem and it's because the United States it's a big part of it they wanted to make everything legal they wanted it you know they did do you know that here's a little-known fact Mexico is decriminalized everything small amounts when you're not selling it everything's legal now you could get acid in Mexico you can get mushrooms in Mexico they decriminalized everything just because they had a allocate resources to fight these fucking drug lords I mean that's a that's a gone country that country is gone the country doesn't have a government anymore that's right next door right next door right next door right next door so the fucking drug army is it's like going to war with someone who lives in your country it's like if we were fighting al-qaeda but al-qaeda had billions of dollars and was way more armed and they were living here that's what it's like that's what it's like being a fucking Kosciusko and here's the crazy thing Mexico's coming back to get what's des bitch California in Texas you can't take Texas yes can't take even the Mexicans will do go around Texas and Jack Wyoming so Jack Dallas Dallas time I can't shit they'll give them a beat yeah you can't outskirts of Texas they'll come out of their hunting blinds I'll kill you all I don't have a chance he lives there Ted Nugent lives in Waco now yeah you can't fuck okay does he's got a high fence I've always admired what they think he's a retard but I think he does a lot of things that I really agree with and one of the things that I agree with his when he lived in Michigan he had this badass compound we like 2,000 acres or something like that and it was all fenced in and you had all these animals living inside his compound he was just going Jack him and that's where he got all his food from he got all his food from hunting on his own property and I'm like god damn it that's fucking brilliant that's how I want to live I would love to live like that yeah that's one of the reasons why I was into moving to Colorado the reason I was like look if the shit hits the fan we're living in the woods you know there's a lot of animals out here in the spring water that comes in fucking shooting the pig yeah cooking in a fucking cave with your kids okay it's kinky dog we're gonna have a good fucking time Oregon's one of those states that's been on the grid for years but nobody nobody they kept it hush-hush I used to get some good weed Morrigan 15 fucking years ago yeah Pass Ashland Eugene Bend Oregon's a hippie fluffy foundation over there in bed Portland is a pretty hippie place too is already hippie I slept there girls have dirty feet putting hot socks on socks on don't breathe in my mouth Portland was the the place that I went to last year and we were at trying to find the most attractive person in a Costco for like a half hour meaning the girl is with a mold you fuck yeah and we couldn't find anyone go to a Costco in Burbank and you're with a bunch of cripples there too I know but it's a packed Costco I wondered strings you need to go to better places so there's a smaller amount smaller amount of people you'd want a fuck that's okay dude gotta live somewhere with this place falls apart - there's too many humans here too many people we keep on staying there but we won't do anything about it I did I fucking move man the only reason why I came back cuz mrs. Rogan got pregnant and because the dog got eaten by a mountain I'm already talking to real estate agents to top all that nonsense the move is you go and you get a summer place and you try it out and you live there for summer and anybody comes like you'd be super nice while you're there so it becomes all nostalgic round sigh just every time where they'll just bring home flowers and shit and then we come back to LA and then it's all jiu-jitsu and loud music and too much pot smoke so he's negative yeah daddy's crazy in LA daddy just wants to fight in smoke pot and he's walking around naked no in Colorado daddy wants to go get ice cream and daddy's bringing flowers home see you just train them Rose is the father you got blowin farts on her I love you DEFCON here's the problem Joe Roland's got Joe Rogan's got a great wife and Joe Rogan I went to his home last week and that was one of the first times that mrs. Rogan was home in a couple tops and I'd been up there like four times mrs. Rogan likes to rock the house where you put it before motherfucker witness relocation plan she had a drive 90 miles before she even seen a Denny's gone it was another 20 miles she was from all weapon Baldr the first mall that she cares about his cherry fucking Creek you know I'm saying so you had a 2/4 is that Denver yeah you gotta keep it closer to the wall you had a 90 fucking miles book and I love the most what I love the most living up there was that there was a small amount of people man all of their boulders only got a hundred thousand-plus people not that much man and people are friendlier like that there's a more relaxed vibe and I think that shit is healthy I think there's something exciting about living in a big city especially if you're you know you're involved in the hustle and bustle and you're really trying to make something happen and if you got divorce you probably get married again after a week are you ready to shut that party up you gotta figure out a way to get a fucking car from to the mall don't worry about that he's got to move a little closer that was truly a little close and you just need to move to Texas Texas is this is the answer to I like Austin I'm a big fan of that Austin Texas I'll tell you that I live there if I was gonna live but more lane no weed is not legal there the thing about Colorado is just like California you could just go rock weed everywhere not yet yeah the shit hits the fan anything can happen you know one that shit hits the fan everybody gets scared then you start making you know survival choices anyway you can live in Kansas you know you'd rather be healthy in Kansas you know but um the weed stores in Colorado or just like out here bro it's just out there everywhere there's one place in Denver where there's a fucking seven of them on a street yeah Bink Bink Bink be there everyone's easier to get a license Otis name same deal I get headaches bang prescriptions so I was like I don't know yeah there's a place that I used to go to in the mountains it was like a gift shop and they were doing they were struggling they were doing terrible and you know the fucking they were about to lose their business and then they started selling weed in the back of the gift shop legal they got a legal license boom now they're ball and now they're there about so they're one place they open up in Boulder is supposedly I don't know if it's open yet but they were talking about is gonna be 30,000 square feet it was gonna be three floors I don't know if they went through with it I need to find out if they did yeah because that's just the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard that's a goddamn shopping in the Walmart yeah a Walmart of weed yeah but they had great spots there man they had great spots we can get weed smoking Matt since 2006 and you've gotta figure that every year it gets a little slow it's there a week they pay this bro I forgot to bring a but it looks like one of the Martians from Independence Day it's like a hybrid beautiful what if I tell you how do I join that right barri give it to you no no I wouldn't got it no you do yeah I did go get that shit son do you really have some what's it called bring it back and spark it kid oh that shit is fucking strong yeah sounds good dogs like Oregon's gonna be fun last we have our time with the Eugene Oregon with Jody Ferdie and we have a Saturday night that for a one night if a Tribble but it was the same night that there was a convention for like the American Association of retarded children I don't want to say it wrong but it was like the children that right shoulder fixed right and they had a lot of little guitar the kids running around so when I go to check in I'm high as a motherfucker there's all these different balloons and I'm just freaking cuz oregan got some beep we got some at the gas station Brian you're gonna love this shit so I got a lighter we check in to the hotel in Eugene and Joe this is not 10 or 15 of them this is 600 children you know Special Olympics 200 retarded ones and their parents well so I go to my room you know we small we do the show the show isn't a hotel but on a different part they're having a little dance you had to see this they're all holding hands with little balloons and the disco and it was very cute to see but if a lot with the stories a lot of people don't know is retarded you guys boys are the strongest motherfuckers in the world they're most perverted really oh I've heard that a boy they go fucking nuts if you see them if you show him your pussy don't listen to me we're in the fucking comedy club and often they switch it at 10 o'clock they switch they turn into a disco and Jody's got a couple cocktails and she started dancing she got big titties at the time and this is a little retarded boy who breaks away from the fucking pile and goes into the dance and he starts to look at Jody and you could see Joe Rogan and he's losing his fucking oh no and finally he goes I wanna dance what starts dancing with he started to answer with and he starts crying it when the Jody thinks it's cute and awesome they come in they're like there he is there's little David and they come to grab him and David fucking snaps like one of those fucking gorillas in the zoo right now they had three black doormen that would try to tackle a little Timmy little timmy was drawing them around like last look throwing around fucking John Fitch just pick the whole offensive line of the Giants couldn't help his little retard down three fucking black gorillas and he's just pushed my on DVD on TPP I'm not he's seen those titties he went fucking eight shit he's pushing them to countless game they had to throw him on the fucking floor put his hand he seen them titties he was fucking ape shit dawg whoa those little parts go fucking bananas when you show him this little white tars and it was just titty can you imagine so it was the monkey who want a job bro he sees it visit University of Eugene he's a big black football players they couldn't control his little twelve-year-old he was banging him throwing him around like he was only 12 12 or 13 just throwing these fucking black guys around shoot this little fucking poor kids seen titties and he went fucking bananas bananas that's crazy wonder if they're just doing what everybody wants to do but just doesn't have the ball they had they don't have the walls that that's a breakdown yeah yeah what if that's what people like instinctively want to do I think like yeah retards can't be like extra more horny right no they probably not extra horny if I put that fan on like Joe Rogan's house with the electricity even saying Oh bro this kid went fucking bananas he ripped that's Jerry you can't even beat them up what do you do you can't drop a bomb on a funny thing was that they built like a wall at first make a little mouth first they asked me to leave when he was like they built like some black guys got shoulder shoulder right and he was grabbing their shoulders whoa I mean it was fucking scary they don't know they look bad you know that's one of the weird things about people that are retarded or down syndrome or whatever they don't seem to know you know they just kind of are they just behaved they don't they're like good one mofo gets to be you know they're not like that that is themselves what I mean it's like that must be a strange strange existence where you know that's part of being dumb is that you're too dumb to realize you're dumb you know if you I'm not saying dumb like there's like they're lazy like they have an issue there's a mental issues a mental imbalance whatever but I mean it's there they're impaired but they're so impaired they don't know they're impaired they've lost the ability to see that they're impaired you know what's a strange thing what if they all have an inner voice that that's completely normal like but they can't take a to be like you know you right I mean so the whole time there's this like I can't believe how much they treat me so horrible and I wish I know but they can't when they try to say it it's like well there's probably there's probably a lot of that yeah I think there's a bunch of different types of you know being fucked up you know for sure there's that too you know it's not it's not just simple as yeah there's some of there's varying degrees yeah there's varying degrees along the way that are you know it means fucking crazy thing man to have your mind impaired you know and like look our minds are impaired in comparison I was watching this fucking 12 year old kid his autistic kid with 170 IQ doing his take on the theory of relativity and he's writing out equations on this fucking window and I'm watching this kid I'm like this kid might as well be a fucking alien all right I don't know what he's doing I have no idea he's explaining this like this is all simple simple shit well this is so far beyond my capacity to him to this artistic kid I'm retarded okay I am this guy who he has to humor because I can't understand a fucking word a letter a single part of his equation I don't know what's going on up there it's chaos to me but to him it's so clear it's a language it's like well quite simply you have to move this and this becomes x equals y equals 2 we are the retards to that kid hmm you know maybe like that maybe like you know people with Down syndrome they feel bad with people don't have Down syndrome maybe it's just like us we feel bad with people have autism right my gosh poor kids got autism man he can't engage in all the normal emotional things that we do meanwhile this motherfuckers you know count counting to a billion in his head while while he's talking to you about how a television is conduct constructed you know maybe we're retards to them maybe you know they look at us and I go this poor Fox they can't even do math in their head they don't they can't see through walls they can't read people's minds you know well but some people just I had a kid in the 8th grade name is Michael alig Retta Sicilian kid he had been fresh off the boat fucking sixth-grade by the eighth grade this motherfucker spoke three languages well that's the silliest shit he picked up Spanish then he picked up English and I just sit and look at him off do you know I'm saying like he was such a cool motherfucker that I just wanted to hang was so he was a married we used to play when you we used to play hockey we hit him in the change with the with the hockey stick and he was never great to the back with my dog Michael a Belarus and he but this kid knew nothing only came off a boat January in the sixth grade by the eighth grade he knew three fucking language he would talk to me in Spanish talk to you with English like nothing and get A's you know some people work ethic to it's a some people just they have this insane work ethic and people that get a chance to come to America it's so much different than being born in America we don't have any fucking idea you live you know you're living in fucking Guatemala or some shit you know you're your opportunities are fucking few and far between you know you living in some place that's impoverished you're kind of fucked man but when you're in America dude holy shit so these guys you know their family gets them together look we're gonna move to America wouldn't have a better life and you realize you're leaving everything behind you're putting all your fucking ship in cargo planes and you're all sitting together crammed in coach and you know eating fruit out of your mom's purse and you know just hoping that when you get there things are gonna be better and you don't know anybody there and how scary is this so when those motherfuckers get to school they come out guns blazing you know they appreciate the fact that holy shit I used to live in Italy now Here I am in the land of the free the home of the brave you know I'm in America and I'm in school and I'm learning English and I'm just gonna go fucking crazy over here they're just so unhappy and you're open that's the one half of it because I didn't leave Cuba crying I woke up on 89th Street Riverside Drive right I had all the fucking things that a rich kid would have right and here I was walking around this fucking City but I didn't know English and all you want to do in your heart is just fit in and you have no idea this is not trying to fit in when you're in grammar school you should get a tattoo a long hair oh you wanna know for them not to know that you came from somewhere else that I can't describe it to you I can't even fucking start to tell you like sometimes I have this anger at me and it's because I think we were I was so lucky we were so lucky I need three of us could have been born one of those black kids and fucking Haiti with flies on you yeah any three of us and we have so many fucking opportunities and sometimes I wake up in the morning this really hits me sometimes I go oh fucking lucky in mind that my mother came here and Here I am sitting here smoking somebody you ever say like think about that's what an immigrant was like you know I'm telling him for a long time I've been writing this thing and that's how it starts with did you know I don't remember anything I don't remember the plane ride from Cuba I remember nothing all I remember is crossing the fucking Street on 89th and Broadway up to ps1 see 666 and thinking to myself finally I'm gonna be a fucking American what does that mean looking at that flag you really believe in something dawg it's not just a piece of fucking rag looking at that flag and going what the fuck like looking at the wind blowing that flag and going what the fuck that flag is the answer to all my fucking problems that's the answer right there but I even at that age I knew my mother was fucking crazy so I knew I wasn't a full fledged American but when you look at that flag and you just come here they have a scene in the beginning of Scarface when they're on the boat and they finally see land and they show the American flag and the director whoever the guy is brilliant enough to show he showed it from a different angle what that flag looks like it's not just we overlooked that flag every fucking day we overlooked that flag you don't know what it is to look at that flag when you first come here and to know that that's your fucking that's your a magic carpet it's the highest ideal in the world it's the highest ideal that's why it's so infuriating when politicians are fucking corrupt that's why it's so you know people say you know why do you criticize what America does overseas don't you love America yeah if you love it you want to tell the fucking truth about what it's doing you know if you love it you're supposed to stand up and go what the fuck is going on it's like you don't love it by letting it get away with stupid shit because there's some corrupt kant's at the wheel that's not doesn't mean you don't love the idea of America I fucking love the idea of America for sure we only see the one side of that flag we never see both sides together gentlemen and that's the point we never we only see that one side of the flag right now you've discussed that the CIA is setting up things in Libya what are they setting up they're starting a war they're starting business yeah they're getting things going that's the other side of that flag that we're never able to see well yeah put a mirror on the other side of the flag you know I'm saying that's the one side of the flag that we have since we except this side of the flag we got to accept that so yeah the only way that side this side is possible where it's easy to drive around is if they're doing all this creepy shit you got to bring unless we bring the whole world together in on everything and that's just not gonna happen we've done crazy fucking shit they're gonna do creepy shit can't trust them you know we can't trust people to be cool you know they look the natural instinct if someone can get into a position of power is to be Qaddafi that's the natural instinct the natural instinct is to get Botox when you're 80 they have this big stupid looking rubber face where goofy clothes and just be running shit even though you're this old cunt you know living in some fucking castle with billions of dollars he doing that job we put for money that flag is money Joe Rogan that's a lot of people never had comprehend but that's the reality of it stand-up is a beautiful thing to do yeah some guys are brilliant between the crack the other side is stand-up it's a business yeah it really is a fucking business guys and it's like anything else the other side of that flag is the business guys in the same way we want social security one with 65 a country has to sell a couple kilos every once in a while to replenish those fucking funds you don't saying right and that's aside the American public don't want to know that's the side that included Kennedy that's aside the Alex Jones talks about whether it's true or not that society not supposed to see we're supposed to be focused on the other side on what that machine is supposed to mean to us and for guys like you and I like looking behind the curtain but I don't I don't because I grew up in a corrupt hometown I've seen what politics is out of minut level I can't even dream of what it is in a national fucking level when I'm taking political contributions but I'm gonna pass your fucking bill so you could pass that law that'll make people's hands grow back but they also gonna give them cancer in the eyeballs that's part of it it grows it when I grew up in it when it was in the micro process ice now it's in the national level of corruption is in a macro process and it's punch with little things and townships where if there's a macro smaller than mine yeah micro macro but you understand like I know exactly what you're saying yes it's very interesting corruption if not checked grows it all just keeps getting bigger it's not like they go hey we got to cut the shit I know we've been making millions of dollars on the sneak tip but everybody's gonna stop right now and I'm not kidding I think is why are you still making money these Wikileak things are pretty cool for the country I think that's why these assholes want to put that guy in jail they want to say it compromises American secure no it does and he did exactly what the New York Times was supposed to do if they got that information they should have done that on Twitter though imagine if there was just like this Twitter address that everyone followed that every week later by the way JFK here's pictures of JFK so in cocaine well dude WikiLeaks has a Twitter and they really they they released some an article about how different parts of the American economy are influenced by genetically modified foods and how we are trying to force them on other countries and then we're like fuckin with other countries if they don't go into the genetically modified food if they don't start growing like Monsanto corn shit like that you know those that does these giant companies are way to embed it into the political system they're not doing stuff for the greater good of people they're doing stuff for the profitability of giant corporations that moved them into position in the first place the whole thing has been corrupted like to sit down and pretend that that that it's real is insulting it's like it's like a stupid argument it's like people who argue about Pro Wrestling you know it's like what are you arguing about this is a fake nonsense process if you can't notice that from Obama Obama's gonna pull all the truth out of Ikea oh he's not Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize and then he sent 30,000 more fucking troops to Afghanistan I mean come on man thank you look at all the shit that he's done to allow these cunts to get away with steel and all that fucking money and that bailout I watched that inside job movie dude that shit is disgusting it's disgusting how deep the corruption is the financial the whole financial sector it's scary dude they have the people that regulators eventually get jobs with the banks like how the fuck you're telling me you work as a guy who's working for the SEC and you're looking into banks and corruption and shit like that and then when you quit you get a job with the bank how the fuck are you not in jail how the fuck are you not in jail you were the one responsible for looking over these motherfuckers while they were doing all sorts of crazy shit betting on things failing and betting three times more than that a business is worth and speculums and and and betting again fucking forcing clients to buy shit they knew wasn't good like they did a lot of crazy creepy shit and got away with it I mean we would've got popped is that Bernie Madoff those motherfuckers should all be in jail there should be a mass jailing and they're not they're not jailing anybody then it's bullshit then it's all bullshit it's all bullshit they're not you you've gotta like hold them them the most accountable you can and it's barely at all people's dreams people's dreams when you steal people's dreams that's the worst thing in the fucking world you're 63 years old or so somebody says you put away that happens those guys a lot too it's happened to a lot of fucking people people at six they just watch them but a month ago people 71 getting part-time fucking jobs now the 69 fuckin movie showed I believe it was Iceland how they went in and jacked the Icelandic economy in like a couple of years these banks went in and just fuckin just created bubbles and started making crazy money and spending in access and then it all failed and people are fucked they had like the most stable the most normalized economy like it was a beautiful economy everything was running smooth people were hard workers people got shit done they lived a life of you know relative prosperity now they're fucked everybody lost everything everyone's fucked everyone's pissed you think that the states I think it he has no he has what does this bailout what is this how do you how do these people get money when when their banks failed they will they have bonuses in their contract bonuses how the fuck do you get a bonus when the bank fails like the idea that you have to respect them and that they can't lose that's just there it's so crappie the sizes millions millions of dollars and this is from banks where we would check to pay them we gave them money and they're giving out money either way if your back fucking fail you can't get a bonus you can't get a bonus I'm smelly as a bank fucking failed do you take no personal responsibility like who takes responsibility somebody and it you shouldn't it be the guy that stands to make a bonus if the bank does well that should be the guy takes personal responsibility so when the bank fucking fails you don't get your bonus cuntface that's it it's that simple why why the fuck can't the president say that is like we're gonna you know load limit it to half a million dollars half a million fucking dollars for a bonus when your bank fails well you want these motherfuckers are so not living in reality and most people's reality these cunts cost so many fucking people their life savings and they have to get their bonuses and the presidents like welp we have to give it to them you have to give it to him you can't just step in go cut the shit are you fucking crazy no you can't get 30 million dollars after your fucking bank fails no in the middle of a crazy down economy where billions of dollars from taxpayers money's been funneled to the fucking banks to keep them afloat no
