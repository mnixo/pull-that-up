- sup fella how are you good to see you again man likewise I've been reading that you are having some great success with your machine finally it's everything's up and running last time we talked you had yet to implement it actually out in the wild and now you explain to us what happened you had some bumps in the beginning right yes yeah so it's been quite a quite a few years finally something's happening so we we launched her first ocean system from San Francisco in September of last year and we we took it out and roughly two months later we figured that first of all it wasn't catching plastic so what we saw was that the system was moving at roughly the same speed as the plastic so maybe you just take one step back the idea and how it works so so of course with this Great Pacific Garbage Patch between here and Hawaii twice the size of Texas one hundred million kilos of plastic doesn't go away by itself and the idea was to to have this artificial coastline that is driven by the forces of the ocean we put it in there and the plastic naturally accumulates against it and kind of stays in there so we can then periodically get it out because the the big challenge is that although there's a lot of plastic it's it's spread out over this vast area so we first have to concentrate it before we can take it out because if you were to simply troll the ocean for plastic with boats and nets it would just take forever really so so the idea was to - to have those artificial coastlines we deployed the first one and then what we saw was that somehow the system was moving at the same speed as the plastic so you can imagine if you know this is like your pac-man and this is your your you know your your catch and is moving at the same speed it's not going in and sometimes it did go in but it went out again we got a video of it what it was other that's great yeah so so this is the basic idea but it wasn't doing that so so and then you know we thought okay that's that's all right well learn from it we'll try and adjust the systems and then literally exactly a year ago the system broke into two and so at the structural failure forcing us to tell the whole thing back to land and go back to the drawing board so so we didn't have the the best start of this year how much time has been lost or how much time has been spent I should say in the beginning phase the initial yeah version that you launched I was worried about now so we've been going on at this for since 2013 also softer yes a busy after five years launching it and seeing it break into two that was wasn't the the best start of the year could could have imagined but then you know went to the drawing board and the team really took it well they and we took those lessons into account adjusted to design and relaunch really just a few months later so in June and this time we made the system a little bit a bit more modular so we could try different things to try and adjust the speed make you go faster make it go slower and then what we figured was well the system isn't going fast enough what if we actually turn the problem into a solution what if we turn it around and actually slow it down so that it goes slower than the plastic and then what we figured that that actually works and in October we announced that we're actually catching plastic and really just last week the first two shipping containers flula plastic were or landed important Wow so it's really recently up and running yeah you expected now how long does it take to accumulate two shipping containers full so that was roughly month month and a half and how big of these shipping containers 20-foot so 42 of these rooms so the only thing that's really stopping it from getting more is like the actual size of the net itself yes so so that's the next step so now that we went from 0 to 1 we have the basic principle of catching plastic confirmed we now have to make it bigger before we can build a whole fleet of them because you know we've we reckon we need maybe 50 or 100 of them to really clean up half this patch of 5 years that's that's the objective half the whole patch in five years that's the real objective that's how is that really possible if you have enough systems yeah that's incredible now where you at in terms of like trying to get systems made and implemented so so the so now we just finished this this first step with the system number one that's how we called it and the next step is to develop what we call system 2 which is indeed going to be a bigger version and it deers to minimize the amount of vessel use that you need for it so that comes because boats are really fucking expensive yeah the boat that we have costs roughly 15,000 euros per day to keep running well it's just one boat so boat you don't want boats to you know would you anticipate that it ever gets to a point where the amount of money that you can generate from the actual resource of physical plastic can actually pay for the expert the whole experiment I mean hope so that's what we want to trial next year with by making products from the catch that we that we make and the material itself hardly has any value it's it's really the story to it and she makes draws don't feel guilty yeah it's a recycled straw yeah now without yeah that's a terrible idea but what would it be a very sustainable business model just yeah just keeps going yeah what is the what are the products that you're thinking about ah everything with a few ideas we it's still kind of under development so I think in September we should be ready to launch the first one but I think it's going to be things that that are durable that don't end up in ways that you actually that will retain their value so can last for a very very long time and that check she wants and ideally carry around so you can talk about with other people and actually now's a just last week we with that first plastic oh sure we said okay now we welcome our supporters to actually make well Xuan called a reservation but kind of make a make a down payment so that you can be first in line so if people go to our website they can actually put in the 50 bucks and get the right for the first ever products made from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch so you're just trying to figure out what products will have the most sustainability what products people keep for the yeah and think that people want dry you don't want some kind of gimmick that's just going to be this paperweight flip-flop seemed like an easy one right yeah don't they I mean people love to buy flip flops if they had bought flip flops especially people that are like sort of like outdoorsy type folks sure appreciate the beach and maybe have to write these things down flip flops that's pretty easy one any other ideas um what else Jamie what else would be a good one belts people like belts shoes any flip-flop shoes like definitely some Yeezys some dope Rhys I get ya some recycled sneakers like what is foam like the foam that they make running shoes out of that's a very specific type of yeah it's not actual plastic right something else it's a type of plastic yeah we might be able to to foam this mature as well I think we've done tests with that oh really turn it into foam yes oh there's some sort of a process yeah yeah I mean you could make athletic shoes that'd be easy right people but they would you'd have to have a way to make to like incentivize people to recycle them it would be so ironic for those fucking things wound up back in the ocean you know there's got to be a way to do that just tell you know like have like if you have your own company like drop-off points in cities where when they're done with their stuff if it's broken down or it's old they've used it you could throw it into this bin and what you will ensure that it gets converted back into raw materials and utilized again right yeah sir can I come in yeah that'd be a great move if you can people would do that if they if you made it easy for them you know it sort of like recycling bins they make it easy for them they'll throw their bottle in there sure no so you have these two cargo ships or these two cargo containers filled with this plastic stuff what do you do with it now yeah so that's going to Europe before true there isn't really any useful recycling infrastructure in the US so so we set up this this infrastructure in Europe to be able to first sort it and then shred it and then recycle it and then make those first products out of them so hopefully and hopefully with that then generate the - needed to to continue running the cleanup but of course now it's still small-scale right eventually we should have those number of shipping containers every you know every day Rolly so do you have a your group of people that's trying to come up with ideas of what to make out of the plastic yeah it's a little team in inside they were to clean up working on that and yeah so they I think they say that by September they should be ready to to launch the first product that's it that's great man that's the whole idea behind it's beautiful don't you have a river system too as well right yes so so that's the other thing right so on one hand we need to we need to clean up what's what's running in the ocean doesn't go away by itself and yeah basically the only way to deal with that is to just go out there and clean it up but of course then there's this this other side of the equation which is there's still huge huge amounts of plastic flowing into the ocean every day mostly from countries in Central America South Southeast Asia where people are kind of this the stage of development or countries are at a stage of development where where the people are wealthy enough to consume a lot of things that are wrapped in plastic yet there isn't any waste infrastructure yet to take care of it so you literally see people on on scooters just drive on the to bridge to dump their municipal waste into the river because that's simply the easiest way to get rid of it to your point you know what's easiest people will do and so it's not really let people you know don't care there or that they are less civilize is something but it's really the combination there's a lot of people and there is no infrastructure that they can make use of so so then back in 2015 we were like okay maybe at some point in time this this Ocean thing will work out who knows but then we're stuck with this problem that there's still so much plastic flowing in that we would just have to keep going forever and that would just be no not very motivating and we want to be this project with the beginning and an end so so we're like okay so where's the plastic coming from and we figured you know probably rivers rivers are like these these arteries that carry the trash from from land to sea because when it rains plastic washes from Street to creeks to river to ocean and but then we found out that there is a hundred thousand rivers in the world so that's kind of a big amount if you want to do something about it so so we started doing measurements in rivers and then what we found was that just one percent of rivers are responsible for 80% of the of the pollution so really just a very tiny amount of rivers if you were to tackle those could really address them the majority of of the plastic going into the ocean and it's it's mostly like these relatively small rivers in in capital cities like Manila like Jakarta like Kuala Lumpur we have very high density of people near the coasts that's where most of the leakage most of the emissions occurs so so since 2015 we've been kind of as a secret side project been working on seeing what can work she develops something to to intercept the plastic in those rivers and we just launched it a month ago we call it the Interceptor and it's this yeah it is a scalable system that that's almost like plug in place so you bring it to a river and you install it and it it just works it's fully autonomous solar-powered so this is all real the real plastic that's being pulled out of this river yeah that's it from your machine yeah so this is credible this was the prototype that's amazing this was in Jakarta for people that are just listening we're looking at this thing pull enormous amounts of plastic out of this river and it's also doing so in in there they're stacking it into these bags it's a large physical quantity of stuff oh yeah and then maybe you can actually put up the video interceptor too and in Malaysia so we already have two of them in in real life as we speak how does it avoid doing anything with fish how do you avoid accidentally oh my god is that real yes this is this is the clang River in Kuala Lumpur and it's according to our model it's like the fifth most polluting river in the world so 1% of all plastic going into the world's oceans is coming from that one river and this is unbelievable how polluted this is this is crazy ten million kilos per year roughly so just just looking at it looks like a wasteland that's so sad yeah so so then we so we now at four interceptors two of them have already been deployed so here's the one going to to the to this Klang river and kind of wanted to make it look like a like a spaceship just so people would like it and so it has this barrier that that concentrates the plastic to the mouth of the interceptor where you have a conveyor belt but then scoops it out of the water again fully solar and battery powered and then deposits it on to this moving shadow conveyor which then distributes it across these big dumpsters can hold roughly 50 cubic meters of trash and yeah it just works by itself so it's that's what it does how much this that's an insane amount of garbage that you're pulling out of there you when you look at it visit visually folks you can watch the video what is the name of this video Jamie some people you define rivers interceptor 0:02 cleaning in Malaysia is the title of the YouTube video it's crazy now and you're not catching any fish in this oh yeah so so because this this barrier is non-permeable the current just flows underneath it's basically that the sea life can just pass it make sure at one point we had this giant lizard which was probably 2 meters we should bring post that photo it was she kind of climbing onto the barrier and then it just swam around it so 2 meters really yeah everyone a half thick it was what kind of lizard is that I don't don't know the name but it was some kind of monitor or something monitored that yeah you're right yeah yeah do you know where's that you see if an image of that no do you post it next week oh you haven't posted no okay he was looking for it yeah I thought you were saying it was out there so it's safe for fish what about the stuff that doesn't float on the very surface right so this isn't goes down one meter what we measured is that really almost all the plastic isn't that top layer so sure you know won't be a hundred percent efficient but I think it's it's really about having this pragmatic thing that catches most of it and it most importantly leaves wildlife alone because everything else can just swim underneath that exactly yeah that's that's great and so this plan that you had when you know it's been six years running how much of your daily time is devoted to this oh I don't think there's much much free time at all it's so special past year I've not had a single free day so not a single yeah just 9:00 a.m. - usually you know 9:00 p.m. in the office just it's been busy but I think it was it was worth it now looking where we were at beginning of the year to where we're now well now that you've actually pulled these cargo containers filled with plastic out of the ocean that must give you an extreme feeling of satisfaction right you've you've actually made it work like it's moving now so I was I was kind of hoping for that feeling but then when you get to that point you're like okay but they're still you can really only see the amount of work that's still ahead of you so so it's actually really hard to have enjoy successes in a way I should probably get better at that it's hard well particularly what you're doing you have a monumental task in front of you and what you're doing is rightly being applauded by so many people but I don't know how many people are actually helping you you you have a crazy thing that you're doing you're trying to pull the plastic out of the ocean when people find out about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch they they get panicky they're like what how long has this been going on how do i how do I not know about this because so few people I mean I would think like maybe 40% of the population understands there's a gigantic patch of garbage in the middle of the ocean and it was discovered 20 years ago exactly 20 years ago and still it's there just been growing Oh 1998 no one had a goddamn clue nope and then they went we hate what what's going on here yeah is all this garbage and it keeps getting bigger and bigger right yeah it's actually quite a good story this is the Sailor called Charles Moore it was participating in a sail race between Hawaii and California and while others would go further north you thought well let's try and cut off this this piece and then he was looking at the water and he just just saw that all that trash and then he went back he was shocked about it and then he decided to take some measurements publish the results and that kind of popularized that whole concept of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch mmm it's a weird thing to see when you see drones flying over it and you see the footage of it and and it's also it's it's a lot a lot of it is a lot smaller than people think of it right because it's broken down by the ocean right yeah so that's that's what happens over time is that this these larger objects how it enters the ocean due to the working of the ways as well as the Sun breaks down to these smaller and smaller pieces which is actually not really a good thing because these smaller pieces are then easier to ingest for for fish and other wildlife so so the smaller gets in a way that the more harmful it gets as well and fortunate what we see is that still 92% of the plastic is still non micro plastic so big stuff but of course if we don't clean it up over the next few decades all of that big stuff will also become micro plastics and then in a much worse day is the cleanup of micros micro plastics possible or is it just something that needs to be sort of rethought out well so that was actually one of the positive surprises that we that we had this year is that the clean of system in the patch wasn't just catching plastic and not just the big stuff it was also catching most of the micro plastics so down to 100 meters clogged up with all the other stuff is that what it is we're not exactly sure how it was able to do that but we just saw huge amounts of those those micro plastics and in this it's probably has to do something with the radiation of the way so you have that big pipe that keeps the system together and because waves are kind of crashing against it it reflects waves as well and almost like a lens it was concentrating those micro plastics into one patch in the middle of the system which I was kind of just holding up into into the system so it was so that's that was really we weren't expecting to collect micro plastics but there we were that's pretty cool so now where you at in terms of trying to expand it to a point where you could you know really get this goal of half of the plastic or the ocean in five years yeah so so it would probably be easier if we had one goal but we now set two goals for ourselves one is the 50% of five-year for the for the patch but the other one is that we want to have interceptors into the 1,000 most polluting rivers the ones that do the 80 percent in in the next five years so will be will be pretty busy really really busy yes so if you're not busy enough yeah how many people are working for your in your organization now about a hundred and I think really team is being as now better than it's ever been so fortunately there's there's definitely love help but we're still recruiting not quite I think not not our twenty thirty people coming up here so so definitely there is a lot of work to do and what is this ride been like for you from being this like really young guy when you figure this out like how old were you when you came up with the idea first ideas when it was 16 but really founded the organization when it was 18 yeah so that's really young eighteen to where you are now just being constantly involved in this process what does I've been like for you educational I would say so really when I started and I'm gonna look back at when I started I really didn't have a bloody clue what I was doing and I suppose that was a good thing because if I would have known how complicated and big it would have to become in order to actually take some plastic out of the ocean I probably wouldn't have started it was just too big and remember doing the giving my first presentation back in 2012 and somebody approached me and he said okay great idea it's going to cost like tens of millions of dollars you're going to need a team of maybe a hundred people to to to get this to a point that it could actually work and I thought this guy was crazy no way you can so that's why it has started a two million dollar crowdfunding campaign to to get it started and yeah he was closer to the truth than I could have ever imagined when you when you think about the amount of time that you're investing in this deed how do you see yourself ever getting off this ride does this what you want to do for the rest of your life no so I I do I simply want to solve problems and I think this is kind of a good starter problem it's I think it's very feasible to actually solve it it's by the way hilarious that you're talking about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch as a starter problem Oh what kind of ambition do you have that's one of the most perplexing problems with the garbage and waste today yeah but I do think it's it's solvable and it's I think it is - according to you and though you're saying but to call it a starter problem Salieri's yeah yeah and I mean I think this was a exciting thing for me is that it's I can pick this promise that's the first one because I believed it would not just be solvable it's solvable by a relatively small group of passionate people and yeah so of course what I hope is that with the OSHA clean we can kind of create this blueprint of how you solve a problem and how you how you make civilization a bit more sustainable so that hopefully with the blueprint we can not only solve more other problems in the future but also inspire others to to do the same thing well that's a beautiful sentiment and do you have any other things that you want to try to solve once you sort of stepped away from this mm-hmm yeah so I really I just definitely not going to be a shortage of ideas so I keep this little booklet so that's kind of overflowing but what I realize is to to be successful with the cleanup I really need razor-sharp focus and I can only do one thing at the same time and like IDs are like viruses and when they enter your mind it kind of expands and evolves and it's really quite dangerous actually to have new ideas it was I forget who said that but somebody recently I heard saying the best thing you can do is having one great idea than never having any other ideas and the rest of your life so just because you know to be your resources right yeah to achieve something you need full focus I think was Stewart Brand but two good things it's it's accurate what do you think though about what I was going to get at was do you ever conceive of a possibility of coming up with something that removes carbon from the atmosphere that's a giant issue with us right right carbon emissions so definitely I believe negative emissions I think you refer to them will be required to make the goals to kind of keep the warming in check it's however it's a much more difficult problem because if you think of the ocean it's it's busy a two dimensional problem it's a plastic on the surface and fortunately it's not even the whole ocean it's it's kind of concentrating in these accumulation zone so the Garbage Patch although it's twice the size of Texas it's still one point six million square kilometers while the ocean is like three hundred million square kilometres so it's really just maybe less than a percent of the ocean which needs to be cleaned and it's a again it's a two-dimensional problem well the atmosphere is three-dimensional so it's just this is one dimensional increase is just yeah it's just a huge challenge so I do think it needs to be tech oh and it's definitely exciting problem to think about I do think that's definitely that's not a good starter problem to to work huh no um wasn't there something Jamie that we had talked about where they had figured out a way to make these building sized essentially vacuum cleaners they were gonna put in the center of certain cities I believe it was in Asia maybe perhaps China they'd come up with this and the I don't know if they implemented it yet but the idea was to have these enormous things that place that look like a skyscraper and really it was just a huge vacuum cleaner for carbon sure I know they're of a few companies that working with they've carbon engineering is one there is also there's also one out of Switzerland forgot the name but so so definitely good smart people are working on that problem I'm not sure where they are in terms of the economics and sit right here when you mentioned his carbon engineering is this one okay so that looks like giant fans like a huge building filled with fans we believe humanity can solve climate change he hikes imagine like we have filters for air the same way of filters for water direct air captured technology carbon engineering more than ten years in the making that can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and look at that machine try to get a close-up on what that thing looks like it looks like giant fucking washing machine right like it's washing the air doesn't it look a giant washing machines Wow that mean it seems like it's feasible it doesn't seem like it's something that's impossible yeah I think that's the scalability that that's the main Ryland well it's also funding like if you drive over or fly over Manhattan rather and see the density of the structures and how many buildings are in there you know that people can make some pretty insane shit right why couldn't they make some giant insane vacuum cleaner for the air that's you know as big as a city block of course a lot of it comes down to economics or our system it's not very good at valuing things that our long-term are directly benefit ourselves so so definitely people tax it no fun both find a way to make it profitable is this another one rendering of what one would look like to capture 1 million tons of co2 per year whoa sounds like it looks like it'd be noisy yo yeah probably annoying as fuck look at those fans it's so weird though like the whole array of fans okay that seems like a way to do it looks like somebody built a giant computer and tried to cool everything and then know how all this carbon what the fuck they do with that burn it what do they do what do you make shit out of it what do you do make diamonds imagine that that is her girl's best friend and making that other carbon that you pull out of the air that would be a great business model this would be like a green diamond right a diamond that's actually made and it's all pressured by solar power the use solar power to fucking smash it a freight car that's same carbon fiber I don't know is it the same shit yeah why not right cause be it's carbon right so carbon is how they may die it's coal right which is essentially carbon right do they make diamonds from carbon or they make diamonds just from coal what is cool coals like burnt shit right there's many many forms in which carbon exists yeah so I know there's still structure they are doing that now where they are making commercially made diamonds diamonds are made of carbon so they form as carbon atoms under a high temperature and pressure they bond together to start growing crystals that's why a diamond is such a hard material because you have each carbon atom participating in four of these very strong covalent bonds that form between carbon atoms I've never word that read that word out loud covalent have you ever read that word out well covalent is that I said I've never even seen that word so these bonds that form between carbon atoms so that I know they're doing it now they're they're making diamonds with certain machines high pressure yeah if they did that would be that would be hilarious that would be a good thing too because they would put a dent in the actual diamond market which is this weird lock down fucking strange market because diamonds aren't nearly as valuable as they're set out to be De Beers takes these diamonds and they stockpile them and they only release a certain amount they keep the price very high but it's all engineered like the profit like diamonds used to be far more rare than they are now but with the innovation in mining technology and their ability to get to diamonds they couldn't get to before they have a lot of diamonds okay it's not as valuable as it appears when you go to buy one okay so we can make carbon diamonds bro I'm actually plastic again carbon chains others oh yeah we turn even make diamonds out of ocean but whoa that would be the ultimate green diamond imagine like if you like a really ecologically minded rapper you wear out all your ice could come from the ocean let everybody know from trash to treasure yes they dude that's the fucking that's that's the signature of the company in quotes from trash to treasure write these things down boy in diamonds how about that I like it yeah dude you could be the first guy to do this here we go a plastic this is an ocean diamond whoa earth is crushing the ocean into salty diamonds that's a dope looking diamond to salt I guess recreated salty diamond deposits in a high-pressure high-temperature experiment suggesting that many of Earth's diamonds form when the mantle crushes ancient seabed minerals oh isn't science and the earth cool I mean if you do get to do this here's another problem okay here's a big one for the ocean we're depleting it of seafood right I mean we you know I had how do you say his name again sequoias right Louie Psihoyos who directed the cove on yeah we were talking about the depletion depletion on the wildlife in the in the ocean and when you start looking at it on a grand scale like how much fish they're pulling out of the oceans it's very sobering you know sure maybe you can come up with a way to replenish well fish in the ocean so we can continue eating sushi yeah so so maybe could just zoom out a bit and realize oh what is so because of course plastic pollution climate change overfishing I think it's all part of one big problem to make civilization sustainable and the way I look at it is that of course over the past 200 years humanity has made tremendous progress so of course since agriculture revolution 10,000 years ago UNT has been kind of stagnant no progress or just very very slow progress number of people lifespan it was all kind of flat nothing really happened and then since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and when we learned how to utilize science and our knowledge collective knowledge to to turn that into progress basically every possible metric for Humanity has improved tremendously and if you think of wealth health violence education rights all these things and no you that's Steven Pinker on these is much more knowledgeable on that topic than I am yet so it's a truly at this point in time it has never been a better time to be alive for humans than been today not saying that it can't get better but we have made tremendous progress by one hand in imagining things that don't exist yet so inventing technologies and also inventing institutions and on the other hand our human ability to collaborate effectively in large numbers which includes you know the corporation which is a very effective way for people to to work together now all that progress has always has also had its negative side effects which are most pronounced of course in the area of the environment where we put things into an environment that shouldn't belong there and we take too much out of it then nature can replenish which includes you know the fish and on the other hand you have the plastic going into the environment etc so so and the question is well how do we solve that and of course one hand is to say okay it's kind of the the maybe the Luddite is maybe a bit of a negative way to phrase it but the a reactionary approach of saying okay we should consume less corporations are bad knowledge is bad we should all get rid of all those things and I think the environment the modern environmental movement which is we can do this Romantic movement has this image of back in the day everything was great and we lived in harmony with nature so let's get rid of all this modernity and try and return to that pure original state what I however believe is that first of all that's I don't think it's a very realistic thing people want to keep their iPhones and their cars and you know people want to move forward and at the same time I don't think it's really the most effective way to to solve these problems because it would be like fighting a leopard tank with bow and arrow you know technology is nothing more than an enabler of human capabilities it enhances our power so why not use that power to also try and solve these these these problems as well so rather than try and reject business reject technology I truly believe that we should embrace those those forces that make us human and and has created this amazing world to also try and solve these these negative side effects as well and that's why I believe you know the over camp overconsumption of fish is not going to end by people all becoming vegan but rather through you know fake meat I think that the transport emissions are not going to be solved by people not flying anymore or not going anywhere anymore realistically people are going to fly more so we better invent technologies that allow people to do that without harming the environment and the same thing I think would be the case for for for plastic and really other energy uses as well no I think that's a very wise way of looking at it and it's a it's a hopeful way of looking at it it's funny that today you kind of even it though you're you're you're dealing with statistics and facts information like the fact that it's a safer to live today there's less violent crime it's easier to get by this more technology more innovation medical technologies improve radically all these things are true but you still have to say it's not where we want it to be right so we're not saying that the worlds but we have to say that even to you like even though you're I mean like it's it's the worry about people barking at you so worried about people it's still terrible in parts of the world it's terrible for the people of color it's still terrible for trans it still I can't get it no one saying that there's not room for improvement but you have to say that like you even know you felt compelled you like it's still not perfect yeah and I wonder why it's so so controversial I think it's important to learn from the things that we do well and then apply that I don't think it is that controversial I think it's a trick I think there's just a lot of people looking for every single opportunity to complain even to someone like you who has you know objectively done nothing but good they say one thing like it I mean Steven Pinker took a ton of heat or saying that and even though he's talking about actual scientific statistics he's just it's not saying the world is perfect and everyone should shut up what he's saying is we should look at this you know from a bird's eye view look down and understand that although there's much work to be done we're in a great place in comparison to the rest of human history and it's it's helpful to realize that progress is possible just yet every there's something that feels intuitively right as if every step forward would also have to equal a step backward elsewhere yes and I don't think that's that's the case there's plenty of things that you can invent that that are are not that like and we see it for example with carbon right now that there's countries where like like Sweden GDP has grown a lot past 20 years carbon emissions has gone down so they call that the the decoupling and I think what's really the the main challenge in this century is to decouple human progress from those negative side effects and I think the way to do that it's not reactionary it's really again through innovation and through to collaboration I I agree with you and I think that a lot of times people just assume that this is these are the consequences of innovation there's a pro and a con to everything because there has been so many things there have been so many things and there are inventions that where there are a pro and a con to it but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be that way no and even if things have a pro and a con it doesn't mean the Pro is as big as the comp so and if that would be the case all the technology every technology would be neutral and a wooden limit it wouldn't matter what your events but it would mean that an atomic bomb is morally as neutral as an ocean clean up system which I just don't find plausible so I don't believe that inventors entrepreneurs they put certain morality into their creations into their technology there is there is a certain use that you prescribe with your invention when you don't use nuclear bombs to wash your car right so I mean you use it not for benign uses unless maybe you want to terraform Mars which there are some people proposed to do with atomic bombs I don't know what is good at it but yeah I don't think technology is neutral - it has a more morality so what that means is that as long as we consequent consistently develop net positive technologies you know eventually the world does get better and better if say to not only 60% Goods and maybe has 40% downside and okay but then we can invent a solution for that 40 percent and maybe that's again net positive and you can't get this this cascade of ever improving what no I think what you're saying sounds beautiful and if more people thought the way you're thinking I think the world would be a better place I like the the positivity the optimism and what you're thinking in terms particularly in terms of what's what's possible with innovation yeah well I I just don't think that being against something is very productive I yeah it's it doesn't really move us forward so rather than you know protesting against the things that I don't agree with and there's so many things that I don't agree with but again I don't think it's very helpful rather than doing that I might rather built towards the future that I I do agree with you listen man I think what you're saying is very very logical I wish more people thought like you you're a great role model for a lot of kids to use your energy in a positive direction you know Ken it can be done yeah sure I mean I think we agree with your yeah do you think that I mean when you're looking at this this possibility of getting 50% of the oceans garbage out in five years do you think that's realistic in terms of like the resources that you have the the funding that you have and all this stuff and if not how can people help is there do you have a website where people can yeah so so definitely you know we don't yet have both you know we don't have the technology ready yet to to really clean up the patch the river is different story we're really ready to scale but on the ocean we we still need some you know need some iteration and of course the funding isn't there yet so of course on our website the ocean cleanup come people can donate people can also okay cool there go support the cleanup yeah and so you have is it like PayPal or what is it yeah anything you want and you can make you can join the queue for for the products though that's excellent beautiful and so and are you getting a lot of success with that people are contributing so definitely so far has been enough to keep the keep the development going so it hasn't really been the the limiting factor but of course if we want to scale we're going to need a lot more resources so so definitely a lot of help will be required there coming years it's amazing that this is taking you so long and that you've been working on it so hard that you you have all this energy to be able to pursue something like this I mean it was there every time while you're doing this would be like Jesus Christ I don't know I'm gonna be able to do this is it sustainable like this every day no days off constant yeah so part I should take a few days off hell yeah oh there yeah this year has been you feel guilty if you take time off ah yeah you know but yeah so I usually I feel that with a lot of my that's pretty case for everyone that a lot of my strengths are at the same time also my weaknesses so I think I'm pretty creative so it's good but at the same time it means that you know I really have to force myself to not be distracted by new ideas I think I'm have a good work ethic but but you know the downside is that it's also very hard to slow down and I do realize that taking taking breaks it is eventually it is better it does the best ideas that I've had were during word during times off really like even the ocean cleanup idea was I was 16 was scuba diving in Greece so I'm more blessing than fish yeah that was during during a break so so I should probably take a few days yeah man just go you know go somewhere we could just take a few naps just relax recharge yeah get your system back online perfectly yeah though I think once I know to make is that you know with everything that I've ever done in my life of what's been very obsessed about it and I think when you know it's something that you cannot really stop thinking about it it's it never really feels like work either so it's um I had a calling well yeah I just wouldn't be able to imagine just having a normal job doing something you're not passionate about it's so so yeah I never really miserable would it be to just be in an office and I've just stared the clock waiting for 6:00 p.m. so you can go home right it must be that's like my biggest nightmare for a lot of people is their life you know well yeah I don't mean to offend I've had anyone here but you're being nice again yeah no I understand exactly saying and a lot of people don't realize that the biggest asset they have in their life is their time and to spend that wisely you have this is 80,000 hours of which I believe is like you know 40 40 years 40 hours a week turns out to that's 80,000 hours that you can use for anything and and I do believe that people often have a lot more potential than than what they turn out to be doing if they if they were to realize how valuable that time is and sort of the classic model also for more wealthy people is to to work very hard and then to kind of donate here and there but probably you could be a lot more effective if you were to just use your brain use your time directly on you know working something that matters well I think what you just said is like legitimate inspiration talk you know there's a lot of people that write a book you should well you mean just a video I think it's good enough just a video of you explaining your philosophy you have accomplished so much and your idea your that you're doing is so noble and actually effective there's something that people need to hear sometimes about different people's philosophies on how to spend their time and their energy and your your perception of instead of wasting it on other things just concentrate on something that you think is going to make an impact something that you're drawn to something that and yeah when you do that then you have a cause and you have a thing that you're working towards it's not just simply showing up and doing something that someone's paying you to do that you don't necessarily want to do which is a lot of a trap a lot of people find themselves in that trap and yeah they need to hear people like you talk sometimes that's that that's as inspirational as anyone who's like a professional inspirational or motivational speaker for a lot of folks maybe more so because you're actually doing something yeah well probably my my words carry more credibility once the oceans are actually clean and yeah it'll help but just in fact you get to cargo holds filled with two cargo containers I mean who the fuck has that no one you know come on big blob some bags yeah you know and on the river sweet yeah I've heard that amount every day no really yeah every day on the rivers Wow did the river when you see that horrible pollution drifting down river when you see that stuff does that feel almost like impossible to capture all of it or pointless because people keep throwing it in there well that's that's the thing so we don't position this these interceptors as being the solution the ultimate solution for the hopeless oh of course eventually you have to make sure plastic doesn't end up in the ocean or in the rivers in the first place right so but I was standing so few weeks ago was in in Indonesia and Malaysia to see the machines and talk with you know government people there and I was standing on the Interceptor and you see this constant very torrent of plastic going into the Interceptor and from and I was looking upstream and I realized well there's there's more than five million people living in the catchment area of this river and they have limited infrastructure they consume so much and just trying to imagine all that plastic not ending up in the river with just such a diffused source five million people it was just so hard to imagine and of course that's where we have to go to but realistically speaking its is going to take is going to take a while it's going to take maybe two decades three decades something like that so I think rather than kind of staring at kind of the perfect solution and really just working on on that which of course it's very important I think we also need to be a bit more pragmatic and also realized well okay they may take 20-30 years let's at least make sure that during those twenty thirty years we don't have ten million kilos of plastic flowing out of this river in the ocean so you'd have to have some sort of cooperation with the people that are doing that and chucking that plastic into the river so yeah yeah so somebody's got to figure out a way to get to them so I do hope that the interceptors can have a positive influence upstream as well or people say oh I don't worry about it they're gonna think now yeah it's the best place to throw your plastic because they got a thing guilt free dumping yeah no no side that that hazardous copy or that risk is called moral hazards and it's a phrase from economics where in in the insurance industry it's kind of a thing where people make more damage once they are in short because we're all worried I don't buy it that much as an argument for for the plastic problem because it's not like it's a it's a conscious cost-benefit analysis whether you going to throw something on the street or not it's more of a unconscious thing you just do it right or at least I hope you don't but some people do and and then it's with that same logic why maybe municipality should also stop sweeping the streets and maybe we shouldn't even collect garbage at people's houses because I'd only incentivizes the creation of garbage so so I I don't think that it's not you know and then there's this other effect called the broken window effect which where I think it was back in the sixties in New York what they found is that in streets and neighborhoods where you have buildings that show obvious sign of decay like broken wheat that's where the name comes from broken windows or litter that actually would incentivize other unlawful activities so the similar effect has been observed with like a park if a park doesn't have any litter people litter less than when there is litter on the ground so so Roger I think is the opposite if you if you truly believe that the ocean is going to be polluted forever and it doesn't really matter it's already dirty yeah that's not really a strong motivation to to not litter but if you say okay well ocean is clean now then they love effort for that and yeah once once it's clean I think that would actually be a motivation to to to not bitter I think you're a hundred percent right I think some of those videos where you see shorelines that are so thick I don't know what part of the world it is but that are so thick with plastic you can't even get into the water like you can't wait out there and swim yes it's it's so disheartening and you you wonder where the world will be if not for people like you that are trying to come up with a solution where the world will be in 50 years 50 years ago this wasn't the case now it is if you could see like a time-lapse video of these oceans from like go back to 1900 to 2019 and then go back before 1900 does is relatively unchanged for thousands of years right and then also this massive change very quickly with the Industrial Age yeah but again I believe this is a transition phase it's like our modern civilization being in its sort of teenage years and yes I have to grow out of it and couldn't agree more I I hope I hope this worry that we all have will translate into improvement in progress and I always say the same thing that we're in some sort of adolescent stage of society and evolution that we're in this weird sort of state where we're aware of how we can change our environment but also still contributing to the detriment of our environment in a non sustainable way and then eventually it's gonna have to come to a head you know when you see people screaming about climate change and all these different things I mean this is people realizing that this is there's a lot going on that maybe not everyone is completely and totally aware of and but I'm with you I'm I think it's it's good to be optimistic it's healthier to be positive and I think it is it's logical that people will find a way out of this I really do yeah well you know I'm not sure whether will be right I think not sure either I I hope we are that I think and I you know I think eventually it's going to be fine it's just a question of how long is it going to take how much damage will have been done in that period but realistically it's it's the only way there is a chance that we fare this out right so have you faced in the opposition to this is there anybody that thinks is a fruitless idea yeah I know there were people that were actually I was very shocked I read people that were actually happy that your project didn't work the first time hey what the fuck man there's people that I think it's a thing like cuz you're this really hopeful young intelligent guy who comes up with the solution I think it probably was you think he's so fuckin smart front-cam I hope it fails and when it failed people actually enjoyed it yeah yeah is that did that hurt no so for me so yes of course since the really since the beginning 2013 there have been people yeah like relatively small group of people that have been people that have been opposing it and most of them ironically enough are people that care about the ocean because they don't feel it's the right way to to to check the issue and but the way I deal with it is at least what I used to do in the beginning now they're fortunate there aren't many new arguments anymore but just better get right them out every single argument rationally analyze them know emotions emotions only model your your thinking way and make a distinction okay is this something where this person has a point if so great because rather have somebody else pointing it out to me then us having to learn it in the field and you know having a having unnecessary failure and if the person doesn't have a point if it's just you know assumption or unfounded or whatever now then is very easy for me to just ignore it and so and then the question is well what motivates people to be negative and I think there's pretty for reasons first of all it's it's no genuine skepticism whether it can be done and I think that's how that's healthy and I think we've proved most of those arguments wrong now but of course there's still you know the whole scale-up thing which it's to have to do so so bit of that but it's kind of morphing now to a few other things like one thing is human risk perception which sometimes I think is a it's a cause of some opposition where it's very easy for people to ignore the baseline when they look at risks so you know you can for example say okay nuclear power super risky we shouldn't do that but then if you compared to the baseline of other sources of energy it's actually probably the least risky source of energy there is even solar energy is causes more deaths per megawatt hour then then nuclear power because people fall off roofs so so it's really so if you ignore the baseline and if you say okay doing this cleanup we shouldn't do it because there's all these potential risks right of you know potentially there's some sea life that may be caught potentially there are these moral hazards there's all these risks and you know basically best thing to do is not do it what people then are ignoring is sort of the certain hazard off these hundreds of millions of kilos of plastic that's already in the ocean and if you were to kind of pose the opposite question to say okay so if we were to go to the ocean right now and just dump the equivalent amount of plastic that we were to take out would dump it into the ocean would you would you think that's a good plan and then well probably the answer is is no so so I think there's there's a bit of this you know of course of course what we're doing it's new there are risks involved but as long as we map them well we take things step by step I think they're manageable and they're definitely not risks or reasons to do not do it because of course the baseline is that there is already doing a lot of harm being done by the status quo so I think that's one argument behind people's opposition there's also a bit of zero what it calls zero-sum game bias where people are saying well we shouldn't do this because the resources would be better spent elsewhere I saw an op-ed in Wired a few weeks ago where people were saying well or just one person actually it was was writing where this person said you shouldn't worry about the plastic pollution issue you shouldn't do anything about it because climate change is the biggest issue and our attention should go there plastic pollution is just a distraction and that's foolish well yeah I think yeah there's seven half billion people's in the world and we can do more than one thing at the same time I think yeah I mean what should you not wash your dishes because your carpet is dirty it doesn't make any sense both of them are a problem I don't clean both of them this is this idea that you should only think about climate change so oh don't think about the giant Pacific Garbage Patch is twice as big as Texas are you fucking serious it's a dumb argument both of them are important to think about both of them reporting but a part of writing an article today is writing something that people will get upset about that's part of it is like generating our clickbait stuff having controversial opinions being in contrarian all those things are profitable today there's a giant part of why people write articles they don't write articles they don't write articles to state an objective well-thought-out perspective always sometimes people do but a lot of times people make and click baby bullshit and they kind of twist a story and twist an idea who you are twist it to sort of make their narrative make more compelling be more compelling and Brett sell more or click more and get more ad sales yeah I wonder whether that's in part behind the growing tribalism and polarization that you see everywhere social media I mean the fact that Facebook's algorithms in in a sense support outrage right like these these things are designed to support my friend Ari Shaffir tested this and it's really interesting because he tested it to find out what did it what does it actually support what it actually supports is what you're interested in if you're interested me outraged it'll show you the things that outraged you so he decided to just only YouTube puppies yeah and that's all YouTube it's shown there's puppies he's like no you assholes this is what you're into if you're into fucking getting bad about the border and getting mad about the climate and getting mad about abortion and getting mad about whatever the fuck it is that's what it'll show you because that's what you're interested in you know my YouTube feed is mostly muscle cars and fights why cuz that's what I'm interested in you know I'm just that's like you know and occasionally science things yeah but that's just because that's what you search for that's it'll show you what you search for I'm sure you're somewhat happy that it shows you those things yes sure I don't think I don't think it's as sinister as people want to say it is I think that the issue is human nature we are compelled to get upset about things and I think a lot of it is people that feel disempowered in their own existence the people that you were talking about that are stuck in cubicles and that are staring at that clock waiting for the buzzer to ring so they can go home those people are online they're tweeting they're taking a shit and tweeting fuck this guy's a little kid think she's gonna fix their sparkling trip there's a lot of what's going on there's a lot of people that are upset because they're just it's fun to be upset when your life sucks it's fun to shit on somebody sure it's fun to get mad about the border or when you know you don't live in fucking sounds Dakota you know we're near the border what are you worried about what you're worried about you're just angry people just angry you know it's like these aren't logical discussions of people are having their shout offs and hmm and it's it's a natural part of human nature to get upset about stuff and you know and even someone who's doing something as beautiful as your perspective and or your your idea instead of just saying like this this guy is doing something amazing we need someone like this who's just as innovative and just as inspired to try to tackle this climate issue you need more people like em this is amazing instead of that like you're spending your resources incorrectly yeah yeah well yeah actually are you talking about it yeah and yeah I suppose it's you know from the perspective of the person who who writes that it's you think she's got a point yeah and and then and indeed if you're just saying what everyone else says nobody would see your opinion exactly that's a big part well there's the journalists are fucked right now and it's not their fault it's just print journalism is almost on the way out in terms of like buying things and buying newspapers and buying magazines their numbers are radically down sure so they resort to online things well there are in the online world do you have so much competition you have competition from a million different things that people can choose to look at or read and you know to get them to read a fucking article like you gotta you gotta have something good in there so you have to distort you have to inflame you have to get people polarize gotta get on the set you gotta paint a picture that makes you want to click on this like what is he doing that fucking idiots waste his time trying to pull truck doesn't he know what crap Thornburg has been saying how dare you that's and that's what's going on then yeah you know but it's it's just a fun weird time for humans you know there's there's a lot of negative things but there's also a lot of positive things it's a fun weird time there's a lot going on and it's happening very very very quickly and the prognosticators that people are trying to you know have some sort of an idea of where this is all going no one really knows and change is happening it's such a rapid pace that it scares every bunny so they're looking at defined things and they're looking for control and they're looking to be the person who's got it figured out because nobody's got it figured out it's madness the earth is heating the fucking ice caps are melting the fish are disappearing people are eating dolphins it's madness it's madness out there the fucking Garbage Patch is growing and growing and growing if it wasn't for someone like you who's actually acting and doing something about it would just get worse you have a workable solution you should be applauded yeah fuck that guy you heard me right Jamie I don't think it's fucking hard yeah yeah Jamie group consensus pretty yes consensus is fuck that guy yeah but but I think it doesn't create like so maybe that guy's trying to make a living or she or there are they yeah they're trying to make a living you know I mean I don't understand it's like in this day and age like you have to you have things you have to write about so they write about things and it might not necessarily be you know honest so how do you incentivize the truth let's question again again I think we're in this transitionary phase and I also think technology is going to make a lot of what we're concentrating on obsolete I think we are really really close to some crazy breakthroughs in terms of distribution of information that's gonna make it obsolete and people aren't gonna care as much about clickbait T things because you know you're gonna be able to feel things from digitally created media we think we're very very close to augmented reality becoming an essential part of people's lives you know the same way your phone has become an essential part of your life twenty years ago no one carried a phone around those are very rare and you would and you know 1999 I mean a small percentage of people had phones on them now it's a hundred percent right all this stuff is happening at this exponentially increasing rate when they implement augmented reality who was telling us that apples like somewhere around 2021 man I might have been I've been looking that up he happened it once or twice definitely did might have been you but some other folks have brought it up to that apples really close and they're there in the process right now developing some sort of augmented reality goggles and they'll be like glasses like you know you put on pair of you know just like this but you'll be seeing all these things in front of you you'll be able to move them around you're able to see navigation you'll turn it on and off it'll probably work on Siri you'll be able to talk to it and you're gonna be able to get video and information written was podcasts all these things music it's gonna come through this and probably this is one step in this ever increasing trend of us getting further and further immersed in technology and augmented reality will lead to some sort of impossible to determine virtual reality where it's indistinguishable from regular reality we're like we're like 50 years away from literally being in the matrix yeah yeah so I I think it's under appreciated how much our behavior is also guided by technology I mean of course we have our genes our genotype which kind of lies at the most fundamental level of how our behaviors are formed that's why you know there is such a thing as human nature but then there is this whole sort of cultural layer but that but we humans created around us which I called a Technosphere maybe other people have different names for it but it's indeed I've recently read we we interact with something like thirty thousand inventions or thirty thousand technologies through our entire lives that's a huge amount and I think that environment that shapes your behavior it decides what kind of genes are expressed and the interesting thing is it's not just a natural environment but it's an environment we create so so probably now when you think about people being born thousands of years ago their genes were very very similar to the people today yet how they behave is completely different again at violets and why is that the case it's thanks to these inventions not just yeah there's a co inventions but also cultural inventions and institutions that we created that you know shapes our behavior and probably human nature is the human behavior is very hard to change unless it actually benefits what what we do look at you know smartphones how fast that happened first is how long it takes for smoking to to go away you know one is one is kind of incentivizing the continued use of it through addictive products while with with smartphones it's again it's it's something that you you want to use so so I just wonder whether you know that interaction between humans and the technology that we create kind of invent incentivizes inventors to become morally better and better because they all right did she lose me already or no no no so the question is what people are incentivized primarily by profit right right but the you know the behavior that people express is kind of shaped by but the world they live in and who knows maybe a person today is it's more instant device to to do good things because of the environment that has been created rather than a thousand years ago no I think that's absolutely the case and I hope that people's ability to express themselves through social media all those often negative and bitchy sometimes also it can give you a sense of the moral landscape of the culture like not just the people on the far fringes that are the the most angry and vehement about things but people that have objective real rational thoughts like the the the fact that you were able to read that article and objectively assess whether or not someone has any good points or not if we could all do that about everything you know if people have that sort of perspective instead of being so reactionary instead of being so angry about things just look at criticisms look at possibilities look at all these different things and then shape technology to fit within our ethical and moral boundaries so there's part of theirs and also there it's very profitable right because if if things don't feel if you don't have like a guilty feeling about buying something every time I get a plastic straw now I feel guilty right if there was something that you that people where they innovate to the point where you don't feel guilty supporting products and you felt like this company has the same sort of ethics and ideas that you have that's all good and I think we're moving more towards that but again we're dealing with a very short window of time where human beings have had to adapt to this an incredible amount of change there takes place during a small period of time yeah it's kind of them where one way to look at problems is that it's kind of this chasm between human nature human behavior and how we want the world to be and indeed social media is that's the case but similarly for environmental problems we humans are are driven by certain things and you know self-interest is definitely a big part of it and yet that's not creating the world right now that we want to live in because the the Technosphere the technology that is in the interface between the worlds or so sort of nature and human nature that interface is not compatible with both so you either have something that's compatible with human nature so it's like a big car with a v8 engine but that's not compatible with with nature or yes something that's compatible with nature which is for you know walking but it's not really comfortable with human nature because we're you know lazy and greedy it's cold outside and you know you're in a snowstorm exactly so ideally what we do is rather than trying to change humans which I don't think is a very futile activity because there is such a thing as human nature we have genes of this evolutionary history rather than trying to change that I think is much more effective to change the the technology around us that you know enables our our inner desires and behaviors to be positive rather than negative I agree with you I think it's gonna be difficult though to get that same sort of positive result when it comes to our addiction to technology our addiction to smartphones in particular I mean for a long time it was like televisions right like people talked about how much kids watch TV kids watch TV eight hours a day it's so much it's so bad you don't really hear that anymore right you hear about phones and this is a sort of an undiscussed rapid shift in what we waste our time doing right and most of it is you hear people talking about and most of the use of these phones I would I'd be willing to bet a giant chunk of that social media yes right yeah and I suppose that's again this sort of infantile stage of that technology is now in Taos adolescent but yeah so I think you're right yeah it's it's again probably we can engineer social media and our information technology to incentivize people to do good things but indeed now it's it's probably incentivizing the use of scrolling through timelines because you watch more ads I also I think it's our bodies and our minds and the way we view the world it's we're not designed to live in this digital realm sure this is a completely new thing for the species and I think we don't really know how to handle the dopamine rush that we get from clicking on Instagram and scrolling through your feeds and checking your DMS and reading your emails and constantly interacting with people and checking did he text me back what did he say oh well that's interesting what about this and that and this and that you're just all day all day interacting with some digital device we're not made for this to go outside you know and then you have you know very bright engineers somewhere in a big shiny building a be testing all day to see whether you know a red dots on a certain icon in the social media app makes people click more or less and that's yeah well Instagram is kind of dabbling with this idea of taking away the likes right like what if we just didn't show anyone who likes right you don't know how many likes you get you put up a picture it's just a fucking picture move on yeah no you put up a picture he got 70,000 likes for that picture what the fuck man you check it checking an hour later 74,000 oh it's going viral yes that's weird that that likes thing is one of the weirdest drugs nobody saw coming and people get addicted to you know saying things that get likes right putting things up that are socially conscious to let everybody know let everybody know how virtuous you are and exactly likes getting likes yeah and it's it's all making use of I suppose the the flaws of our or human nature what I'm worried is it one day those likes will actually be a physical feeling oh yeah you get like a little jolt and though engineer the system to get you to seek those constant love jolts yes why not I mean if they look if if they're gonna give you augmented reality we are how many generations I don't know away from something something being embedded in your body right people have already decided to do that there's some was a guy or girl embedded a fucking Tesla Model 3 key their arm so that they didn't ever have to have their key in their pocket they could just walk up there Tesla and the fucking door unlocks wait does the climbing software updates key doesn't work anymore I thought it runs out of battery isn't gonna cut you open like a fish just I mean what the fuck are people doing those are people at the fringes they are the fringes but there's more of them than you think and if they make it more they make it simple like you just need like a like a flu shot just know whether there is any sort of innate fear or aversion towards crossing that interior/exterior boundary with technology fair is a good way of looking at right like what is fair is it fair if you agree to do it look look is it fair if you decide to get a face tattoo all right if you if it's up to you man but if it's fair if it's like hey man my credit card company told me that give me 10% off if I stick this you know this credit card chip under my skin somewhere yes I suppose if you again incentivize it with yeah with selfish interests yeah maybe it will take up there's that and there's also the big concern is what if these jamming we're talking about income inequality in this world a big one would be what if there's a jump that you can make in enlightenment and intelligence access to information number crunching the ability to assess risk versus reward this is all done computer wise and it's it's done through some sort of additional piece of hardware that they give you or and put in your body but it costs a lot of money so the people that can afford it initially are the people that are valuable they have money in the first place so the wealthy people are ready because it's very valuable but then the people that really need it they can't afford it so by the time it becomes something ever all the money's gone everybody's chewed it all up everybody's figured out how to hack the system you should become a writer for a black mirror that seems like a black mare episode it seems like it would work right yeah that's well that's what people are worried about when it comes to longevity - right they're worried about technological innovations and are allowed people to you know nanobots and all sorts of different weird things gonna repair cells and allow them to live for extended periods of time but then who are these people going to be are they gonna be the king class you know are they gonna be this super duper wealthy people of the future that are gonna you know hold this over the poor folks you can't afford the technology yeah yeah so it truly seems like the the technologies that we're developing are that at least are not too far away our institutions aren't ready yet to to really cope with us no because definitely that would be probably increase inequality koyla yes that that is one of the major concerns when it comes to this sort of rapid change that we're facing right now you know another one of course is artificial intelligence there's there's people that I respect very very much that have a very negative view of what the future of artificial technology is gonna mean to the human race you nervous ilan alone yeah both of them scare the shit out of me every time I talk about it yeah Sam Sam Sam and I did an episode and I where he talked about artificial intelligence and the rise of it in the fact that once it's uncorked it's really not going to be able to be put back in the bottle yeah and we talked about for like an hour and a half and after it was over like the rest of day I was bummed out sure I was like this is inevitable yes so the president have a very I suppose a very optimistic and pessimistic view of technology at the same time I think on one hand it allows us to to improve the world and that's what we've seen and it's it's gradual and it continues probably because people want to solve their own problems and with that inadvertently solve other people's problems that's progress happens I believe but then at the same time while the world is getting a lot better it's also getting riskier I mean two thousand years ago or maybe even two hundred years ago there was no way to wipe out humanity that simply wasn't if you even if you wanted to to happen very badly you know you could scream wouldn't happen now though there are actually people who have the power to do that and rapidly like you could the whole of humanity could be wiped out in a day yeah and now it's fortunate just a few people would imagine if that goes from a few people to quite a few corporation - maybe right even everyone I think there's a there's this this sort of brain teaser or mental experiment that Nick Bostrom came up with that says well what if you could have kind of this atomic bomb that you could just make yourself in your microwave it's like well maybe at some point in time we would just not be economically feasible anymore to rebuild cities because I don't know it's on one hand you know and so I think that's kind of the this this the scary you know risky aspect of it but at the same time when you think of it I would much rather trust or n trust and an average person today with the button for a nuclear detonation detonation device than somebody a thousand years ago oh sure I'm one of the Mongols or someone some savage Nick Ostrom freaked me out man and we had a conversation about probability of life being a simulation it's very high probability it's more probable that we're in a simulation now than we're not and my puny monkey brain to some logic yes that's that's where it gets weird we deal with the number of potential civilizations out there the number of human beings the amount of time that life has had a chance to evolve not just here but everywhere in the entire universe one of the possibilities that a simulation has occurred already very high were the possibilities that we're in a simulation right now also pretty high simply because there's only one base layer yeah simulation so yeah also life seems fake right it seems weird see there's so much of it that seems like boy this is okay a few weeks ago I saw like a duck in a palm just making an infinite sir because I said that's definitely a glitch yeah yeah yeah someone needs to fix the code yeah yeah of course it's lots of fun to think about those things but you know rennet II well that's what's the depressing things that we'll likely never know wow maybe maybe one time somebody will figure out the solution and dystopian view of the futures it's I mean I get I get the perspective I get the dystopian perspective but right now as we said like you know according to Pinker according to statistics things are really better than they've been before and my concern is that but my concern is what one of the things that Ilan said that where the biological bootloader correct artificial life I mean look when a caterpillar makes a cocoon it doesn't know what the fuck it's doing it just does it you know just makes the cocoon it becomes a butterfly well you know we're buying the iPhone 36 and the cyber trucks and trying to get a solar-powered plane right off the ground we're probably giving into this thing or this look what we have right now is more than sufficient for survival if we just decided if we got all the people in the world say hey watches we make watches that keep perfect time computers they get online it's great you can download YouTube videos cameras they're very clear they take very clear pictures okay CTV's look great everything looks great internet speeds pretty fucking good man especially 5g let's stop yeah everybody stop stop stop making stuff stop it just met everything we have right now just keep making it no no new innovation let's just enjoy life together right that sounds like it's that sounds so logical but yet also so ridiculous like no one's gonna agree to that no I phone 37 is already in production rich it's gonna be better and faster it's gonna wrap around your dick and keep you comfort at night it's they're gonna figure out better stuff no matter what forever it's part of what makes people people we have this unquenchable thirst for innovation that's one of the weird things that freaks me out about this move towards technology is that materialism which seems to be this like really standard behavior with a giant percentage of the population like people really into things and this desire to have the newest greatest things is what propels innovation because there's a financial incentive because people are making money off of selling you these better watches that you don't really need or these better cars or these better computers and all these things just keep getting better and better and better and better and a lot of it is fueled by this weird desire that people have for stuff sure which doesn't make any sense like how where'd that come from well that might be the stuff that makes the caterpillar make the cocoon yeah I mean it's probably just making use of the same biological mechanisms as social media right it's you feel like you need it yep tricks little tricks oh yeah and next thing you know they go listen we have two options either we let artificial life take over and be the superior life form or we merge well it's just smart let's just make friends yeah just make friends with artificial intelligence take this little chip boy huh yeah well so probably if it's possible and it likely is it's probably pretty inevitable that it's going to happen I think it was Edison that said that I never invented anything I just took elements of was there probably the quote is a lot better than I'm paraphrasing now but it's kind of if it's possible you know it's kind of yes there it's right it should be already invented yes you just have to discover it Marcia so sir probably that's going to happen but what does give me hope is that to my point of the nuclear detonator thousand years ago for this now it seems like we are getting more responsible and our ability to foresee the future allows us to invent things but it also allows us to to kind of think about the risks and to to try and mitigate the risks before they they happen and I don't think there's nearly is enough enough attention given to these existential risks but the fact that some people are thinking about it is yeah it's kind of hopeful no I agree I really do and I and I'm posing these things about this dystopian potential future just because really it's probably something we should think about but I am hopeful that as technology improves our understanding of humans improves along with it and and and also that perhaps some technology like I'm not exactly sure what this neural link thing is with Elan these coming up with but I think something is some of it has to do with a much more rapid access to information sure you know that it has to do with the increasing bandwidth yeah increased bandwidth yeah hopefully that will become I mean you don't want to say hopefully some fucking wires they stick in your brain will become standard because that seems that seems like we are much to him I mean that is merging right that's that's that's the merge with technology Marshall McLuhan said the greatest thing about this said human beings of sex organs of the machine world what a great quote right yeah that's one of those quotes you just go whoa fuck that is exactly what it is the machine world can't make itself needs us like if we do make artificial life and McLuhan I think wrote that in the 60s yeah I think that's from what is the book he's got a book media something but what is Marshall McLuhan so so it's uh it's a broader point that our full understanding media or media understanding media that's it for yeah 1964 imagine if that guy called it yeah in 64 so so definitely it's it's a it's a broader point of people make and that we are in a way enslaved by our technology and that I think in the book sapiens by Harari yeah great book he makes the point about grain enslaving us because the Agricultural Revolution ten thousand years ago they we didn't really become better according to him it was less nutritious it was it was just a worse way of living than the hunter-gatherers did but it was very good for the population of grain and there was no way back for us so I suppose yeah that's the thing with all our inventions they there are these these Lockean effects that can kind of look us into an inferior position yeah and yeah so so you know of course the risk with artificial intelligence is that a similar thing happens and that's not very benign and yeah we didn't foresee those consequences that we will be locked in in the year 2065 it's one of the more fascinating things about people though that we have the ability to contemplate the possibilities that we have the ability to look at this and go okay what are we doing here hold on hold on we're making a mistake here look what we've got us doing but good Rice's got us doing damn it look how much people there are in the city there's so many people in the city what are we gonna feed all these people shit right we didn't think of this we just kept breeding and you know that's the big concern when people start developing too into new areas when people start expanding the the technological or the the rather societal sprawl when you see these urban sprawl is just slowly encroaching on new land right and pushing out into areas where there was no houses before that's always weird for me when I Drive by a place like Boulder Colorado does a really good job of limiting the amount of construction that gets done there right they're pretty fierce about it but even they have been sort of lightening up a little things have been getting built and every now and then I'll drive by like if I'm in Colorado my oh that wasn't there before now it's there everybody thinks it's harmless no big deal just a new building used to be an open field who's that helping it's not helping anyone and then another building outside of that and then you know you could you have the ability to look in time 50 years from now you yeah you see this spread we're this weird wort of humanity and starts moving across the globe this cool feature and Google Maps where you can have for Google Earth where you can have time lapses from satellite photos like past six years and for them really Dubai 30 years ago nothing and you something I'll be the example that's a crazy example that place is so strange it's like Las Vegas on steroids yeah Las Vegas on steroids with its own Islands man-made islands the shape of the world like all the different continents that world you seen that yeah and it's not doing it like it's some of it apparently they have to like keep adjusting because the tide rises and the pretty dumb actually is this the Google Maps thing called another one but there's another one to buy oh my god this is insane this is insane it's happening so fast how many years is this spanning Oh 20 oh my god that's amazing so the actually some of our engineers used to work for the dredger and they helped build the the palm islands and pretty the problem is that the water doesn't really move in the arms of the the palms so it kind of gets stinky and oh okay so this prime real estate that's just stinks oh no really oh that makes sense but the water in between it would get stale of course that makes sense fuck this is bonkers this videos bunker you know either actual oh there's the yeah that's the thing so all that water inside yeah it doesn't get recycled it doesn't move around yeah how the fuck that they had to do that to keep the like an ocean break right the both the water from smashing into it like the outside rim you can't just pump everything so now what do they do with all the stinky water you just accept it good question that fucking world's tallest building is BA Nana's right that thing I've seen pictures that people have taken from the top floor it doesn't even look real like all you flat earthers you need to go to Dubai get up there you could literally see the curve yeah and when you stand on its foot because of its shape it looks they even told her can you see the curve from up there see if go to think so no thing so maybe on an airplane you can't you can kind that's true with a bit of yeah you got a design this yeah yeah yeah you got to be way up great would you go and one of those virgins trips they do a virgin spaceship fly above the earth and once there's good safety statistics right for you fuck early adopting yeah it's pretty not good to be an early adopter either yeah well just base area what kind of psychos and want to be on that first flight well I suppose Richards would have to go and one of the first ones themselves right oh if I was him I would clone myself and put a fake me on that and see if that bitch blows off I wouldn't trust UNDOF oh yeah what is this Jamie is this for oh I'm getting vertigo just looking down I am freaking out I get like legit this is all GoPro so this is what would flat earthers use to show that the earth is actually flat it's the perspective shift but just the height of that goddamn thing makes my palms sweat I was there last year and there was somebody sticking her phone out of the No yes oh god damn people are crazy yes how did she dropped it and it fell and just went right through someone's fucking head like literally like a missile in your head would just explode you manage getting hit in the head with a cellphone from a mile up motherfucker that's good motherfucker people are so crazy would take so long to put the word burst mode yes a new perspective to that term they should have like an alarm that goes off when someone drops something someone can quickly hit an alarm and by the time it hits the bottom the bottom floor will hear bad man they get all back away from the building these guys are on the tip top no shut the fuck up oh my god they're hanging on like these guys this kids with his dad it looks gross dad's crazy - right you're both fucking nuts dude my hands are sweating right now I can't handle these oh that dude that we've had on James with a k' do Kingman Kingman James the guy who does those said it Kingman right he does these videos from these fucking places Kingston thank you sorry James it's America I smoke a lot of weed no he's uh he lives in England okay and he takes these videos where he's like hanging on by one hand with a fucking selfie stick yes looking down science skyscrapers and sweat so hard just watching those I can't imagine if I was actually doing that what a terrible fucking instinct or a terrible thing that happens to people when you see people hanging onto something your hands sweat hmm so do your hands sweat when you're hanging it's not helping you that's the worst thing that could happen is your hands get all slippery fuck man this channel looks like he recently had an accident he's a video post on September 11 says the day nearly died and he's got a big old like stitches - well we talked to him about that when he was on the podcast does he think about that look but he's kind of locked into that now you're sort of married to this idea that you you know you're the guy who goes up there and does that you can't just say well I've done it no more it's like the green yep it's like the green yeah he's married to the thrill well Alex Honnold is the best example that right he's this free solo guy oh yeah a free solo climber that goes oh El Capitan with no ropes it's did you watch the yes fucking thousand I've had him on the podcast a couple of times he freaks me out I just don't understand how he can do it I get I I get it you know I get that's his thing he's passionate about it and again sweaty it's just a weird thing that people do where they try to activate their adrenaline glands you know they try to activate their thrill glands right yeah I do respect that I mean he's it's his passion and he he follows this yeah I shouldn't some people clean the ocean people climb 45-degree angle backwards a sizable Mountain wouldn't want to be a Semele but No right try it it looks like he might have stopped doing that I mean instant he might be getting paid to still do it as like a stunt person for movies because he did one for a movie recently but he has a video from this year recently says that YouTube do monetize all his videos and he just has been posting car stuff YouTube is D monetized as videos bloggers they don't want incentive I probably oh wow that's interesting he's had a video explaining it you could probably talk about I guess at the end of climbing YouTube to monetize me August 22nd that's interesting understand huh being more realistic yeah but here's the thing they do monetize it but yet they still have it up and they still have an algorithm that will click you after his video and suggest a bunch of other shit they're gonna monetize but it might not have ads on it right his video I'm sure doesn't have ads on it but that doesn't mean it's not that effectively a part of their system like that that sort of that's gets revenue because you know they're gonna recommend a bunch of videos that do have Adams you're gonna keep clicking I think they're as far as YouTube stance is just like if an advertiser solved their ad on this video we can't be a part of that well I think also from YouTube's perspective almost all of is illegal yeah good point that's I think that's a big one like I don't think you could do a legal shit on YouTube and get money off of it then then they would be responsible in some sort of a way right yeah boy um we're over here fixing the world dude yeah done anything else huh do we cover it all basically yeah I think that's oh yeah of course Yoshi cave does come people went to how ocean clean up the ocean clean ocean the ocean clean up calm people please go there and help well we'll help too we would love to contribute love to be a part of this for sure if there's anything else we can do if there's anything that you need promoted or want to let people know we'd be happy to help but uh thank you thanks for being you man thanks for inventing this and thanks for pursuing this so dogged Lee and have being so obsessed with what is an incredibly worthy cause appreciate you man well so much my pleasure all right bye everybody see you [Music]
