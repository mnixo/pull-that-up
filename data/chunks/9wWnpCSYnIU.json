hello freak bitches well you guys have been through such a fascinating change in music too because you mean obviously Lars was a huge figure in the controversy surrounding mp3s yeah and that was like during the Napster days that was the time where everybody realized like holy shit something just happened you know and I don't think we realized it back then I think Lars in a lot of ways was one of the first people sounding the horn he was one of the first people going hey all this selling record shit is gonna go away like do you understand what's going on here people are just taking things and putting them online and this was a totally new thing absolutely and that poor guy still you know he's taking bullets he's taking hits for still well really where Oh everyone who's got a beef with any other thing then uh you know Napster day it just gravitates towards that all the time that poor guy yeah he got beat up by that and we all stood behind him obviously he was the spokesman for it he he chose he chose to do that management said hey this is comin this is coming let's be the ones that stand up for artists and he took that he grabbed the flag said I'm going and there were lots of other musicians and people that were on board as well but they weren't as vocal or taking the hits like he did there was something about you know even you're like a dr. Dre he was on board with it but for some reason in the rap world it's like well it's all about money anyway so so what you know for heavy metal there was some kind of stigma around you know you're an asshole if you're rich or if you've been successful or something it's like we got to pull you down into hell with us you know don't don't be getting good now you know yeah so that was that stigma but there were other artists that would show up at shows saying hey man I'm really glad you're doing what you're doing it's like come on you know join us oh no oh yeah oh no my career would be over it's like you fuck you know it's so frustrating it's like dude do you believe in it yeah then stand up psych yeah but no it'll fall apart some what happened my fans blah blah blah so they they were concerned about their own careers and not the big picture of artists and obviously these days you can see there's no copyright laws there's no nothing man you can rip this and that and whatever and do whatever you want with it there's a beauty to that and a lot of creativity comes out of it but it gets watered down it gets you know I don't know we we acknowledge that yeah there's an inspiration somewhere for everything but blatantly taking that and using it is it's pretty frustrating to me and we're where we were at that point where we were we had such a following we had such a strength in Metallica that we survived all of that stuff but there was a lot of bands that didn't you know they couldn't sustain themselves couldn't feed their families because of what happened and I think the frustrating part was no one really understood that music is our life you know if you take that if you take ours like the way we want to present our music is part of the art like in in an album meaning like one song leads to the next song meaning more like releasing an album here's how we'd like to release it right we don't want it leaked over here we don't want this happening we don't write you know a present but presentation is part of the art like when you walk into an art studio the artist has been in there putting it together like okay I want you to see this first and then that and then you go here and you get BAM you know that there's a passion behind that and when someone just throws it out there then and it just it kind of loses leaves as an impact so if I'm complaining punch me in the face but we have survived and we feel good about it and we've adapted but the record company certainly did not you know they took a hard hit but also you know when you look at the record deals the deal that record companies make with artists and you see like what would a record company selling well they're only selling your work without your work without your creativity without your creations there's nothing to sell that's all they sell but then you look at these insanely one-sided deals that they cut with artists especially emerging artists that might be a little bit more desperate don't realize the potential especially the potential for income that they might have in the future I mean I've seen some of those I don't know there was that one that somebody said that Courtney Love didn't really write it that it was ghostwritten I don't know who the fuck wrote it but Courtney Love put it out saying that she wrote it but it was a breakdown of how artists make money from the creation of an artic reiation of an album to having it sold in record stores to where the money gets extracted and how much is left for the actual artist it's pretty fuckin disturbing yeah even well a couple years ago we got the rights to our catalog our music from kilomole up till now we own it finally which is weird might tell my kids hey you know let's go celebrate we've got and we got the master recordings we own it finally and they were just looking at me like what the hell are you talking about you wrote it why isn't it yours right okay well a little talk about how it was back then you know you would somewhat sell a little bit of your soul to get a bigger something you know basically the record company was a bank and a marketing tool to get you where you wanted to be so you know it was a necessary thing at that time but it's great to have our stuff back and be able to you know we owned our own record press how cool is that whoa in Germany one of our management people found a place that had some machines that were for sale and we bought one and so we press our own vinyl man Wow and we could kind of do whatever we want what color vinyl today you know or what crazy things you can do you know you guys can kind of do whatever the fuck you want now right you don't need a record company you can do anything well it depends we have a record company but we own our own in America or North America the rest of the world's a little tougher you know there's a lot of countries out there especially in Europe and there's no way we can deal with the distribution in each different country so we've cut really good deals with with other record companies that have a vision and have a love for Metallica and understand that this is powerful stuff and people love it and we want to be part of the family but having your own record press is a pretty darn cool thing that was really inspired by Jack White who uh you know white stripes Fame you know rock on tears he's done a lot of stuff but he he loves that stuff he's pressing his own stuff he's coming up with different ways of doing vinyls and colors and hidden tracks and cool stuff like that and it's it's just another way to get creative in in your career is vinyl what's selling more than anything now when it comes to actual physical hard copies of things I don't know the numbers and they're probably very all over the place but vinyl has never gone away and it's it's I don't know if it's coming back but it's more popular than it was I think there's just something tactile about it there's something great that people are finally understanding that you can look at artwork you can feel it and then the the the ritualization of opening up the player taking it out and blowing on it clean and putting it down setting the needle down and it's that something really cool I just I came down to LA a few months ago and hung out with some high school buddies it's like hey what do you want to do us listen to some songs and he takes out the Kansas you know album puts it on and carry on away exactly hahaha dude this sounds so great Wow yeah and we were actually listening to music sitting down listening to it my kids got into vinyl they got up you know like it urban outfitter you buy the little the set up now and that's where they that's where you can get vinyl it's it's there there are some record stores out there but that's where they gravitate towards got him this little player and they just picked out some album covers didn't know who they were it's like this cap this cover looks cool this speaks to me I'm buying this I remember you know in that kind of thing oh yeah cool cover yep that's how I discovered tons of bands so they go into the room and you know I leave them alone for a while and they come back they haven't come out like what's going on I look in there they're you know the record players on the floor covers and stuff strewn out all over the place and they're laying on the floor listening to it's like that is what that was me you know uh and my daughter comes out she said dad you'll never guess what like what their songs on the other side oh my god yeah it's not a CD you know I was like she discovered some huge thing you know Wow well that was one of the things that was not what is this vinyl sales outperform digital downloads for the first time oh wow shows a significant shift in how people are consuming music that's really interesting man I tell you that's just cool uh in general yeah the more ways you can get music to people the better well I think the other thing that you were saying it's it's like it's a whole presentation the album cover you open it up the inside the artwork all that represents your vision of what you guys are trying to put out and that was one of the things that kind of went away with digital like all of a sudden there were no album covers so the CD was that big so you couldn't really there wasn't you know it's like a tiny little piece of art and if you're downloading it you're not even getting that you just you're just getting the music itself that's well it you will you would get loadable artwork but you're not really looking at the artwork while you're listening to it on your mobile device right you know so you know the event of sitting down and and and disappearing into the music you know being a real music listener not I mean while you're driving I get it it's it's keeping you from killing people on the road but when you go home and you sit and you just get lost in stuff even like those the cheap frigging headphones man the little earbuds my kids were listening to stuff on that's like you guys haven't experienced music like good sound here try these headphones on they're like whoa I hear stuff I didn't hear before and but just seeing my kids get excited about going to a live concert you know they go there and they absorb it in like every sense you're not just here having your ears hear something and that will never be I don't know maybe the friggin goggles or some kind of audio-visual stuff will reproduce live shows but there's something about being next to a sweaty fucker at a gig in you know them pushing you er you know seeing someone head bang wildly or getting thrown over the top of you and there's just so much smells things like that that just can't be recreated so live music my daughter just like I can't believe that guy just pressed a button on his computer and he's singing over his own music that's not performing you know she discovered that on her own hey these guys are actually playing their instruments and they fucked up fucked up a song it was so cool you know I saw something that I wouldn't have you know really cool like that yeah the lip-syncing thing man dad when you go to see a concert you find out the people at lip-syncing that's so disturbing it's just what what have you done with that this is what is the point of this it is disappointing what is live performance live performance is supposed to be you're experiencing this thing actually happening you're watching this person themselves they're not put they're not pretending you're not supposed to be pretending right are you pretending you're you will get fucking money back does your nut that's not that's not that's pretending that's not singing I've gone to see plenty of shows with my kids and you can tell it's like alright it the mics way over here and they're still singing in and it's like well they have to have the backing tracks cut there there's they're dancing and they're out of breath like we'll fucking stop dancing and do the song I mean are you a dancer or you're musician or singer work in cardio start running hills it can be dango and the Vale and run up to 14 or exactly it can be done but I've seen shows where there's that going on and then they'll get real they don't like sit down on a couch plug it in acoustic and and sing out a key and like really try and struggle with a song or sing it you know it's like that's natural that feels good who would not gravitate towards that yeah then listening to the album I gonna listen the album at home yeah that's why it's cool to just see an acoustic set sometimes from people you know just like it's as minimal as possible you're breaking it down to the bare bones just a guitar and two people singing or something you know yeah that is pretty intimidating I'll tell you when we do like that Neil Young benefit words you know acoustic only and if you're frigging eight naked up there dude every note is like burp at you know and every fuck up on the vocal it's it's great I mean it's like when you know you go you're gonna be on a TV thing and they put makeup on you it's like why are you doing that well exactly uh so when people see me in person they think damn you're one ugly fuck no I want to be as ugly as possible to everyone so when they see me they go hey it's you you know exactly exactly right yeah you're not airbrushed yeah you see a Photoshop of yourself and it's like you know they smoothed out all your lines you're like what the fuck are you doing sometimes sometimes you got to do it or like you know if you're in a band like I am and three guys get the stuff put on and then I show up dude oh my god I your shiny exactly it's like people are gonna go fuck this Bandai dude sweating yeah right hey when it comes to the Napster thing and what would happen with Lars I feel like there's two different things there's something there's what's really happening and there's how people look at it and what's really happening was like all of a sudden this door got opened up or this Pandora's Box got open right and you guys were looking at it going well this is uh we're gonna lose our record sales like you understand that like people have been consuming music in a certain way you've been paying for music and that paying for music has supported all these people that are a part of this industry that makes albums there's this gigantic thing behind it this is all going to go away because you just put a hole in the bottom of it and all the money's going to dropped out but then the way it looks is look at this rich motherfucker you know he doesn't it doesn't appreciate his fans hey man I can't afford your album right now is it okay if I just download it for free and a lot of people thought well hey people who can afford it will still be downloading it and then they'll buy it when they can but that wasn't really the case was it no I don't know I you know I'm all for convenience in the technology moving forward getting music out to people is an important part but just make sure the artist gets what they deserve from it because without that it's going to become a hobby no one wants you know I don't want to see the paramedic show up at my house and it's like a hobby for him hey you know I'm not really getting paid for what I think I should get paid for my creation but I guess I'll save your life you know maybe people didn't relate that to their their career or something equivalent I think because the money wasn't equivalent they looked at you guys like you guys are already so rich what do you give a shit there's no way you're going to be broke you guys made millions and millions and millions of dollars you tour all over the world and it became the touring was way artists made money then right touring and merchandise and that's now how record companies are stretched structuring their deals you know hey we get a piece of your merch in and touring see that's bizarre though the record company is getting a piece of your touring to me is very strange and I've seen not just a piece but an exorbitant amount and that disturbs me well it's the only way they can survive now they shouldn't be around then well cuz then you become a parasite because you don't deserve it I mean especially now where bands can literally become gigantic because of YouTube me didn't Justin Bieber become huge just entirely because of YouTube Jamie knows look at him fucking Justin Bieber fan he hides it Amy - first I heard him saying I thought it was a girl I didn't even know was it I didn't know well I tell you the the whole you know would you would you go up to the artist and take that out of his pocket you know would you go into a record store and just lift that steel it run out the door with it you know would you do that with you know okay there's you know there's there's big corporations at a rich and would you go walk in and just steal their stuff I mean there's software companies that are massive would you go in there and just rip their stuff I don't get that mentality I don't call me old-school but you you need to earn what you get and if you get stolen from you it doesn't make any sense it's it's hard to fathom and what it seems like to me and I could be talking out my ass but the record companies drop the ball and the new record companies became iTunes in control at all here's how much we're charging for your music and here's how much you're gonna get everyone's even it's like some communist approach you know and I don't understand I don't understand that if we're an artist and we make a lot of money that's up to us if we give all our money away to charity or we throw it back into a movie that bombs which happen that's our choice we're the fucking artist we get to do what we want it's our party you're invited and we can destroy this thing if we want I want you to destroy it yeah the iTunes distribution model is a very bizarre one it's very strange how they so they don't know what they're doing no one knows what they're doing and you know there was a system that worked and I'm up for bucking the system and making it better but it didn't it didn't get better it's like the like you said the cat got out of the bag and you can't put it back in man you just can't so what do you do well you got Spotify or you got something else where streaming's gonna help get the artists their money and it's it's you know companies like that are losing money a lot in Spotify I don't I don't I don't know the exact workings and I'm not going to speak for them at all but it hasn't been figured out yet is what I'm saying it hasn't been figured out how to make a music model work and there's no one way maybe there will never be one way again and that's fine but it's still unbalanced [Music]
