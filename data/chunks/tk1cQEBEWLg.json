bloom ladies and gentlemen Josh Barnett youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion a now retired retired just I'm free in the wind I'm like a bald eagle I'm just out there so riding on that freedom just America just I decided to leave the fold of the UFC and chase my my own futures by my own hands are you actively competing or going to be actively competing there'll be some grappling stuff this year but I'm figuring by the start of next year I'll get back into the MMA circuits mainly because it's just going to take some time to set up camps managers the structure of everything right I have proper sparring partners and all that and in the meantime we were talking about you're doing commentary for New Japan Pro Wrestling with Jim Ross and you do it on access TV right that's right every Friday night at 8:00 you can see me sit down and run my mouth about wrastlin yeah we just did the live show up at the Cow Palace in San Francisco which they've been having sporadic wrestling events there but it was a it was a big draw in that building in like the 60s and 70s I guess so it's a bit of a historical it feels like wrestling pro wrestling's making of Renaissance it's like making a return yeah I think that there's a certain audience of a of a certain age gap that are age group that has come into flourishing in into the internet and other ways to which to go ahead and bring wrestling back up there and show that wrestling whether it's the biggest company like the WWE all the way to say you know number two would be New Japan and then there's all these independent companies all over the place so that some of them have quite a decent following is you know Billy Corgan from the Smashing Pumpkins huge wrestling fan he owns what is the company the nwa alliance yeah so he owns hardened NWA is NWA the rap group it's that - you mean that's what I hear what I hear NWA I'm sure there's some attitude in I'm sure nwa yeah speak about the rest of it but NWA was is I guess though it was it's a legendary sanctioning body and so it wasn't any one particular company but it was a sanctioning body that would then oversee certain titles and so if you're gonna be on this show at this time you're gonna defend the NWA championship the NWA Commission would get involved and and they had their specifications as to how the title matches would be run and whether or not you could lose by disqualification or not or if you could go over the top rope would be a DQ and little stuff like that who did kill her Kowalski wrestle for a killer Kowalski I couldn't tell you do you remember him I know the name but I don't really I mean it was cool famous trainer after the fact Oh was he yeah when I was in high school probably W a guy it was an endo yeah that's right do we talk about that with Billy I think we did he was like local cable when I was in high school is like killing territories he had like a claw grabbed his own wrist [Laughter] he's get his hand up the claw it's like there's some nostalgia to it that's one of the reasons why I feel like it's it's coming back it's like people who liked it as a kid are now as adults going back to it nostalgia that what the internet it's it's much easier to go out there and put product out right yeah so it makes it more easily disseminated to any audience who might want to see it especially with like you know shows that are abroad like there are some shows I'll go on in Germany and Austria that will get streamed and people get a hold of them they get to watch them so it's not like the tape trading days of the of yesteryear just Jim Ross woke you up with his barbecue sauce okay you know I know he's got some fucking killer barbecue he's got sauce he's got rubs he's got all kinds of men a whole menagerie of all your meat fixings is he a pitmaster is one of those dudes does he do the whole thing with the wood and I don't hickory chips yeah and then he's got his his white oak on the side Oh them guys maybe maybe I lost in my mind yeah yeah there's like two types of people that use like that barbecue there's people like me that you pellet grills which is like infallible you know I use one of those triggers sure it's easy you pour the palace in it does all the work for you but then there's a serious motherfuckers chop wood and dry it out and they've got the Colemans there are though those are the the ones that start with a w the weber grills that there's just nothing to it other than all those kettle grills yeah those are for amateurs bro the real serious dudes they get those side those side smokers oh sure they have like the main chamber and then you got a little wood box on the side where though the woods heating up and then the air goes through and it smokes from this that's those people that cooking like 225 they never let anything do I I throw stuff over over gas flames that's right I have no business having any any voice in the realm of barbecuing but it seems like something you'd be interested oh I love it you're a man who's into all things manly this is true and I like setting stuff on fire and then eating it but you still drive a manual transmission all around Los Angeles just drove one today fuck yeah man I just I've been driving around I just got it out of the shop a little while ago my I have a 75 formula Firebird but instead of doing the LS swap which everybody does and I understand why it's got a 455 Pontiac in it that we bored I had a bored 60 out it's got forged pistons I didn't go with forged rods I didn't need it I think because well no actually I did put fours rods and a forged pistons but iron heads dual quads will you look at that you know I don't know anything the goal was to just make maybe one horsepower per cubic inch but have well over 500 pound feet of torque that was the idea just and it's it's a automatic unfortunately yeah yeah center force with me and will gives me crap about that all why don't you just get it swapped out cuz I like just being able to drive it their whole Sun on the clutch pedal in there I'm more than down but you know how it needs paint it means interior done you know so that's a Burt Reynolds car right is that the you know that's a 77 okay you're 75 75 big headlights circular headlights still kind of a square round off rounded off square for the center Jamie I'll pull it up you can pull up 75 Firebird and the formula has the big Ram air scoops on it right right - right yeah that makes normal to come over the toe so dope there it is that's the Trans Am B and mines the formula oh look at that like that yellow one on the right or that gray one formula Oh so I've been driving that around quite a bit and Hotchkiss did all the suspension on it little it did the brakes it stops in a heartbeat that's a nice mellow exhaust that's one of the few cars that I like from 75 like it feel I feel like everything after 71 is real risky in a way I mean some of the the styling lines of these mid seventies cars I kind of like it in the obnoxiousness of it all but and you know when whatever you get with these as far as like so this car came with a 400 the one that I bought and it was like seven and a half to one compression so it's just a total dog people hey do burnouts I'm like I wish that was the year that I mean the years where the gas crunch was on and they started making these cars gas efficient right well are they attempted to in some way not to mention they would they started trying to incorporate smog elements to try and reduce the amount a small thing but they were just highly inefficient the we were going about it with the AI R stuff and different processes that were like things connected to the heads and it was just bad news yeah it was a rough time for America I know the rare the rare times that is right yeah one of the rare times it was a rough time for cars like from 71 to the 80s all through the 80s we just made dogshit cars made some real real real snoozers yeah Pontiac was one of the few that was putting together a decent looking car the Firebirds in the Trans Am and then of course Corvette Corvette still had some good-looking cars in the seventies they did and especially because they even with the low horsepower motors they still liked car so you can still get up there and hustle back to us yeah and then with even into like 77 78 you had the 6.6 liter the 400 or or the 403 I guess by that point in the Pontiacs right now chicks are turning off their fuckin radio in mass I don't know any chicks want to tune in to listen to what I had to say anyway come on bro you're Josh Barnett chicks want to hear what you have to say they want to learn the ways of men the ways of men yes they want to learn there's a lot of fake men surrounding it they're using signals you know I have a theory that so not that long ago I maybe just a handful years ago I finally got like a leather biker style jacket and the Fonz kind of yeah but and aurait every time you know what but every time I smack something electronic it doesn't work better so there yeah he had a magic touch but absolutely the ladies loved him yeah yeah keeps her dildos in shape but he all right so I got this jacket and I've always wanted one ever since I was a kid and I went to this store in New York because there was no there wasn't a location locally where I could just try the jackets on and I didn't want to buy an expensive jacket and have to send it but all this stuff so I was in New York went to the store found the jacket that fit me loved it bought it been wearing leather and living crap out of it taking it all kinds of places it's been in nasty black metal mosh pits with it on I've been all around the world with it I've been in far eastern Russia the leather jacket is made to tell a story eventually at the end of it right but people will go oh you know do you write up you ride a bike I'm like no the reason why I have this jacket is because of Mad Max and the road warrior because when I saw that and as a kid those jackets look badass and you know here's the bronze the the mfp running around and their falcons just tear and ass blowing shit up wearing these jackets I want a jacket like that but I started to notice that this jacket was everywhere everywhere everybody everybody was making a version of this jacket somehow or someway this biker style jacket guys are wearing it everywhere chicks are wearing it everywhere and then I'm like how that's a weird fashion trend I didn't really see that comment and then as I started to think about it more and more and more it seems like there is a attempt within society to try and present the image of toughness right so from haircuts to jackets to all these different kinds of things that everyone's trying to appear to be tough and badass all the time without but people aren't going out there necessarily risking it like they used to they're not they're not in generally taking on these jobs that are dangerous or even just people want to have muscle cars but they don't want to work on them they don't want to it's like by having the item it's somehow in implies some sort of character yes toughness some sort of rugged element to yourself like I'm a badass like you've done through it right but you don't want that jacket you're falling off your bike going 70 miles an hour and just rolling and dust yourself off and you'll see all the like like the 30 year old Hollywood e-type dudes with the manicured beards and all that on their Harley's that have all been you know turned into choppers and like no it's like a big show of toughness without because people aren't going out there and and living tough lives anymore is it toughness or as a coolness it's it's I think it's a coolness related to the idea of being tough right an attempt at authenticity correct and you know to use a term like masculinity right and even though a woman that's appearing to be tough I mean you would call it a masculine trait even though that doesn't mean that there being a man well she's putting out a signal right a chick that wears like a leather jacket and rides a bike she's putting out a signal like you better be a bad motherfucker if you want this bitch or I many girls previous could still apply to the ladder yeah sure but it's it's like you know I'm a bad motherfucker all right whatever whatever vibe you're trying to put out there and then you go and you're like well okay what what's bad motherfucker about you I don't take no shit yeah sure you do hey bro don't take me shit my agent calls me I tell him to fuck off I walked in I nailed that audition I even have any product in my hair I don't give a fuck you don't know me man I'm different it's just it's just a little it's a casual observation it's totally anecdotal but it just seems like people are attempting to try and it's like things I always tell people about looking at human history I go that the issues that we deal with the things that affect us are not new just in a lot of ways they're just more magnified there especially with social media social media I believe like the pics and praise on certain elements of our way of being our process and it and it heightens our responses to certain things but it also heightens what we see from these responses hmm because when somebody is let's say massively insecure so social media can really pray help play hell on that and make you feel more insecure especially if you're putting depending on where you're putting value on what you see or what is said about you or you know how you are necessarily if you're comparing yourself to others also when you respond to that in some way through your own social media be it by trying to take more grandiose photos or I don't know whatever sort of signaling of how into them to make up for that it shines even that much more to everybody else yeah so what you do get seen as much as you see what everybody else does and then you're given an option on how do you react to that well if you're not I mean these are the sort of you can go back into old books on philosophy and you know old historical texts insecurity is not going anywhere we're not any all that much more different from a thousand years of 2,000 years or 3,000 years and the way we react and respond to things than we are now it's just that all these things are amplified under the the elements of technology that are around us and how they can affect us and how much easier it is for that for those things to get to us you know radically amplified I mean I see people fighting with people on Instagram you know see people fighting with commenters yes you know someone post something and then other people shit on them and then they they take their posts and comment on that and and you gotta go if this is like hours of your day man and people just sniping at you for the clothes you're wearing or whatever it is something right and you know you could say well you know you've got the person who's got a who's turned their their social media to a very self-absorbed sort of platform that's a lot and that's a that's a lot and then even in amongst that it's like well I mean to a degree if it's your social media and you are the prime element within it you know of course it would be a bit self-absorbed yeah but I think there's more nuance to it than that and it's not just a pic on say you know the gals that are taking all the sexy selfies and all that kind of stuff there's the the dudes that do essentially the same equivalent and it's all in a you know often it could be in a response to drive attention towards themselves but what do you why do you want that attention in the first place and of course that's something you can't know until you know the person exactly well a lot of girls make a living off of it a hundred percent yeah there's a lot of girls that they do like sponsored tweets or sponsored Instagram posts and once again dudes are making a living off of Instagram that way first like that got famous like for girls it's like girls with big asses and there's one girl that I just started following her whole instagrams her ass I mean that's it man I was thinking it was a terrible thing to think but I was thinking if a dog ever came over a bit her ass she'd be out of work that's it it's fucked up she's have a an arcing spray of fucking gel shooting out of her eyes you should have Kevlar pants on everywhere she goes London I have what will you give me per cheek on insurance I mean she has a tremendous ass don't get me wrong but it's just weird when there's this like one here's my part that essentially defines your identity this it so does which which is weirder that grace ask them this this person with this fantastic monumental epic level ass is out there taking photos of it and putting it out there for people to see or that people not only continue to look at it but more flock to this this religious icon of an ass apparently yeah well it doesn't get old apparent it ever gets old no not for dudes I mean for girls is there like one but I guess it's ABS is it ABS like what is the one body part turn to Jamie Jamie yeah hey tell us about but on also it wouldn't be surprised that the women in terms of that that kind of shallow aspect of social media in that way could could make more impact out of it because even when you look at say all the men's mag all the women's Maggie's and all that kind of stuff like women want to look at hot women yeah right so women are even driven to look at hama where of course obviously driven to look at hot women well women know about filters too like oh this bitch is using filters look at her that is not what she looks like and then oh my god she looks like a cartoon face look at her face and then they're trying to find out what filter that was yeah that's a beauty filter what Cameron did she use yeah if if girls found out that there was like one camera that really did it there would be the every girl would use that one phone that has that one camp exactly okay they nailed it I guess they're all pretty good now but if there was like one standout phone that took better selfies mmm-hmm like that would be the one that they used oh it would be a marketing avalanche towards yeah right that demographic for sure like your your Bri R phone like if you have a phone then the camera on the back it's always more powerful than the selfie yes with a bigger lens and for chicks that's fucking bullshit like they need it the other way need like multiple lenses you can choose which one you need they're like I know what my friends look like I see them I want to see myself selfie sticks if there was dudes only dudes on the planet there'd be no selfie sticks that shit would have never been invented you don't think so if we found if it was only men and we found a guy with a selfie stick that would be the guy we fucked hold them down is this did you get injured is this a walking stick this is a portable baton in case you get attacked are you using that to take photos inside of a bear cave yeah cuz you're not about to go in you want to make sure what you know where the Grizzly is or you uh you know putting that thing around corners yeah that rabbit is yeah get it so what you doing cuz if not I got a problem with this my arms are sure fucking dudes with selfie sticks that is a dark thing there's something about it like holding it up I'm in front of it doesn't make any sense like why is it okay for me to take a selfie with a regular selfie lens mm-hmm but it's a problem if it dude as a selfie stick I don't know it just seems a bit obnoxious yeah perhaps well it seems that way I can't say that I have a reason why it makes sense make me you know hey maybe it's simply because we view it as something that or we see women do it more and so we think that a man is somehow doing something well it's likely I don't know if a man gets fillers in his face you ever see like a older dude who gets fillers in his face like bro I don't want to pull him aside come here I'm sure I have yeah you gotta go no just don't you're gonna be wrinkled this is just it you're 65 years old you gotta let it go let it go it's letting go on its own anyways but some some gals can kind of pull it off and you feel bad for them but they still look kind of pretty see a little you know personally myself I'm not really all that into the especially manipulating the face like that for anyone I just think that it's it's one the potential for it to go really badly real guys there and to it just I think that people you don't have to look perfect to be a beautiful person yeah yeah your person that I mean like your personality is at least as important as the way you look and if your personality is such that you need to shoot plastic in your face in order to feel good about yourself you know I've got to go oh like what what's happening there but below the surface it could be a indicator of something more serious that that no matter how much filler how nice it could look maybe there's still gonna be an issue per se so it's also one of those things just like anorexia or bodybuilders that can never get big enough where they have body dysmorphia people don't know what they really look like do you do you know about the Fibonacci sequence the numbers right yeah yes it's a the golden ratio it actually applies to facial features see if you can find something on that now there is one to see documentary on that right and at the time there was something about symmetry mm-hmm and Elizabeth Hurley when they made that thing was considered like one of the most beautiful women in the world by the sent by the mathematics of it all she's still I don't doubt it yeah that chicks like 88 years old she's still hot as fuck she's grokking it but there's something about the way your face is shaped you like a good example is my friend Ari Shaffir ari has a thin face and a long nose and it all works together like if he had my nose on his face it would be like hey the fuck's wrong with your face but the ratios of the width of his face in the length of his nose the size of his eyes all that stuff somehow or another syncs up so you're saying it's not the any one thing it's the sum of your part yes it's all those things go together and if one of them is off like say if your here is golden ratio on the face so if you are a black woman and you have white lips like a white woman's lips people like what the fuck is going on whistle right she's got a large nose or a wide nose and you know why grow this facial hair and hide my skinny little skinny lips completely slips you got Viking lips bro I've been told I've this is I've had some girls go man you're you're actually a way better kisser than I expected because you have it seems like you have no lips oh my god someone told Kylie Jenner and that's why she got facial stuff really not yeah I was reading that today this is what kind of a loser I am fifty year old man with children I fucking pay taxes I got a lot of shit to do meanwhile I'm reading some article about why Kylie Jenner decided to take all the filler out of her face it was a fucking article on my google feed and I was like what is this well they know they know what you're into I guess they do they've got your nag bitch they know that you're working some joggin well filler is a fairly recent thing in human history I'm not around earlier with it I mean I don't proclaim dude I don't even know what's in it what is filler well it's okay let's facial filler google that what's in facial filler sand jb weld pondo guerrilla comm yeah probably depending on what how high-grade it is or and there's the freshness levels like the gorilla club what does it feel like if they touch your face and you got some shit then it makes your cheeks pop some girls look like they got rocked like their cheeks injectable fillers for the face oh Jesus hydraulic hyaluronic acid now see collagen hyaluronic acid are both going to get absorbed into your system eventually yeah I think that's the the good part about it is that it's temporary and then if you just let your body raising scar depressions enhancing lips and replacing soft tissue volume loss through facial injections hmm enhancing lips huh but that's why it looks weird with girls when they have big fake lips because of the golden ratio your face doesn't it just doesn't work like go back to that article on the golden ratio of the face please and you'll see like they have a there's a whole mathematical sort of algorithm that they can use to short sort of explain what is in is not normal in the shape of your face hmm like look at what the first name Angelina Jolie remember that song the way there was a fucking song someone there was a saw goddamn it this is like 2002 something like it was a song was Angelina Jolie got some big-ass titties was that top 40 I'm not monks me and my stupid fucking friends it was it was a it was a funny song like to do to sang it that is that funny sober as well or really good question and you ask somebody else those are the years from from 2000 when I was doing fear fact is that it stating the obvious is that the name of this song yes big ass it's just so stupid from 2002 to somewhere around 2007 I think I was high every day pablor just like when I was so bored when I was doing Fear Factor the only way I enjoyed it I was why you guys fuck you're enjoying all eating pig anuses and people screaming about having a centipede on their head after a while I got bored desensitized to it it just didn't just can't watch general porn anymore right it's like if there's not a robot right in there you know having sex with a tiger while a midget films it clearly that stuff does happen right like there's a reason why people like gag porn is that rule 34 if there's not a point of it that it if there's if you can think of it there's a porn out there and 35 is if it doesn't exist it shall be made yeah that makes sense it's a fourteen thing not that I'm allowing all the time but well someone's got a an alt account there's something about like people getting desensitized that's fucking absolutely real and that's one of the reasons why like in times of war people are capable of doing more and more awful shit it's like you get desensitized you get normalized like people are very malleable you get accustomed to all sorts of things yes and some of those things don't necessarily stay forever they're they're subjective you know for that that time in that moment and plus you there is everything that's going around you and if if we're all in here and we're say we're drinking coffee and we think that this is the way to be and and then other for everyone else are out and around us like well they're all drink and energy drinks well the energy drinks are actually the best thing to do well now there's this other thing that you see that and perhaps and then that bleeds into what no let's do energy drinks instead yeah if you go from that you know let's drink and alcohol well maybe not well could ya I mean sure people just imitate their atmosphere evil show and and if someone else is you know God and war you know if they take one year your your teammates and then cut them to pieces and send them back to you then all of a sudden yeah you're gonna do the same then some you know reprisal yeah yeah I used to know dude who he was a Mormon and Mormons aren't allowed to drink coffee I thought you were gonna go somewhere else I knew he was a mormon east cup people two peas in the center no you didn't do anything I don't think well I mean Mormons they're just so friendly yeah there's something got to be going on underneath something there's a trigger that you gotta find it puts a hole in there they get a hole in their magic underwear and they're just that's it but I would fucking place down I offered him a cup of coffee he's like no I can't drink coffee and he had a fucking one of those huge monster energy seriously yeah he was drinking them all day long to the point where he was having like heart problems he's getting fucking heart palpitations he was drinking oh no it wasn't wasn't monsters it was rock stars I wonder which one has more caffeine if I know which one I think Rajdeep rock star has more caffeine than a monster monster is doable like I drink I'll drink it sugar-free monster during UFC broadcast sometimes I drink those during the the new Japan shows at 4 hours yeah but the problem is you got a piss yes whatever's in there goes right through your system I like that caffeine ain't helping goldberg used to drink those fucking things like they were water and he was always peeing both monster and rockstar have the same amount of caffeine per serving which is 880 milligrams per 8 ounces yeah but what a tease not that if you look at Wow that's crazy that's our list as being 240 Matt or something around there at the whole can and monster list as being 130 dude this is 270 whoa yeah these little bad boys are 2 7 goddammit Tate yeah he kind of made me jump out of his chair Kate's trying to take try to give people heart attacks shout out the tape Fletcher shout out the tape Fletcher and caveman coffee yeah there's a yeah well people are weird with Tran right like whatever the fuck happened the acid wash jeans I was thinking that the other day like people used to love acid wash jeans remember they walk around with jeans with all sports although I mean they're kind of making a bit of a comeback yeah it's like fanny packs yep and of the same you were ahead of the curve way ahead of curve I never left you're basically a late 80s pro wrestler Yeah right like old Hogan like Yeah right here ladies and gentlemen this bitch never left my side all leather never left my side this is real it was made from a bighorn sheep that you you tracked down and I we got with him with an arrow I wish I should get one made I've got these access deer hides out there I should get one turn into a fanny pack that'd be dope leave the fur on it fuck yeah right yeah hope you don't get any ticks no there's no I'll leave they have ticks in Hawaii but uh it's weird you know but that's the thing about paradigms is you don't really realize it's you know when the paradigm is over until you're out of it right and so we're in a paradigm now of some sort and and it's easy to get lost in that and not be able to see outside it what do you think is happening now that will be ridiculed in the future um tough I mean I didn't think that in a lot of ways we would end up to where we are at this point in so many of the social and cultural elements and that didn't even just specifically stay within the u.s. but seemed to be bleeding throughout all of Western society and civilization at large I got one word Yeezys Yeezys Yeezys will be mocked but that says that's a shoe right he loves those fucking things he bought me a pair I won't I told him next time I go running in the creeks I'm gonna wear them Jamie loves these goddamn things oh okay yeah I I'm not do they hit base so I'm trying to mom this is look at the foam thing in there bro come on nope Yeezy say that come on that looks like a sneaker from the 80s right I wouldn't even say that what would you say this by the way you're talking to a real man here that's okay they'd understand this hey I understand this is that just like the bottom of a fucking yeah see like Coleman coolers yeah yeah that's the bottom part like a glorified fucking water sock this is like the thing you see some some doofus with those frog skin things on his glasses to keep from falling off wandering around in the you know I don't want to get too wet so you wouldn't wear those no hmm weird how manly men I wear these that's right Chuck Taylor Ducks custom chucks fuck yeah with my logo on the side I was drawn by dampe notion look at that skulls and shit like this goddamn dirty stinky chucks I wear a black metal t-shirt fuck yeah look at that see though chucks goddamn classics Jamie not this what is this the fuck's going on here like you're just wearing Angelina Jolie's titties right big-ass holes yeah they look comfortable I could see JP and some disease what's up Jack you see JP and some Easy's JP yeah Jordan Peterson music oh yeah I could see him wearing some atrocious sandals you'd have to talk to him take those off with that yeah with like some wool socks on yeah some TVs Jamie now we're talking about this the other day you're allowed to wear socks with slides uh you know slides like so there's no right there's no tote you're how do says guys wear them all time fuck that noise the fuck is that about I don't know it's not allowed guys wear them all about keep your socks out of your sandals we were just in Vegas and there was some basketball thing going on okay there was a bunch of basketball players okay half of them okay okay ox here's the deal with that though in its I can at least say as an athlete maybe they've got the slides on because they're gonna take those slides out and put their basketball shoes right on so for them it's like I'm sure I'm out of uniform at the moment I'm but I'm ready to go to combat basketball wise at any moment I don't know but in general as far as a fashion trend fuck that noise but it's ridiculous amongst like rappers I see rappers wearing those things with socks it just looks like you just I don't know like you given up yeah kind of money just wear sweatpants all day too like you're a dude with a wife beater with your gut hanging out of the bottom of it and you just fucking kick back fuck it I don't I can't even bend over and tie my shoes yeah those can't even clasp the velcro on my Easy's yeah yeah they don't velcro well you know I guess I guess you don't need a real shoe if you throw on you walk out with your socks on you throw on your sliders and get on your hoverboard or fucking what your electric scooter and you mean would you ever drive a Tesla uh I would drive a Tesla but you know here's I got one of my beefs not with Tesla's per se in any way but I would say be talking about cars of somebody out and about and they'll have some conversation and I'll bring up some car or talking about something like the Dodge now wasn't the demon when the Hellcat came out and so like oh yeah those Hellcats I've heard amazing things about how not only is it obviously incredibly powerful and fast but that they're they're massively comfortable you could it's a GT car you could Grand Tour it all over the US and become for you the whole time and smooth ride and yeah and they're like oh but we know but what about the Tesla I'm like that's another forty to fifty thousand dollars more oh it's almost it it's just fast if not faster I go if I'm paying over a hundred fucking thousand dollars for a car get better be fast it better have all this shit like and I would talk about you know certain other and a lot of times like my Firebird doesn't cost that much dude I don't care if that Tesla wins you just spent a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on a car okay what if cost wasn't an option what if you were Elon Musk if I'm Elon Musk I'm more god I don't think he can not drive a Tesla if he's out there and and goddamn exhaust for 70 you know big-block Pontiac people are like what the fuck yeah he probably can't drive anything but Tesla right and oh what a trap yeah no I would rather I would rather drive a car I don't feel like electric cars have so they don't have any there's like nothing that doesn't like beep beep boop boop boop up in the little printer II comes out and I just doesn't do it for me well they're really cool but at the end of the day there's a problem the problem is it feels good to hear the rumble of an engine I mean to fucking put that clutch in and pop that gear what is that he launched two gas cars he owns a Jag that's an old-school jag that's a 60s it's probably a v12 actually those are amazing Wow oh it's a roaster okay so that top pops off wow that's that's a shape man what year was that he type oh oh yeah it's something lean 60s 60 70 yeah 67 that's a gorgeous car oh it's so pretty let me see that picture again scroll down oh look at that yeah but there's something about the sound of combustion engines just it's so magnetic tehsils are cool they're silent that I'm sure they're incredibly comfortable oh yeah and that pad the big ass iPad that you have where your navigation screen is amia is the shit well you're driving and that thing and you just ask it to play songs and it pulls them up on Spotify I'm also a little weirded out by the over electronic element of modern life I realized the usefulness of it but I always think about you know when some shit goes south like I can't just fix it and we keep going or if something goes bad it could go bad in a lot of different ways and there's a chain of command of bad that it's all linked to that it could go to as well and so I'm just like it just isn't the plus when you talk about engines all right you start up your Porsche start up you know a vette you start up an LS motor and then you started up next to a big-block Pontiac you started up next to a big-block Ford and everything has a different feel a different a different cam that's in it makes it sound different makes it operate different the exhaust it's not everything changes based on all kinds of different elements and so the car even though itself not just the exterior of it but the internals make it seem like a different vehicle yeah for sure like have you ever been around Ferrari not a ton no but I know they have they got this salad they had their own Aston Martin is famous for having it's a very specific exhaust you note there's sounds that they have it's like a celebration mmm it's like better not drive it too far because it's probably gonna break for the next 12 minutes this is fantastic nothing like it the way they sound like I used to love Top Gear with Jeremy Clarkson is a great show he's the best whoever he punched he said sorry yeah get over conscious lap it's what you were talking about earlier people are pusseh fied they're pusseh fied there they're playing tough they're doing a goddamn car show with a bunch of men drinking booze mmm you guys got in a fight and you got hit whoa take a little settlement or even just say hey let me hit you one back I wish I was there million people wanting to sort of live at parents house for the rest of their life except then it goes from being mom and dad to them being a state of some sort that does all your work for you because you don't want to have to take the responsibility of either winning or of losing that confrontation maybe well I think you just got punched well in general is a drunk asshole Wow maybe so but it's not Jeremy he could just go to me like I dude I'm gonna I get one on you yeah it's and it's even we're done I move on with my life right but what if the guy can fucking crack what's called a legit in the fucker man huh I shouldn't have fucking hit him yeah well that's the realm of people that don't practice martial arts like how many people get drunk and get in fistfights that actually know how to fight it's pretty small according to the internet it's real small they think it's I'm always amazed at people's overestimation of what they can do with their body especially in particular to pertains to animals like what you would do if an animal is coming at you like you know my favorite thing to watch is one of my favorite things are the last couple weeks I got a stop i watch fucking running with the Bulls oh man when is that Zen this fence actually this week I think I have a bunch of friends over there they're going to know call them call him tell him you love them hey let's let's uh let's get this two-ton animal I just don't think people understand a how strong those things are and be how shitty their body works people have this idea that come with me bro I'm gonna fucking just get out of the way I'll just sidestep it yeah meanwhile you're on these slick beer-soaked what is this Jamie this is the end of it right now that's the sixth of the fourteenth what's happening right now I can't believe it I've been watching videos I didn't know was actually live this is this is so fucking insane this is so insane people are so insane what if it gets a beat on you and then all of a sudden like I know you're the only one out of this entire crowd of 500 people right now that it wants to Gore oh yeah I mean if it finds one that sits still it's gonna take its frustrations out and the crazy thing is look how many people are there watching this they're watching these fools running around in the middle of this bull fight I want to see someone get fucked up by a bull have you ever watched a bull fight I have not I have seen plenty of you know clips footage of it what have you but I'm not watching bull fight yeah I'm not interested didn't didn't really do anything for me no I mean I I can up until the point of killing it like I okay you want to go out there and dodge a bull seems like a bad idea but all right but then you know all right you've already proven that you maneuver yourself out of the way no need to spirit and kill it yeah it also seems to me that I know it's tradition I know it comes from a different era I know I understand that so I'm not gonna sit here and then just like go railroading bullfighting of the Inquisition is tradition - well there's a lot of things pretty successful traditions it just seems to me to be a a bastardization of our relationship with animals like even I don't think there's anything wrong with domesticated animals but obviously factory farming is this disgusting foundation why do it I mean and there is no it's possible to have animals that are able to live a more natural way of life than it is to jam them into a cage and force-feed them and tell you don't know if it's possible to do it the way we've been doing it but we the real problem is the way we expect to be able to just go to Jack in the Box and get a burger well we too much meat yeah in general I think that your average person doesn't need to eat nearly as much fucking varieties of meat as they do they need they definitely need meat in their diet I believe on average do you know you know about the carnivore diet now see here's the thing I've been I heard you talking to Joe what you talked a lot about men Jordan Peterson and his his daughter well I talked about it with Chris Bell first who's been on it for I think he's been on it for at least six months or so and he's having radical improvements and one of the reasons that he's having improvements and then Jordans having tremendous results and Jordans daughter as well is arthritis mm-hmm they all have arthritis like Chris Bell has two metal artificial hips I don't doubt it trying to be that mark is smelly Oh Marcus smelly Chris is Chris's bore Chris Ward oh yeah and Chris is the one who produced bigger stronger faster I met Chris I met I've actually never met mark they're great chris is a fantastic always got as a backward baseball cap on yeah they're both fantastic guys and really really smart and just chris has suffered from serious debilitating arthritis and Pena's joins his whole life having a carnivore diet no knocked it out for him and and that's the only thing I was familiar with the ketogenic diet and all that kind of stuff and and having a higher it works for me as well to be honest to eat that way my problem is my love affair with fucking breads yeah you're out there getting a coffee maybe in the morning damn that looks like an amazing croissant right now you know how it looks even better in my face you like a chocolate croissant I do like chocolate croissants you know you always get the best ones mmm coffee bean those Starbucks ones can suck my dick you know what I don't I don't need I'm a Seattle guy but I don't need Starbucks croissants you don't know they're terrible they used to be okay they used to be pretty good you know when they went south and they started putting them in plastic bags they give them to you yeah they're already sealed up in a plastic bag bad mm-hmm no someone's at coffee bean have way more chocolate in them they're thick if you're gonna go deep go deep that's what I say I go to the the off you know the non chain coffee shops that will like coffee coffee and food and coffee commissaries down the street here a Russian bakery I hope you have these truck croissants Oh knock your dick right into the dirt and bet whoo thick rich and delicious yeah I'll do my grammar for them if I if I stick to eating and I'm in a more ketogenic way it's I feel better my joints hurt less I lose fat easier but I still can can put on muscle mass it's it is a better way for me to eat and I don't know if there is something about our genetic makeups I say meet you JP we probably have some crossover similarity there yeah I don't know if there's anything to do with that i I just know that it's been useful to me and I've seen it be you know that's the way you eat I've seen I've heard Jordan talk about his daughter and how useless been for her and and as you she's everyone I mean she's had her ankle replaced her hip replaced like an autoimmune thing yeah as does he it's the same same exact issue and an autoimmune issue is also what this radical arthritis is mm there's so many people have these issues and these are isolated incidences you know isolated issues that people have but you know I know people that thrive of vegetarian diets have no problem with it yeah vegetarian is the way to go for a lot of people that are thinking about being vegan don't be scared of eggs folks just get good for it eggs are great for you just everything all this fucking PETA propaganda where they call them chicken periods look if you don't want to kill animals I get it I get it I told it I love animals get free-range eggs you can get them at the fucking farmers market and they have a dark orange yolk and they're fucking great they're amazing and the chickens don't even notice they're gone they don't give a fuck no chickens gonna have eggs no matter what they just lay them unless there's a rooster so to to fertilize it they just kind of fucking lay eggs yeah it's just free food it's like a gift that they give you you don't chance I had six eggs this morning for breakfast incredible very thicker and heavier and it's actually good for you and of all things one of chickens one of their favorite little snacks it's something that they just absolutely love eggs yeah the chickens love scrambled eggs yeah you know what they really love they'll have shells to love the fucking show yeah an egg shell ya know what they love more than that mice mice lizards they officious little fuckers yeah but you know what they don't fuck with squirrels hmm well they're little big yeah but they just don't even try like the squirrels like a rat you know it's basically a rat everybody loves squirrels even chickens it's that bushy tail it's crazy that bushy tails all you needed that cute haircut is like just a little snap and a wank and yeah yeah well I had a I had four chickens and one time there was a little miniature Chihuahua a little chihuahua or a little mini dachshund maybe our mini mint it was a mint pin and it got into the yard and ended up in the backyard and the four chickens cornered it and wouldn't let it leave and so it's back there whining and yelping and eventually my ex at the time went and caught the dog and then tried to figure out whose it was and what have you and it turned out it was chipped I think and you got given somewhere where they someone could then track him down but it was just hilarious that these chickens are like fuck you motherfucker you're in the wrong place you know well so love squirrels my dog that's a different animal altogether yeah Marshall they hardly ever catch him enough he got that one it was like this sweet golden retriever this kind dog who loves everybody yeah he likes fucking up squirrels too well the problem is that squirrels go into the chicken coop they'll find a way in the chicken coop and they steal all the chickens yeah and Marshall just decided to wait outside the chicken coop because he knew where the hole was I just said mmm snatch that motherfucker girl and then he's just with the biggest she ate in green space yeah mrs. Rogan does not like the squirrels she doesn't like the squirrels getting into the chicken food to me I feel like we just buy more chicken food poor little squirrels yeah they're hustling it's hard life being a squirrel it is just kind of guy Audis you know Church trying to get by yeah trying to live your life they're out there they're all this peer pressure from all these other squirrels my first smokin young yeah they find this sweet spot where all these fucking nuts and and all this grain is like this is amazing yeah squirrel gang you know when they fucked up though start stealing eggs they stay steal eggs these cunts were trying to roll eggs out of the chicken coop that's when she got mad yeah I had no idea that squirrels ate eggs then we started finding videos online Jamie pulled up a bunch of videos of squirrels rolling chicken eggs out of a tree number two that either huh the motherfuckers we think we have egg boxes they're elevated egg boxes okay the egg boxes are like two and a half three feet off the ground mmm the squirrels got up into the egg box got the egg chucked it out of the egg box lands on the ground they're getting it and they're rolling the eggs look clever little fuckers sneaky and they're cute so they're like I can get away with anything they do get away with more yeah like rats must be like what in the fuck man versus Mars shit we you know we can do were way smarter yeah and yet people keep fucking on us just stab us left and right yeah there's no industry for squirrel killing like nah not really maybe in the deep south and that's not an industry out there they get their mortgages paid by killing rats like they're driving around in a nice car from killing rats Nolan and nobody cared nobody feels bad like oh I'm an exterminator we're all racists when it comes to certain animals and bugs right people collect butterflies nobody stomp roaches everybody stomps roaches and swats mosquitos yeah well I'm fucked mosquitos those things they will give you everything of all kinds of diseases in Shangai fever hilari at the only part of the mosquitos life I enjoy I think is interesting is when their larvae and their these fucking vicious little things with these giant hook teeth that will can't even eat little fish and all that kind of stuff in the ponds - when I first moved to California I've rented this house in Encino and nobody lived in it for like a year and a half two years something like that and they had a pool in the backyard that was just sitting there with trail-cam agreement there was schools of mosquito larvae swimming around like fish I went out into the yard I was like what the fuck is that and the guy was like I'll take care of that I go what is that how do you take care of that you poison machine do it yeah well the first thing you do is you bleach it then you got to drain it you gotta you got to take this scoop all that shit out yeah you got to drain all that water out they had to bring like a machine and then they had to clean all the fucking the bottom of the pool it was all green and funky but the crazy thing is they were moving through the water like you know I see those those big flocks of birds yes and they all moved yes they were doing that in the water there was fucking thousands of them it was crazy but then they didn't grow legs oh it would've been a real problem they got out and started flying around I would've got fucked up there's a meme out there and it's I think it's a it's a picture and it's repeated and on the bottom as well of a PETA billboard and it's got a you know these animals all sitting standing in a line and it says where do you draw the line between you and rude man or whatever and then someone else has and they've got that the same thing down there and it's like you know this is normal food there's a catastrophic apocalypse yeah I've seen that yeah well you know being a vegetarian or a vegan is a very it's a very first world option the reason why people it is got to this point is because we figured out a way to survive eating all the animals around us just like they figured out a way to survive eating the animals around now well I need the argument that oh this culture is mostly vegetarian Revere this or that and it's like okay well it's also highly developed on what was available yeah I didn't just say I don't want to hurt the animals well the only people that did is the Hindu yeah Hindus are fascinating you know and there's a lot of speculation as to Worcester Berkeley civilization yeah at certain points in time in comparison to the rest of the world oh yeah I mean you go back and read the bhagavad-gita I mean they had some really complex philosophy and really interesting thoughts about the universe but a lot of people believe that that was due to psychedelic drugs and what they yeah but well that one of the reasons why they believed they had this interesting relationship with cattle but not with lamb was because cattle shit would grow magic mushrooms on it this is huh because soma is a big part of ancient Hindu folklore and their religion and their ancient texts they talk about soma and soma was some sort of a psychedelic mixture and they don't know exactly what it was but they know that Hindus the like a lot of the ancient Hindu texts they deal with some sacraments and they know that they were into hash and like a lot of the Yogi's asad ooze they're into chil UM's they smokes chillings of hash so they knew they were into hash but they think that their aversion to eating cows may have had something to do with the fact that these cows would shit and then the mushrooms that grow throughout shit and there were shrooms and have these profound experiences right and so that these they thought of these cows as conduits to God right but there's you know also they probably drank the milk and you know they probably used them to plow the fields to grow their food so it's it's real it's interesting because when a culture has an aversion to eating it's a very specific animal and that specific animal also is the main source of psychedelic mushrooms to ignore that connection seems a little bit weird no I don't think it's arbitrary I think it's it's it's something that would be worth investigating right I mean why not and in worst case scenario you come down to you have to figure out of something else but look at Shiva like right you see that picture the cheapest arms six arms and Shiva standing on like a little it looks like a baby and I always have a giant bronze Shiva in my house and when I bought it the lady said this Shiva is standing on ignorance this is what it's supposed to be I go I thought ignorant would be way bigger than ignorant be like a drag and then Shiva was like fighting was much larger than him but when you that that thing that she was doing that's what happens when you trip your balls off okay if you trip balls and you were started moving your arms around I would think Josh Barnett's got six arms that I mean there's so much of ancient Hindu artwork that is I thought they were just fan in a bad fart Jesus that's what fire round is they're lighting matches but the like ancient Hindu art there's there's this iconography this like these iconic imagery this iconic imagery that you see when you do psychedelics you see a lot of this stuff particularly on mushrooms for some reason yeah you'll see like ancient Hindu and and sometimes ancient Egyptian shit too I know you know you can see you'll see geometric shapes yeah up here out of and you know to me I'm just like well that's just what you see when you're poisoned but it's a great it's an interesting way of looking at it but it's not poison that's about it it's it's a the way it's affecting the way your video processing it yeah perturbance of your visual cortex yeah but it's not poison that's the crazy thing is like the ld50 of mushrooms and almost impossible to eat yourself to death mmm like you'd have to eat your own bodyweight like you would get way to stuff put them inside those fucking croissants those chocolate croissants that's a term that has continued to go throughout yeah it's like a sleeping pill now that and then it was also a major element within Aldous Huxley's brave new world which and that was based on that probably so I'm firmly of a belief that what we're living in is not a Orwellian potential just stop dystopic future we're living in a Huck's version because Huxley and Orwell's both saw it from two different ways and and Orwell was more of the there would be force and violence and and direct suppression of individuals and groups and retrained now there is thought policing and and you know even though they call them equity diversity whatever departments I mean there are people that are there to you know they have these cabal's that that try to force everybody to be in line but it's you know they're not necessarily gassing folks or beating on them or what have your shock therapy however Huxley's version of how this would all go badly was that everybody would be so comfortable that there would be so much luxury and pleasure and that you would just not fight back yeah anything that they would try to impart upon you the way they would get you to do it is just make your life even softer and even easier yeah Huxley was right in that regard and also all there's so little danger in the world and so little real drama that we look for drama of course we look forward all over the place we've means the world's going on most of the world very very safe especially for at least for us in West in the first world nations there's something that Dave Rubin tweeted today see if you could find this it's real reason that the Star Wars I don't think the mayor of Durham apparently said something about Jordan Peterson that Jordan Peterson is not welcome in Durham North Carolina because of his transphobic and racist views what yeah what is he I can't read that man can make that a little larger what a fuckin misrepresented person Jordan Pederson has become just well it's gotta be late very strange we believe that Durham is a place for all of us black white asian Latin X oh I like how you let lots of X instead of Latino because if you say Latin X it's like latina Latino you get all the Latinas I'm not taking any chances indigenous and mixed-race trans and sis this isn't a real word you're getting crazy mayor gay and lesbian queer and straight this is thing queer doesn't cover all of it anymore it's not her uh I'm always confused by that it got a very open vague term I mean and maybe there is a and there may be there's some sort of accepted standard for what what defines queer about what about a sexual is that Alright how come he didn't put that in asexual people you should mark oh yeah now out now they're fucked attack the asexual activist lobbies coming for those who seek to expand or deny the humanity of others will find no comfort that's interesting that's always an interesting statement that people like to make deny the humanity like who said that you who's denying your humanity even even assholes right I mean even some of this is just a prick it's like they can't you're you just heard it and responded to it you're living the life that you want to live how can they deny your humanity well look at this we wish to emphasize that a person's right to free speech does not include the right to a platform or an audience well here's the thing you can't deny that people are listening to him and enjoy his work but if you're gonna make these broad statements you have to have some sort of evidence to back up what you're saying I know Jordan Peterson and he's definitely not a racist no he's definitely not transphobic or homophobic or any of those things he was against compelled speech Jesse Owens held speech state compelled speech meaning that there was a bunch of different words that they were forcing people to use that were these new gender pronouns and they were Jen Palin right and they have human rights councils in Canada and he is he's a mean he's a clinical psychologist and he's very well-read and he understands like Marxism and all the pit post-modernism neo Marxism and it's it's evolution from classical Marxism and how it's been influenced the difference between emphasizing this structure over the base yeah no it's just virtue saying like it's worse form I am a very very familiar with JP's work he actually sent me a copy of his book through Twitter oh that's amazing which was fantastic but the way I came across Jordan Peterson was that as a big fan of Nietzsche and his philosophical writings so I'd go on YouTube to see if I could find lectures on Nietzsche and in his maps of meaning lectures this is before any of the like the issues that bill c16 really I didn't know about any of that I was just listening to Jordan Peterson lectures because of him referencing and talking about Nietzsche so and then from Nietzsche to ASCII and all this and he would met and start to talk a lot about Marxism and communism and post-modernism in reference to each other in other ways and then then the c16 stuff and then I was living with the Marxist for a while so I started well you really yes oh Jesus yeah it was not fun so but at the same time I had to try to understand what the arguments that were being made and why and so you gotta go research them so if someone says oh the wage gap bla bla bla bla bla I'm like okay well I guess I need to look up the research on what that is then you come back and you go oh well that's actually not an apples for apples comparison and it's not 70 percents on the dollar and then you just go into it and then they just look at you and they go no thankful I read what's your source well this thing I read that source it doesn't talk about education level job for job hours work like it does it doesn't I mean no one's saying that the things couldn't be better yeah they just haven't heard this argument before when you hear about the wage gap that gender wage gap it's not this it's not people doing the same job that's what's right this is the best way to a lot of it's not people doing the same job and it's not people working the same hours the reason why men make more money as they do different jobs well now are those jobs more difficult for women to get is a real question some of them I imagine they are perhaps I mean I never doubt that there is a potential sexism sort of ISM to some degree in something sexism coming from both sides of the tracks sure the way there's something women want to be working on a fuckin oil rig right in the middle of or doing you know pipelines up in frozen South the North Dakota or something I mean they'd not that and how many of them are physically capable of doing them work - right which isn't a woman's fault at all and you can't I wouldn't hold it against anybody or and if they didn't if they did did not want to choose to do that kind of employment there's nothing wrong with that either no you know if a woman wanted to go off and make artisan soap right that mother fucker could make the best soap with essential oils that are the best for like you know how you use defense soap stuff I mean if that was a woman that came and created all that like that's a valuable respectable fantastic thing that they just it doesn't require physical strength anyway don't don't diminish the a compliment to someone else just because it doesn't fit what you think is well the problem is when we get into teams man I mean toxic tribalism is the real problem the real problem is people getting regimes whether it's male versus female and this mayor of Durham guaranteed a lot of stuff is weaponized so most of the stuff about the patriarchy which I'm also ingredients with Jordan Peterson you know that doesn't exist that's not the way the human history has has rolled out I don't buy that at all not the men or the wage gap these are weaponized things they use them in a weaponized way to try and destroy your your argument or your position or your way of being the it's a weapon they diminish your point of view by saying it's what's your white privilege talking something like a lot of white privilege to tonight I'm so why you're a big white guy very very white with a red beard dude yeah from the Pacific Northwest how much how much can you get anyway if I get any wider I'm gonna be wearing your fucking Birkenstocks with socks on you should have a ponytail and but it's it's a Willys are these terms are used in in conflict well and when why wouldn't they be because most of the the source material the creation of the these sort of ideological viewpoints are from postmodernist neo Marxism and and it's all based on concept of conflict theory so there's always going to be an oppressor and oppressed so if what you are doing is up is trying to argue with or even just make your case to someone who's an oppressor well it would be weaponized because as far as you're concerned everything they do is weaponized against you right so you've already chosen a confrontational position there's also a problem with people wanting to be right in life yeah that's human nature well I also like whether it's someone who's a postmodernist or someone who's a staunch conservative people go into any discussion with a presuppose or the have a preordained or a pre they have a collected group of ideas that they have attached themselves to and they do not want to let those go no and you have yours and I have mine it's very difficult for people to just talk and very difficult for people to this someone to lay out their their position and someone else to lay out their position and to people to like cordially discuss the merits of each position with an open mind it's it happens so rarely and it's something I try so hard to do and it's it's something that it took me years to cultivate the mindset to not not have these pre-existing conditions or pre-existing ideas or if I do have them don't attach myself to them and be what ready to abandon them at any moment under new evidence sure and it's you know if there's no problem and saying okay well I believe a and you believe B and we both believe them to be correct well tell me why I am why a is incorrect or better yet tell me why you believe what you believe right you know what are some reasons yeah and and let's find if those facts are real that's right and I used to you know I'd have these conversations with and this person used to that I was living with with I would say like we you just always have to be right I go no no I don't have to be right but if you're gonna make a claim you're gonna have to defend your argument I'll defend mine but ultimately I don't care if I'm wrong cuz being wrong only means that I could then perhaps work towards a way of being having the most understanding that I can have we as human beings are wrong so much more than we're ever right but by being wrong but by making mistakes it's like through martial arts by being on the mats and you know guy I'm gonna get this guy's ankle right now ah fuck that up ah fuck that up I got caught up fuck that up you can't get to the point to where you're like oh this is how you set it up this is the way that you can I wasn't securing the knee well enough so it was always sliding out of position I couldn't you know keep the leg framed in such a position where when I applied my hold the pressure went for the joint that I needed it to none of that happens until you make mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake and and there's nothing wrong with with before making a moving forward on something to sit back and to study a little bit and to try and understand somewhat of the landscape but eventually the only thing you can do is you've got to go right you know now that paralysis through analysis isn't gonna help you either well I lived a good portion of my life wanting to be right always sure and it's a toxic mindset it's terrible for you it's terrible for you because you don't grow and then you have to live and denial and then you have to always tell yourself that you were right and they were wrong even if you get you know out debated or even if you're faced with new evidence you try to ignore that new evidence I know the mindset I lived in it for many many to be in it's an easy place to be and you know not hard to go on it's hard to relax yourself yes and just realize that you are not facts you are not your ideas you're not your opinions you're you and if you attach yourself to these opinions these ideas like you're gonna it's a fucking trap like you have to know what like here's here's something I know for a fact this wood is hard and then I've hit this wood mutt with my knuckles that shit's hard if it dropped on you it would hurt these are undeniable facts and you there's a gang of those that you have in the world there's a gang of undeniable if that's why collaboration objectivity yeah whether or not Marxism can be successfully implemented in a large scale with a sensitive compassionate group of human beings that all live together who can it I don't know doesn't seem to be yeah well I don't know though see what I'm saying like this is uh this is a complet hasn't been done before socialism never really worked but can it work did the argument that it can't work it seems to me that doesn't make any sense either like maybe you could work well the argument that it could work is that but see what I'm saying like these are these are like we need to think a broad yeah complex nuanced concepts that need to be discussed up and down and back and forth and you also need to look at the weight of human history the myriad times its failed right and in just human history and even in ways that which is not directly related to say Marxism but just to look at patterns and trends and and and ways of people of operating and to see how okay well given a different circumstance how would that process work within this one or in this one or this one or this one and then even if you wanted to say well if you if you're like well I don't I don't think Marxism will work well but you can't say that until you actually study what Marxism is and what his principles are because if you don't understand the argument and this is like you know John John Stuart Mill you you can't just defend your side without knowledge of the other yes you have really no position to your position isn't any better than theirs yeah that's a really good point I mean I think everybody should do that no matter what you're looking at like whatever you're trying to defend looking even even if it's something horrible yeah and it's like a racist position find out why these people support this cuz they believe it right and so what why do they believe this racist position what is it about them that they think gives it validity and you can look at it and go I could see where they could take this way to its extreme and that that I mean that's nonsensical but you see where it started or you can see like that's everything about this is clearly driven by something else yeah and not the not what they claim so well it's also the one of the things about societies that we really have to take into consideration is the momentum of the past like there's this country has unique freedom to it because it was literally created by people who decided to get on a boat and risk traveling across the ocean to some new land yes it's a country filled with savages like crazy people that took wild chances and did wild things because of it and if you look at the history of this country that's clearly established by look at the art look at the music look at the things that have come out the comedy all these things that have been created the cars all the different things that have come out of this one place and this one place just happens to be the most recent place with the least amount of historical baggage yes but then you look at the places that have the most amount of historical baggage like Africa or you know some parts of Russia and like these are places that have the hardest time breaking out of these the weight of the cultural momentum of the past you know it's it's very difficult for people to to radically change an establish system that has existed for a thousand years well that's true and if you were to say think about you know communism and the Soviet states in the the length of what constitutes human history is has only been gone for it was only it was around for a short time and it's only been gone for an even shorter time and it's not come on Romney it's gone but it's still a dictatorship over there uh yeah I guess they're trying it's a bad Russia did you hear about that lady in Iran that she's going to jail the dancing years from York and dancing yeah oh no the Egyptian girl the girl the Lebanese girls going to jail for she she made a youtube video I'm not getting sexually harassed in Egypt okay so they sentenced her to eight years in prison she's 22 years old holy shit terrifying she's a twenty-two twenty-four somebody thought she's young and they sentenced her to eight fucking years these people here in America or Western the Western civilization at large just fucking they just put on the blinders about stuff like that like there are places and I'm not gonna you know demonize these places either but at the same time you as a 22 year old could may have a complaint and say hey I am like you know this thing happened and I'm this is fucked up and all of a sudden they can go huh you think that was fucked up boom and throw your ass in jail or have you executed or whatever I mean they it's like okay well I guess I don't have the right to express myself whereas you know people will show up and bang on doors and do all kinds of crazy shit it when Jordan Peterson comes and does a talk and the thing is they're allowed to they're allowed to protest what he has to say on her protest if they want or to express their their unhappiness with things political and things media why anybody can say what they want in terms of what makes them unhappy without fear of the government silencing you right that's a major thing it's a major thing and this poor girl in Iran she's just dancing I know people there always rail against Islam or Islamophobia there's so much Islamophobia in this world yeah sure there is you're right there is but you know what else there is there's also radical Islam and radical Islamic governments that are putting women in jail because they fucking dance religious right now religious zealot ring and while I have you know people will often get into a conversation about this and they'll bring up all about the Crusades or what about this I can hold on these are all relevant things - and while the Crusades are not nearly as cut and dry as you think they are in fact which to it ended in like the fourth crusade to two groups went down there and then end up fighting each other it's like you're both Christians yeah what the fuck you thinking but then you had things like the Inquisition you have you've had all kinds of stuff and it's like yeah no you you just that doesn't erase this and that doesn't it don't balance each other out as returns it's just left right and it's because it's one religion and not the other doesn't make it's the the the motivations are the same it kind of comes it comes from the same concept even if it's not technically the same religion well it reinforces it in my opinion I mean the idea that it's not the idea that Christianity is so amazing and Islam is so bad it's that ideologies force people into very terrible behavior can they can very very much and they often do yeah most of the time it goes bad when you have a powerful potent ideology that's right dominating a cultural imagine okay you had Christian zealotry and and let's say Islam and Christianity had swapped and Islam had all kinds of Reformation and different sects break off from it and all this and it become more like Christianity is in this modern era but Christianity stayed in a more less developed sense and had a more rigorous fervent zealotry in terms of adherence to doctrines or at least or even interpretations of doctrines and sir Old Testament stuff so but within this context of the modern era so now you have the Internet so any you let's say you know you only got like a million people in the world that feel this way but these million can all connect with each other via of social media very different electronic ways they can create weapon way they can weaponize things much easier they can coordinate they can it's it's not like the Crusades where you had to get money from a king and other government monarchs get together all these troops and get together all these supplies March them all down into the Middle East to where you've got the Turks waiting for you that they've done the same thing and then you guys all meet up on these different points of battle the you could literally be in at war all over the world all day every day all at the same time because of the modern advances of Technology and not to mention you have firearms you have explosive and chemicals and things you can use to your disposal drones they just or truck yeah right you didn't have you know six ton trucks in drive it out and take drive into a crowd that's just technology it's it helps it makes our lives better but in other ways it can also create calamity for us and it's really their tools you know social media is a tool I think the social media is if you were to track mass the mass shootings that have happened the rise of social media and the rise of mass shootings would be on a parallel I really think that it's social media that's increasing the amount that you see with the school shooting and things like that I think that because they get Fame from it they get Fame or you're able to antagonize someone and they can't get away from you Mormons much more easily the rosante mount using a Nietzschean term in terms of the resentment the resentfulness from seeing other people having what you think you deserve or or doing thinking that they they somehow are having more of what you think that you want that as well why do they get to have it and I don't or any number of reasons why you could be incredibly potently resentful and now you have this thing that's just in your life pumping all this kind of stuff at you all the time and I think that it can affect people in some really pathologically bad ways and now you have technology to also enact it and if it's not India and you can also easily make the argument if it's not a firearm it could be something else and and that doesn't make it any better but I think that the the rise of social media has been is a direct correlator it's AIT's a it's directly responsible for the rise in the school shootings directly responsible or directly correlates to it I think there's a correlation there I think is certainly there's a lot going on Society I think the big factor well there's a lot of factors people are alienated yes is terrible child rearing people have mental health issues yes people are medicated does the big one is now imagine all that with the the technology of social media able to height and some of the effects of some of these things or to create so someone that feels alienated imagine now not only do you feel alienated in the real world but then when you're on social media you one it's not a real you know what your body knows it's not the real world but you could be alienated out there too and that which alienates you there could still penetrate and get to you while you're out what you're away from it if people are fuckin with you at school or what have you then you're at home you're feeling alienated there and then this is continuing to fuck with you through social media yeah or other people are fucking with you on social media let's say you're playing your video games and people are talking shit cuz you keep getting shot and you know battlefield 5 or whatever and then all these things are just compound compounding and while no one knows I mean there's I'm sure you wouldn't necessarily know that if I say you know fuck you noob or something on some video game this person is essentially in real life being told fuck you every day all day feeling like the whole world thinks fuck you how would you know that but it could be then that person snaps or that person has a there they have a psychological issue that they're not I'm sure there's a bunch of factors there's a bunch of fact first of all does the ability to kill large groups of people yes which is unprecedented right the ability to use assault rifles and just fucking semi-automatic guns and go and kill large groups of people the the knowledge that if you do do that it'll make a huge splash and giant headlines and you'll be the infamous the the fact that a lot of these people are on disassociative so a lot of these people are on like serious psych medication yes that we really have only been studying the effects on human beings for the past couple decades there's there's not a whole lot of data on long-term use of these SSR for a 20 30 40 year act so you've got varying peoples of varying mental illnesses varying psychological pressures and stresses and life's that are just beyond fucked and then they have access to guns and they want people to hurt the way they're hurting there's a lot of them there's a lot of factors going on well and you know even if they illegally acquire the guns and they they still like I mean it doesn't matter but the in this case what the tool is per se but well you know what I don't think we're meant to understand I don't think we understand nor are we meant to live in large groups of people where we don't know the people around us that's another thing I think that is a really new situation for human beings well don't they overlook the historical significance of the population growths the the population density that has been gathering as these we dint we get into these these high-density civil as it civilized areas like cities these big cities and it changes everything and people are less likely to know that many like if you live in a town of 150 people you probably know 150 people if you live in a city of 5 million people you probably know 10 people you know you know people you work with you might know a couple friends you know unless you're like a really social person sure you probably have a way more limited number of people that you actually know then people that have a tight-knit small town and small community but you know those people are obviously in your business that's one thing fuckin what I know friends that live in small towns fuck man there's there's things that come with that too yes the busybodies a lot of debugging over the fence I think they had the anal sex last night oh Jesus is gonna punish his neck line and storm come on through you don't fuck speaking of blood fucking let's talk about you sada yeah without the lose yeah we were we started this podcast talking about what we talked about your your situation with Brendan Schaub and I had talked about your situation where you were you tested positive from a tainted supplement like legitimately that's a positive from attainted supplement you were cleared mm-hmm but this whole process was a goat rope yeah right it took a long time yes work out and you didn't feel overly treated not in the least it it started one way then took a fucking curve what happened well so did you take I took a supplement that had tribulus in it that's all it was just a Chinese herb it's a Chinese herb that stimulates testosterone and by the way barely works yeah it's not it's not it's not gonna turn you into Superman I think if you get more sleep it's better for your testosterone production than tribulus so it's just tribulus as all of us and they in it the the supplement itself as it turns out was contaminated with a SARM called austrane but when I say contaminated I mean like it had such trace amounts that the people that did the lab testing on it said well it's clearly just contamination cuz this wouldn't help you this wouldn't do anything for you and those let's explain how that happens a lot of these places I know this for a fact because I am one of the owners of on it on it is a third-party tested company where we get our stuff tested by an independent party to make sure there's nothing funky with them but we've had some issues in the past with stuff being in our with our earliest formulations of alpha brain and weren't supposed to be in there and what it comes from is you buy your ingredients from a company the company has these vats that they mix every day and they don't properly clean the vats and if they don't properly clean the bath you're buying some stuff from China mm-hmm who knows what they're chucking in there they got steroids in there they got this they got a lot of creatine is tainted with all sorts of shit a lot of different supplements are taint and that's what you thought I thought it could have been at first Tim means yes happened to yo al Romero yes so this stuff is is is contaminated right and so you sada was was testing me I had had a fight in September of 2016 against Arlovski and then after that I was like yo I'm just gonna take a break for a while I'm not fighting for I'm gonna tour Europe and goof off and whatever then when I get back uh you know I don't really I don't know what I'm gonna get back in the ring and like all right whatever and we UFC we told them and but you saw it would still come around and test and it's like okay fine whatever so this is post testing positive this is pre pre okay and so you fought our loss key and you said I'm just gonna chill for a while yeah and then you know one day well like for one when I'm out there in Europe and I let them know like hey I'm going fucking where the wind takes me in Europe and I don't have a whereabouts to fill in because I could be on a train moving here moving there whatever which is your prerogative right as a human being and they they know that and yet then they go ahead and send someone to my fucking house to try and test me while I'm in Europe I'm just going okay so don't isn't there like an app we fill as an app but I find that work you have you can fill out where you're supposed to be ahead of time for the most part so on Tuesday the 16th I'm gonna be at this place from this time to this time and then and then but what is your home base so if we don't go to these places and we'll just meet you at your home at some time let's say you just decide to go to Japan yeah do you have to tell them hey today I'm gonna take a train to Osaka today I'm gonna go to the mountains I'm so you have to give them a detailed itinerary every day every day okay and so I'm like fuck dude I'm just trying to be out here live just doing whatever I'm not fighting but you know when I get home you test me wherever you want you just wanted to enjoy a vacation just travel correct and they go they send someone to my house I was like fuck all right and then there are times where so what happens when they send someone to your house but you told them you weren't there well for one no one told the I don't know how what mechanical elements within their organization how that works but they sent someone there anyways I'm not there that could account does it count because did you tell them that you were gonna be on the road I we did so they still counted that as you not being there for a test yes well that doesn't make any fucking sense well it is what it is so but wait a minute if if they're gonna give you a strike like don't don't they have to follow their protocol and their protocol is you have to inform them aware you to be right if you did that you informed them more you gonna be yes my literally told Nowitzki and the UFC he's not gonna be home for almost a month and he's fucking practically backpacking all through Europe going from place to place to place so he's gonna be real hard to get a hold of good time take steroids yo yeah get just as fucking gear with that ring and come back smooth to the gills yeah you're passed out if they showed up in Europe you did give them your location and you told them where you are if they would but I was gone I didn't fill in any locations I just went wherever I went so when you went wherever you went and your manager told you solder that you were in Europe they still showed up your house in LA okay well that doesn't seem to make any sense and and they give you a strike yes hmm and so I'm like okay that's aggravating oh boy a strike when he was a try UFC yeah see what stuff and I saw that and I'm like you know what I just did I I can't fuck around with any of this stuff I don't want people to use this as some sort of in kindling to try and start a fire about me and so then I get back home and they're you know test me again like alright fine whatever and then they test me again and I'm like okay now you may just make me late to an audition as you just showed up out of nowhere cool so they can do that like they can just show up and you you can't say hey I have an appointment to keep they're there even if you are not fighting like say if you're running out the door and you have a business appointment how long has it take for them to test you it depends on what they're doing whether it's blood and urine or just urine it both me it's always been blood and urine so you can't say hey you guys gonna have to come with me because I got to go to this fucking audition yeah I don't know I didn't try that I would say that get in the car bitch how could we how you gonna sit there and have someone draw blood not going to you you guys are gonna have to do when I'm done look if you want to keep an eye on me come with me the whole way I always took it as they showed up it's like well here it goes that doesn't seem to make any sense if you have previous commitments and you have to do something they shouldn't have like ultimate precedent over your life like they shouldn't be able to just decide like showing up random that I suppose they could they can make an argument in some way on that but if you have a life well in any case so I take this test and I'm like all right I'm just gonna retire for now I got too much shit I gotta do I'm not fighting anytime soon I've got my new Japan stuff I've got auditions I've got all these things I'm travelling and I just I'm not gonna fight right so just leave me be and then I'm in Japan and the fucking the very last test I took right before retiring oh you're flagged I'm like you gotta be fucking kidding me really really all these tests over all these years me being the first person to do complete out-of-competition are in competition random urine and blood testing when I worked with wada and the Nevada State Athletic Commission when I fought Travis brown so no one had ever done actual random testing before and there was no you sada involved in the UFC yet going through why did you do that it was something that the NSAC wanted to see done and I'm like fine what I wanted to see that done because you had tested positive in the past right and so do you tested positive before in the past you've taken some stuff right I tested positive for anabolic sin the past well but I mean the supplement market used to be way wilder than it used to be well and also well anyway the just fighting was way wild writing was way while there the supplement industry was way Wilder it's like back in OT you could still buy all this shit over the counter that bio for got reclassify the steroids I remember I was taking this shit called mag 10 do you ever mag 10 what was the name of the company that makes that yes Incorporated I think cooperated that shit I should have all steroid shit with steroids it was steroids a hundred percent I remember magton he came like 10 pounds in six weeks on that shit you just get Jack but that was all over the counter yeah you used to be able to buy a lot of stuff and by the way liver toxicity is probably off the charts Rob there's a lot of those things that look super bad for ya but real effective they fucking it work this stuff worked but so you know there was a whole different era and then with for Nia you know I I had an issue with with a contaminant what I believe ultimately to be a contamination but I didn't take all the steps that I had this time and once that whole process was such a motherfuck like this is never gonna happen again so every supplement lot that I took I would always keep bits of it behind for until I need I could get I felt there was enough time it expired and get rid of it because no one's gonna come back and test me I passed all my tests so so once you passed your test you would get rid of the old right I don't need to keep those lots and you're supposed to take the only third-party verified well that's not what they say necessarily they suggested I guess now but I know that with this brand of tribulus I'd taken I'd take in three or four different other supplements in the same company and all past no problem on their times right so it was just some weird contamination which does happen again happening to me yes it's happened to several far as I can tell I mean I'm not testing their whole product line but it just seemed like a fluke and it's just such a simple supplement in any case a one ingredient deal so then they come back they're like all you tested positive for this I'm like well that ain't fuckin possible so then I send in some supplements which I had to pay for to have them tested they run them through the testing and then bang they find it all right there you go there's your deal then they went out and bought a brand new bottle unopened same lot tested that one verify the results same thing test same thing doesn't happen that Tim means as well so then he were in contact with you sada throughout the entirety of this so we don't ever break contact with you sada we have a specific guy I'm not gonna throw his name out there anything but we have a guy that we spoke to directly the whole time through my manager was speaking with him and I've seen the emails and so we're talking about how we know this is a contamination and when the in you know when we get done with all this why don't we even try to put together something some some promotional stuff anything that we can do to try and keep athletes from ending up in the same issues and we'd like to do whatever we could to help you guys out with this you know we're not against you or we don't mind being a part of the system and we understand why you're here and I'm not against them wanting to do drug testing or whatever and try to keep a a clean and fair playing field I get the point of it so we get the these supplements tested they test the secondary batch they have all their information it's like alright this should be she fucking rock and roll and then they got real quiet okay now you're not talking to us anymore what do you mean like you would contact them they wouldn't respond they would take him a week two weeks and what were they saying when they do respond uh you know I I can't entirely remember myself my manager was in touch with them so what is the protocol if someone tests positive for something that's a tainted supplement and it's a third-party supplement and where it's not it was not third-party verified rather well I don't even know if it was third-party verified that anything would be any different mmm okay well if it is third-party verified and still is tainted yeah that would be an issue right yeah if you tested positive you tested positive if they found the supplement yeah I think the idea about third-party verified is it's much less likely to be a toy it doesn't solve anything right and this is coming from someone who's in the supplement business you know you're a certain amount of this stuff you farm out so far as I know what the deal is there is a period of ineligibility sort of basically what what happens is you're effectively suspended until this thing is all finished out and they try to say that you're not suspended there's no suspension but that's not true well no one treats you as you're suspended I tried to corner Travis Brown because I was training him and they wouldn't let me it wouldn't let you the Horner mission would let me throw up yes okay a lot and they're like you're suspended so you can't you can't corner but you said you're not suspended she huh exactly okay so you're effectively suspended you can't work you can't even work as a a tertiary individual as a cornerman or anything like that it can't be at the event and this is after the fact where you brought them the supplements they independently verify that it was tainted yes and so then we start talking in the throughout the process I said look I'm not taking a punishment for contamination and I'm not even fighting I'm not fighting anytime soon I'm not you you can't like what you did with means and these other people you punished them you know that it was contamination but you punished them yeah they gave them many months yes of you know suspension so that they weren't able to compete or make a living during those marks right and I'm like no I'm not dealing I'm not taking that that's not acceptable because I'm not that's not what's going on here and nobody is doping nobody's trying to cheat the system right there is no I'm not even fighting you you don't get by punishing me you're trying to levy guilt on me you're trying to make me out to be some sort of you know guilty party as if I'm trying to be a cheat of some soreness like I'm not dealing I'm not taking so how did it ultimately get resolved well ultimately what ended up happening is we had to go to arbitration that was all it was really left to us because then they started trying to bring up stuff from my past and then weigh that against me as well and it's like whoa dude you guys weren't even around and now you get to decide to add to the to weight of whatever punishment you want to levy against me based on things that didn't involve you great so what were they talking about they're talking about 2001 no 2008 they went to 2008 yeah the election they tried to say well oh yeah well this happened so then therefore you know now they start talking about two years mm-hmm like you gotta be fucking kidding me they start talking about suspending you for two years tainted supplements yes Wow and I'm just going there's no way I wouldn't even expect six months you think I'm gonna take two years and so we go and we inquire on the Arbour and I've done I did an interview with the guy that we were dealing with through Skype we've we've been in touch it just like at some point everything turned and changed their tone changed their even the original penalties they were looking to levy increased new shit gets brought in it's it's like they became a completely different animal as soon as you know there was the evidence of contamination and that I wasn't gonna I wasn't willing to take punishment for it I wasn't what do you think their motivation is here I think that they and this is just my opinion I think the way you sada looks at it and it's an easy way to go about it is that the more people they ding the more effective they appear it's their effect their efficacy is based on Punnett on punishments doled out not necessarily think this is you know also remember Jason by the people that are working there so they arbitrarily get to decide how things go about right there's not like a very strict protocol that they might follow they're tainted supplements and for this no there is actually quite a bit of leverage or there's there is leeway in terms of how they can enforce and what they can enforce so when so it's subjective it's a very subjectivity in it they they have a lot of discretion there is some outlined elements of protocol but there is no it is always this or it is always that right and you know I didn't begrudge them for a period of ineligibility while you're going through the process of finding out whether this is contamination or what have you doing any testing and that makes sense to me that's fine I understand that if this guy supposedly has something in his system well let's figure out what it is and once we have a better idea then we can decide about whether you can go back into the pool or do this or do battery with you're gonna lever any punishments makes sense to me but in addition to that then tacking on more shit in terms of my case I was like that's not acceptable so we we go well I guess the only thing left to us is to go to arbitration and so my manager spoke with when was working through them to arbitration and we said ok well well what is that going to take well that's gonna cost more money out of my pocket you know the arbitration process these are guys that they're paid by you sada to do their arbitration like they work for them in a way or they're not they don't work under them directly but they are they do get paid to be arbitrated somehow there's some something so they get contracted by you Sadiq yes and yeah so that was like huh I don't necessarily feel the most comfortable with that but I don't I can also understand how it's not there's probably not an easier way to go about it okay I got it then when we then we get notice back from you sada that we have to limit the scope of our argument like whoa whoa what you you're gonna tell us what we can and can't argue in what way I don't remember what the definitions were exactly but it was like you can't you know you have to keep it within this boundary and this realm and this and I'm like but you can't fucking try to say the levy this against me and then you stuff from my past and then tell me I can't argue my full case so they're limiting the amount that you could defend yourself as a basis like they were limiting the the range of argument you could make what would the argument be that you would bring up that they would want to limit ah that's a good question I don't know exactly did they define that they know they had definitions in the emails with with back and forth with my manager and he goes will fuck we you know because we could argue about you know this is contamination and go from there but it was something really potentially limiting which was weird about how they put it you just don't remember what exact I don't remember all the detail oriented it's legalese and and then so we get to the point it's like well fuck well this doesn't even look like a very you know this might not even be a a useful way of trying to approach this thing and it got down to the wire to where and we kept pushing it back and pushing it back and in saying like you know we can we get an extension and and to try and figure out how the hell did we approach this and and also like how do how could we approach without having to spend money on having lawyers get involved I mean that's the last thing you want to do is get to litigation or you know even arbitration it's a legal process yeah complex and it is it's there's a lot of and lawyers love billable hours sure they do and so it gets down to the wire essentially and we I just sit back and I go I won't accept any ruling if it's a punishment at all I don't care what they say I'll just be like nah nah I don't I'm not gonna abide by it you can't force me to do shit and I guess we'll have to cross so your position is that if you are accidentally taking a tainted supplement and also trace amounts that have absolutely zero effect on performance yes there's nothing that you're doing by accidentally taking that that in any way would help you and that's a fact that's a proven fact yes so your position is you shouldn't be punished correct they and you're out of that your when once you the time that you've been out here's the thing that's enough exactly it's more than you don't need to say oh well if you if it took six if it took seven months to get the the information that you needed the data right so then clarify okay well you're not at fault to then say oh we'll suspend you for six months but since that six months has already passed it's like we didn't suspend you at all like no motherfucker when you look in the end of the hunt Bay at the data when you go and look at this case it says suspended which means you punished me which means I was guilty in some way you you said I'm guilty because that's how you got to punish me right it's not as under investigation or you know after this investigation yeah exonerated after that's no no you still levied a punishment in there to say that look how we caught this guy and we punished him and I'm like I'm not I'm not I'm not down for that and so oddly enough so I was like on Ariel's or something like that I said I I won't accept I don't care what they say I don't care what punishment they tried to levy I don't abide by it I won't agree to it and I'm done with them and someone from the arbiter the the arbitrator's office who we were dealing with calls us out of the blue and goes so you still sure you don't want to do this like well and my manager goes well they said that we have to limit the scope of argument to this and this and we can't talk and then he goes no you don't you can talk about you can you can bring any argument you want who is saying this to you the arbitrator's office and this so who would initially come to you and said the a dilute the scope your argument you sada okay so you sada was attempting to establish some boundaries for your arguments but the people who were the actual arbitrators said that that's not true right they that's not the case you know it doesn't they can't force you to argue in a certain okay so is it possible that you sought as lawyers we're trying to here's the thing I found about about lawyers like yeah for sure they're necessary and that's all well and good and you need them but there's a reality and this is something I had to deal with recently in doing something with a friend through lawyers where they attached a bunch of shit to this deal that wasn't supposed to be in there and he didn't even know it was in there and then my lawyer is like what the fuck is this and so I contact him what the fuck is this and he's like what the fuck is that so he contacts his lawyers what the fuck is this and it turns out this is a common thing lawyers what they do with each other yeah we put this in to give you leverage I don't think you necessarily want that but we're looking out for your best interests and so now you have a good negotiation point if you just go in with what you want then they're gonna ask for more than that and then you're not in a strong position because you can't ask for more after you've already established your initial position makes everything convoluted they're gross yes I hear you my that's the world we live my grandfather was a tedious world pretty pretty fair lawyer he was Assistant Attorney General of the state of Washington he actually wanted me to get into law of all things but I'm like no I think I'd rather beat out my brains yet seems like well you haven't beaten him out very impressive with your memory well so we we get to my manager comes back to me goes hey man they just contacted me out of nowhere and they're like if you want to do this you can and no you can't you can make the are you need there's no limiting in the scope of your argument any thing right so then it's like well yeah alright I'll go for it at least yeah except the very least I thought maybe I can have some sort of record down of what what we talked about what was discussed the arguments made so in the end you know no matter well how it came out I could go here's here's what's legitimate on decision from there and so we go in I brought my legal team they they had their lawyer come who was the same guy we were dealing with throughout the entire process and and they made you know their argument and we made ours and you know and there there are times when I'm sitting back and I go you know making they're making closing arguments the beach lawyers and I'm just sitting there listening to the sada side going man he's just pushing he's just moving the goalposts he's how so well it's just taking a certain element and then trying to you know you slippery slope arguments moving the goalposts on things he's just doing anything he can to use rhetoric instead of logos at this point because you know they're lawyers and they're trying to make their case in trying to find impassioned responses when you're saying this you know consider the people who listen at home don't really know your case don't know this go well okay so it's like trying to say that you know find ways at which to move the goalposts in terms of so what like I said to you earlier I keep batches of all the supplements that I take especially when I'm in these this program and especially after dealing with the the clusterfuck that was California and it's like well I didn't have anything that I could bring to you that I could fuck well you know so I'm like this is never happening again so I keep everything they go and they test stuff and they find it and I kept notes I kept this and it's like how what more could I have done for you guys even if it doesn't matter if there's let's say well they were all third-party tested as well I would still keep batches of the supplements and any of the stuff I take every party so what was the issue then well it's just simply it's just they kept trying to say that I didn't do a good enough job that did you use the did you see this thing on supplement form one one it's like that came out after the fact and yes I have seen that in fact I use all the resources you provided your globo drove your other supplement for one one to check against ingredient lists supplement names company names to make sure none of this shit is on the list so that I don't make that mistake so I use the resources that you give me I keep batches of my my supplements so they can be tested if need be I do what's available to keep from any issues and yet they just kept moving the goalposts on that and trying to say that well but you didn't you didn't hire a psychic you know it's just that kind of shit I'm like well how how can this have been any better and not to mention I'm not fighting right so at the end of the day what were they looking for in our they wanted to levy a punishment against me and suspend me for years and this is you Sodom yes so you saw ultimately even though they knew that you took a tainted supplement yes it had no effect whatsoever on your performance right they still wanted to punish you for years that seems stupid that just seems stupid now let me let me read Jeff Novitzky because Nowitzki texted me because I told him this was gonna go down and his take is a little bit different than yours I don't imagine it isn't alright I'm not surprised that it is and I I told you what it was this is I'll just read you what it says he said he'll complain about the amount of time that went by with you saw the process but he notified us of retirement right after the positive sample was collected before positive was announced so he was off in the wind for many months and not communicating with you sada big reason the case took so long to resolve to his positive was from a tainted supplement but he didn't do the number one thing we advised COC athletes on UFC athletes on supplements he didn't choose a supplement that was third party certified as a banned substance free like on its supplements are there are literally hundreds of certified supplements out there and virtually and virtually ensures no issues to foreign athlete if they stick with those one other point for Barnett when he was unresponsive to case he missed all of his deadlines to file for arbitration he came to the table later and said he wanted to go to arbitration you saw to made an exclusion and let him which ultimately led to his favorable ruling by arbitrator their reasoning was that they wanted to rule in favor of fairness to athlete rules say they didn't have to after time to file expired well but they're saying you it ruled favorably towards you ultimately yes the other day yes they like all those in our favor Bobby says that oh well he retired and he was in the wind you know what my in the wind was it wasn't even that long I was in Japan for Rison with my athlete ELISA Garcia mhm but in the fucking wind sounds good though yeah the win in the wind fucking you in that motorcycle jacket just drivin yeah I'm dragging a cop in behind me like Django yeah the Nevada desert somebody pulls you over got eight days growth in your face you Josh Barnett some days were you sada we're looking for the broken eye you pissing this cup for me I've didn't break up just yeah I was in Japan at Rison you know I wasn't in the wind and they was in your favour they arbitrary arbitrator and what they say this is the same guy the arbitrator is the same guy that put together is he's an Icarus he produced Icarus the movie on the lawn doping he is he's one of the major figures in terms of the world of anti-doping so it's one of the guys who worked with Brian Fogle the arbitrator as Brian focalize who starred in Icarus this guy is a term for water actually why am I doing this so this guy has the end everything in terms of drug testing there was no favor yes and he said hey does he couldn't see any way that I could have done hardly a better job that I was meticulous with my record-keeping that I'm a I did essentially anything I could got it was so in the means of a normal person to do how was it resolved at the end it was a the last of reprimand that's it reprimand yeah what is that what do they do Richard H average of McLaren clarin yeah oct.4 betrayed er yes okay so at the end of the day after all this they say they gave you a reprimand what does that mean that just means like don't do that be careful yeah okay thanks a and but this took with no punishment right and so all that two years shit from you sada was unwarranted right and heavy-handed heavy-handed as hell and an Junior dos Santos went through that started at six months and then by the time we they have both supplements tested then all of a sudden it starts getting weird and you know this claim by a whiskey that we were out of know we were always in touch Nowitzki doesn't work for you sod I know and this is so it what's kind of funny is Nowitzki is such a public face on this kind of thing but when it comes to actually dealing with you sada he's all he's hands up I mean he'll come and he'll he'll make sure to put something out there and any of the sphere but in reality he ain't got a fucking thing to do with any of okay but in his defense he's a UFC employee I know and it's inappropriate for him to have any influence whatsoever on the way they rule things that but that's that is that is I I think that's actually the proper thing for him to do in a way but I mean it's just it's a it's a it's it the presentation is a bit of a misnomer I think so well initially he was responsible for the drug testing now he's what is he the president of athletes safety and wellness fuckin they're running the performance Institute I mean what they're what they're concentrating on now but I'm just saying for Jeff in his raft that I think they're concentrating more on encouraging fighters to train and and and fortify their body with nutrition correctly and giving them education on how to do this and the Jeff is at the forefront of that stuff and showing them how to avoid accidentally taking something well I guess where I'm coming with this is that he is not fully in the loop with what happened between me and you Sadiq because he's not involved right so some of some of what he's saying there is incorrect and it's not I don't blame him because he's not a part of it so is he misinformed at the police think that they they're not being straight for with it sounds to me like they wanted to punish you badly they wanted to punish me bad yeah two years is a fucking crazy punishment and also when when people get did you remember when Nick Diaz was was being interviewed by all these people and then there was that mean lady who works the Nevada yeah but a commissioner she was grilling him and I'm like we're talking about pot here yeah easy lady like what in the fuck are you doing you're acting like you've robbed a bank right if not if he's not getting in the ring hi and leaving alone exactly and I think you probably did a few times I think in the Gomi fight he might have been higher it's like bro I'm bleeding oh my god maybe I should choke him right now he didn't give a shit yeah John Jones is going through this right now I don't know where John Jones stands but it's been pretty well established that at the very least what the the numbers if you look at the numbers when he was tested and you know I know a lot of people like to say that he's a cheater there's a lot of this going on right now but real clear the first test was proven that he took tainted dick pills okay yeah that's it was a actually so that got brought up to my attention as part of all this because you know you saw a felon it relevant the difference between that first one let's say and I'm not I don't know about the second shit with John I don't really follow close on this but this came across my plate because he had he was taking like a liquid cialis and it was from a company that sells psalms and peptides and all that she so it was a company that also sells banned substances right and so their argument was that dude you're buying or using shit from a place full of illegal shit and you're not supposed to take definitely a dumb move definitely yeah goddamn prescription for cialis right you don't need to take this imagine the second one what he took had such a minuscule trace amount that he tested negative Danny tested positive sure then he tested negative again and this is something that's supposed to stay in your system for months right so this is indicative of someone who's not taking something to get into performance enhancer and benefit from it but rather someone who had something that was tainted and these lab technicians are smart on this shit like the guy who saw the results from the the first little batch of supplements we gave me he he had seen everything and then some under the Sun and all different levels and this guy knew what what constituted contamination about wasn't he could tell right of course they can tell just by the numbers look if you're taking trace amounts of anything it's not gonna do a damn thing to your body in terms of performance-enhancing but it is gonna show up in these tests cuz the tests are incredibly thorough hey Jamie what's going on with John Jones case because particularly after this weekend it's very very relevant you know I mean with Brock Lesnar getting in there with DC yeah becoming the first light heavyweight to consecutively hold the light heavyweight championship and the heavyweight championship you know and spectacular fight by DC but John Jones is always gonna be sure I mean there you cannot you can go on and on about the the extracurricular woes of John Jones sure his capabilities as an athlete his talent is it's undeniable undeniable yeah look whatever the fuck he took dick pills where it's not making him a better fighter he didn't knock DC out because it dick pills that's not rays II know it has to do it's great skill and beautiful left high kick that's what it was and he recognized a tendency you know if DC knows he has you know but with this whole you SATA process it just became and it drug on because you know we said to them I'm not gonna take a punishment and they said we won't we're not giving you any option on this and so that's it's like there was a negotiation what what happens what I want one of the things that I've talked about when it comes to police officers is that when you have police officers and you have people they're trying to arrest it becomes a game and I don't mean a game in terms of it's bullshit I mean it's a game in terms of one person's trying to win and they're trying to get people in a room and this is why people plant guns right and plant drugs I need to win trying to win and that's what killed me was that - in my opinion you sada was trying to win yeah it was more important for them to win than it was for us to have a clean sport this comes back to what we're talking about earlier when it comes to arguments and discussions and then people oftentimes are not really searching for the truth they just want to be right yes and I've had this argument about bureaucracies in general right and this goes to this isn't just about you know not you sada in their bureaucratic elements I mean they're tight like the government or other things so you come and you say all you fucked up and then the bureaucracies go shit we didn't fuck up and they're gonna say we didn't fuck up to the very they'll take that to the very longest lever until either a they'll scapegoat someone or be they can figure out a way that they didn't because looking making a mistake on a bureaucratic level makes it seem like okay we'll fuck if we and here's the thing if you sada says oh you know you're not you didn't you're not gonna get punished then Tim means in Yoel Romero go uh why did I get poached or if they if you shot her to say oh well you know that was a miss that was a mistake well if that was a mistake well then hey well I got fucked on that mistake gonna take care of me so no drug testing is bad but too much oversight is also bad I think that clean sport is is a-okay and the ideas are random testing and all is fine but you can't do it at the expense of the athletes in that we're in the administration of the testing that you're trying to blast them like these three brazilian guys that just got busted over contamination that they traced back to a compounding pharmacy autozone when things this is just recent three different guys in the UFC and they were all getting supplements from a compounding pharmacy and everything was traced back to it it almost seems like you shouldn't take any fucking supplements well that's the other thing it's like you'll do we are we not allowed to take anything anything at all nothing there's no on it what are supplements what do they do they help your performance yeah you know I mean should you take no performance and answer so should we take nothing should just eat food I mean there's got to be someone out there well there's food that will enhance your performance - right like kangaroo meat the Frank Mir took you take some bad kangaroo meat oh man that kangaroo meat I could get a good pump on that first of all ain't nobody giving steroids to cameras okay kangaroos are fucking everywhere investigation identifies compounding pharmacies the source of tainted supplements behind three positive Almeida and Antonio and yeah Minotaur oh and here's the weird thing so it comes all the way down to it and then they're their highlight on this is and you know they've a week we put gave him a suspension that but at the time has already lapped so they won't actually have to serve any time it's like but you just fucking suspended them nonetheless yeah you didn't have to do that right so you they took seven or eight months or whatever for this get cleared up and that's unfortunate Junior positive for a diuretic is that correct that's what it was we hydrochloric which is crazy because he's a fucking heavyweight and juniors down on the high side of heavyweight it's not like a 265 guy that's kind of weight to make the upper limit use those wrinkles on his face try to look good baby that's right does diuretics make you look good look I don't know show herself it just pulls all the bones Jones keep in mind life is a journey not a race and God's will for me to be there blah blah blah blah right let's not forget I'm still the youngest guy in the top five a heavyweight and light everywhere yeah uh-huh he's young no what is that what is unique Mazique what is that someone's account Oh was he responding to somebody he tweeted that a couple hours ago up to a four years okay right now he remains a provisional suspension awaiting the outcome of the situation with you sada after testing positive for steroids last July following the knockout win over Cormier was a steroid uh man I couldn't tell you John faces up to four year suspension due to second violation UFC's anti-doping Powys policy obviously a young side every champion but obviously first of all when it says second violation the first violation was proven to be something tainted so it's and he's not when you say violation I want I want to hear this guy took steroids he took steroids because he was trying to get a performance-enhancing result from it suspend that guy yeah I don't want to hear oh you got toothpaste it's from China and had fucking something in it you remember that too don't you wasn't had a fucking crazy story about the toothpaste that had some poison in it or something that they were selling to China yeah what was that some wild shit it was a toothpaste in China that wasn't it yeah I'm vaguely remembering this I just said it just because it sounds stupid but it's really yeah you just made it up yeah and all of a sudden it's true it's probably in the back of my memory space it's made in China found us sure fresh sure fresh sure fright that's like some people that don't really understand English sure what does that mean I don't know sure good very good sure she'll fresh I think it's a Chinese romanization dollar store in Maine they're trying to kill people in name oh yeah it's green up there 84 yeah what is it what was in it antifreeze okay cool yeah cool it's Maine look at how cold it gets up there why wouldn't you need any these people I know that they were doing a good job I wanted teeth falling out yeah little propylene glycol oh I'm a hundred percent for testing I'm a hundred percent for them stopping people from taking performance-enhancing drugs but this sounds very heavy-handed it was just and I'm I had no problem with the system and then this the way it unfolded to me was just like this is I don't I don't need to be fighting multiple fronts what I'm just trying to do everything I can just this day as in this as an athlete now when you first started I mean you won the UFC heavyweight title in 2001 to at 24 years old yeah young sever um when you won that man everybody was on some shit it was just it was the beginning of the cleanup right everywhere and and even then going into the Nevada State Athletic Commission previous to that before Zuffa bought the UFC the idea of having giant fights in Vegas was fucking a win it was a dare but not a possibility no there's not gonna happen so and even then like the testing back in 2002 that wasn't official per se dude it was like he was like he was astir over him when he fought Brock Lesnar fuck mm - yeah how about when we saw the ream when he was when he was Marine when he was a Marine when he fought Brock Lesnar jesus fucking christ damn comic book-y if I mean there is not a goddamn drug testing agent alive that would have been grabbing he's clearly over 9,000 onto that guy like do you get the picture of him on the scale me that pictures amazing look at both of them yeah they're both boxes man but that one hold him down everybody would have been like hang on hang on what would a needle even lock could you even get a needle in his vein dude he's just like pings Ben he was so jacked this part of me just wishes he would leave and go to Japan and go right back to it you know just fill him up I mean look everybody knew what the fuck it was back then I mean it's interesting like Brock Lesnar being back Brock Lesnar is not asking for over him over him was the last guy to really fuck him up he wants to fight DC over he was just not the same guy anymore no he's not he does not perform at the same level as either still very good he's still very dangerous here's the thing even when he was a 205 pounder right and he had a tendency to gas out gas out and get you know be Chinee to a degree bow he was always super technical mm-hmm highly skilled like I don't think you could Overeem him and his brother both are actually very good fighters yeah and you know their struggles have never been a physical one for the most part I think you know they've had and that's a difficulty that that is most common among fighters is the mental game of it well we saw that with in Ghana this week yeah we see the fight but I heard it was one for the ages it was one for the ages someone who'd let some lions loosen that thing and just like okay let's crank this up a bit it was the worst heavyweight fight I've ever seen it was the worst you name I came to it came down to these it was the second lowest output fight ever so they couldn't even make it the lowest output fight to me number one I didn't get to number one number one they failed it failing Jen's Pulver versus Joe Hoch from like fucking UFC 13 or something I don't know what day that fight was but that fight was number one with 23 or 22 strikes landed in three rounds and this fight was number two with 23 strikes landed that's weird dude it was insane and then ovary I mean Francis go to Francis and ganas Instagram he released a statement today and his statement was essentially that he was over he carried the fear he said I'm not proud of my last performance I have carried fear from the last fight to this one I completely understand the frustration anger that it's caused my fans coaches teammates and family and friends we heard that he would have fear from the last fight we got fucking owned we can wrestle but he didn't know he thought he was the man and then he got owned and I won't but he's letting everyone down again all I can do now is prove myself and make you proud again but look at this picture that he puts up yeah swinging on him connect the one punch yeah I mean that's kind of funny it should have been him with his head down Francis in the future if you're gonna if you're gonna post a humble shot look humble yeah this is like I'm him I can't say that that he doesn't legitimately maybe he is carrying some kind of fear from the last fight in terms of losing the result or there's a lot of mindfuck that can go into being a fighter and yeah but we think you've bounced back you've been on both sides and you know the first fight back after a KO loss or after getting dominated what is that feeling like that's good yeah I don't know I've been at this ship for so long for me it's just like alright that was then this is now don't make the same mistakes you've experienced everything you've been submitted you've been knocked out you've knocked guys out you submitted guys you've won the title you beat some of the best guys of the world you've had fantastic performances you'd have performances that frustrated you you've experienced it all yeah you've got I mean in your long career I mean from being the youngest ever heavyweight champion of the world ever to how old you now 44 team dude you fucking seen at all you've literally seen it all how long do you think you can do I don't know but I'm planning to run it out you do I also have a lot more in Japan bro going I also have this bad car habit that need cash yeah yeah you know 455 Pontiacs don't get built and put in 275 Trans Am Firebirds for free well sometimes they do if you have the time like you think how you gonna work on your car when you're off all over the world doing all this shit right doing seminars and doing pro wrestling commentator all my fighters I had two guys just fight to last this Friday at cxf in Burbank one of them defended his title AJ Bryant the other one show him moto on his foot and for people who don't know that's not lucrative to train fighters I mean at the very highest level it's barely lucrative barely yeah I'm not this isn't a money thing this is a passion project this is what he's training guys out of what gym I the UFC gym in La Mirada let's use it for a fantastic feat and we get use of all 55,000 square feet oh that's nice we also work a lot with Chad George has a gym called C MMA and we'll send we'll go down there to nice good camaraderie between where's la mirada where's that a like northern Orange County okay I would say yeah is it like what's like northern aren't it what's the border of Orange County it's it's like at that border it's either southern most LA County or northern most Orange County it's that kind of thing yeah those UFC gyms are fucking badass they are a great job super nice and plus they've been an opportunity for fighters I think cub and Bisping also have stakes in some you know Vijay does as well I believe Frankie Edgar does Frankie has won in Toms River yeah there's a there's quite a few of them now I mean they're all over the place yeah if you're looking for a place to hit the heavy bag and workout and lift weights some martial arts classes they all have cages and mats and all that and so we we use those facilities they've been really great to us and yeah with these these kids that I work with and they are pretty much kids it's just about trying to help people achieve you know work towards the things that they want as an athlete but also they're good people that I want to see them make the most out of their life mmm yeah so I'm trying to be a person that can be a positive influence in terms of you know bringing philosophy and ethics to their life and helping them be good people and to pass that kind of shit on be the ripple in the water that the drop in the water that sends ripples out that makes a positive effect on other folks bro you a poet what the fuck I don't know Broads some shit just comes to me man you should put that on an Instagram picture and show your but that's what a lot of those girls do I don't show a butt and then they have like something about you know don't like negativity into your life because the ripples of that negativity can affect the people around you and you don't want that stay positive look at my house pull up on them undies look at that peach I think that UFC gym is a brilliant thing so brilliant move you know because if I'm like if I see 24-hour fitness is right next to UFC gym like oh fucking heavy bags everything what the fights are on TV yes put that on they also at least the one in La Mirada has like a whole little section that has astroturf down and all that a little with ladders that have been painted into it so you can do foot drills oh nice they've got sleds and tires and shit you mean so you can do other non-conventional workouts kettlebells so they haven't really like a real strengthen condition yes yes I mean you can do really anything they have a whole to set up of TRX is and shit like that shit yeah that's badass yeah that's I mean that's what you want from a gym you go to a lot of gyms they just don't have that kind of stuff you know they have your standard stuff you know machines and lifts with it's just not not quite good enough I agree and so this gives you that that full spectrum to to work in whatever ways you want to just about would you be interested in open owning your own gym sometime I think about it I do I wouldn't mind having my own gym but it's just it's such a I don't want to burden isn't the right word but there's just a lot of responsibility with it you know the overhead of having a place and creating a program and having people manage and run those programs yeah and with me being as busy as I am I wouldn't want to do anything half-ass and I also don't want to commit to something and then not be able to put into it what I think is necessary you obviously love teaching I do I do love to teach yeah I like for me it was such a big thing in my life the people not just in terms of athletics but the people that mentored me and helped to mold and shape me and help give me the tools and sometimes the kick in the ass is needed to move me along in life to get me to where I am today to get me not just in terms of you know what what you would argue for is successful or not but just to be the person that I am and while far from perfect you know I can't I can't think about exchanging bad moments for different moments in my life for the fear of that I wouldn't be Who I am today right you know Nietzsche talks about eternal recurrence and one of the idea of that is is that and your loneliness of loneliness of a demon showed up and it said you're gonna live your life in every way as you ever have in every single aspect of it it's like well you have to you have to be okay with that you have to live a life that that that's that's reasonable that you would be fine with doing it all over again doing it all over again if you're gonna become if you're gonna be Sisyphus you better like pushing a rock up a hill right whatever mistakes you've made they've made you who you are right now correct and as long as it's not catastrophic to the point we've caused a loss of life or someone's devastated and destroyed someone else's life you hope not you hope not yeah I mean you know it's interesting thing like that there's the concept of reincarnation there's many concepts but one of them is the one of the most haunting for some people is that you will live your life over again exactly the same way until you get it right I actually heard a Leo Gracey talking about this once that everything in your life every mistake every choice you make if you do not do the correct thing he believed that you would have to come back again and do it all over again exactly the same way and this is his philosophy the way he lived his life that's terrifying for people this idea that somehow or another you're going almost like you're gonna repeat high school sure you don't but here's was a little brutal period my life and mine too but here's my question I think everybody's and the people who wasn't brutal for those fucking people turn out to be losers the fucking homecoming king in this I mean that's like a fucking Billy Joel song yeah the king and the queen of the prom you know that's it scenes from an Italian restaurant that's that's literally the the premise of that song I think it was a it was a immortal song - yeah norway rendering an e with a popular still using the king and the queen of the prom riding around with the car top down on the radio aren't nobody looked any finer or was more of a hit at the parkway diner and we never knew we could walk more than that alive i mean that but III don't know as well as you do whoa that's good song the idea of living your life over again is terrifying for people though but alone but living over and over and over again for infinite sure but but why is that when living right now is fine for most of us I mean unless you're depressed unless you're depressing life's a wreck living right now is like okay I'm alive I'm here I'm doing it sure why scared to do it over and over and over again forever it's a strange thing you'd like there's something like the futility of it all the idea that this is just a repeating cycle that's just gonna haunt you forever well that would in in the idea that there would be nothing that you could do to make any effect to it I mean if it's a money fuck even even still like I couldn't me personally I couldn't think of something in terms of like I want to do something that it as a mental idea as a mind game that if I live my life in a way that I could be okay with doing it all over again just exactly the same way yeah I mean here's the other thing would you know that it's gonna happen like that how could you well there was a I kinda I wish I could remember who it was there was this philosopher who was saying that if you were given the ability to absolutely and utterly control your dreams in all aspects and elements of it and so at first most people would would go to sleep and they would turn it into every fucking wonderful thing they've ever wanted they would just be the ultimate winner at everything all the time always right and then they would get tired of that and then they would create chaos and catastrophe and and you know make me probably make everything is horrible for themselves as they could possibly do and as they're going through these cycles ultimately the one thing that you're going to end up wanting in the end that you just don't know what's gonna happen at all find by knowing everything prior to it to it occurring it takes the want to experience it away Cormac McCarthy wrote how many people have they knew the path of their lives would still choose to live it whoo right well there isn't that ultimately expressed by fighting like fighting is the ultimate expression that because when you step into that cage if it's just you and you're looking across the ring at another guy who's a legitimate top-flight mixed martial artist yeah and you really don't know I have a theory about fighting and that fighting is actually a not the only but a great conduit into what I think of as the highest point of is of being as a human being that you can enter into this state that it's not a place that you can exist that all the time like it's just not possible but when you breach it it's as if you are so alive and you're at your the peak of being at that moment and even though it is it is brought on through through being in the intensity in the stress of combat it's as if every aspect of your being is charged in electric in living and being but it's not a place you could be at all the time you would just be a maniac it's not a place that human beings can exist in for more than maybe short periods of time hmm well your senses have to be insanely heightened your your the consequences of your actions are grave the only thing that really is elevated past that is war and one of the things that you find about war and Sebastian Junger wrote about this in his book tribe is that the people that experience it have an incredibly difficult time adjusting to regular life sure and they really miss it and want to go back to it because they never felt more alive I believe that that war is a similar place I think that when you are faced with death that that is a a conduit to bringing you to words that highest point of being hmm and yeah I suppose it's like that once you get past that point of there's there's no fear that that level either it is just an it is a way it's just an existence you don't consider you don't think you don't think something isn't this or that it just is and it's a place that you can't be forever wouldn't it doesn't work that way but when you've been there and you're just out here dealing with petty fucking internet trolls and dumb shit and people doing stuff that cut their nose to spite their face and undermining this and yeah you know the fabric of our relationships for no good reason it's it's tough to sit and exist in this and go fuck you know I how do you get back to that other thing this this state of purity this existence of where these none of those things matter anymore I don't know if you can I mean you you might have I mean look we have a certain amount of time on this on this planet in this life right you have a hundred years if everything goes great you can't really expect to just live in that that perfect state of both chaos and and chaos and I guess being in the moment there's there's something about something that's dangerous and intense and overwhelmingly filled with anticipation beforehand and and that the preparation is all-consuming there's very few things in life that are the like these big moments like a person stepping into a cage for a fight and the consequences are so grave it's just for your emotions for your physical health this is this really nothing like it is it really to expect that you would find something else similar in life and to be able to achieve a similar state outside of that it's I don't I don't think you ever will because I feel like part of what makes what you do and what all fighters do so intense and so incredibly enjoyable to watch is that we all know how much is on the line I think I believe I'm a hundred percent in agreeance with you there and I think racecar drivers and fighter pilots I think people like that also likely experience that state of being well yeah I'm sure yeah fighter pilots it has to be you know fighter pilots apparently I was reading some story about this about wife swapping then they that they they're more inclined to have polyamorous relationships really yeah and then they wife swap because the idea was that they know that their life easily could be wiped out any day at any time and the people they care about the most their wife or their girlfriend that they want other people to love them because they might not be there interesting and that they would want the people they care about the most to love them because yeah they're thinking in a altruistic fashion of doing what they can I suppose to help this person that they care so much about continue to find joy in their life you know because of their their realization that what joy they may be able to derive from them specifically is is always on a thin line of not being there and yeah that's fucking intense do you love someone so much you want other people to fuck them get on that list well it's probably already on it's the which comes back to the one thing that is I think poison in life which is to live a dull life a grave a boring no risk to in a rut no thrills no challenge no growth no knowledge no learning just this stagnant bullshit life that is so prevalent in our society I think it's one of the main problems with our world is that we have set up these really safe cities and safe societies and cultures which is wonderful it's great but also we and given people the discipline or the structure or the the just like the framework for living a life that's going to satisfy your needs in terms of your biological needs your yes psychological yes and people start determining that totally inane things or what their needs are well you know they're difficult to acquire right you think of Ferraris gonna make you happy cuz a Ferrari is hard to get sure look how much you call shit if I just had dad man I'd be balling I'd be driving around also rather re yeah ballin but then you get that Ferrari like this is just a car yeah like unless you just really love cars like you could love you know your Firebird and you appreciate it from a mechanical standpoint you want step back look at it it's enjoyable but if you think that the fucking thing is gonna make you happy you're crazy not more happy than me being happy with who I am as a person and the life that I'm living the Firebird can't you can't do that there is no item you know I have to sit back all the time and try to think for myself that you you've I love my library that I have all the books within it I love the cars that I have I love the relationships that I have but instead of relation but just the things and it's like these are all great things but if I don't have them I am still me I still have everything that I need in this world I I don't like to think about them being lost destroyed I certainly hate the idea of it being destroyed because even if it wasn't in my hands I'd like them to still exist for others but without them I'm no different than who I am now and I guess that's kind of a thinking of like the Stoics you've been more defined by your accomplishments and your thinking and your philosophy there's lots of things that people obviously they couldn't know about me they've because it's not the kind of thing that is isn't just my Who I am right and and I don't need someone to know whether or not I'm smart or whether or not I know this or whether or not I can do that it's like I'll do it what I need to do it and I have to try and look to see that I have my own inner pieces based on my own self knowledge and knowledge also for the that I am lacking that I can be better that I and if I want to I can choose to in those days that I don't it was a choice not to be better it wasn't that I couldn't because even going and failing like we talked about before is a worthwhile endeavor because it'll move you towards either a eventually getting there or be that it's not something that's gonna be yours but you know what it is and you know what it takes to get there and that's a different perspective altogether and that is where I feel like that's where I can be okay in this world and dealin in there's all kinds of things that you can draw your focus and really eat at you and bother you and you're giving weight to these things and allowing them to have an effect on you and that's natural that's a normal thing and it's easy to fall into but if you can be okay with all right if all I'm left with is just me and what I have if I no longer have anything no no more luxuries no more this no more that can you be okay with that you know what kind of life would you make of this and I like to think the same one I have now you can pick me up here take all my shit away throw me some other part of the world a third world country and it will be jarring it will be difficult there will be some lament of course but I will continue to be Who I am I will see what is necessary to to communicate with others and to continue to propagate this that I'm trying to create in me yeah I think we're all trying to navigate this really incredibly difficult thing which is you're just your life you're the emotions the the the the your goals your tasks your relationships your your dreams and aspirations all these things are just so complicated and the the whole idea of not knowing what the future holds is stressful but it's also incredibly rewarding when things work out well and even when they don't work out well what's rewarding about that is you get the gift of knowing that you fucked up and you get the gift of the feeling of fucking up and the horrible just the feeling of failure and to understand that it's fuel for you to regroup repackage your fucking thoughts and and now move forward with the knowledge of the mistakes you've made and you're gonna be a better person how can you fuck up if you don't do anything if you don't never do it you don't if you just sit back and you try to lead the simplest safest version of a life it's not a life it's on a wire and it's not a life I can really imagine that anyone can really be truly fulfilled living and you know things are ultimately incredibly soft on us I mean we have pressures in other ways but ultimately most of us are living quite comfortable lives with no immediate dangers and no no real impetus to put stress on ourselves where it doesn't exist at times because let's just say you want to learn new language there's that's agitation in terms of forcing you to have to endure something there's some suffering in that and you know I believe in the Nietzschean concept of you know suffering creates growth you know life is suffering suffering doesn't have to be catastrophic it doesn't have to be the sort of thing that is is going to debilitate you but that suffering is needed for you to continue to become better for sure with everything with exercise with learning with everything with even relationships learning in relationships that that all those uncomfortable feelings are how you learn yes learning relationships I I've always said to two friends of mine you know the first time they have like a big blowout with something call me up and I'll fuck you know so-and-so said this and I don't know how their dick ended up there and all this does like look ultimately yeah no one wants to get into a row with someone especially someone that you really care about but if this is an important relationship the only way it becomes a relationship that has that deeper lasting meaning and that really has any real depth to it at all is what you do when you guys are faced with adversity that shows you what a relationship you have because when things are fun and easy anybody can be a part of it right we all just you know humping and drinking and going out and blue that's great fucking wonderful once he hits pretty it's not bad as a single guy I'm constantly looking for that opportunity but ladies if you look in a hump and drink hump it humpin manly whiskey and coffee but drinking it up and in muscle cars if you're into that but when you get into these all of a sudden adversity comes across your doorstep how you to handle that and you know whether you're the person who brought it or you're the person who's in enduring it from the other side and and if you haven't experienced that in your life and also in the experience in the relationship man you might not be ready that stream might not have the tools yeah you know you think about everything that you do that's difficult right it gives you the tools to navigate difficult situations and the other aspects of your life agreed yeah it is the the stresses of having to to deal with a problem and how you handle that problem because there will never be any shortage of problems of difficulties from from great to small and you your way of mitigating those problems and dealing with them is is so important it's it determines how it how it works out for you that's right bitches Josh Barnett dropping knowledge like advertised let's wrap this up Josh you're the man always pleasure
