hello freak bitches if you had the opportunity to go and view any culture from the past like if you could be completely invisible and walk around amongst the Romans or cave people or Native Americans before the Europeans came what would you choose wow that's really hard question yeah um I think I don't know when the time would be but the first time where anything was trying to be colonized I like changed from being what your regular like the first time like a boat showed up in Polynesia or something like that some white people got out right we're used to being in the fields everyday and and you know this guy hunts and this guy watches after the boys and teaches them and this one's over and we're all you know and then all of a sudden they come out and they're built like you guys need women are staring at their fucking balls two feet from the ground what are these things what the fuck is dawns in this fucking here can you fucking call Tommy the boys we're gonna need about 40 these fucking things climb trees what is your character's name I love this guy he needs to come back more often this is the kind of atreus Joe they climb trees what do you mean they fucking they don't even they don't even with their hands and he's up there for 20 minutes goddamn we are on the fuck is going on I'm getting eaten by ants he's laughing I saw a statement wasn't someone went and it was a tourist spot but I passed the tourist spot I went in the house and there was a statement in there and I know it just it's simple but it just blew my mind and it said one person could change the whole world for a better as long as they don't give a damn who gets that credit and I and I thought like if you really don't you just want to sit back you just want to see things better yeah and you really can change you for the better but you don't have to worry about going you know so-and-so said that or someone so set that up you know so-and-so did that because now you're doing it for a different reason I'd never heard that before until like sort of like yesterday I saw like I saw that quote I make and that's a problem that I continually have you know all the buzzing - almost ideas and that's like I think part of what's excellent about this medium and particularly the way it's being executed by you look is that it's it's discourse you know this kind of things not really like you know like you said the fast moving fast cut soundbite TV on barded with an artillery of mostly erroneous information you don't get people here people hour after hour talking examining discarding as you said who really knows and returning to that point is sort of is sort of encouraging because I've had like you know like as I like I've always thought like you know I don't like agree with like Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity or those guys I've always kind of for I think they were all right if I hang out yeah he's like imagine me kind of old come on like I think I think he was kind of okay you know I think you would joke around with them and you guys probably saw it lying about some things and that's kind of a reassuring thing isn't it and like it to not be kind of to like once you get at like I think that's what was kind of ugly about both liberalism and neoliberalism so you can see is people just forcing their idea and they've lost touch with and like I do it all the fucking time yeah what is it that we're genuinely here for and that thing you said of like you can change the world if like you know no one like if you're willing to do if no one knowing about it the pang I feel in my gut shows me how much my ego is still involved in this shit idea I'm not a fan of sharks I don't like them they scare the fuck out of me and that's what's keeping me from surfing because nothing looks like it's fucking are I see guys like you on those big waves I don't know about the big waves that that's beyond me I believe even when I was young I don't think I would ever like this this kind of shit that's not I'm not designed for that it's not fun looking yeah nope That's not me we're looking at a vote for people who are listening we're looking at an image is that you who's that's me well Jesus dude tell me about this falling off several buildings stacked on top of each other tell you like that that that actual moment right there actually felt like I was falling off the building it was it I was absolutely sure I was eating shit right there so and you didn't um I didn't yeah as a miracle I actually fell from the top and landed on my board and made the way home is a big wave it uh I don't wave off the north coast of Maui called jaws yeah how high is that waived probably fifty feet on the face maybe maybe more maybe sixty so you're falling off the top of the wave like it breaks and you're coming over the lip or they what would you call it what do you call the edge of the wave yeah yeah yeah I'm falling from the lip but the cool thing is you're doing it with your hands you know you like you're doing it with your bare hands like this wave comes in and you have to read the wave you have to time it you have to position yourself see so you have to catch it in a steepest part yeah right before it throws over like that because if it throws over you're eating shit so you know you got a it's just it's so precise you know to be able to tighten it on a giant wave like that especially like the bigger the wave is the faster it moves so it gets really really technical so you know if you successfully ride one of those ways it's a lot of fun I would imagine it gets super addictive when you're in that tube and you're slicing through it and you see the water oh yeah going over the top of you yeah it is it is so much fun it's like um it is it's such a blast it's um it's super addicting I you know I've been surfing since I was I've been surfing on on a surfboard standing up since I was five I got a surfboard from my dad and I'm still totally obsessed with it it's weird there's nothing else in my life like that where I'm absolutely psyched like when the waves are good I'm I'm like a little kid still what is it about it dude it's like it's like hunting it really is it's like I'm out in nature no one's bothering me I don't need to talk to anybody I can o do my own thing I can go down the beach no matter how she'd have a day I had no matter how much stress whatever like if my kids getting a bad report card or I had to pay my taxes or whatever the hell it was I can just put on my trunks drive down to the beach grab my board and I'm good and as soon as I hit the water I'm fine and and that's how I am a bow hunting and people who don't bow hunt they don't understand that they're like why the hell do you do that like what do you what do you find you know like what do you find good about that like being out in the forest for days at a time it's the same thing just you know people have a porn addiction even read those guys oh yeah they're like I had to stop it was getting crazy couldn't concentrate on anything yeah well that's what they're saying Michael Jackson had some sort of a sex addiction Jesus dark just super dark like midnight it's just spooky that that guy was doing that to these kids while he was the biggest star in the world I mean we all know it's true mm-hmm what do people still go and know cuz they don't want to they don't want to believe come
