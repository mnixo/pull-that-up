four three two one hello Sven hello what's up buddy there's a discrepancy my my coffee is way way bigger than your horse I've got like this 40 ounce big gulp French press yes um versus the is that a caveman yeah cold brew nitros yeah those are pretty good too bunch yeah dude thank you so much for the bread and the macaroons goodies I would probably morbidly obese if I wasn't an exercise freak it seems like I yeah yeah Jessa makes that sourdough bread and it is freaking amazing did you do that carnivore diet thing did you try that out no you didn't no no I like me put it into the cardboard ah you were gonna do it for a certain amount of time and test it I thought about it I'm too much of a foodie I'm like what I did was I tried to eat rib eye steaks every night for dinner so I did like a 33% carnivore diet but there was a study actually that came out it was just like two days ago on that TMAO mm-hm the the sugar that is associated with gut damage when you're eating a high red meat diet right when your body takes excess protein and it turns it into sugar right with theoretically the idea being that that might be present because your microbiome is imbalance from a diet that's too heavy and meat is there microfiber it's it's because your biome I thought it was just because of glue code gen is's because your body has nothing but meat your body turns it into glucose no that that would be something different that that conversion of glucose is a different sugar than the TMAO so what the TMAO is is that's going to be present if you aren't getting enough fiber or if you buy on is imbalanced but what this study a couple of days looked at was people who are eating like a fish and egg and plant rich diet and they had high levels of TMAO too but they weren't deleterious their exercise of texture because they had the fiber yeah and I mean you could do you could do a carnivore diet if you or there's a few populations that do this like in in Spain I forget the name of the sausage but they'll like eat the they'll eat the ruminant like they'll eat the the intestine of the ruminant hmm and get their grasses and their fibers and their plants literally by eating the stomach of the animal but like a cat yeah yeah and it's the same issue with like you know methionine too much of the amino acid methionine from just eating red meat would be deleterious but if you're getting glycine and some of these other amino acids if you're reading like nose to tail right marrow right bone broth although we're getting meats you know headcheese braunschweiger just like all these different mixes of meats I think that would be the way to do a carb or diet yeah there's a lot of people that are proponents of that as well and then there's a bunch of people that are you know it's interesting because you've got a there's a disparity between the anecdotal accounts of health and well-being and then bloodwork yeah the blood work these folks get is not impressive I mean the people on the cardboard yeah what I've seen I haven't seen anything where I see all their inflammatory markers down their testosterone up I haven't seen anything where it's looking really good yeah high blood glucose is another thing that you see but I should say that there haven't been a lot of tests done it's not like a lot of people are publishing stuff on it but the anecdotal evidence is amazing it's like it's really weird like my friend Jordan Peterson he's had a tremendous success with it yeah lost a lot of body weight he says he's in his intellectual prime he said he's never felt better in terms of his energy levels and that guy is he is so rigid and disciplined with it all he's eating is meat with salt on it and drinks water and that is really well if you think about it it's an elimination diet yeah right it's like an autoimmune diet or you can say well I you know I don't know what's giving me trouble soy or wheat or dairy or what-have-you so I'm just gonna stop eating all that stuff and switch to primarily meat yeah the problem is that it's you know I don't want to call anybody out and and and call them lazy but it's almost like kind of a very easy lazy s approach because rather than figuring out how to do you know like that that sourdough bread it's slow fermented the Rye in the are in there but all the phytic acid that would normally inhibit your ability to absorb minerals is pre digested by the lactobacillus and all the bacteria in the wheat so you've got a bread that's lower in a glycemic index and it's it's more easily digested with some oh that rye and salad or more health right and you put the Rye in it because it lowers the glycemic index and then you've got the what's called the I forget the term it's like a gluten digesting enzymes it gets activated with the lactobacillus so that's a smart bread it takes freaking 24 hours to it's it's not 24 hours but it's like 15 minutes over 24 hours that it takes to make it that's an intelligent approach to food preparation right that's the way that our ancestors or many of the Blue Zones would have treated their foods fermenting soaking sprouting slow food and you can take a lot of these things that would result in you're talking about Jordan Peterson I know his daughter does this as well Michaela Peterson they use that elimination diet you know which is the carnivore diet to clear up a lot of those autoimmune issues but you could also just render food more digestible or switch to an elimination diet or an autoimmune diet for eight weeks or 12 weeks something like the carnivore diet heal the gut and then return back to a more all-inclusive eating pattern that allows you to eat you know dairy wheat plants etc all these things that would normally damage the gut if the gut is actually leaky so what are the like what what's the process like what is happening when they go on this very strict elimination diet and they're just eating meat like what is happening to their gut that allows them to have all these pretty pretty significant health benefits a lot of loss of weight increase of energy autoimmune issues like Jordan had some some pretty significant gum issues those all went away depression that went away all right some of that some of the gum and the joint stuff might be just as much related to the fact that he's getting a shit-ton a college and mm-hmm you know fiber ID all right or not fiber but you know elastin and muscle fiber precursors he's a lot of protein I don't know if he's eating bone broth and bone marrow but maybe a lot of glycine satellites so part of it could just be more fuel on board to repair muscles or to repair the joints but then the other part of it is that when you eliminate inflammatory products that you're consuming like let's say you're eating whatever you know Wonder Bread and commercial dairy or or unfermented soy or any of these things that can actually damage the lining of the gut you're creating an inflammatory scenario and I know you're you're familiar with the gut brain access and how our gut interacts with our nervous system via the vagus nerve and when you have inflammation in the gut that affects neural symptoms that affects sleep affects intellectual performance and then you've also got the autoimmune component if you're actually truly allergic to or intolerant to some of those proteins that wind up in the bloodstream in the presence of a leaky gut you know plant proteins lectins are another one that a lot of people complain about then you create almost like a full body damage scenario so the idea is you get rid of all that stuff you introduce the carnivore diet and I don't know there's a lot of components of the carnivore diet that are actually healing the gut as much as it's the absence or elimination of the foods that we're harming it mmm interesting the you know the Bell brothers Chris and Mark you know yeah um their take on it is basically they've never felt better and you know these are guys that work out very heavily the difference between them and Jordan is probably that especially you know Marcus a gorilla yeah he's powerlifting and you know it's been doing that basically his whole life these guys are what their take on it is essentially they're at least the way they think is that most people that are talking about diet they really don't know what the fuck they're talking about even though you might be able to look at it on paper and you might have these ideas about what's beneficial or non beneficial some people are proponents of vegan diet some people are proponents of you know paleo he's like until you are actually physically doing something until you are actually doing something with that die and then you report how much better you feel the people that are actually training really hard those are the ones you should rely on and he's saying for him personally he's never felt better never been leaner yeah and a big part of it I mean this just returns to diet personalization and customization as a whole you know we live in an era where you can self quantify pretty easily with genetics and you can find out what ancestry you came from what blood markers that you have what your gut microbiome looks like and I don't think we talked about this on the last show but there's this idea of eating according to your ancestry yeah and the concept of what are called cold spots like areas around the world where people have a genetic susceptibility to have certain diseases that they don't actually develop those diseases don't actually manifest because of their traditional diet like you look like the Icelandic population that carries the genes that would render them more susceptible to something like depression or seasonal affective disorder but their diet is very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA which we know can protect against those disorders and you take take the Icelandic population and you uproot them and put them in the context of a westernized diet and all of a sudden depression and si D manifests that's say the same thing for like Cameroon Cameroon Africa higher than normal risk for colon cancer but they're eating a diet what is it that's high in fiber why does it higher the normal risk I don't know it's a genetic susceptibility but the idea is that that population probably figured out at some point in human history that if they eat a lot of plants or they eat a lot of fiber all of a sudden people don't have as many issues with their colon right and then you take that same population again strip out the fiber put them on a westernized diet and you get a large portion of the african-american population developing colon cancer that's crazy about this seasonal affective disorder and you got to wonder how would that affect people that live in Seattle the Pacific Northwest that are dealing with constant rain I wonder if that would have some sort of an impact on them probably even more if you come from that population I mean I'm on the Spokane side but I'm out in the middle of the forest I get Sun for maybe 10:00 to 2:00 you know I'm in a North facing slope and I work indoors a lot of the time you know I'm typing on my computer you know I'm blogging and so I don't get a lot of sun exposure but that's where you know all these newfangled light panels and had worn light devices and things come in that were actually developed for seasonal affective disorder that actually worked pretty well just to keep your mood up if you're working indoors you don't get sunlight exposure right but Spokane is a different environment right you're not dealing with the constant rain that they're dealing with on the actual coast now the precipitation builds up on the mountains and dumps back on in Seattle yeah I mean it still must be you must get much more than you get in California or Southern California at least but it's supposed to be very beautiful out there it's it's gorgeous so I'm about 25 minutes from Coeur d'Alene oh really yeah okay yeah that's was amazing I've never lines beautiful I used to go over there I race the Ironman and they'd have that in Lake Coeur d'Alene it's an iconic race just because I mean the mountains the lake everything is just gorgeous I saw pictures of the lake where people were taking photographs of the bottom of the lake like from a hundred feet 100 feet deep of water you can see the bottom of the lake it's that air that is insane it's kind of funny because its actually polluted because of all the mines that they have around there there's a lot of metals in it because the corlane feeds into the Spokane River and your your allotment of fish that you're supposed to eat from the Spokane River is like one a year well I like it's that high in metals so I mean I don't need any I don't want I don't choose no I'm learning that's awful yeah damn it yeah but it's a beautiful lake I mean it's buddy what is the allotment of fish that you're supposed to eat from the lake is it similar i I don't know I don't know but if I if I went to Coeur d'Alene and I spent a lot of time swimming there I'd probably spent some time in the infrared sauna to spend some of those medals out so let me ask you this what's the benefit of infrared sauna versus traditional song is there a benefit so the idea is it's cooler you know I do have an infrared here no way so you walk into the infrared it's like a hundred and fifty five to 158 degrees most of them there's a couple that will go up to like 170 even though the air is cooler the actual photons of light that are being released by the panel's does your you're surrounded by infrared panels while you're in there those penetrate more deeply into tissue so you wind up getting a deeper sweat you sweat for a longer time you can stay in there longer because it's not quite as hot but you look at like the studies out of Finland all right these these studies that show four to five year lifespan increases from a from a weekly sauna protocol you know I think it's like four times a week for 20 to 30 minutes and the significant drop in dementia and Alzheimer's and a lot of these these mortality risk factors and you look at the studies that have been done in athletes where you get almost a wreath ropo eaten like like a blood doping effect from sauna exposure when done post-workout and right you stay in there for 20 to 30 minutes post-workout all of these were done in a dry sauna yeah that's why I use a dry sauna as per run to Patrick's recommendation I just got that because she said there's no real studies like that on an infrared there's a few metal too so they've analyzed metal and detoxification and some of these infrared saunas and they have found that that you release more through your sweat you get a deeper sweat so if your goal is something like detoxification like when I'm in that I'm fucking drenched like how could I get more out of that have you tried like a like try out like a 30 minute infrared versus dry I have I I'm an idiot so I don't feel like I'm suffering as much so I don't like it when you're in the infrared you don't feel like yourself exactly yeah see that's the thing is and maybe I'm jaded cuz I'm my infrared like I've got it I've got a kettlebell in there I've put my bike in there okay I'll get in there when I go in there at night actually like I was telling you we're talking about those those massage devices those they saw out there yes so right this OS ones are like a PSO RIT they're like a ship in your abs love those things but they open up your cellar they open up you need to work them on a lot of different body parts hmm anyway so I'll have stuff like that in there and occasionally do bodywork but I actually move I exercise in the sauna there's a sauna that's designed for that what the fuck is that called again there's a specific sauna that a lot of UFC guys are in Vegas and they're building them in gyms I know Winkeljohn gym Mike like a TV panel in there yeah yeah they have televisions in there so you can even watch things like watch like directionals or watch some sort of instructional video on exercise yeah that's what I think they're doing is they're trying to have you do your workout like you look at a screen and it's sauna and you do your workout while you're looking at this gets a bit spa I think it's called fits something like that yeah but the the the the hot one that I go into mean I I sweat so much I have a hard time believing I would sweat more anywhere else I mean I'm literally pouring sweat and I keep that fucker around 190 degrees yeah so I'm I'm really ideal scenario I would like it I don't have a dry sauna but I would like to get a barrel sauna because I have the the infrared in my basement it's one of those big ones like the four-person infrared sauna mmm that you can get into an exercise you can you can yo get more people do yoga whatnot and I'm you know six too but I can get into like a full down dog in lunch or whatever but I'd love to have a dry sauna as well what is it bears on a barrel sauna is a it's like a big barrel you've probably seen it before they're okay they got benches on either side they're shaped like a like a cylinder there they're very popular they build up a lot of heat I think even the shape of the barrel somehow allows the heat to be distributed more evenly through the sauna or something like that almost like a treasure grill okay yeah looks like yeah so I've got what I did was I bought learn it oh he's on those endless pools that you swim against Jamie go to that one in the upper right-hand corner with the bubble on the outside of it that looks fucking awesome yeah keep that sucker in your backyard I was at a guy's house in Santa mom and it heats up the same way that some sort of a power source attached to that yeah that's pretty badass see I want to get one of those and just put it out in the forest where I can look out with the cedar barrel saw yeah looks fucking good yeah yeah yeah especially if you were in like a cold area and you could like like that look at that guy's head set up looking over a lake you could look out into the snow serene yeah pretty like a pastoral scene yeah in the cryo after you do the sauna sometimes but most days no most days I do either or yesterday I did cry oh yeah yeah yeah I've been doing cryo every day cuz I'm staying down the hill and they have a crowd therapy chamber there oh and I'm a bigger fan of the cold wait the Hilton was a cryotherapy and they've got a crowd there apish a more they've got they've got a bunch of work they have like this thing called upgrade labs and like the basement of this this Hilton really got like a cryo they've got an infrared sauna they've got subject I've just been going down there every day and and working out my workout this morning actually I did this machine they've got a machine called a vas / have you seen this before no you put like it's got cold cuffs you you know katsu training like blood flow restriction right so you put cold cuffs on your arms and then you put cold cuffs on your legs and increase the millimeters of mercury and tell your basically get less blood flow to your arms and your legs and then it's one of these full-body exercise devices right so you're moving your arms and your legs like an elliptical trainer you're barefoot and the whole thing is cold so it's pumping cold water through the blood pressure cuffs on your arms and your legs and then it's got cold water back behind you on here it is right here what's in this and and by the way this this thing is not gonna make you an athlete like that's not the purpose of something like what is the purpose of it just general fitness you know you're getting cold and when you take off the blood pressure cuffs what happens is you've got a bunch of lactic acid trapped in the muscle as you're as you're moving and typically you're doing like 30 seconds as hard as you can go so you might go I mean pretty heavy wattage like 600 800 watts for 15 to 30 seconds and then you recover and when you finish and you take those cuffs off you get this amplification in growth hormone testosterone and based on some of the research they're talking about now stem cell mobilization really and it's like this this super quick 21 minute workout I actually want to get one for my house and how long is the amplification of testosterone and growth hormone and all that stuff times it lasts but I don't know I mean in many cases I mean it's like a lot of things that affect testosterone or growth hormone or inflammation generally it's like a 24 to 48 hours cycle you know it's like weed you know we know that weed suppresses testosterone but it's not chronic it's a it's a temporary 24 hour drop in testosterone does it really suppress testosterone I don't know about that yeah although a lot of the studies on on marijuana they're using pretty high dosage and they're using rodent models using like a hundred to 200 milligrams in rodents yeah and the show I'm sorry what would be the equivalent of a hundred to 200 milligrams in a human on a rodent model you know a lot of a lot of the studies on supplementation think same thing with TBI and concussion you know you hear about DHA and fish oil for that but you need to take a lot of fish oil a lot of DHA like if you extrapolate from the rodent models you're looking at like 50 to 60 grams of DHA or fish oil to manage like TBI or concussion which is it's a lot of DHA but if you were gonna use like a multi-modal approach due to TBI or Alzheimer's or dementia right I mean I'm a I'm a huge fan of that I'm a fan of like hyperbaric oxygen therapy ketosis definitely works these these light devices that you wear in your head now they've got a lot of research coming out on something called photobiomodulation for TBI and these things produce Hertz frequencies 10 to 40 Hertz range you place them on your head typically there's like a probe that goes into your nose and they've got new research coming out on this for restoring blood flow to the head increasing your alpha brainwave production your gamma brainwave production very cool devices so what does the probe up your nose do it delivers a wavelength of light that is supposed to activate part of the mitochondria is called cytochrome C oxidase and when you activate that you get increased mitochondrial activity you get increased blood flow you get increased production of nitric oxide and this kind of returns to what I was talking about with seasonal affective disorder where you can use a lot of a lot of these new things that are designed to deliver infrared light or light to the body to increase mitochondrial density or to increase blood flow or to increase nitric oxide and people are not using this for TBI and concussion in stem cells as well they've got a actually last time I was on the show we were talking about how when I got that concussion in Austin I did a self-administered infusion of sugar alcohols I used mannitol and then I followed that up with stem cells because that my stem cells stored down in Florida and also in this lab called forever labs in Berkley and I followed that up I chased it with a stem cell injection because when you inject sugar alcohol into your strain it renders your blood brain barrier more permeable and then the stem cells can cross over through the blood-brain barrier oh but now hold on slow down so this should your how you what are you doing with sugar alcohol how you administering it intravenously in intravenous mannitol solution if you do this yourself I do this myself but you could get this done by a doctor and when you're doing it elaborate I recommend you get it done like it sounds like a good idea I do yeah now what what kind of dosage you using of mannitol yeah I don't know it was it was what I was advised to do by the doc who who taught me this protocol so remember how much it was but it was it was like a vial yeah I do the same thing with nad every week I do a weekly nad injection everything it's a yeah push any minute swish IV ten minutes is pushing it yeah it hurt I mean so normally if you were to get five hundred to a thousand milligrams of nad most people will sit under a four to A six hour drip IV to do that mm-hmm and one reason for that that they say is that you get less of it degraded by the liver and the kidneys and the gut as the NAD goes into the body then it but I think I think that the bigger factor is simply the fact that when you do a push like you're nauseous you feel like your whole body's on fire I mean if you feel like Superman afterwards but it's a very very uncomfortable IV and I don't want anybody pushing that and except me like I want to be in charge of the trigger when I'm putting that thing in because I got to stop and go and stop and go but it's it's it's quicker it's more convenient than sitting down and doing an IV so a push you would actually have a nurse actually pushing down on the button as things are going yeah yeah exactly and it's an intermittent intervals I do about two like two ticks on the syringe at a time because it's a 30 ml syringe so I'll go like two cc's then stop and you can feel like your heart rate go up and you get nauseous and and your skin kind of flushes a little bit and you breathe it off then you wait like 10 15 seconds and you do another push how clean if L like his guts were on fire yeah Kyle I think is a champ I think he did it in like five minutes or something which is like for me if I if I can do it in ten minutes then I've it's it's absolutely mind-blowing in terms of how hard that is really I don't know how he did it in five minutes but well he's a savage you know it's interesting too I started to listen to your podcast with David Sinclair on the car ride over and he's talking about this nmn stuff which supposedly when orderly administered simulates a lot of what an are nicotinamide Rui beside which is one thing that a lot of people are taking for anti-aging and nad which is what we were just talking about administered via either in most cases it's IV there's a couple companies doing like an oral nad version but supposedly ma nmn I don't know if Sinclair has any human studies coming out on this right now but he or or at least released but he's done rodent studies and show mints like exercise in a bottle mmm the NAD from what I understand though and this returns to the TBI concussion piece crosses the blood-brain barrier easily or more easily than nmn or NR so if you were doing it for like a cognitive or a neurological effect you may want to choose nad sounds to me like from the research I've seen if you were doing it for the exercise effect maybe you choose n MN or NR hmm interesting so me and I aging effective a they don't even know in many cases all the pathways on which these things are working but most of them are related to these certain pathways where it like sirtuin activating compounds that actually allow your mitochondria to repair more quickly or give your body more antioxidants so the idea is they probably all have a pretty good effect on anti-aging and when you're doing it are you pushing yourself you say you're doing it once a week or you did it yourself are you pushing it IV yeah and how much time to yourself to actually do that yeah yeah if I've got 20 minutes I'm happy like if I have to compress in at 10 minutes it hurts like I like to at least a lot for 20 minutes and then you follow it up in most cases with like an IV cocktail like a like a Meyers cocktail vitamin cocktail and supposedly supposedly that it does a few things supposedly it enhances your stem cell mobilization or the activity of stem cells and allows the nd to be absorbed to the cells more easily mmm so you basically I mean the way I do it is I use it just a butterfly needle and you do the NAD administration and then you just unscrew the the end of the butterfly needle line and then you put the vitamin cocktail and follow up with the vitamin cocktail which takes like 30 to 60 seconds and then and why do you do it once a week you feel good no but why once a week why not twice a week why the idea is you're supposed to maintain your levels and there's even some evidence and in it you know this is kind of similar to testosterone that long-term use may suppress your body's own nad production you're going to start to do it great but you may want to realize that this is something you'd need to do regularly I'm going to keep your levels elevated because you may get like a down-regulation effect Oh interesting so your body might recognize that it hasn't a surplus that's not a lot of nad it doesn't need to make more one of the one of the very interesting things though I did a couple of weeks ago as I went to New York City and I got an ad from this doctor dr. Chen over there but then he infused me with Co Q 10 hmm and a bunch of other vitamins to allow my body to make more of what are called adult pluripotent stem cells they're also known as V cells very small embryonic like cells now if you've heard of para bios's before this idea of taking the blood from young mice and transferring that into old mice there was research that they did at Stanford University on this you impart essentially enhanced longevity to the old mice the idea is that's a that's a non Attalla ggest transfer right like that's that that's the transfer of blood from from a young healthy donor into an older recipient and there are companies now in Silicon Valley doing this like the young blood institute you know for like eight thousand dollars this company called ambrosia will will give you the plasma from a young healthy donor is there any evidence that that does anything good for you though other than the studies that they've done mice I don't know of any studies on humans yeah no is there anecdotal evidence meaning people that you know of yeah I'm about to to get into that you're gonna saw but you haven't no I didn't autologous version of that so I didn't want to put somebody else's blood so we didn't run body so what I did was I had this doc take out a pint of my blood and what happens is if you put all these vitamins like nad and stuff into your blood it increases your stem cell production if you stress the blood after that it dumps out a bunch of these tiny little adult pluripotent stem cells which is exactly the same type of cell that you're getting when you do one of these young blood transfers so he stresses that over night in cold you can use cold you could use pressure you could use anything to increase the stem cell release from the blood cells but they get stressed out they release stem cells and then what happens is you get them injected back into your body so this is similar to like what they're doing with Regina Kane I don't think it's anything like that well you know with John Keane they take the blood out and they stress it with here and then they spin it a few yeah and I think I think and and I don't know a lot about what Regina Keene is doing but I think they're more concentrating the growth factors I think they might be doing exosomes I know they've got some overseas places where they're doing like a culture expanded or something like that but as far as in the u.s. like this this protocol is one of the few that I know of where you could take your own blood and get a lot of that same stuff that you'd get from culture expanded or from Parab iosys like using the blood of somebody else and you get all these stem cells released into your body so you essentially get the same effect as you would if you took young person's we did a young blood transfer and the young blood transfer they're not transferring the entire body's supply of know that they're taking they're taking a bunch of plasma I don't know the volume that they're using in my case they took a pint of my blood so for right 460cc tubes now is there any anecdotal evidence or any published evidence on your style that what you're trying to do and the benefits of it no there's none equals one I just felt like a million bucks afterwards yeah the the other one that I did that worked very well on my knee cuz I have some meniscus issues on my left knee was I did what's called a nerve hydro dissection have you heard of this before hydro dissection is a protocol where they take like a liquid and they use the liquid to act like the scalpel or the knife that a surgeon would use to kind of remove adhesions like scar tissue adhesions or separate a nerve that's causing pain or discomfort or lack of mobility in a certain joint but when they do a nerve dissection they don't have to use like you know something like they'd use in Provo therapy like sugar water regular water what I had done and this was at a clinic called bio reset in uh in San Jose dr. Matt cook down there he went in and did a nerve hydro dissection and he used hose own and a placental cell it wasn't like a culture expanded placental cell which is what I understand to be illegal in the US but just like a regular placental extract he did that into my knee and my knee went from like 25% to a hundred percent in a couple of weeks I know that protocol was called nerve hydro dissection they use ultrasound imaging to to basically visualize where the needle is going into the knee they identify the area where the adhesion or the scar tissue is they inject it right there and I mean it's like a 10-minute long procedure now this is for only a buildup of adhesion and scar tissue what about the people that you know my it was doping yeah it was developed for a Nerf pain and what they found was that it actually seems to cause some kind of a release of the scar tissue followed by an increase in the blood flow which is difficult to get in some areas of the knee right so yes so yeah I mean I would if I ever get to the point where somebody wants to sculpt my knee or something like that I would I would definitely consider doing that treatment first it worked very well it was just quick and easy I had a meniscus issue and I got exosome shot into there I've had it done three times yeah and every time I've done it I've experienced a good benefit from it then I beat the shit out of it and I think I gave it not enough time to heal up before I started pounding again I would give it like a week off and start running again yeah but now I'm gonna give it a full six weeks with no pounding no running hills nothing crazy and I've experienced just in the two weeks since the procedure a very significant decrease in pain no inflammation decreasing your discomfort I have to like try to make it feel weird now like go out of my way and it seems like every week that's more and more difficult to do and the range of motions increased basically can go all way down with my ass to my ankles with no problem you know I bend all the way down and back all the way up with no discomfort no weirdness yeah I kind of questioned the one thing because I've asked myself this before and I don't know if you have like when you get a protocol like that done and he kind of go easy on your knee cuz you really want it to work and you start backing off of some of that stuff you were doing anyways how much of it is you just backing off of what you were doing and how much of it is the exosomes and small cells I know because I did try to back off initially and it didn't have anything I could yeah when I when I backed off initially with nothing I said let me just take some time off and let it see if I can let it heal up didn't shit yeah it stayed exactly the same like it was just hurt you know like so it was one of those things where in the past I would have had to just deal with it yeah now this is my new world this is my new feeling in my knee until I get it scoped yeah so it's pretty significant the impact that it's had I mean I'm a giant believer in stem cells and exosomes I had a full-length rotator cuff tear my right shoulder and now it's gone it's gone like it doesn't exist anymore and dr. Roddy Magee out of Vegas coat do you know what he yea looked at the MRI and he said to me he goes do you know how fucking crazy that is like you had a tear and your rotator cuff and now there's no tear yeah I get to regenerated tissue that's crazy which is the ultimate goal right I mean now I have zero pain in the shoulder I mean nothing did you deals like did you not have rights belong I did peptides I did what is it BP see one five seven yeah that will be PC one five seven that that's the only one that's that's still legal according to you sada and wada for athletes to use and that one decreases inflammation and increases blood flow and then the other one the one that that's not allowed anymore is TB five-hundredth Imus and beta 500 and that one repairs are actin and myosin fibers yeah so in a gold standard protocol you go back and forth between the two well switch it up one one day just like inject subcutaneously near the side of injury no it works for a lot of people but peptides are weird like I'm attending all these anti aging and longevity conferences now because I want to learn a lot more about someone was kind of I'm kind of starting to pivot from just pure human performance to how can you how can you live a long time mm-hmm and talk to Sinclair yeah yeah well I want to finish listening to your interview with him that was very fast yeah so the the idea is that these peptides are talked about a lot now in these anti-aging circles like they've got weird names like like epital on is one and two times a year like a ten to twenty day injection protocol of epital on there getting a bunch of increased mitochondrial density decreased markers of aging increased fat loss increased muscle gain and they've done that in humans hmm and so again it's just a peptides very easy like you you would inject it next to your abdominals subcutaneously there's another one you know side effects this one uh not with that one but this one called melanotan have you heard of it before no so I was intrigued by this somebody was telling me about it it's a it's a peptide and it was used in the bodybuilding industry for a long time because when you inject it it gives you like this amazing pan and I called melanotan it stimulates your melanin is that that lady that was on that fucking show that was turning black she believed that she was yeah the wrong skin so she was shooting something into her body and she got black like Congo black well I tried it out I tried it out for about a week did you try to get black no I didn't try to get black just wanted to see what happened to the tan I started to get some freckles but the side effect of this is you get massive boners that lasts a really annoying ly long time so your baby like you can't say no but people will use this is like almost like like an IDI you have a drug right but it and I don't even know the mechanism of action like I don't know how it's even working well it's giving you a black so basically you get yeah you get a tan and boners yeah I don't know that's not how you would administer Milano tank which is she's doing some kind of like a vol she might learn what is that thing that she's doing with a syringe what that looks like a caulking gun like what is she doing picture yeah there's another type of thing like the Kardashians are doing to their cheeks like the fillers I don't know what they're doing cheeks they're doing something that seems like well it's very popular with the young people these days they're taking fat out of certain parts of their body and putting it in their ass right it's not I don't listen we should find out that's getting diaper but just Google how are women today how are Instagram models getting diaper but I'm curious because that's what it is it's what you're using their own so they're taking their fat from somewhere else on their body yes injecting that I know that some people do that we should know some our calves that way we could start at Instagram calf channel no I don't want fat calves with a jiggle and walk like a girl's butt well he's pulling that up what kind of coffee is this this is black rifle coffee it's good yeah it's good stuff yeah I know I figured out something thank you by the way for hooking me up with Trager oh that's great all right I was trying to more lines those are the shit I've been making a coffee rub for this time and coffee rub before yes I have shaker has their own coffee rub yeah well they they have their own I love you Trager but they sometimes never know what all is in some of these spices and rubs you know and sometimes you know multi-deck scenario or instance yeah there's some sugar in there so I find fine grind coffee and I mix that with black Kona salt cayenne pepper and paprika and you can just make that rub as thick as you want put that on the ribeye and I've almost switched completely from doing my my stovetop sear followed by the quick broil on either side to doing like a one-and-a-half to two hours smoke in the Trager mmm that coffee rub on and then just finishing it on the grill with the Trager yeah I did a what would you call it a prime rib you know it so it's that it's basically ribeye roast yeah and I did one on the trigger and I cooked it for like four hours at 220 degrees holy shit you smoked it yeah four hours yes yes and it had does the traitor smoke yes I smoked at that temperature you know this is a super smoked setting at 225 and below okay press the super smoke button and it constantly infuses this pump of smoke look at like it's like whoa I've never tried super smoke at that high of a temperature oh good lord delicious dude and the but the Trager prime rib rub I know it as sugar in its taste - delicious - not but holy shit when it's in there for three and a half four hours and it has that crust on it there's some words some about that long smoke if you try to beer can chicken yeah nothing at all yes beer can chicken so I've tried a bunch of different rubs on that but it's just coarse salt and black pepper works fine for the beer can chicken you empty about half of the beer can out you open up the beer can but then you poke a couple extra holes and the top so you get more of the steam so the inside of the chicken gets even more moist but then when I figured out is if you use like a little little scalpel or exacto knife and you cut open the skin of the chicken around the outside a little bit and you stuff that with pads of butter and then you do your smoke pads of butter inside the chicken that the skin gets crispy super crispy and so you just it's like I think it's like an hour an hour and a half you cook that one and you can't you can't smoke that one very successful like you want to run the grill with the smoke on but you can't super smoke it doesn't seem to work so well but that beer can chicken that's freaking amazing yeah whoever figured that out whatever drunk figured that out is goddamn genius know what I'm gonna do it works but I've wondered before if there are other things that will work even better than beer well you got Jamie it says in most cases what I'm finding is either brazilian butt-lift or just like a fat graft or fat injection mm-hmm but there have been cases where I'm seeing that they had to get an injection taken out within weeks because it was causing a problem so like I don't know if that was just fat well you got the fat put in and you have to get a ticket back out yeah cuz they're gonna they're dying the Abarth great and then you have this fucking war zone of an ass yeah most is like leave some mark Syrian a few pox air strip yeah yeah no more no more g-string 32 people died supposedly in 2017 from wonderful yeah yeah that's like the same amount of people that died from coconuts fall on their head that's a fucking ridiculous way to die you know and here's the thing the what they're doing is not aesthetically pleasing because it violates your sensibilities because you look at the ass and you look at the legs and you go what's wrong here how did you get that ass with those legs they don't go together like if you look at like a CrossFitters legs like one of them powerful gals with a big butt but they all saw us with those knee high knee on compression socks it looks right it fits like if the ass it's the thigh it's not entirely disproportionate yes when the ass pumps out and then it goes these little toothpick legs you like that's gross that's weird you know like it was possible that's real ass Instagram we may be evolving as a species to find these type of things more attractive though because that's a whole idea with social medias you get a dopamine hit every time you click on the little blue notification button or you look at a new photo so maybe we're just gonna eventually develop a real appreciation for that type of symmetry no will redefine alright no no what true human symmetry is incorrect it doesn't look as good it just doesn't look as good it's a it's a cheap fix your squats yeah get your ass to the gym girls do some donuts run up so alright so squats and muscle building did you see that Rhonda Patrick tweeted that study about mice and my own nuclei and how when they when they dope mice they actually they they never actually lose the muscles my own nuclei yeah it's like those don't actually ever disappear it's not never just when you dope which is when you lift period muscle memories yeah already known right also memory muscle memories always been a sort of an anecdotal idea well muscle memory has been in many cases just based on motor unit recruitment like meaning like like my wife she ran for university of idaho and when i go out running with her still even though she doesn't train she just got faster leg turnover she's got better form like her body just remembers that the same thing with the swimmer right do a triathlon somebody swam in college but hasn't swam in ten years we'll kick my ass just because they have that muscle memory the in terms of which which motive units to recruit when sure but this latest one was basically the idea that you retain actual my own nuclei in the muscle like they thought for a long time that those just disappeared and went away once you D train but it turns out that they're all still there so as soon as you start training again you build muscle more quickly and furthermore and this was kind of like the political part of it is if you've done some kind of you know illegal performance-enhancing procedure or steroids or doped or whatever you actually would have a higher concentration of micro nuclei or my own nuclei available there there was a studies and leading up to that and this was I think this was like 2013 like this was a while ago where they took mice and they gave one group testosterone the other group didn't get it and then they spent six months off testosterone I remember how long they were on it but they spent six months off it and then they took those mice and they trained them with the training protocol and the mice that were on the testosterone but were no longer on it had a 30% increase in muscle mass compared to the other mice that only had a 5% increase on it so once again and this was probably related at my own nuclei thing that just came out in this recent study so it turns out that a you should you should live like when you're young because you can build all these my own nuclei that just basically hang around your body and then be when they like ban somebody from sport for doping and then they come back and start to compete in that sport again they still have an advantage hmm well that has huge implications for MMA is this that's the big debate right now how long should someone get suspended for and for how long you know how long afterwards should they be considered enhanced yeah you know like they're giving people some pretty significant suspensions now for steroids like two years but you know there's this John Jones case I'm sure you're aware of the aware of this yeah where he's testing positive for the metabolites for a long-term metabolite for a very small dose he's never tested positive for short-term metabolite 4 testosterone no it's not testosterone it's what is the stuff Torana ball yeah and essentially it's tainted supplement and it's not it doesn't have any performance enhancing benefit in terms of like the the amount of the dosage that he's tested positive for but it's lingering in his system because the protocols for the weather ability rather to detect these metabolites has increased rapidly and over the last year it's just unbelievably more sensitive to the point where you know they're detecting these infinitesimally small levels of these metabolites and there's also seems to be some sort of a pulsing effect when your body releases these infinitesimally small metabolites and then doesn't so you'll test negative and then the next week you'll test positive but only for the long-term metabolites which is an indication there's no readmit astray ssin of the performance-enhancing drug yeah so it's real it's it's and everybody's mad there's some of the athletes that are mad about it and from what you're saying and for this study that dr. Rhonda Patrick highlighted it's you know it's it's a willingly taking something of those like once a doper always a doper type of things there is that but see the John Jones situation is very tricky because he's so good and he's so dominant the people just assume that he's been doing something his whole career yeah you know and when you catch him they're like AHA that's the reason why he's so good yeah it may be but it also might be he's got phenomenal genetics he's too much it was just the best of the guys who are taking drugs that's a different situation because that's a sport where at least in the time period where he was competing everyone was doing something a hundred percent they had to go needles like that it's not right that it's not it's not it can't be they're too strict the you sod is knocking on doors at six o'clock in the morning pee in this Cup and you you do hear about positive tests but the amount of positive tests versus the negative tests is overwhelming way more guys are not doing something it used to be the opposite he used to be in the 90s everyone was doing something yeah we were just talking about this in the fight companion podcast that a big issue is grappling grappling competitions are over with steroid users because no one's testing and these I mean it's the smell test is off the fucking charts you're looking at these guys they're just ridiculous jacked yeah low body fat super high muscle mass and they're training jiu-jitsu all the time too so you would think it would be very hard for them to maintain muscle mass as well as be trained the way they're training with technique and drills and cardio very difficult to maintain muscle yeah any any concurrent strength endurance training scenario very difficult very difficult so there's a real issue with some of these guys competing this way and then trying to transition into MMA yeah now what what's the deal with marijuana in the mmm in MMA much legal now the they don't inches in out of season yeah it's fine they just they've lowered the acceptable level or that they've raised it rather like what you could have in your bloodstream you basically just can't be high the day of the fight yeah yeah and that's another interesting one I mean that acts especially THC acts on a lot of these mTOR pathways you know this that's that's the same thing with a lot of these anti-aging compounds right like rapamycin or you know metformin to a lesser extent axon that mTOR pathway and inhibits it right but again it's it's short term with something like marijuana and you also get this pain killing effect and there was I forget if this was a study or if it was if it was like anecdotal but it's almost like a higher thrill-seeking effect like the endocannabinoid system when stimulated shuts down some of your your your sense of fear when it comes to experiencing a new adventure really and so you actually actually go adventure seeking more and when you look at like ultrarunners anybody who's competing in a non complex activity in which they might have already developed the ability to be able to be in the zone right they've put in their ten thousand hours of practice and they're able to just kind of check out and go into automatic mode when you combine that with the pain quelling effects of something like you know in most cases like a THC CBD combo is what a lot of ultra runners are using I'm not sure what what they'd use in MMA right now but ultimately you get a good effect but but the loss of reaction time and the loss of the ability to be able to perform complex tasks which they proven like flight simulation studies dictates that it's still not that great of a drug if you were going to be doing complex tasks here's the question though when they're talking about reaction studies nothing talking about reaction studies for people that are acclimated to taking marijuana are they talking about it with people where they take uh someone who's a sober person and they introduced them to marijuana and there's this overwhelming effect of it because one of the things that happens to people that aren't accustomed to THC is the freakout effect yeah where they're just like they're not comfortable with the experience after a while the way it's described and again this is all anecdotal but by people that are accustomed to it they say you just get good at being high and see the reaction time thing I don't buy because a lot of Strykers a lot of kickboxers they train but while they're on marijuana it's very common a lot of leave it I mean this one reaction time was done on pilots and there's there's a few more blinky lights in a cockpit than than a mat sure there's more going on sure but that's the the question is are they experienced owners or people that are freaking out and maybe the reaction times they're spacing out and they don't know what the fuck this experience is like and they're they might have anxiety because of it you know there's a lot of really overwhelming sensations that come with that marijuana high and a lot of them you know you call paranoia or oversensitivity and sometimes you get paralysis by analysis when you're under the influence those things work yeah it's the acute versus chronic effect but jiu jitsu personally my personal experience would you Jitsu in marijuana is it's an enhancer and I've argued this that I think it's a performance-enhancing wit with CBD you know with CBD no just just marijuana that's that's what that's what a lot of endurance athletes are you know like like folks in the ultra running complainers and now like they'll use like a trace amount of THC combined with CBD like an 4 to 1 to a 10 to 1 cou THC ratio and I think you know now with the farm bill and increasing legality I think this idea of developing which performance supplements for athletes you know who aren't competing in sports yeah that is banned are gonna be steered in the direction of like high CBD and then some of these other novel molecules where like CBG or CBN I'm not sorry what are the others there's all these different okay now but no it's just terpenes yeah CBG cbn or cannabinoids THC eight is an anti-inflammatory that's totally different than THC nine I'm gonna lace from orally ingesting at or from smoking it or maybe they actually are now isolating these and labs almost like organic chemistry and you you can take hemp or marijuana and you can actually isolate specific compounds and then combine them so you could take like you could take like CBG CBD combine that with other terpenes from like whatever let's say lavender and valerian and chamomile and make like a like a de-stress relaxation type of compound or you could do like a like a THC but a THC eight instead of a THC nine and combine that with like cinnamon and peppermint maybe some caffeine or creatine or something like that to make like more of a pick-me-up type of compound but I think that's that's the wave of the future when it comes to a lot of these these marijuana companies that are developing stuff for specific goals I know a lot of folks that are trying the CBD that use it for information especially athletes like it a little bit of THC they seem to think it's more effective you know there's some sort of combined effect of the THC with the CBD yeah yeah they call that the the entourage effect you know when you have all the different terpenes and the endocannabinoids which ones turtle yeah which ones turtle have no clue so there's hundreds of different different cannabinoids right I don't think there's hundreds what I think there's at least dozens I don't know about hundreds how many of them I mean if you if you look at a chart of the different endocannabinoids they've actually discovered if you're to just google 113 yeah yeah so it's a lot it's a lot of fucking cab annoyed I wonder you know I wonder if they'll be able to like design something that gives you the high without the paranoia or gives you the you know various effects yeah without spacing out yeah I think that's that's where supplementation is going in general right it's just like we were talking about with diet how based on your genetics based on your blood work based on your biomarkers that's how you would choose your diet I mean like you know like the carnivore diet if you're if you're let's say like sub-saharan African or Southeast Asian and you have high levels of you know there are genes for salivary amylase there's one called a my one gene there are genes responsible for you having a higher inflammatory response to saturated fat or a ketogenic diet or there's one called the appo each gene you have only three for which I have dictates that even though I personally did kind of like a higher fat low carbohydrate diet the majority of my fats come from Mediterranean fat sources doesn't olive oil avocado oil fish and I do that because my genetics dictate that you know my macronutrient ratio my diet is gonna is gonna be best suited to that specific ratio of fats but you could say the same thing with supplements you know I think with supplements now with with all these different places that will self quantify you know I like wellness FX an inside track or in 23andme and you can you can take all this data put it together and actually determine you know whatever my everybody's saying was supposed to take two thousand international units of vitamin D a day if your vitamin D levels aren't like 80 or 90 then that could cause arterial calcification if you're taking excess vitamin D I had both myself and my kids tested for our genetics like none of us boys in the Greenfield family actually have the gene that allows us to generate appreciable amounts of vitamin D from sunlight so we all now supplement with vitamin K my boys neither of them possess the enzyme or the or the I guess it is an enzyme superoxide dismutase it's a just gene that allows for increased expression of this enzyme that allows for glutathione production right so they take glutathione now they have the one that results in a lower than normal level BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor the stuff that's like Miracle Grow for the brain so they use lion's mane extract now for school so I like the idea of doing a genetic test and doing a blood test and looking at what your ancestors would have eaten if you happen to have the I guess kind of like it clean enough to interpret ancestral profile to be able to say well here's you know I'm mostly northern European so this is what I'm gonna do well on you combine all that stuff I think you know return to your question about the carnivore diet that's the way to eat this apoe4 is also leaves you predisposed to CTE correct yeah yeah or you have that higher risk now I've got the a PO e 3 n 3 4 3 4 apoe4 4 is the one that's more concerning from okay yeah and you get a very deleterious response in many cases to to fats it's like an inflammatory response to fats that's something very similar like if you had familial hypercholesterolemia you know and you get on like a ketogenic diet for example and your cholesterol goes up to 500 I mean it did it's something that just doesn't agree with a lot of people yeah that's what's really important to discuss right the everybody's body really does respond differently to all sorts of different diets and yeah it's so difficult for people especially if they don't have a lot of research in the field if they don't you know they don't they haven't read a lot about it to try to determine what's the best diet for them yeah there there are there are specific characteristics though that regardless of macronutrient ratios and regardless of food composition you see over and over again in centenarians or in people who are living in a blue zone or people who have the absence of a lot of disease risk factors or a high risk of mortality like we see regular periods of caloric restriction like at some point either a compressed feeding window or intermittent fasting or like you know the Mediterranean diet everybody talks about goat cheese and olive oil and fish and eggs but not a lot of people talk about the religious aspect of that that includes certain periods of time where you fast certain periods of time where you don't eat meat certain days where you aren't drowning all your food in olive oil right and so um you know it's it's a in terms of other characteristics that you see glycemic variability right you see very low periods of glucose fluctuations occurring throughout the day because of a high intake of either fiber or legumes is a big one that you see in the Blue Zones right like high intake of things like lentils and split mung beans and a lot of these things that get thrown under the bus now we're we're talking about lectins and gut damage but ultimately returning back to what I said earlier soaking and sprouting and fermentation makes a lot of those things really not aware that were the issues with so the issue with lectins and this is based on on a book that was published I think about two years ago called the plant paradox by dr. Stephen Gundry and he talks about how lectins are these built in natural plant defense mechanisms that are in primarily plants and seeds and the skins of certain fruits and vegetables that will cause your digestive tract to become damaged or give you a deleterious or inflammatory response to that food kind of a similar argument as the Paleo people make right they say well you don't don't eat dairy because that could have inflammatory proteins in it that might cause an autoimmune reaction or or to donate bread because of the gluten and the phytic acid but when you step back and you look at a lot of a lot of Blue Zones a lot of longevity hotspots a lot of centenarians you don't see avoidance of these foods you see smart preparation of them right when you hunt you don't set up in a tree with a like a dagger in your teeth like Peter Pan and jump out of the tree on the back of a deer and and you know just start eating the deer right like you have to go through a pretty long process of tracking and stalking and hunting and and filled dressing and quartering and even then you know there's a pretty intensive cooking process and we do things like you know like coffee rubs and things to decrease the amount of carcinogens and the meat when you cook it and and we dry aged and you'll take the organ meats and soak them in lemon juice or buttermilk something holding any flavor and blah blah blah but stop stop stop okay hold on I got to do this guy otherwise I forget coffee rubs what is it how does it decrease the amount of carcinogens well Coffee rosemary thyme a lot of these things that we use as rubs one of the benefits of them is they decrease the formation of a lot of these carcinogenic compounds in the meat you know like the burnt charred components of the meat anything that's an antioxidant right and you could you could just go in your spice cover and start to make up rubs based on this concept anything that would be you know these certain precursors that people are talking about now for anti-aging like blueberries and red wine and dark chocolate and dark purple fruits and berries etc you dry those you powder those that's a great rub right because all of a sudden you're decreasing the carcinogenic aspects of burnt meat or charred meat or heavily cooks proteins particularly so the idea is you want to prepare your food in a manner that renders it digestible and that unlocks the nutrients and so when we talk about dietary customization not only do you see calorie restriction compressed feeding windows fasting as one element that regardless of the diet that you choose has been shown to improve health and lifespan but you also see low amounts of glycemic variability you see a high amount of emphasis placed on rendering the food digestible again no matter what it is that you're eating and so you know whether you're eating a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet or a high carb low fat high fat low carb what-have-you the idea is you try to choose real recognizable food then you render that digestible and you eat as many different food groups as you can eat based on self-experimentation primarily until you land on that diet that works well for you and if you can combine that with self quantification blood biomarkers look at your microbiome look at your genetics I mean there's no reason that that most people shouldn't just be able to eat the diet that works for their body but it's a hard thing to discover the the idea that you can figure out what works best for you like what feels best like people start convincing themselves you know that one thing is more beneficial to other and that's one of the things that people wonder about this whole carnivore thing it was like are they mind fucking themselves are they giving themselves a placebo benefit of only eating this way yeah and you just go to Sean Baker's Instagram every day the hashtag meat heals and you're like yes meats healing me and you start bribe it's a try a church it's a religion it's a nutritionist highly religious and dogmatic well the the carnivore diet people are the exact opposite of the vegan people they're the same but different there they're all just preaching that you should only meat and meats the thing and you know and they're mocking vegans and the vegans are mocking the coward you know saying disparaging things about people who eat meat it's really similar issue is the same thing though it's the fact that when you start on a highly restrictive diet that tends to be dogmatic to like I'm gonna wholly eat meat I'm not gonna have meat I'm gonna only eat vegetables you feel pretty good like you feel a difference it's impossible not to feel a difference once you go go completely myopic on your diet and have a very limited number of food choices but we know that vegans build up deficits in creatine in taurine in you know unless they're eating algae and stuff like that in DHA in EPA in fatty acids and amino acids long term deficits and cortisol which affects your cell membranes you can definitely do it right I mean there's dudes like you know freakin rich roll right like great guy and he tin and he's into like the you know fermentation soaking and sprouting it's superfoods and you know it's honestly kind of expensive and time-consuming to do a vegan diet the right way but you could do it a lot of people don't but if you're not careful you build up deficits long term even though you feel really good short term it's the same thing with something like a carnivore diet like you're probably gonna build up some kind of microbiome bacterial deficiencies unless you're eating the intestines of ruminants or I suppose supplementing with some kind of really good probiotic well it's just fascinating because they they find these people that have been doing it for 20 years they they pull these folks out of the woods look look we got this one guy he's been doing it for 18 years look how healthy they are they so show someone doing chin-ups but the reality is you don't really hear about that diet or you didn't really hear about that diet until like three or four years ago right and much more so over the last two years probably because of me accidentally know having all these people on and talking about it and it's it and you know the people like Jordan that have had look it's impossible to deny the benefits that he's gotten the guy looks fantastic it has a tremendous amount of weight and to your point that is most likely because of an elimination diet and whatever was fucking with him before and I think you know most people that start off with a poor diet and then switched to a restricted diet they're just gonna be better because they don't have the stuff that's poor they don't have the trans fats they don't have all the sugar they don't have all the nonsense it's probably causing a good deal the information in the first place so by eliminating all those bad things from their diet and then concentrating on the one thing that they all the only one thing that they're eating you think the one thing they're eating is causing all the benefits when it's probably the lack of the bad things exactly it's a it's a fancy elimination diet so but it's a delicious one it is speaking of delicious who are you hunting at all yes yes I what's your hunt well I mean I'm going through the two elk that I've given away a lot of it to and I shot last year every year I scheduled two elk hunts and assumed I'm gonna strike out and the last two years I've been very lucky and I got two elk each year so that's breaking the rules of the secret and Think and Grow Rich you know to assume you're gonna strike out well I supposed to sit cross-legged in your son and manifest that shadows I don't yeah I work hard but I assume it's a hard thing to do to fucking know it people don't realize now they don't and you look at a clip like there's clips of me online and the clip is like a minute long and it seems like oh look look how easy yeah you don't see stalking in for hours you don't see the hundreds of hours of shooting arrows the coaching from John Dudley all the reading archery articles and understanding what in keeping your mindset clear in the moment it's a lot of difficult to long haul my boys have their first hunt in three months okay and we've been prepping for seven months they're doing bow hunt in Kona pig oh my wife she's going after sheep how old were you have to pay to ten so are you getting him a crossbow no no there right now they're shooting a Hoyt ignite mm-hmm um they're shooting at about 25 yards just a shooting at about 40 yards how many I live in London they're about 45 now which is gonna be enough that's enough if you have oh yeah but I mean there's no contact I mean they're still when they when they draw they're pulling so I've still got a couple more months of training to really get dialed in um but yeah it's it's difficult I still haven't even gotten my elk bow hunting you know I spent my last one I spent six days up in the Colorado mountain range and the the what they called the Santa - crystal range mm-hmm you know and and on the last day I finally came in on elk and it was dark and I shot and I missed mmm and that was after seven fricking days of trying and you walk out tougher I was the show ride your horse out completely empty-handed it's about 45 yards you know you know in dusk but you know I mean you know how it goes you shake until dark and yeah yeah anyways though so I'm gonna do I'm gonna do Kona I would like to get you in touch with Dudley because I know we've talked before I know how you shoot you shoot with a finger trigger shooter yeah yeah I need to it's it's on my list but those moments like that when you you're hunted for six days and you just trekking through the woods 20 miles a day and you're exhausted and you finally get that one moment there's so much weight on that moment that yeah it's so difficult to stay focused entirely on the task of executing the shot perfectly and there's methods there's a guy named Joel Turner who has he's got a website called iron mine hunting he's a he's a he's an instructor for first responders and snipers and things along those lines iron mined iron mine where's he live I think he's a Pacific Northwest guy really and he's helped me tremendously his methods it's all about keeping a the difference between an open-loop system and a closed-loop system being able to control it and stop it and stop the process anytime you want and keeping yourself and that versus like a baseball bat swing which is going to start swinging you to swinging yeah and the idea is to maintain the present empty to have a mantra and he gives you a mantra to chant and to think about it in terms of controlling all of those movements so you are in control kind of your move well you you develop your own but the idea is to talk yourself through it don't let your excitable mind take over you didn't freak out and you pull the trigger and you shoot fuckin over the things back and you don't even know what happened what's your mantra it lost I I pull back and I say draw I go through all the steps in my head that I'm supposed to do I actually modified his and went to John Dudley's so his he has his own one which is draw back and aim get it done watch it to keep it in the hide is just keeping those things in your head so you have one thing but what would Dudley I go through all the different things that he says like draw back tip of the nose Center the peep Center the bubble pull through the shot pull pull pull let the shop break and so I go through all those things in my mind but the whole idea is did not allow the freaked out freaked out is what causes the target panic and when you have that itchy trigger finger with the the finger trigger you'll go yeah and that's that's I've done it I mean I've seen it I've seen it I've heard it everybody does it the arrow goes in the spot you know where you're yanking it and you're point eight it's not very precise you want to get it to where it's a surprise shot yeah and when it's a surprise shot you're just concentrating entirely on the area that you want to hit on the elk your form is perfect everything's aligned in order and if it's not you let down yeah if it's not you let down and try to get your shit together yeah see those trained to hunt competitions helped me out quite a bit I'm sure it's like a 3d shoot but you're turning around and getting exhausted well no not really like like there they do have part of it as like that like an obstacle course race with your bow but then part of it too is just a 3d shoot mmm but like a like a 40 target 3d shoot where one shot might be I'm facing you but the targets behind me and you've got a ten-second time span to draw turn and shoot where you got to take a shot seated through the trees at 40 yards and then within you know 20 seconds do a shot at 60 so they would slaughter hunting scenario Dudley would tell you that that is gonna cause target panic that that whole thing of shoot now that you should never just do that that you should always execute the shot correctly even he doesn't even like this fucking game this thing this techno hunt that we've done he doesn't like that he thinks that that thing causes target panic because you only have a brief window and you like go he's like he believes that you should concentrate entirely on the correct fundamentals and execution of archery and then with time and understanding of the situation the experience of hunting itself then when those moments present themselves you're gonna execute correctly whereas when you have this like 10 second you got to turn and behind your back ready go do you like BA yes you're just gonna hit that you're gonna hammer that trigger you're gonna put that pin on the target and Hammer that trigger and that's just you are emphasizing all the wrong things that you could do when you're hunting yeah yeah let me go to Hawaii next month and do sheep which island go to Ireland is B Kona Cohen I'm gonna do if I like to go down there because you can spear fish you can you can double up into moment spear fish so we'll do sheep and goat pig possibly Turkey and then we'll have a couple days out on the boats and that'll be actually Kyle and Aubrey are going oh yeah yeah I'll be was talking about Peter T is good come with us well the doctor on the trip oh yeah and then the one I'm excited about is dall sheep up in Alaska so I'm gonna do the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that's a float hunt so you're floating about 40 miles down the river I'm very fly into into Fairbanks and there's a fort that you fly in from there on a charter and that'll be dall sheep caribou and grizzly this is it's a ten day hunt and this is a bow hunt as well that'll be a bulb we'll all be all pack like I've got a ya got a Smith & Wesson 44 it's a big-ass gun so I'll pack that and there's probably have a 272 on the faith like if I can make weight when are you hunting weapons are you just avoiding them no I'm hunting dall sheep God that's what I really want that's just an adventurous I'm not much of a trophy hunting guy but I am an adventure guy like I want to and have an amazing adventure let's explain to people why that's an adventure because the the the place where these live is some of the fucking sketchiest ground on earth it's shale rock a lot of it you have to a lot of times you're wearing crampons on your boots you're an extremely high altitude in precarious situations these little cliff peaks long pack outs I'll have a caribou tag and grizzly tag as well so to shoot a grizzly because it's charging you or to shoot a group that would actually be to harvest and eat a grizzly the guy I'm actually pretty you know I'm a cook look at those dall sheep yeah exactly exactly so that is an adventure right there to be able to get to those little specks on that rock so I'll be floating the river we'll be fishing they got arctic char up there few other fish beautiful fish yeah so he's a fatty fish cold water it'll be about 10 to 12 days and then I'll just fly all the meat out and fly a home now grizzly as a meal that's the thing that where people are hearing this and they're going what the fuck are you talking about and I had Donnie Vincent on the podcast he's a he's a really interesting guy very well educated and really really articulate and really like like Rinella in a lot of ways does a great job of explaining what hunting truly is about and the conservation aspect of it but he's a big fan of eating bear and he's oh he's telling people like you know they're all good like if you prepare correctly all bears good yeah apparently the trick is to to get rid of the glands early on when you're field dressing because apparently that taints the meat hmm and I've never field dressed a bear so I don't know but um Stephen Rinella though I love his cookbooks he's close to me he's up in he's up in Bozeman yeah I think yeah I've been trying to get him to come through Spokane and swing into my house to do a podcast so I want to actually ask him some questions about his it was a new cookbook yeah yeah we've connected we've talked a few times I see guys guy get him to come through Spokane I love that guy yeah he's the one who got me the honey yeah yeah that's fun though yeah he's a great cook - he really is he really understands like so many different preparations and tries to get people to try things like osso bucco you know they braise the shanks and yeah yeah yeah yeah I love that no how about spearfishing have you gotten into into those fishing free diving scene at all I was in Hawaii recently my youngest daughter is obsessed with fishing she fucking loves it and we caught a bunch of yellowtail when we were in Hawaii this last trip and now she's super hooked cuz you know she's eight and she's hanging on to this rod and you know I mean I was sometimes I was helping her like I was holding the rod and she was with her two little arms cranking these yellow tails and you know you catch a 10-pound yellowtail when you're eight years old and the fucking that's all right oh my god they're so powerful it's a fight I took my boys out for steelhead yeah and you know my my boy Taryn he almost got pulled into the water on North Fork of the Clearwater big steelhead I mean those things are massive what is it deals Meghan's deal we're not supposed to eat them right you're supposed to let them go it depends there's a certain I forget that I forget the color but there's a certain style of steelhead that you are allowed to he had to throw this one bag this wasn't the one I don't I don't totally understand that I mean I kind of understand it but it seems to me like it is it's an ocean bound rainbow trout correct yeah exactly so why can't you eat I don't know I don't know then and there's there's a certain variety that you actually can't eat well you you can eat it physically but you know I mean I mean legally yeah but that seems so strange to me is the idea to protect the population because they're in the process of breeding and you don't wanna interrupt but you're not there's a certain mortality rate that they're accepting with catch and release this is one of the reasons why I have an issue with that and I've done catch and release fishing I don't want to appear like I'm a hypocrite cause it is fun but there's a thing about it is like you're just shoving a hook and in things face yeah and then releasing them that's that is why I like spear fishing because you're underwater you're going after the exact fish that you want yeah there's no doubt in your mind I'm gonna shoot that fish and you're not wondering what's gonna bite the hook right like whether it's gonna be a legal one mm-hmm or an illigal one regardless of whether you get a fish it's amazing you're happy you see the coral you're getting you know you're going down and up there's there's all like if you're in the fitness the cold thermogenesis and the breath hold and the spleen compression and the red blood cell production so I mean it's it's an amazing workout mm-hmm um it's just fun it's a Zen yeah they wouldn't let my daughter do it though she's too young they said you have to be 13 so Spearfish should tell you like shallow water with a singing and that's that's the way to do it is you want to start offshore 8 to 15 feet of water you want to easy sling you know a lot of people think spear fishing and they think of like the big roller guns that you gotta like put the handle against your chest and pull back right it's very difficult and then you got a dive to depths you know for if you're going after tuna yeah I mean will it go like 30-plus feet and you have a floater and it's a very involved process but if you're just like in freakin Hawaii and you've got a sling and a good spot and some coral and some good fins and you can just basically swim away mom you know I'll tie a string around my waist and put a little knife on my belt and you can just go out there and you know string four or five fish and it's an easy day its ton of fun yeah and it's almost like it's not fishing he'd call it spearfishing but you're basically hunting underwater they're hunting underwater yeah they even have that I haven't done this yet but maybe you've seen these these underwater bows you can you can shoot a bow with the fish yeah it's a bow I don't think all bow fishing or what but have you seen this I've seen something like it yeah I know there's a lot of bow fishing that people do they're shooting down at Fairleigh gar an alligator gar I'm particularly well know it's supposed to be really good smoked early it's such a weird looking animal it's almost seems like in my mind I almost feel like you shouldn't shoot it because it's a dinosaur yeah keep it alive because yeah they they really haven't changed in millions of years yeah such a freaky look they're fun to prepare though I'll do a fish feed after spear fish you're all cold you're hungry last one I did we had a pair of fish don't know why stuffed with avocado and mango coconut oil baked it in the oven with macadamia nut like encrusted macadamia nut pair of fish of the workers that are eating the coral and shitting out white sand I don't know yeah did you know you've watched more nature TV than I have that's what white sand is it's shit really yeah believe it or not it's like these yeah these fish eat coral chew it up and shit out the whites and so like a giant white sand beach like Clearwater Florida that's all fish shit parrot fish poop makes beautiful beaches there's the article answer I wonder if it's good for your and wonder if it's good for your microbiome out on bacteria these motherfuckers are out there just eating rocks that's a lot of shit it's a lot of parrotfish over a very long period of time millions making a lot of shit like here you go you can see that they're chewing on the coral they bang it out they have like a beak essentially that's why they call them parrotfish they smash down that coral and then all that white around them is they're just basically swimming around their own shit that's pretty cool crazy that's pretty cool very strange like that yeah um I was gonna ask you something um metformin you started talking about David yes it's in Claire you can take that yes the metformin maybe I don't know it seems weird because that one's a drug it's like it's like the darling of the anti-aging industry right you know it's like a nickel a pop and it's it's you know hits mTOR to a certain extent but the big deal with that is is glycemic variability reduce risk of chronic disease but there's a lot of side effects of that really want to mention that okay so you're saying that there's none no there's lactic acidosis and it inhibits the the electron transport chain in the mitochondria which is fine if you want down regulate metabolism live a long time but not if you know if you're an athlete you want to inhibit mitochondrial respiration necessarily um vitamin b12 deficiencies like it's derived from French rue and physicians for for hundreds of years been using it but in limited quantities because it induces nausea you say get gastrointestinal disturbances might take on metformin because because I've been looking over the past year into a lot of these anti-aging compounds that people are now using or talking about using like rapa myosin and metformin and nad and a lot of these sirtuin precursors but metformin and repre myosin actually for for different reasons because that's an immune system suppressor or to that I don't think I would ever take really cuz with myth for there are a variety of natural compounds that reduce blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity in the absence of that like berberine curcumin apple cider vinegar Ceylon cinnamon bitter melon extract and you think all those things are mimicking what metformin is capable of doing I think so I'm not wearing it right now but usually I wear a Dexcom g6 it's a continuous blood glucose monitor it actually fell off yesterday when I was doing that exercise that's one of those ones who sees diabetics where the stick sends my blood glucose to my cell phone I learn all sorts of interesting things like my blood glucose would spike in the mornings like clockwork about 8 a.m. every morning and I was trying to figure out like why is my blood glucose going to 120 130 every single morning well I'd have a cup of coffee in the morning and even though I don't put cream or sugar in my coffee I just drink straight-up black coffee coffee actually causes your liver to engage in something called glycogenolysis so you actually release glucose into the bloodstream which is a good thing that's why you drink coffee you you want that cortisol release that glucose hit you know maybe you want the flavor and the antioxidants too but I would get a blood glucose response from coffee hmm another one that surprised me was green beans you talk about legumes you talk about slow-release carbohydrates and it falls into that category but my blood glucose would go up whenever I'd have green beans so I actually got food allergy tests through this company called cyrex they do like a really good food allergy test that doesn't give you this big laundry list of false positives like like there's like the ELISA and the al cat test like the skin prick tests you just get like a very small number of foods that you're actually allergic to there's a lot of these other tests they'll show a bunch of antibodies to food but it's antibodies to fuchs you're eating that food alright so so many people will be like to to them I'm allergic to eggs I got a test down allergic to eggs and I'm depressed because that was a big staple in my diet well it's only showing that you're allergic to him because they were staple in your diet because you're eating a lot of eggs and you're winding up with a lot of those egg proteins in your bloodstream but this this cyrex man explained that so basically if if you're eating a lot of eggs you actually have a lot of egg proteins circulating in your bloodstream and if you get a food panel you actually can very readily purr like a food allergy panel you produce antibodies to the egg protein and they say that you're allergic to the egg protein when in fact you just have a lot of egg proteins in your system because you've been eating a lot of eggs and sometimes they'll even test the white blood cell reaction to a raw egg not a cooked egg right and so your white blood cells are going to react more readily to a raw egg versus cooked egg or raw chicken versus cooked chicken I don't think a lot of these food allergy panels without accurate for that reason I think they're just giving you a laundry list of foods that you may or may not be allergic to mmm but this one is called it's called cyrex I've have no financial affiliation or like that with this company but I just think they do a good job with their testing they you got to order through a physician and I ordered this test and I was allergic to almost nothing like barely anything would spike for me like a kind of like a moderate spike for gluten green beans they were off the chart off the chart so that continuous blood glucose monitor was actually able to tell me that I was eating something that my sympathetic nervous system was responding to I was going to fight in flight mode releasing a bunch of glucose and I never would have really known that or gotten a clue about that unless I was wearing one of these continuous blood glucose monitors I'm not gonna wearing my whole life but I'm gonna wear it my plan is to wear for a year to just learn a lot about the foods that I usually eat what they do to my body what certain workouts do what certain supplements do about returning to metformin I started to use a lot of these things like bear brain like curcumin you can do a shot of apple cider vinegar before a meal take a couple of teaspoons of ceylon cinnamon and your smoothie and these things actually have an effect on blood glucose that mimics what you're trying to get when you take metformin doing is just limiting blood like I mentioned earlier it does inhibit mTOR a little bit right so so you get that mTOR in a bitch but you can inhibit mTOR through like calorie restriction fasting done regularly or like a compressed feeding window should have had you here yesterday yes there's there's should have had you here to talk to David singing I want to finish listening to that interview too because he's a very smart guy but I I just I'm not enamored with Foreman well he's not a better more natural alternatives he's an athlete he barely works out and a lot of side a little bit it does like a little bit of run a little bit of lifting but you could tell he's not he's not a guy who's really yeah exerting himself rigorously to me I want the marriage of performance in-law job yes right I don't want to live a long time if I can't kick ass Biggs I don't want to be cold and hungry and libido listen left home 150 like no I want to even if that means I'm gonna live to him 145 instead of 150 right because I've got more muscle mass or whatever like I want to feel good so whenever I'm looking at a compound like that I'm questioning whether or not it's it's the best way to go if it's going to inhibit my actual performance right his alternatives he's so focused on longevity yeah yeah but you could say that about a lot of these things I mean like like cryotherapy chambers right I mean you look at the the Cherokee Native American tribe would dip their babies in icy cold water till they were like two years old or the there's that the viral video footage of the Siberian schoolchildren I don't know if you've seen this one they they rush out into the snow during recess and their underpants and they dump cold water on themselves and run around the snow and come back inside and in Iceland based on some of the research that was done a few decades ago on immune system they let their babies sleep outside like sub-zero temperatures in strollers yeah Wow you know the Russians the Finnish the Eastern Europeans they've all about their their cryotherapy like the Baltic Sea you know you go back and forth and I go to Finland they've got the men's Finnish sauna Society there's no crowd therapy chambers and was just old-school saunas and then you go jump in the sea and you dry yourself off in the air then you go back in the sauna so yeah you know a lot of these things there's natural alternatives yeah and and I I get flak a lot of the time because I'm you know I'm one of these so-called biohackers I have like the the laser lights in my office that I shine on my balls and I've got like the you know the lights that go in your ears and I've got you know the the stem cells and IVs and injections but I always always want to make sure people know that you go after the natural stuff first mmm like natural ways to get cold natural ways to get hot if you're gonna buy some expensive pulsed electromagnetic field Matt you sure as hell be better be going outside barefoot right like our camping or sleeping outside or learning how to earth and ground in a more natural way what do you what is involved in earthing and grounding is there a real yeah there is research especially in terms of a reduction in inflammation and improvement in joint comfort that's a very interesting one and then when you take these same frequencies so that the earth naturally emits somewhere in the range of about 3 to 100 Hertz electromagnetic frequencies like way lower than that in the you know million Hertz frequencies again when you hold your cell phone up Siri air but we're walking around on basically a giant electrical mat like there's a radiation electromagnetic frequencies or at least by earth and the idea is that these fancy devices now these mats that you can sleep on or do therapy on there's there's like I've got one in my basement that just packs a punch like who is using the race horsing industry for a long time it's called a pulse Centers and you lay on that thing it just like vibrates your whole body what is it is it reduces inflammation if you think of it like exercise for your cells it's opening and closing the cell membrane so you get this blood flow it's called a pulse centers it's like a giant table pulse centered it's got different coils yeah yeah it's its pulse pulse centers is the name of the company that makes answers or sense centers centers but it's got like attachments like coils and pads that you can attach to your knee or attach it like a bum shoulder or whatever I'll just sit in there and work on my computer I get a massage on it every week for a couple hours so it's taking the same frequencies you get from the earth and just magnifying those just delivering them in a more concentrated manner the same thing with like a like an infrared light panel I don't know if you've seen these before they deliver near-infrared far infrared red light people will strip off their clothes and stand in front of these things to get more collagen production or you know in the same way that that light that I was talking about for your head can enhance mitochondrial activity neural tissue your your balls are basically little eyes they have photoreceptors on them they respond to light you can actually increase mitochondrial activity in the testicles the lading cells and the testes to increase testosterone or increase sperm production so you shoot a light in your balls oh yeah it is you grow more you test you go outside and you did sunbathe nude or you'd use one of these lights and just stand in front like I literally I look look like an idiot at work but this is what I do I've got a light panel in front of me right I'm at a standing desk I work at a standing desk I've got a light panel behind me and every day for 20 minutes I just take my clothes off at work and I stand sandwiched in between these light panels and it basically blasts me with this red light but I also go out in the Sun right like if I've got the option to do that versus get outside in the sunlight I go out under the sunlight if I've got the option to take berberine and bitter melon extract instead of metformin I'd rather take the barren the bitter melon extract so I think it just strips up down and go as natural as possible and then once you step up to the more advanced you know anti-aging strategies or biohacking strategies or what-have-you you still have to look at those with a skeptical eye and ask yourself whether or not those are those are really safe or if they have side effects that might you know in many cases limit your physical performance and why do you prefer a standing desk well the whole sitting is the new smoking thing I disagree with I think I think sitting is just fine like it feels natural to set doesn't feel like you're breaking some rule of the human body to sit down like we're sitting down right now it feels pretty good the problem with sitting is that that is the posture most people are adopting for eight hours per day right the best position to be in when you're working would be whatever position you're not in at the moment saying you know when you look at weight training this would not apply to hypertrophy which would dictate that you want to hit a muscle over and over again using the same angle with increasingly difficult loads but for metabolic training you would want to actually throw curve balls at your body right you would the best workout therefore would be the one that you're not doing right now if your goal was was just to limit any type of metabolic efficiency so the idea with the standing desk is I have that to give me yet another position to be in during the day so I've got it I've got a trueform treadmill and I had true form modify it to take the dashboard off so I've got that in front of my standing workstation and then I've got one of these balance boards that I can stand on and I've got like a stool that I can lean against so I've got all these different positions that I can be in during the day and then I've got that that a pole centers chair in my office that I can go and sit in so every 25 minutes I'll just shift to a different position and my stand-up desk is a hand-cranked stand-up desk so I can crank it up and down if I do want to sit at my desk it just it just works you know it's it's it's the idea of hacking your environment of equipping your environment to be in as many different positions as possible so I think that's the key to feeling good at work especially you're stuck indoors do you believe in one of those have you seen one of those it's a you stand at your standing desk on this variable sort of surface have you seen those things where it's like a topographical Matt call the topo the one like in our Boulder offices for my company we've got the standup desks that go up you push a button and they go up and down but then what we have is just scattered around the office a few of those mats we've got some of the if you've seen these fluids dance things they like kind of like skateboards that you stand on top of but they're not they're not as gnarly as a balance board so you can still focus while you're standing on top of it um you know we've got different stools different chairs that will go up or down so again like even if you're in a corporate office I surprises me how many people in there in their corporate offices don't equip their employees just to be able to move during the day yeah yeah they don't care yeah yeah and the most people aren't using organ Amish chairs either yeah yeah what do you use as your as your main chair Freese anomic chair these chairs that we asked for sit in right it's what I'm sitting in right now Pisco I feel like I'm not using it to its full capacity it's excellent what what are the what's the purpose of the way that this is shaped right after this he kind of leaned on it in a weird way put your elbows on and if you like but it encourages you to have an upright posture I've got this thing called a Mogo upright it's a and I can even travel with it because it will compress it weighs about two pounds mm-hm and you can actually lean against that and get into some different positions on that one what does that company that sent us something they have one that's basically almost like it's on a spring where you kind of have to balance yourself out you have to like active even more just to be I saw one of those at a chiropractic event once it's like kind of makes you squeeze your pelvis while you're in the chair but there's actually there's this dude in Finland um he's got a company called Sally s a ll I he used to ride horses and he decided to start making chairs that would get him into the same right position that he'd be in we have riding the whole chair yeah it's a saddle chair there's one oh yeah I have one of those too that Reza's pet my kitchen table that's shit yeah really yeah it feels like your balls are sandwiched in between these two planks I think the arm Nazis or so you can spin around if you want to sit like AC Slater style that's like a spider style chair backwards oh those saddle chairs they they've got like little allen keys that come with them and you can adjust to your pelvic width no it mean defense my with it's just weird these be all those injections you've been doing just give it a guess white and pelvis that was my main chair for a long time to Saturday but then when I started using these capisco chairs it's way more comfortable yeah well if you're sitting for a long time yes yeah yeah it's just it's easy and I have no back pain when I use a regular office chair and I sit for long periods of time I get that Center back pain from just just poor posture just so yeah in a curved stance or curved position what about a treadmill desk you tried one of those no no see I can't do a lot on the treadmill desk production-wise but if I'm ever let if somebody's interviewing me like on skype on a podcast I'm doing a console call with somebody I'm reviewing blood work or something like that I'll be walking on my treadmill and then I've got my microphone in front of me and I have this program called Dragon Dictation and Dragon Dictation allows me to talk like a headset yeah and it'll type the words on the screen how you seize that a long time ago but apparently I moved leaps and bounds yeah it's called training your dragon via the Sofitel train your dragon and so you say all these words you read all these paragraphs and learns to identify your phrasing right volume of your voice and it gets more accurate but it's way better than the built-in Apple whatever yeah voice recognition software yeah so it works and I like that because then I can just walk I can I can talk emails I can talk with people so there's like three or four different things that I do at work that I will walk during yeah that makes sense that makes sense I write when I'm just completely alone and quiet staring at a computer because I want to spend time on each individual word and really concentrate on what the fuck I'm saying because in most the time of writing stand-up so I need to bounce it back and forth and to talk it out it's not really the right strategy yeah yeah I I'm working on a book right now and what I found is for me I have to have a triggered environment like a place in my house that when I go to that place that's the place where your mind says okay this is a writing spot for me it's it's this chair in the corner of the living room outside of my office as soon as I get into that thing it's like riding mode right right and I just I just go Pomodoro all right for 25 minutes get up take a five-minute break come back that's how I do it environment to write in yeah an environment in a good time like a specific time to write is good to like well you know hey now it's X amount you know it's X time that's that's why I write yeah yeah that's the idea behind all this new research they're doing on morning nough Steve meanest chrono types different people being night owls versus morning larks even there there was was a study I was looking at yesterday about the response to like an inflammatory stress or I don't remember what the stressor was but like when a morning type is stressed out in the morning they handle it better than when they're stressed in the evening and vice versa and it's very interesting this research on chrono types I like the idea of just just being able to shift your circadian rhythm because I travel a lot like I haven't been home in 17 days I've got two more days on the road and then I'll be I'll be home but when I'm going east to west or west to east I used light a lot to reset my circadian biology and call the zeitgeist or CAD in biology so like eating is one you want to wait to eat until it's actual meal time in whatever area of the world that you're traveling to so if you arrive in whatever you know New York City from California 3 p.m. you don't want to eat a bite of food until like 7 p.m. when it's actual dinner because that helps to regulate your circadian rhythm movement is another one like you want to get outside go for a walk go for a swim go hit the gym I found that that's a big one for me whenever I travel the first thing I do is I check in I go right to the gym yeah outside take off my shoes and go outside that's good too I've been but for me like a rigorous workout makes all the difference in the world in terms of like how I actually feel yeah when I'm if I'm training if I'm traveling a lot and doing shows and I mean oh you don't want to you get to a hotel room we just want to lay down and relax yes I defy that urge yeah I just go straight to the gym yeah that's what I find if you if you shut up the inner bitch and make it through the first two minutes you're good to go yeah but light is the biggie light is the biggie so I've got like the I've got these buds that make light that go on my ears you make light into your ear and you have photoreceptors in your ears photoreceptors all over your body that's why if you were a sleep mask to go to bed you still have to make the room dark because you have photoreceptors on your skin I've got the one that I was talking about that I wear on my head that one's called a that one's called a V light the one that goes in your ears is called a human charger and then I've got the one that goes in the eyes that one's called a retie mer and that one makes like this greenish blue light that's not damaging to your retina but that just blasts your entire skull with light so I've got light on my eyes light on my ears and light on my head and I'll flip those lights on back in front of the body and that's homes set up to get my circadian rhythm restored so what I do is if I've been back east right and my body that's 4:00 a.m. Pacific time is telling me it's 7 a.m. because I'm on Eastern Time my circadian clock is on Eastern Time what I do is I wake up oh I'm gonna lay in bed for three hours waiting wait until the time when I actually do want to get up what I do is I wake up I get out of bed and I put on those blue light blocking glasses the ones that you're supposed to wear at night right you know like the yellowish orange lenses but I block all light so I'm basically just walking around and pretty dim setting in my house you know I'll make coffee sometimes or have some water stretch out get some work done but I've got the light blocked the whole time and then whenever the time rolls around when I actually want to start waking up all right let's say I'm like 6:00 a.m. I don't want to wake up at 4:00 a.m. I want to wake up at 6:00 a.m. then I'll go down my office and I'll put on the eye thing the ear thing the head thing the light in front of you picture you little eyes behind me I need to see if I've done it on an IG story before and then you just blast yourself like 20 minutes and if I do that for two or three days like my circadian rhythms just right back on time right back on time and I and I mean I fall asleep but I'm supposed to fall asleep you know I got a better like 10:00 p.m. I get up about 6:00 a.m. and that's that's my cycle every day but I just blast myself with light when I get for me lack of food is a good one you know make sure you use some sort of fasting in order you know to regulate everything when you're traveling and then exercise those are the two big ones yeah and then eating after after rigorous training puts everything sort of back into perspective how do you fast what's your fasting protocol 16 hours every night every single night now one or two nights a week I'll fuck off what about like longer fasts during I don't I had at all no I haven't done that I started doing it yeah I started last year it's my protocol now is 12 to 16 hours intermittent fast every day Christmas Thanksgiving what it like as soon as I stop it and I'm competitive I'll set my watch if I finish eating at 8 p.m. I don't need again till 8 a.m. if I finish eating at midnight then I don't eat again until you know I give a midnight first snack I won't eat again till lunch at least 12 p.m. so I do that every day and then what I started doing once Valter Longo came out with his research on the longevity diet and this whole idea of a fasting mimicking diet inducing cellular auto financing longevity to the same extent as if you were just do like a pure water fast or stop eating so what you do is on a quarterly basis four times a year you restrict the normal amount of calories that you would eat to 40% of what you'd normally eat so maybe you're doing maybe you're just dropping one meal or for every meal that you eat you're eating a little bit less and you do this for five days on a quarterly basis I started doing that last year and I just have like this stew that I make with split mung beans and basmati rice and it's called it's called Kittery it's an Indian Ayurvedic cleansing stew dr. Longos company el nutria sends out these kits called pro lawn kits that are all done for you but I just wanted it to make make my own stew that's easy for me I put a little coconut yogurt on it and that's just breakfast lunch and dinner for me for five days in a row it's almost like a like a seasonal cleaning so you do that four times a year and the only other thing that I do is one or two times a month I try to go from Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner without eating so it's almost a 24-hour fast and with those three things 12/6 Nariman fast quarterly five-day like modified fast and then the 24-hour fast one to two times a month that's sustainable for me I could still perform I could still work out um I think I think that's the way to go how do you feel when you do that 24 hour fast does it work out that's 2 p.m. you get hungry not 2 p.m. in the afternoon on Sunday because what I'll do is I'll have dinner on Saturday and then I'll wait the whole day and I don't have a big Sunday dinner and honestly it doesn't affect the workouts that much because the magic of fasting seems to be the compressed feeding window and not the calorie restriction right this returns to not wanting to be hungry and cold and libido less if you're gonna live a long time so the idea is that you could fast from Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner and have a giant rib eye steak sweet potato fry a red wine dark chocolate halo top ice cream whatever you whatever you want at the end of the dance they eat 3,500 calories and then you're justyou're topped off and you're ready for the next day and you have a long period in which you're engaged in cellular cleanup cellular auto feature but you kind of get to have your cake and eat it too because you have a bunch of calories at the end of that are you drinking coffee yeah so coffees fine I was actually surprised you didn't ask me when I brought in the sourdough bread and the and the coconut macaroons and everything if they would take you out of ketosis or break your fast I get that question a lot now well people are like well people people want to know if the butter in your coffee you know putting 800 calories of butter and your coffee is gonna break your fast but basically the idea is if it has calories it breaks your fast it doesn't have calories it doesn't break your fast zero powers it's negligible it's like a few cholesterol molecules and like the what they call a coffee stall in the kawah all its and even that if you use a paper filter you're filtering a lot of that out that's actually why I like French press because you're not filtering some of those like brain spinning compounds out have you fucked around with any of that for sig Matic mushroom coughing yeah like that stuff that's actually that's actually before I came over here I had a cup of coffee and I had a pack of that for sig Matic Lyons yes good for cognition yeah I I've been drinking there those little packets yeah a fantastic it's a sponsor now yeah yeah I know that fan tarot he lives down in Venice Beach smart guy they do they do a good job with their mushrooms so so anything that has calories gonna take out of fat but I'll drink black coffee green tea both of those enhance your fatty acid burning so it's actually enhancing the benefits of a fast occasionally if I'm gonna do a pretty epic workout the two things that I'll use in combo are ketone esters with essential amino acids you combine those very low number of calories but that's like rocket fuel how much you get cannibalism about 10 grams of essential amino acids and the ketones what I've been doing is a shot glass of this stuff called its ketone aid and then there's another company called HV MN that does like it they all taste like ass but you combine those with like a little bit of amino acid so you have high ketones high amino acids neither of those are insulin hygienic so it still keeps you in a relatively fasted state if you want to go to a hard workout or maintain muscle or whatever what about your zips mushrooms you ever fuck around with those and they're amazing yeah yeah I like cordyceps they seem to act primarily on some of the some of the pathways for oxygenation have we gotten you ready action on a true telling' yeah I've got all that I've got all the on it and stuff yeah true tech is good actually for Signet does it does it cordyceps as well but the other one the the lion's mane what I've been doing I'll do this about two times a week just take a very small amount of psilocybin about 0.2 grams of psilocybin and you take two packets of that lion's mane the the four significant lion's mane extract and then anything that increases blood flow so it could be like beetroot any nitric oxide precursors you could probably try shroom Tek um niacin a lot of people use niacin but you combine anything that increases blood flow couple map packets of the lion's mane and then about 0.2 grams of psilocybin and the cognitive picked me up you get from that is profound mmm I mean you know that psilocybin increases your sensory perception your ability to pick out color smell sense temperature etc but just for getting through a day of work or even like going on a long hike or I'm I would not be surprised if our ancestors used psilocybin for hunting because you actually do get a pretty good increase in sensory perception smell and sight from it and visual acuity as well yeah but that mix works really well we're 80 the lion's mane along with the with the psilocybin extract it makes sense that there would be some sort of a symbiotic benefit to combining those sort of mushrooms together yeah yeah yeah well it's like that uh we were talking about this last time that doctrine of signatures the idea that what things look like in nature could actually give you clues about their benefit for the body and when you find lion's mane I don't if you've seen it in nature but it looks like this cluster of axons and dendrites like it looks like brain cells you know up close see if you can find it yes look up those lines pretty badass looking or like there's a lot of stuff like that like um there's this place in kawaii you know I go to called kawaii organic pharmacy and they just grow on this tiny little two acre farm all these different superfoods like you know noni and cacao and they've got comfrey there and if you dig up the root of a comfrey plant there it is yeah that's Lyons mat is create a great name yeah but it also looks like dendrites and axons and neurons so it's very cool um what a threesome pleasing plant I I have yet to actually find it in nature but apparently you could find it up and up in the Inland Northwest where I live anyways though comfrey they call it nits bone and the roots look like knuckles and joints and human bones and it's very good for healing up fractures or for making like a plaster for your joints a plastic Humphrey plane a plaster yeah well what-what that that farm seen kawaii does they grind it into a powder and then you reconstitute that with water and you smear it like over a shoulder joint they could just use like a like a t-shirt or whatever to hold it on there an ace bandage and it actually increases the speed of bone healing or joint healing like it like it's an anti-inflammatory they do like a like a muscle cream with the two made out of the comfrey so it's very interesting there's there's all sorts of different different things in nature that give you clues you know like the carrots and the eggs for your eyes or the walnuts for the brain I think there's something to it that well how does that stuff increase your bone healing like what is it doing what's the mechanism I don't know I don't know it might be like some way of mineral delivery through the skin something like that I've been blown away by CBD by using putting CBD over muscle trees a lot of companies do you like you know what the trick with that is one of the guys one of the doctors who work with Tour de France teams was showing me this you have an electrical muscle stimulation unit I do I go mark pro or a compacts or what have you yeah I got a cop so you put your your CBD oil on your magnesium or your arnica your trommel whatever it is that using and you rub that in then you put the electrodes on top of that mm-hm and then you put an ice pack on top of that these three things you've got the the cream or lotion you've got the electrodes and then you've got the the topical thing that holds it on and the electricity drives the anti-inflammatory deeper into the tissue so it enhances the effect of like a CBD oil or a magnesium and the ice allows you to turn up the electricity to a higher level without getting uncomfortable so I do this at home I use one called a called a mark pro and just kind of surround the area that's actually you know torn or that's painful and I'll do a rub like that but you're right CBD oil works amazingly for that yeah that stuff is it's it's remarkable because it's you're you're putting on the surface of your skin and it's it it's weird how it can get all the way deep into a muscle or into a joint yeah like a lot of people use it with knee pain and it's just it's remarkable how sore skin is a mouth yeah that's why some of those personal care products are kind of scary but a CBD personal care product yeah like personal care but that like parabens and phthalates and you know estrogen you know the phytoestrogens and then to couldn't disruptors and stuff like that in them I mean you know they've done studies where you know like like guys will like take a shower with the average shampoo that's got you know like parabens and phthalates and these things that can be endocrine disrupters or or phytoestrogens you know mimic estrogen in a man's body and they actually within a short period of time after taking the shower and using these care products you can actually detect this stuff in their urine like your body is actually soaking this up and absorbing it is the very very interesting book I interviewed this guy my podcast is called Astro generation about how many guys have really high estrogen levels now from primarily their personal care products real or their household cleaning chemicals so it's true that stuff trying to turn you into a bitch yeah is more or less you guys house you see a bunch of sweet-smelling shampoos like surprise me like like when I race for for a team Timex we used to train out at the the giant Stadium in New Jersey and I go in the locker room there and it's just like this you'd think that the peak of performance in professional sports would have started looking into by this point how could you keep testosterone as high as possible on a male athletes body right but you walk into the bathroom and it's just like every endocrine disruptor known to man just like lined up in a pretty shiny row there on the Shelf in front of the men you know the shaving cream and the shampoos and the spray do ya I mean any it not all shaving cream right but if it's if it's something that has those kind of chemicals and absolutely have you ever used dr. Carver's shave butter and that sounds familiar it said it's a dollar shave club product it's the most incredible shaving cream of all time like you know regular shaving cream you won't you just won't use it after you try that stuff I think I've tried that because this probably happens to you you get lots of lots of personal care products since our since your studio yeah but that stuff blows me away it's like a butter I mean it's called the dr. Carver's yeah huh yeah interesting I'll get them on I'll have to try you're gonna be blown away but I don't have to shave that much so don't have them sent very much you don't you don't grow a lot of I grow a lot of facial hair no no but yeah these that's all you're experimenting you'd think something would have sprouted but you'd think it'd be kind of weird like it'd just be like one right-side patch of the chin right that's like a hair but there's a mole attached to the hair do you ever wonder let's go let's go yourself stem cells bleeding at the end occasionally that like there's some of the stuff on stem cells that admittedly are a little bit of like a venture into human experimentation without robust evidence of safety how about the one we shot into your dick yeah that's example yeah but uh I'm kind of shifting my whole philosophy on stem cells to kind of go after stuff from my own body as much as possible don't matter of being autologous you know your own like that one I did in New York City it says it's not somebody else's law rights just write my own stuff or you know in some cases you could argue that placental or umbilical or amniotic cell are so young and so pluripotent you know and if they don't have the the the the DNA and the nucleus which apparently they can they can kill off somehow which is how they make exosomes you're not getting somebody else's DNA you know it's it's it's just something your body would have made anyways and recognize itself so yeah some sometimes though um sometimes though I probably have taken it too far with a few of those things but uh but the CBD that you were talking about I'm a huge fan of I take CBD before bed every night Oh whirly a lot of it yeah when I look at the studies on CBD for anxiety and for sleep most of them are pushing 100 and up to 900 milligrams which is nuts when you look at the actual serving size of the average CBD tincture or capsule or pill it's like 10 mm-hmm so you gotta take a lot of it but I sleep like a baby like last night I got the the ring that I do my sleeps Quan I slept eight and a half hours last night and I take a hundred milligrams of CBD I take a little bit of melatonin and I'm just out but yeah I take a lot of it and you wake up kind of groggy when you do ritalin but if you're used to that and you know like you get up shake it off ten minutes later you're good to go what's the rugby was coming well totally just over stimulation of the endocannabinoid system there's like super relaxed which I want to be when I sleep right of course yeah yeah yeah it works what about regular marijuana does that affect your sleep you find it beneficial or no so CBD can enhance your deep sleep cycles alright which is which is when a good majority of your neuronal repair and recovery occurs THC allows you to sleep and it actually decreases sleep latency how long it takes you to fall asleep but it does reduce the amount of time you spend in deep sleep right so if you're if you're one of those people whose mind races who's hyper charged up when it you know and you got to get to sleep at night use THC like you know hit of a pen or whatever but know that you might miss out on some of the things you want during deep sleep memory consolidation neuronal repair and recovery you know nervous system repair but it's still pretty decent sleep you're not getting as much of a reduction in deep sleep as you would get if you were to be taking like ambien or valium or something that's literally just like a sledgehammer for your frontal cortex that knocks you out but you almost get no deep sleep so if you do this we were to get like a sleep tracker and test your deep sleep levels you would find that with CBD you don't fall asleep as fast but you get higher deep sleep levels and then with THC you can fall asleep faster but your deep sleep isn't quite as high when you consider that CBD can counteract a lot of effects of THC then that means that what you could try is take THC - why to fall asleep faster but then pile a whole bunch of CBD on top of that and I've done that before - where you just take a hit on a vape pen and then take a bunch of CBD and you shoot for the best of both worlds yeah folks that are taking ambient I mean that is I mean especially people that are doing it virtually every night that has got to have a profound effect on your brain's ability to recover I think there are a lot of people shorting themselves on life we're taking ambien or valium I mean I I think to start with sleep you need to rely on your body's own internal chemistry and that would be breath work like I think everybody before they start taking whatever phosphatidylserine and the data genic herbs and all this shit for cortisol and before they start taking valium or ambien or anything else for for sleep you should learn how to control your physiology with your breath I think that's the most powerful way to do it I mean your prana your shock or whatever you want to call it like being able to do things like breath work box breathing alternate nostril breathing even even holotropic breathing like you can go some very interesting places in terms of DMT production by the pineal gland by just doing holotropic breathwork like there's there's a lot of very interesting things that you can do with your breath but I think that for getting to sleep or for decreasing stress you start with the breath and then you start to introduce some of these other molecules but ambient valium like in the era of like readily available CBD and you know all the other sleep compounds that we have available like valerian and passionflower and chamomile and you know all of those are what are called gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA precursors they produce inhibitory No our transmitters I got I don't understand what people are still taking ambien valium cuz they're idiots yeah they're just addicted to it or they just want a pill I mean that's essentially what it is they want faster buttocks and they want ambien and Valley I don't know if it's the same folks but many times it is I think it's our president I think our president takes that shit he I think he's sleeping with ambien I think a lot of politicians do that yeah well they can't sleep otherwise they're fucking ruining the world I am i I've found that if my brain is racing just completely concentrating on breathing in and breathing out and concentrating on just the breath itself like really being cognizant of it and slow deliberate breaths in and out and in and now by doing that over long periods of time I've found that I can I can pretty much count myself out you can but that takes focus a lot of people are not willing to learn how to do that because they want the fast track out well that's yeah so that is the thing right they just want a pill yeah it's very unfortunate that those things exist in that that that sort of thinking is you know it's reinforced yeah yeah it's encouraged in fact you know you've all these ads and all these doctors and different people oh well if you have a hard time sleeping I'll just write your prescription yeah actually you know and I mean you look at the animal world like they self-medicate they'll use clay for parasites and you know dogs will eat grass for stomach issues and you know that I guess birds now are putting like nicotine in cigarettes and their nests cuz there's some kind of benefit to that and you see animals self-medicating you see our ancestors using everything from you know cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to you know all sorts of different derivatives for thousands of years so it's not like supplementation or self medication or the whole creation of pharmaceuticals is something that's unnatural or not an acceptable human activity but once you start to used as a crutch I think that's where you run into issues like once once you deny the human body's ability to be able to heal itself or to be able to decrease stress on its own you begin to rely on these exogenous chemicals I think that's where you start playing with fire I just wonder what's happening to people's minds over long-term use of this stuff where you're not going into these deep sleep cycles and you're using it every night because essentially once you get hooked on it a lot of people have a really hard time sleeping without it yeah yeah I mean they're shorting themselves right right I wonder like studies in memory it's learning like that that's where a lot of that type of stuff happens I mean it's the same thing with with um what's it called lymphatic drainage like this this new drainage system for the brain that they've just discovered in recent years this idea that you actually detoxify the brain during the sleep cycles and it's even enhanced when you sleep on your side they've even looked at sleeping positions and this thing called glymphatic drainage and when you're not going through proper sleep cycles or you're constantly waking because you're on your back and you have you know a lot of people have sleep apnea where you look at their sleep charts and they'll frequently wake during the night or though you'll see periods where they just get ripped out of deep sleep yeah you wake up and you don't have memory consolidation mmm you don't have the type of neuronal repair and recovery that you'd want or you know you can't even show yourself on muscle repair you know and and there's there's probably a lot that we don't know about just dreaming and its ability to be able to you know do things like help form memories or or make you know learning or experiences more deeply rooted but yeah I mean it's it's it's I think sleep architecture is something that just gets super fucked up in a modern post-industrial era we've got access to pharmaceuticals I'll just take a sledgehammer to our heads yeah no question about it and it's also there's been a lot of work done on actually going to sleep with a problem this whole idea of sleep on it like there's there's actually something real to that that there are there's some cognitive balancing that's going on while you're sleeping well your mind is actually going over whatever issues you might have and trying to come up with a problem during sleep time during your subconscious you don't want to know how many times now and I'm learning this as I get older that you delay a decision or you delay replying to an email or delay responding to a text message or what-have-you until you've gotten a full night of sleep on and the clarity that you get after that I mean you just basically think about a little bit before you fall asleep then you go to sleep and you wake up with such a better answer the same thing with a lock on it like walk on it is another thing we know you you make more nerve growth factor and more brain derived neurotrophic factor when you walk while you're learning I recently gave a TEDx talk and I just I made the whole TEDx talk and I learned the whole thing while I was walking up on the Farm Road back behind my house I just walk up through the forest pop out in the sunshine and walk up and down that road and just listen to my TED talk on my earbuds and give my talk hmm it's just it's it's amazing for the brain but yeah I agree dwelling out something before you go to sleep it does the trick I always if I do that I always have a response the next day that's kinder less emotional more understanding friendlier yeah you know it's reciprocating any any sort of good vibes it's it's it's really interesting it's really really interesting how there is some sort of a wisdom that's imparted on you while you're sleeping there is and now what I do is I'll think about what it is but I am a big fan of fiction before you fall asleep it just lets you escape to a whole different world I took my kids on this giant tour of New York City like we went we went to Chelsea Market and the Highline Park and the Empire State Building and Ellis Island we just did it all but we went across the street from Central Park to the New York Historical Society where they had a Harry Potter exhibit and we walked in there now I've just always been resistant to the Harry Potter phase Lathan just I've never read the books and they're watching the movies but my kids really wanted to go so I took him and when I walked through there and saw all the research the deep research that that JK Rowling did on alchemy and herbology and in the history of magic and you know wizardry and and she she actually took a deep dive into all this stuff she pre planned out all seven of those books before she even wrote the first one and all of her original manuscripts were in there and her letters back and forth to the editor and to the publisher I walked out the other end of that exhibit took about two hours to get through you're just looking at everything thumbing through everything and I was just like a die-hard Harry Potter fan where is this this was a it was one of those things that was at the New York Historical Society but you know a lot of these they'll do an exhibit and it'll kind of go in and out during the year so I doubt it's still going right now because this was like three months ago and you know we walked out and I'm you know my kids like dad this is the Gryffindor wand and this is the the Slytherin or the or Dumbledore Swan and the Gryffindor sweater and the the Slytherin sweater and I just started buying them all the sweaters and the wands and now I'm reading the books um I'm halfway through Goblet of Fire right now and I'm actually digging it my 10 year old read all she wrote home is in the course of a year yeah have you gone to the universal ride no but out of thing okay brochure for that down at the Hilton where I'm staying it's amazing a Harry Potter world ride is incredible it's a 3d ride where you're on a roller coaster but it's not 3d but it's you know augmented or yeah that would be nice for me I'm a fan I'll go by myself yeah scream my hands up in the air you love it yeah it's really good the whole Harry Potter world is really good it's amazing but a beer though it'll give you diabetes I did what might might one of my boys made butter beer for his classmates because they've got like a they help Mom with all this stuff they've got like a cooking podcast and they do their last episode was marshmallows they made marshmallows but there's like a cups worth of bone broth and every marshmallow it's like this healthy like glycine infused marshmallow that they made a dark chocolate fondue with whip in coconut rice that much bone broth and a marshmallow house what does it feel I don't I don't have the recipe but it tastes a bit like I'm usually not much of a sneak snacks and a bed kind of guy but I was like taking marshmallows to bed eating marshmallows and reading Harry Potter how much sugar is in the marsh not a lot really I know that they're doing a good job with their podcast like they're doing a lot of like like blackstrap molasses stevia and raw honey and they're doing like what else did they make they made like a like a gluten-free baked donut with a cream-cheese ginger frosting and cacao nibs on top just like you dip it in coffee and it tastes like a real donut good Lloyd they are they're turning into little little chefs they do get us yeah what what's the benefit of grass-fed beef over regular beef I know there is a benefit but I don't I don't I never can recall it correctly it's something to do with the most in fatty acid ratios yeah cuz grain you're gonna you're gonna have more the omega-6 fatty acids which have been unfairly vilified meaning that a lot of people are just like don't eat any omega sixes don't have any arachidonic acid like don't don't overdo your seeds your nuts your nut butter kind of like the the orthorexia health world as a whole you know like when you read nutrition magazines and stuff they're like do your omega-3s but be careful Americans have a 20 to 1 omega-6 to omega-3 ratio but the problem is that omega sixes that's a lot of those are derived from what are called parent essential oils and your cell membranes need a certain amount of omega-6 fatty acids from seeds and nuts and plants and even to a certain extent grains and when you have an excess of omega-3s and not enough omega-6 is because you're going so far into the fish oil category then it actually damages a component of your mitochondrial membrane called cardiolipin you actually make less of that really so you interfere with normal cellular activity what seeds are most beneficial I would imagine the most nutrient-dense ones so specific almonds macadamia I mean what I is like almonds macadamia nuts Brazil nuts I just don't eat the quasi nuts like peanuts which are you know they're not as high in nutrient density they're more of a legging than a nut um a lot of my nuts either raw or lightly roasted you always look at the label to make sure they didn't put a lot of vegetable oil and canola oil in them little you know I'm a fan of nuts in in moderate my nuts like you'd eat your nuts if you were gonna have to show right like if you've ever had to shell a walnut you're not gonna eat 30 walnuts because that'd be exhausting right you stash your shell it's annoying as hell but keeps you from eating too many of them i buy them shelled and I eat fistfuls of them yeah like last night I like half a bag yeah pistachios are great for your microbiome too yeah I actually had a couple of research studies on that last year that showed an improvement in the diversity of the bacteria in your gut with pistachios that's one of the nuts that's good for your body probably because of the fiber content in pistachios but grass-fed versus grain-fed is primarily the omega-3 fatty acids may have less of the arachidonic acid less of the potentially inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids there's probably part of it being that grass-fed grass-finished beef is generally raised in a farm that's using less herbicides less pesticides raising their meat and more sustainable fashion you know giving it less hormones giving it less antibiotics that's painting with a broad brush but I generally grass-fed there's more to it than just the fatty acid composition it's just a better meat overall and my well better health-wise grain-fed beef I will not lie like you can you can have a pretty damn tasty fatty cut of grain fed beef I certainly can but I honestly prefer the taste of grass-fed I like the denser meat the darker meat I liked it better just to me just it just tastes healthier I just my crave it more you know and when I go back and forth between the two of them when I eat grain fed it feels like like a lazy cow like it's mushy it's got like it's good it's delicious don't get me wrong but there's a difference it's kind of funny because I've gone over to Dubai a few times and taught like fitness conferences over there and they advertise grain-fed like they want everybody like when you go to the restaurants like this beef is the finest grain fed beef grain pretty widely recognized at the steak house in the world that place is always a trip by accident I didn't like my steak it's how fucking dare you know are you gonna get did you not like some rude Brooklyn waiters gonna take me out but I didn't like it was like just something about like the meat just taste it it tasted like it was drenched in vegetable oil like something about it didn't taste right and maybe I had a poor Peter Lugar's experience that doesn't even make sense I did not enjoy it that much I I ate there and afterwards I'm like I don't think it gets better I don't think I don't think food gets better yeah how dare your New York does have a lot of good restaurants though yeah you all they do my buddy David boule he's a chef over there and he has this wonderful restaurant where he brings like doctors and nutritionists in and they teach you about certain aspects of the food that you're eating like I did one there on longevity and I taught about like having bitters before your meal to reduce your glucose and your insulin response to the meal and the use of like like sweet breads for your thymus gland to increase the activity of your immune system to you know like a lot of these polyphenols and antioxidants from the purples and the greens and the blues too there are these things called uncoupling proteins that actually get activated with with cryotherapy and cold water immersion but that also are something that get activated with the consumption of it's it's like a sea urchins basically it's like a sea urchin foam that they did at this dinner but basically what he does is he'll partner with the physician or the nutritionist or whatever and make this amazing like for our you know five-star meal that's designed to enhance the health effects and whatever it is that you just learned about Wow I was actually in New York when I did that blood procedure a couple weeks ago I dropped in there again and ate and that's what my favorite places to go so you know who's got a steak house in New York City is that guy who fucking sprinkles of salt what the hell's his name salt Bay he's got a place in New York I know this guy you don't know that that fucking that meme the guy's got the song throwing it on the meat no you're too busy doing actual work but I like salt I like yeah I like good salt as a matter of fact you know what the very best salt that you can get is what this is based on I was with a group of doctors a couple of months ago in Park City and this guy one of the guys was there he's like a water and a salt expert and he did what's called a mass spectrometry analysis of all these popular salts I came away on sea salt and black Kona salt and Aztec salt and Mexican salt and all these different salts and analyzed them for their their mineral content because you want high mineral content but their metal content right like we know that iron especially in guys now we're finding out it's not that great its oxidative it can cause damage it's associated with inflammation we know that metals and and micro plastics and all these kind of things are winding up in the food supply the top of the list in terms of cleanliness and it's Celtic salt healthy Celtic salt you know blue bag it's kind of like a gray salt and it's great because they don't like bleach it but it's still cleans not like pink and reddish because it doesn't have a lot of irons heard of kelp tea that's amazing flavorful it's big it's big chunk so well as a meat rub oh look at that yeah I mean you can buy that yeah yeah and that that stuff is about the healthiest salt you can get okay corn west dude yeah I like it I started you know I always travel with some kind of salt my wife gets pissed because you know she'll make these amazing meals and the first thing I do is I just pull out the salt and just cover everything in salt but I think it's because I excrete a lot of salt if you were when I raced for a 4/4 time ax actually they brought in a bunch of physiologist to to test our sweat sodium our sweat sodium analysis meaning that they they measure how much sodium you excrete for any given volume of sweat and this kind of returns that whole genetic thing like when you look at people of a northern European ancestry who would have come from a population that did a lot of fermenting a lot of curing on a pickling we would develop some pretty robust sodium excretion mechanisms right because we're preserving our food with salt you don't want all that salt to build up in the body because you know theoretically you could increase blood pressure you could cause some damage if you have too much salt and when you look at other folks who didn't you know people who would for example sweat a lot and live in a hot environment you know like like whatever South Africa are very hot region of the Philippines or whatever they would have some pretty robust salt conservation mechanism to be able to hold on to sodium and hold on to salt because you're sweating more well my sweat sodium analysis revealed that I lose like two and a half times more salt in my sweat than the average person so I think that dictates to a certain extent my almost my craving for salt mmm when I was racing Ironman Triathlon I would lay awake at night and I can feel my blood pounding in my ears after a day of training and I started using salt heavily and one of the first things that happens because salt regulates aldosterone which is one of the compounds that regulates your blood pressure all that went away like I could fall asleep at night you know when you lay your head down on your pillow and I couldn't hear the blood pounding in my ears so for about four years I've just I've been salt on everything just ton of it I'm sold I gotta wrap this up unfortunately that was awesome though you're the best dude thank you so much it's always good to talk to you you're I don't know how the fuck you retain all this information but I'm glad you do thanks man thanks man my pleasure I give everybody your Instagram just uh Google Ben Greenfield I'm everything you go alright brother [Music]
