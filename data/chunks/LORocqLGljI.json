the girag and experience but as an individual those jobs almost exist to let you know that you for sure don't want to do that it's like the feeling of it being it's like being a real bad relationship right like what what gets you out of a relationship it fucking explode that's what happens you get to a certain point we like will you just shut the fuck up and leave me alone I can't take it as negativity anymore we're done we're done here okay we boom but you have to hit this well you got into the bottom in order to change yeah and you got to have that McDonald's job to appreciate a really good job you're great to talk about later like you and I we talk about our first jobs it gave you the motivation to get out get on your fucking horse and get out of there yeah if you didn't have that motivation and that's where when we're talking about money like about our society designed to sort of encourage motivation which encourages success which encourages financial rewards encourages more attractive to the opposite sex when you drive in a Ferrari to a lot of checks that's a fact a lot of people get really mad at that but that's a fact it's just a fact there's just too many dudes who are ugly and old who have really hot wives right I mean it's just fact guys get billions of dollars in giant yachts and they're fucking these hot chicks and doesn't make any sense but that's a fact no you can't deny that fact why is that fact exist well it exists because we got a weird system got a weird system and that's one of the holes in the system one of the holes in the system is that achievement as superseded actual physical desire for a lot of these poor gold diggers and they let this wrinkly old cocksucker shoot his dry loads into you ah and and you got to pretend you love it oh maybe oh yeah put him out baby why you like that guy who got his face farted on threw up at nagas that's what you thinkin that's old man keeps on you yeah and he doesn't shower on purpose just to degrade you further like it's if it's all about the money yeah what do you suck it now baby well there's a lot of guys that definitely have a resentment towards these gold dealers yeah for sure especially once the woman's the the fun has worn off of the game of pretending your attraction to the man which you know if you're a guy who's not attractive and you're successful and you believe in your head that you're something cool something special about you look how well I've done and this defines me this watch serious watched a $50,000 watch and this is a fucking 20 million dollar state and you get that shit in your head and you get a girl and she tricks you with your own ego she can get baby you're just amazing to be around I'm just so lucky we met each other meanwhile she is perfect her tits or just melons bobbing gently and his really strange thin material clothes that she wears that clings of her hips and just inches lower than her vagina just hanging inches lower than image on her bubble ass and perfect legs gap under the kissing hose yo Jesus Christ and she just strokes your cock kisses you and you're like I'm marrying this bitch wait a Manby yes yes yes hi she's like tired she's the high so she gives that shoulder run oh yeah and that's the thing as you realize with her not only am I getting the fucking body I'm getting shoulder rubs I'm getting subservient the bitch can cook how she treats the help well she gets it and you can go out with her and she knows how to treat your friends yeah she knows how to kiss you when frozen's you in your sleep because she realizes that she's tricked you into having a shitty will where she gets everything because your kids are that you're she convinced you the kids would be better off if you didn't give them a safety net because that would make them successful like you so she played to your ego and you cut the kids out of the will and gave all the money is crazy tie bitch who stop slowly poisoning your drink and she won she earned it that's the thing about like Anna Nicole Smith when his fucking stupid kids wanted a state no Anna Nicole was sucking his dick didn't you stew a bit about this yeah fuck yeah yeah it's like closers night was it was the whole thing about them saying like oh my god she's taking advantage of him she's only being she's only with him for his money I'm like don't you think he fucking down right like I made a billion dollars from scratch chances are he's a tad crafty and it was like this whole thing about like how do you want to die you'd want to die shaking and alone in your hospital bed surrounded by loved ones or you want to get a big fat Kentucky Fried hooker and just blow it out that's it did and it was all him dying telling her to lick his ass well therefore shit he did to her right before he died and the kids have got nothing and they deserve you were raised with all that fucking money you went to private schools you had tennis coaches he probably bought you houses why do you need more what the fuck did you do you didn't suck his dick yeah you need to get your own money stupid right you rode the ride and now it's over and I think also this sounds fucked up but that exists because it's a predatory situation you're prey you know if you're a vulnerable old weak emotional guy who also has a billion dollars we weren't going to prey on you they're going to pretend to be something they're not and they might even convince themselves that they are that something that they're pretending to be because their instinct to try to acquire your wealth and your social status is so strong that they want to be the Trump girl they want to be the new girl the Trump leaves his wife for ya I don't think it's black and white I mean if you're a woman that grew up in that paradigm maybe your dad had money and your mother was a stay-at-home mom and maybe she had a hint of that and then all sudden you're involved in charitable organizations and you're taking his wealth and you're channeling into positive things so you see it starts to not necessarily be about is he the one I would have married just based on his looks and charisma but it starts to become about like well life is pairing up with somebody and being powerful like you watch house of cards no I haven't don't don't you fucking spoiler alert just to say the relationship is about power I know that movie that show brother is supposed to be amazing it says me jumping onto it next but it's basically about how a couple can be together because they're a power couple and it's interesting Bill and Hillary most likely right most likely absolutely mum most presidents I think probably you have to be I don't think you can do that thing on your own I think that's a nutty fucking job and the first lady has a prominent role in our culture and she's constantly speaking and doing these things and III think you're dead right I think you're dead right about that I think it's also that we're also talking about just two stops on a broad range of possibilities from ultimately totally evil Russian hot prostitute who steals your organs when you're asleep at 2:00 someone who just doesn't want to work and the guys kind of cool and he treats her good and so she stays with them yeah you know I've seen both I've seen both I've seen I've seen people get victimized and I've seen people that are just in sort of these relationship where I wouldn't want it but it works for them you know sometimes they're out the other women the woman will tease and be like yeah uh-huh nice at you know I wouldn't be with you if it wasn't for the fucking money oh it's not even a teeny because of course I know that that's a movie that's in a movie what was the movie that was in there was a movie that was in where the tune well no the what Schindler's List terms of endearment get it would help it you do it right away chitty-chitty go right to fucking platoon and the picture and organs hanging out on on the beach um I forget the movie man but it was just about about a guy who lost everything and in the scene like his wife was like laughing about it when everything was going great and then when he did lose all the money she did fucking leave them Hey well actually was in the wolf of wallstreet - it's a common theme in the wolf of Wall Street obviously it was a crazy coked up fucking maniac piece of shit but when he was going under and his business was going on it that's when the wife left when he was doing great the wife wanted him when he was married to another woman I mean it's like it was it was a classic story so it's not like that's an unfamiliar paradigm to us its nature it's a wounded antelope that gets taken out by the the lion it's she needs somebody to provide for her or she doesn't but in that role she does if she chooses that role if she chooses the role of fucking the old Greek Lee shaky man with his fucking pale translucent dick that he sticks inside we could see as he's coming could see the veins like pop whatever blood of God and it's like a little highway going down his fucking saran-wrap skin filled with Viagra yeah and just shooting dust bubbles into her pussy yeah yeah man I mean that's taking her you Cannell's you can take that choice or you know you could start an art gallery and become a multimillionaire on your own I mean you could do that too okay it's but when you are that girl okay if you are that 25 year old girl and Adderall problem that's looking to try to hook up with some old billionaire dude and marry him so he'd be taken care of for life your that but that's your role that's what you've chosen you might have more potential than that that doesn't mean that that's not what you've chosen oh you don't even know baby she's so slick she's so smart I mean that is one of the smartest girls I've ever met in my life when she met him and she put off it doesn't matter are you talking nonsense she's still that girl she's promised that you can't say no no listen you can't say she's a prostitute good I know her and she's powerful and what she did was yeah she's really clever and she figured out way to maybe like guys no no she's still prostitute right you're missing the whole point right it doesn't matter if she has all those potential she beats 150 books a week okay don't fucking tell me that girl is so goddamn smart oh my god you're saying she's not smart go see she's a hooker all right she's playing the role of a hooker this was the opposite in terms of a female on a male because sometimes women are so hot that the guy is getting something out of her and he's putting up with not not having love not having respect for her but wanting that pussy so bad or that status of being with somebody that's that hot that in the same way he's a prostitute for what he's getting from her oh yeah they're certainly mean there's exchanges other than money that are unfair the reason the old man gets the girl in the first place is because of his fucking money that's it so it's honest if Oh people know what they're getting sort of but it's not because they're playing a game called love in the game is baby I love you I'm just so happy to be with you oh you love me oh come on you want some dick they lot they're playing a game somebody wins a show is a winner or loser and he gets pussy unless you should try the pussy is she drugs him it's prank well it's a matter about maintaining that relationship and this allowing her to fuck her personal trainer she's going to share ok she's going to look how hot she is she's got this little waist this dynamic body she's 25 years old here 90 she's gonna fuck her trainer just accept it be happy that you could fucker and don't ask questions pretty girl this is he's supposed to work that early is out open those with just a smile yeah rich old man she won't have to worry it's fucking great Eagle song man yeah that's right I can't hide your lyin eyes man it's fucking Jam see if it's something hard for you because when you met your wife you were already very successful you had money uh me I had my girl I fucked up because I was single when I met my girl my now wife is lucky I had an MTV game shell and I was like I met her at the wrong fucking time I coulda lined up so much but that's not true because you you enjoyed it see everybody's worried about it but you still do but everybody's worried about what they didn't do all right this is no I should have done this no you shouldn't have traffic I've had people in my life to tell me the most important thing that ever happened to them was fuckin up because if you fuck up then you realize you fucked up and that's what motivates you to get away from McDonald this is how I should have never done that of course you should have done it yeah I lost everything I fucked up getting that marriage man you should've fucking got married you should have lost everything now you know right you win now you win you got the knowledge don't ever let it happen again don't use it as an excuse to just wallow in your own sins nothing worse than the wallowing fucking deforest guy you know he's living in a condo and in Marina del Rey and he's fucking go to the same bar every night the same stuff he's one of those guys were like the woman at Starbucks knows his name because his life has become so simplified and dumbed down because he's afraid to move forward after a divorce Eddie Bravo used to be a DJ a strip club when we first met and Eddie introduced me to the game of how these girls would go about getting men to buy them things like I'd be friends with his girl I knew him through him so they were like there were nice people you know and I'd have relationships with him so I was just talking to them they would tell me about these guys that they were hooking up with that would buy them cars and shit and how they would do it so I visited him at work and I'm like what's going on man and he's like nothing dude check this out you're gonna talk to this girl and then hurt one of her clients when she comes in like you got you got to see like this guy just bought her a truck he bought her like a Yukon Denali and so the girls hanging out and you know hanging out with their friends and this guy comes in who was there's a classic story he's a wounded gazelle 55 year old divorce guy works at the post office coming in with his postal jacket on okay he's no armed from here he bought her a $35,000 car man in this guy he bought her a fucking Yukon Denali you know it was a nice car maybe $35,000 the wrong number I'm just throwing it out there whatever it is he bought her a new car so um she sees him and she goes oh my god and she runs over like little baby steps like a girl and she's fucking naked man she's naked she's in her underwear she's got a bikini on and she goes over and gives this guy a hug and you could see this guy is defenseless there's no way in the world that a girl that looks like that would ever have that kind of reaction to him so he's got to pay for that you got to pay for that you got to pay for it by buying her car or taking care of her fucking credit problem that she's got or you know do whatever you got to figure out how to pay for that shit because there's no other way that you're gonna get that relationship but when I watched it I was like I looked at Eddie and he was like that shit straight mercenary right and I was like this is crazy like they just they put a con game on these guys well I got a friend who's like he seems to like make friends with rich people and he's a good guy but it's weird and he says that a few of these guys they really do take care of girls they've got like an apartment in New York that she lives in she gets a check every month I mean figure it cost them 50 grand a year and these are guys that have fucking 30 million dollars so to have a relationship set up when when they come to town they don't have to call an escort service and they don't have to go out and try to make a straight relationship where they have to send flowers and call every day they come to town she's fucking gorgeous Pat you know powerful confident it's all on the table and they've got like three cities set up and it's and when when he comes to town she is available 24/7 whatever the fuck he wants and I bet they have some kind of friendship underneath it all maybe not well that would be great if it all worked out like that right if that was the arrangement and it all worked out like that right but the problem with people is there's no there's never really a static state maintains itself for any long periods of time when it comes to relationships you either kind of all in or you drift in and out of each other or she finds another guy I mean people were weird they it's very difficult to me so how are you going to maintain a long-term prostitution elationship right you're not most likely people that begin with yeah most likely I mean you're painted out to be awesome and beautiful but the reality is that's not what the girl wants she wants to find a guy either if she wants someone to take care of her she wants to find a guy to take care of her and I need her lover and her boyfriend or her husband or whatever and for the this guy that thinks that he's gonna like maintain you're gonna have to match each one of these situations if you're some crazy CEO of some giant corporation you got like four apartments scattered out across the country with chicks living in them you're gonna maintain these positions like who's who's fucking her when you're not there what's happening is anybody plotting your death you better be sure you know dude what did you sign you start anything crazy you know does she have any photographs your dick like we get for a credit card yeah yeah did you give her a credit card well it's like you'd have to monitor these situations this ain't gonna be a normal person it's gonna be a person's willing to fuck you because you pay for that right and you know they might be crazy yeah easily might be crazy I heard this dude I was at the W and sitting in the lobby waiting and this dude sitting next mean he's got an accent sounds Scandinavian and he's going on Oh fine I got you on the phone you've been so hard to reach lately baby I you know you know I I I'm so crazy but you're so beautiful I can't wait to get you out you need to stop going to college you come I take care of he'd never met her and he was talking on the phone clearly met on some kind of high-end dating service where you get women that you take care of yeah she was flirting back and they were making plans for her to fly out for a week he was going to take her to the best restaurants in LA blah blah I was telling her all the things he's gonna bribe her with right and he has seen pictures online they had talked on the phone clearly a few times and he was closing he was making the arrangements to fly her out okay why do we have a problem dot why does anybody have a probably don't think anyone should have this shipment right she's a real nothing wrong one's eyes are open I don't think I think all prostitution should be legalized I think that whorehouses should be legalized I think that having having horrors on the street or having to go through Craigslist is it's horrible the reality is people are going to use whores mm put it on the table legalize it make them get tested for for STDs make sure they're keeping their money they're not getting fucking beaten up and and relationships like this should be fine yeah well it'sit's unbelievably fascinating that you have something that everybody wants and everybody gets for free but as soon as you attach money to it it has this massive stigma to it like you know saying that you these prostitution relationships aren't stable what relationships are you know our if you you hook up with someone is that going to be stable if you just meet people randomly and have sex let me agree to have sex with each other is that gonna be stable you sure it might not be stable either you might run into instability everywhere you turn but the main reason why we have all these negativity negative ideas attached to the idea of prostitution is because it's illegal what if you hook up one night with a check you bought dinner you bought drinks you paid for the cab back to the apartment you spent all the money you guys fuck how is that different than how many things are all money and having sex with her how about all those things are just you dating and there's nothing wrong with being nice and being nice to someone taking a friend out or driving them around taking them to a nice restaurant nothing wrong with that but then what if she says I've got the situation um I'm three months hurt in my rent and I don't know what's doing you look I'll just take care of it right and you write her a check and then she sucks your dick what happened there right what happened there did you pay for her to suck your dick we don't know she might have sucked your dick anyway you know I might have been like listen baby you know you don't get money from me but you do get dick and you put your dick out and she blows you that's different right but most guys can't pull that off what about what about a marriage where the wife does not work has never earned a dime she's having sex with you mm-hmm that's prostitution according to some people according to some people certainly is I mean according to a lot of male feminists it would be right all right yeah I mean it's it's money coming in though with the sex going out I mean if that's where you want to look at but it's agreement it's the problem is the idea of money its agreements you that's where the idea of prostitution sort of it comes down to what it comes down to is are people having sex with people that they might not necessarily have been willing to without any benefit but that benefit exists so they are willing to do it is that prostitution because if it if that benefit is only money then you're you're defining sex for something as sex for money that's prostitution but everything is sex if you see it like you were talking about the Ferrari thing before if you're at a club and you see a guy pull up in a Ferrari and you go home with that guy part of the reason you went home with him is you saw the Ferrari there's not dollars exchanged but there's an implicit understanding this dude's got money and he spends it like a fucking lunatic yep and you want to be around that that's a good point that he spends it like a fucking lunatic that's a great point because that's really what it is a guy who's so flashy he's driving a $250,000 car he's not gonna hesitate to give you a couple grand here and there right you know you want to buy a new pair of shoes he's like here fucking peels off some hundreds right gives you a kiss on the cheek and goes back to doing business buy sell buy sell this is the fucking some crazy right multi-millionaire maniac banker dude right Byron it's a party and you just got invited you're gonna be a regular party this guy who doesn't give a shit about money he knows he's gonna die soon because he's on adderall and he's chain-smoke and he's a drunk and wherever you go you're eating the best steaks you're getting the best clubs life is fucking good oh yeah oh yeah and I'm fucking him yeah yeah you're very little Evans wife and every when you show up the country club Oh mrs. nickel Evan please come on in and you've got a little poodle with you and you fucking walk in your $3,000 shoes and yeah you waddle in there and take your tennis lesson your tennis player fucking bones you in the locker room he knows it then the husband says bring them over I want to watch oh Jesus thank that's ugly a lot of guys won't do that Brett I don't think that's a normal thing no I don't think that's a watching wanna watch that's a weird thing and then the cuckold porn mmm just lets you know chuckle poor where do you find that I really don't want a pin cuckold porn don't do it Brian you
