three two one hello Jeffrey hello Joe how you doing man I'm young and handsome you are young in the MCS we are if we're not dead mm-hmm I don't know what that means it's all good mall jet-lagged yeah it's crackin how are you I'm a big bowl of wonderful yeah a big bowl a big ball fuckin huge bowl of wonder if you're aggressive with that statement I am I am you don't doubt me with number four don't shout yeah yeah it's good see man good to see you too well what's the latest what is the latest about to start another season of the Goldbergs another season the curb after working with the the fabulous Bryan Callen I love working with Bryan Callen he makes me laugh all the times here later he's at 2 o'clock oh so then I'll see him or 3 yeah oh maybe not but I mean our point being is a dig Bryan Callen very much he likes you too yeah that's cool that's cool man what's the latest with the stand-up career uh I see you around the store a lot at the store on occasion I don't do the store that much anymore because I've stopped doing showcase spots for the most part I just do I have a regular show every Friday night at The Improv in the lab and I do you know an hour hour and 10 minutes and then occasionally I do flappers which is a horrible name yet in Burbank but if you look up but a great room a great room yeah and I do there on occasion on Sunday nights so I do an hour going out of the house for 15-20 minutes not worth my time does it do you when you do like an hour set do you plan your sets out or do you have like some material that you'd like to be working on and is that why you like the freedom of having an hour so you could just kind of fuck around you have no reparation whatsoever except I may think oh I'll talk about that tonight but I have no preparation I may bring up a story I've told before but I have no idea literally when I step onstage I have no idea what I'm gonna talk about what does help me what I've done for quite a while now is I come up to a different song every time I come up and then I just talk about that song it the story of the making of that song who sang that song what that song means to me and that will usually lead me to something that's all I need yeah reason why I ask is you have a very unusual style like I've seen you a bunch of times very loose it's a great thing because you have the confidence to do that yes like a lot of people have to be like super rigid in their preparation without a safe thing setup punchline in the correct order every night I'm only confident in the fact that I'm funny I am NOT confident in any other fact in terms of going onstage that's the most important it is the most important and so I go up with the knowledge that no matter what goes down I am funny and will be funny boom good no that's it good night yeah and are you doing the road at all hardly ever when I do the road it's I did London in December that a couple weeks of shows weeks yeah a couple weeks at a theater there what did you go theater it's a small cool theater that's like 500 seats or something I don't even know I don't even pay attention how's that I've done that I've done leister Square I've done a couple different types of squares good yeah I just I go to London I go to New York on occasion and perform I use I played everywhere I played everywhere from Indianapolis to Seattle to Miami like and all points in between you know to Sun you know I mean like all over I mean I've done it I'm I'm 56 years old I've got two TV shows I develop a bunch of other stuff I'm passionate about my stand-up I get enough I don't have to earn a living by going on the road which I have had to in the past so I stay home and do my stand-up when I can because the thing it's very nice I've work towards that yeah that's a beautiful thing to work towards because the thing that does get you is that travel oh you know it would the thing that no one understands is the only joy that you can possibly get when you Travel is the moment when you're on stage and if that's troublesome or not fun it's a drag it's depressing but those moments on stage if they're great it's all worth it ya know it's the thing also when you go on the road if you have to do morning radio it screws up your time you know what time you go to bed cuz I I like to set I don't worry as much on a consistent basis what time I wake up cuz that'll automatic I tried consistently to go to bed at the same time every night hmm it's a different approach that psychiatrist told me and it has worked wonders for me a psychiatrist told you yeah that it's better because everyone always focuses on waking up the same time every day right he said focus on going to bed at the same time every night and that'll be more productive for you and I do that with a sort of a half hour bump to fall asleep to maybe read for a minute whatever but I'm in bed usually by 10:00 I've never gone to a psychiatrist but when one of the shows that I was on I was like the only person on the set that didn't go to a psychiatrist I'm like maybe I'm fucked up no by the way if you're functioning in the world that's great congratulations I have sometimes trouble functioning in the world how sad and end day well it's like I find going onstage I'm fearless and I don't even like leaving my house I prefer to stay home I loved napping if I could smoke some indica and take a nap every day I do Transcendental Meditation I do all the chill things at home and I leave to work I don't like going to parties I like a good dinner party because that means I can have an actual conversation with someone right but I would just had a party the other night a goodbye party for a friend of mine it was at Jeff Ross's house and I had the worst time I lasted 20 minutes the only people I could talk to her comedians there via Jeff Ross's party but comedian well some people with man buns in the hot tub it was very unsettling and wrong I wanted nothing to do but I said my goodbyes to my friend and she's moving to Japan so I I said my goodbyes but I was out of respect to her that I went but out of respect to myself I didn't stay long man buns in a hot tub yeah you don't belong there yeah that can't be done no it's bad when did that start happening when the man bun talks to me like in a big way a couple years ago there's like samurais and then there was a big drop off for a long time that's exactly I don't get it mommy why grow your hair long if you're gonna wear a man bun I think yeah the idea it's ridic I was at a gas station in Studio City and I was seconds away from talking to this dude he had a man bond that looked like a bird's nest with fate live with a waterfall on the outside and I just went why yes totally friendly I want to make this a conversation why explain I don't get it I feel like what it is is just like they're they're letting you know that this is me when I'm out but when I'm at home and I'm feeling sexy I just undo that and let it down I don't know what it is I just relax and I unwrap a bit Bowl along it's a big bowling and no you're not dear douchey sexier douchey what's the bonus your hairs ever been mine I had like a jew-fro type festival happening when I was younger like longer curlier but not in like shoulder length right no it's ridiculous it's weird that hair grows that long only on your head that's weird and you're growing like Robert Plant's head cool hair like go for it don't man bonnet yeah go for it I'm all for long hair rockers have different rules I saw a guy last night a band a band bass player big man bun big ball around you know what I'm on come but with a CEO haircut in a rock band Oh what are you doing with that fucking button-down conservative here I dig the band I think playing against type is a big bowl of delightful nah not enjoy we differ on this one we differ on this group of men like I thought David Bowie's band 10 machine I didn't really dig their music but I love the look of all them wearing the suits with the close cropped hair well Bowie's so odd and so undeniably creative that he was allowed to get away with anything he's a lot do anything you want but but truthfully if you have any sort of confidence you can accept a man bun there it is right here history of yeah Bowie's yeah but that dude should have cut his hair short they want the long hair ah maybe but he's kind of John Travolta in Palm Beach a short here he is the pressure from the other three guys got to be too much tired of buying shampoo and bullshit yeah yeah the upkeep is ridiculous it's outrageous yeah dudes who conditioned their hair and they have to leave it in for 10 minutes oh that's a big bowl of come on man come on bro yeah but for something there's some reason why it is okay in a band but it's not okay for a comic like a comic with long like Led Zeppelin hair because you know what happens when a comic does that their whole act becomes about it and it's like dude hmm that's just boring remember Jackson Perdue i do remember jackson pretty crazy long hair yeah like a band yeah guy yeah a lot of material about his hair I know I just you know I used it when I was younger I went for the obvious I did a lot of material about having a big head no now did some no interest to me no you couldn't also do like the Robert Plant shirt thing I have I have a Robert Plant shirt like open I think it's call it said nurses do it better or nurses and someone nursing at it's powder blue he wore it on one of the Zeppelin tours in the 70s and I saw it for sale on Amazon and I bought one it doesn't give off the same time yeah it's different with different people right yeah but I always one of my Mount sequiturs that people all the time as you love the nursing industry I just said if you are you you love you love the nursing industry I've said that to nurses what do they say people just chuckle they don't know how to make they don't know you know non sequiturs girls laughter yeah nervous laughter there's a certain things a certain looks that came and went and people tried to bring back like do you remember a few years back they were trying to bring back bell-bottoms no yes that's how much of a failure it was Bill Murray was actually photographed a couple of days ago at a golf course with some fabulous bell-bottoms Oh see that's delightful yeah because it's so wrong that it's beautiful and perfect bill more easy to picture look at them Oh see that it's a big ball he's so fun that dude he's wonderful he is just he is so fun look at him blowing up South Carolina yeah well I think it's cuz of his kids that Zoey's yeah I think it was a family thing oh he's uh that's abuse Bourdain's show and Bourdain interviewed him in his small town where he lives and it's like wow look at this guy just kind of hanging out being normal no girlfriend no wife just just being himself but you don't know that he doesn't have a girlfriend or he was talking oh he was talking yeah I don't think he was talking about on that show I was talking about in Aruba yeah he just doesn't do it anymore yeah leave me alone you know stop delightful that's why I like staying home it's nice as a matter of fact at the end of my shows I always thank the audience for actually leaving their homes to come see me because I know what an effort that is and I'm so appreciative of it so you're just a homebody type character yeah just so much well you know it's like my life is extraordinary so I want to live an ordinary ordinary life as I can that makes sense you know just calm it doesn't have time for ordinary down you know chilling man yeah you need that right yeah I'm not big show looks like tonight I'm going to an opening of a movie my friend wrote it and you know prepare yourself for it there we go no no III just don't be cool with it like if I know I'm doing it and why I'm doing it I do it you know party it was party Jeff Ross's but you know I'd go to a dinner party if he had one again I'm I'm done though with the Jeff Ross parties there's a lot of parties I know I love Jeff Ross I didn't but I am NOT going to any more of his parties tell him I'll go by myself house I don't have them put two hands on his shoulders tell him you love him well I'm gonna talking about the man bun in the pool like who do you who you friends with it as a man bun he's a producer bro yeah he says he's helping me with a project yeah it was like a shoulders love you I can't come to your fucking pool parties anymore bro yeah yeah well it wasn't even a pool party that was a thing somebody went I'm gonna bring my suit and get in the pool and he got in the pool with these two other people I didn't they really noticed that man that's unfortunate if it's not a pool party and you decide to get in the pool yeah that's always awkward as fuck well I I just didn't belong yeah you got to be like a really comfortable person to take off your clothes when everybody else has there's aw yeah I'm pro naked good for you I'm pro naked I'm for me I'm all comfortable well you're fit the fact that I'm processing you're angry at me no I I saw your little festival here you're really your passions are comedy and fitness that's one thing yeah it's one thing cars yeah Bob just American Werewolf in London yeah that's not the thing in the I love that movie but that's when he was in Trafalgar Square yes yes I remember that moment of scary I'm not happy unless um exercising I've tried both way I'm not happy unless I'm napping so we have our ways about us yeah well everybody's bodies differ on the way but I do exercise I eat well I gluten-free I eat dairy free and I eat sugar free that's awesome that's a good combination yeah and I aspire to be more of a vegetarian but I'm not obsessed with it do you read books on nutrition I have books on nutrition yes some that Brian Cowen even recommend which one's the name or bribe my father Brian counts a big recommended Kindle hold on I'll tell you what he recommended and they were good I like you know every one of those kind of books even if they're not well written or whatever I learned something from my pen gun I read a ton that's what I do when I'm at home I read a lot I listen to albums and I read music and I say albums do you have like a record player I have a record player and I have thousand albums sorry about a thousand holy shit yeah enjoy it do you've like a room that you go to you know I'm going to I'm moving into a new house which will be have a specific room that I will go into to strictly play guitar and listen to analog yeah if you do you know Henry Rollins at all I do know Henry Rollins well you say friends I mean but I do know him he's an acquaintance of mine he's a fascinating guy he's a fascinating guy good man very good and that dude very inspirational guy too inspires me I dig him III didn't interview with him at Largo I dig him big-time he's got these crazy quarter-million dollar speakers in his house yeah like there's a speaker room yeah look at this this is the room so is all these albums and those those gigantic things by the way the dude on the right I think is Robert hilburn who was the critic for the LA Times that's how much I dig music I think that's Robert hilburn I'm pretty sure so Henry gets Henry who obviously became famous great Josh he wrote the great Johnny Cash book that came out of here as good as they sound oh you dick Johnny Cash buy the pictures I love Johnny Cash I had a dog named Johnny Cash just died recently unfortunately my granddaughter's name is Johnny um that those still speakers are fucking crazy look at these speakers he's got yeah I just got new speakers they're like 8000 for a pair and I thought I was not look at the size of that that's ridiculous that's why she wondered granite says like 2001 a Space Oddity looking speakers I want to go over his house but I don't want to ask I don't wanna be like Henry come on bro let me come over your house I don't wanna be that weird I'm looking for the big avoids because I know I downloaded them and I want to own them but how many people do you think own those speakers I mean I thought yes but that person if you have to be wealthy or that's where you want to put your money click on the yellow one that you just what's that oh that's the same speaker except in yellow oh those are a big ball around because they look like Plumbing Supplies do they don't look good I don't think they look I think they look good I think they look futuristic again why we get fat I was that bio on my camera the guys name why we get fat and the for our body oh yeah ok tonight it's at Ferris and I learned stuff from both but I learned stuff about nutrition and stuff and I'm in my at my most I was 320 whoa and I'm currently in the two 40s that's not and I'm making the transition now to hopefully low to 30s somewhere in the two 20s and then building up muscle and I'll never be fit like you and I'm not I mean that's I'm not saying that to insult myself in terms of like you know but you this is a passion of yours it's not a passion of mine I just want to live life at a higher level right and a better love just want to feel good I want to feel great yeah and I already do so if I can improve on this delightful the big thing is cutting carbohydrates most people have far too much brain pass for me that's where the gluten and the sugar came from and and the dairy and I feel good with my body not having those things I react positively my so and anything else is okay for me kind of exercise to do I do pilates pilates is fucking hard really hard yeah great Pilates teachers great I do I swim I work with a trainer I play tennis playing tennis tomorrow morning today's Wednesday yeah tomorrow morning I'll be playing with my tennis teacher I play golf which is not that physical however like when it was at the store buying stuff the other day you know at the golf store and he wanted the guy was very nice guy helping me wanted to sell me something that I'll have to bend over to get the ball I go I think that bending over and as matter of fact stretching my hamster really I don't know the benefit I'd get from golf if I didn't at least Bend she's telling you not to bend well they have these things so people don't have to bend well that's for people who they like really bad back no no it's for lazy people that's why I think a lot of people so for me it's a matter of pride to bend because if you have a bad back you probably can't swing either can swing yeah it's a lot of you back but I do a lot of different things I love sports I played when I was younger I played baseball and football do you ever play golf or tennis rather with Kalyn because he's a tennis freaky no I should actually by the way I just started again don't play tennis since I was a kid I'm actually going to talk to him about that hopefully we can play some the thing about tennis though is it's a lot of like going left and right left and right and putting weird strains and pressures on great for you it's but it's great for bone mass okay that's good for it bone mass that makes sense yeah pushes you're pushing and pushing off yeah I dig it and by the way I'm not gonna play competitive with him I'm gonna hit with him right cuz he could probably beat me also weighs about 70 pounds less than yes so he can move baby spry he's been playing he's very spry he's he takes his physical fitness very seriously he does I'll tell you about it oh yeah listen I know yeah he gets very serious about half-assing everything I think it's very serious okay you know I'm saying like he's never gonna get he's never gonna like come commit to being like a professional tennis player right but it'll get pretty serious about kind of getting into tennis sure who needs the stress yeah but no I'm saying it's like a good balance yes he's I get obsessed about things he gets obsessed about kind of getting any things but then doesn't go like yeah you are a follow-through fucking motherfucking follow-through Oh first let's do as a walk around here and go or look at you you're a fucking specimen you wonder you're a specimen just trying to stay saying Jeff's right do you are you married you have a girlfriend you're married yep yeah your wife must appreciate that what the physicalness wow you're a good man but but being looking over and going my house not a fat piece of shit he's a fit motherfucker and I'm gonna fuck his brains out tonight the shutters say that no not around me she should maybe I should start bugging the house you sure when she says when I'm not there when you're not there I bet you that's what she says to her friends are you married I can't answer mm-hmm yeah okay yeah I don't know don't pressure me that's like I can't I can't talk about that that's probably good transitions healthy yeah yeah things are in flux they're flexing I'm gonna flux festival it's not bad yeah no it's bad there's no winning oh yeah there's no one here before I love my wife but I don't want to go home and I love being alone but being alone blows so there's no winning there's no winning I'm a sad young man but I'm really happy because I'm functioning at a high-level level I'm rising and rising up you know what I mean I'm I'm facing adversity had a head on yes but my wife is a lovely woman lovely woman go down that's one of the things about going on the road you appreciate people when you come back oh my god yeah when you with yeah if you're there with them every day staring at each other I mean no I don't care who it is could be your best friend on the planet too much time with somebody except for a rare exception right Wow is that bad yeah it could be terrible yeah be terrible yeah almost everybody yeah yeah people you know you need to be around variety in terms of like different by the way I don't stay home because I'm not like staying home because I want to avoid experiences I like experiences and I'll go have an experience but when I when I deem that experience like Jeff's party not good for me I leave yeah but if I'm if I'm having experience that's new and I'm digging it I'll stay that make sense yeah well you know what you like that's a hell 56 years old man I know you're a man I'm a man yeah I am a man there man I'm Jeff Garlin here actualized I mean I'm an actually I'm aspiring to grow all the time that's what that's my thing to be a wise man I aspire my goal is to be a wise man and I'll never reach it not that I be stupid but I'm saying it's always evolving I have a friend and many many years ago at her house and she had the sign that said enlightenment is possible in this lifetime I saw that now whoa wow that's that's deep levels of it and putting you at a higher place than you are I agree with but true enlightenment I I I'm just kind of I'm not cynical I'm have more of a critical eye there you go right that's possible not I've never seen it I've not seen it but but it's like I'm not gonna deem it impossible because then Who am I and especially saying there's no God that's like me saying I'll tell you who killed Kennedy I don't know right and it's also what exactly is enlightenment and by whose standards by definition right so maybe if you have a very low standard for enlightenment and you reach whatever that level is you go I did it my lifetime look at me like if you are if you're smoking indica listen to great music and having fantastic sex after a great meal and and then someone says no no you're just supposed to meditate and just sit in a room and and and you know be mindful okay how about fuck you how about a big ball of fuck you yeah oh by the way can we make that happen for me that I smoked some indica listen some music have some great sex after a great meal arrange that Garlan it should be done yeah that's what Tony says to me you're Jeff Garlin Tony who Hinchcliffe yeah yeah he's right yeah well III I tend to be confident in my comedic skills we should be yeah the funny guy yeah but outside of that I I'm not lacking in confidence but leaving my house is like I said quite that's what I'm saying is like by whose definition is enlightenment cuz like say if you wanted to go to a concert or you wanted to go to a great movie with an enlightened person enjoy a great movie I would think my version of an enlightened person would in fact enjoy great movie i-i've been enlightened to the concert I saw James Brown when he first got out of prison and I found that that that performance that he gave was the most enlightened performance I'd ever seen was this when he was in the car chase was that that prison yeah it was the last prison he shot at cops because I believe so yeah that one was his someone else used his bathroom right isn't that what happened someone takes me I don't know I know that he got in trouble at the cops but maybe was that I don't know is that he had gotten out of prison and just the idea that James Brown was in prison I think maybe I remember in this incorrectly but I think someone used his toilet and then he got mad at that person and shot at something like you just shot the wall or something I don't remember that story but I assume that you're looking it up right now I feel like he was in a high-speed chase they shot his tires out remember this way sure something in a car though maybe I'm pretty sure they shot his tires out he was driving around on my rims he had to have been doing a lot of blow or some agitated you know what I mean no normal human thing and we're talking about James Brown is that agitated I mean he was fucking phenomenal when is he she was he on to state chase they went up to 85 miles an hour involved 14 cars they didn't stop because he feared for his life though I don't I don't see why it started now let's see that I feel like that that's what started he was he fired off a gun because someone used his toilet by the way a two-stage chase I'm guessing he lived near the border probably live in whacky states Georgia okay yeah maybe was like Georgia Florida yeah it could be close to each other Georgia Florida line is that AB and it is right doesn't know wheeler walk or make fun of them it says you've failed a beta pull over that's all it is that's what I'm pretty sure that's why they were pulling him over I think they were going after him I might be wrong about that maybe thought maybe I'm confusing him with okay Chuck Berry was the one who was filming people going to the bathroom right I think he liked to go in the by the pee like to pee on ladies I'm pretty sure interesting I'm pretty sure interesting general when I enjoy James Brown's music I'm not thinking about his car think about his other side you know oh really yeah but we're gonna say that's right oh here it goes okay carrying a deadly weapon at a public gathering an attempt to flee paris' driving under the influence of drugs okay he reportedly stormed into the insurance company next to his office waving a shotgun and complaining that strangers were using his bathroom as time reported drove on the rooms for six miles there you go are you kidding me years later this episode would frame the 2014 Brown biopic okay I'm guessing that I saw him after this uh-huh because it was right after that it would be no it would be late 80s Early 90s Jesus Christ he did six years he was in there for a while six fucking years how about just sober him up he was on PCP way they gave him a year for each mildly drove out rumors of a PCP habited already surfaced by the time his erratic behavior came to a head in September Wow PCP is a tricky who sang in the prison choir I bet he did shit imagine you go to jail for like stealing a car and your fucking cellie is James Brown okay buddy what do you want to do yeah that's something that's a hell of a story yeah help him write some songs did you ever see when he opened up for the Muhammad Ali fight with George Foreman holy shit was incredible that was incredible yeah incredible yeah he had so much power there was something about him man he would get on just power give you an idea how much power Prince wished for that power fuck yeah well Prince had it but he had another way different way but Prince looked up yeah didn't know James Brown was ridiculous I can't sing and I looked up to it yeah I don't have any musical talent just tells you what a waste all this was cuz Elvis had that power and he didn't use it he added early on and then he couldn't ever dance like James Brown though or if he didn't have a show but it would be different it's a different kind of power if he just took and harnessed you here it is look at this look at his dress - the fucking pants of the show Eunice goddamn drop it down doing splits I know he was not human and by the way he he's not even really flexible enough to do a full split and yet he's still dropping down onstage you know he was wearing a turtleneck that night and I said to him cut that baby out let's let's leave a little bit let's put your initials on there I think that that was done in advance all the girls is hanging around oh yeah look at these giant ass band I don't envy those people do you know when you see people with bands tauren get all those people all those working pieces have to fall into place you know I got all that though yeah but goddamn what a performance when I saw him and I saw him it blew my mind it literally blew my mind well what's interesting too is that you know Prince who died of painkillers he died from fentanyl yeah he blew his hips out dancing like that was that was the thing you know and that apparently is a very common thing my friend Maynard Maynard Keenan from tool please Center tool he just recently had his hip replaced and he was doing he's he's big into jujitsu love's jujitsu and he was having a really hard time doing certain things so went to a doctor to see what's going on with his hip and they're like dude your hip is gone son like it's just now was he functioning at all of them yeah yeah that's the hip replacement is one of the most unusual ones in terms of like its ability to restore you back to a fairly normal state other than a bride being a comedian is delightful I would not do any of that shit no there's no get up and by the way when you see someone moving around like that on stage I will bet you every penny I have they're not funny Callen moves a lot on stage he's very funny he doesn't move like like throws can't so upstairs in the in the you know the Improv upstairs you know that green room thing okay there's a monitor on stage with the thing and I will turn to our and where they go funny not funny because I I can watch and tell how whether the comedy is coming to them or whether they're pushing it and most of them move around people are pushing it but Jim Carrey was a move around guy who's always really funny but move around in a different sort of way territory wolf there's exceptions to all stuff like all things but in this sort of way I'm drama when someone just stands there and talks and then they're doing some sort of movement it's not good Jim Carrey there was a purpose right Brian it's part of who he is yeah that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about people that just oversell shit by silly physical izing what should be just funny the way you say it not even what you're saying the way you say it Tom Segura calls it dance moves it is dance moves I'm Seguros funny he's a genius he used to call it English putting like English yes totally under dance moves damn moves that's what I'm talking about so Jim Carrey and Bryan Callen do not have dance moves right these are funny and they also move there's a reason for their moving but moves oh come on man and you know was so funny years ago I remember any time I saw someone miming having sex you know pumping air yeah I was just going not funny no it was just like it was a sign of like what if there's a bit where you have to mime pumping pumping air there's got to be a bit pumping air yeah you mean like there's got to be growing yeah some bits what what but who doesn't know what that looks like why do you need to pump maybe there's a reason there's something unless like you're imitating someone having a heart attack pumping right or you know if there's if the content is about your physicality right that's not dancing right right right Dancing's when you when you put like English like when you when you're doing this to accentuate what you're saying it's like screw that we don't need that well do you ever go to open mic nights I used to do them up until recently really I would just show up and say can I go up and do ten you know and yeah and what was really fun was when the person who had him didn't know I was oh that's great and then I watched as other people explained and it was cool because I didn't have an attitude you know that and I would do my sets and the audience has an open mic nights are really they're terrible lot of time together there to see their friends or they're tired or whatever or they've been beaten down by totally unfunny shit totally unfunny shit over and over and over again so yes up until about four or five years ago I used to go to open mic what what's fascinating about open mic nights is you're watching people try to figure out how to be funny like you're watching people like if you go to the store like tonight and you you you go there it's gonna be a packed house it's all Chris D'Elia and fucking Andrew Santino and Ali Wong it's all killers you know and you're seeing high-level comedy over and over again and so you get you into that vibe and go this is a great place to be but if you go to an open mic night you're seeing this like primordial ooze you're seeing yourself or some things that you really shouldn't be saying sometimes you know because every now and then you see a little I explained to people get as much state when you start get as much stage time as you can without people seeing you that's good - that's very good advice but you need to go on stage over and over and over again but don't go on stage at any popular places go on stage at the suckiest cuz you only learn from when you suck that's a big part of it for sure that's why you know I really admired Charlie Murphy cuz Charlie Murphy was essentially a famous open mic er mm-hmm when he started I mean when he started he'd never done stand-up comedy ever and then he was just a really funny actor who was the brother of one of the greatest comics of all time who got on the Chappelle show and then started doing stand-up and you know Charlie would just just fuckin do it just go and do it and you know something had some rough sets to when he was famous like really famous oh you think when I did did those things that I didn't eat it plenty of open mic nights yeah everybody but but what I had was I was in control of myself yes and it didn't fall apart right if you're an amateur it would fall apart but it does it doesn't mean I did well well of course remember I remember one time dice came into the store this is probably four or five years ago maybe five years ago and he came up to me goes I'll go up after you you know it was very respectful very nice and I said no I really want to follow you I want to see what that's like I've never followed you please go up there and go for broke go for fucking broke how long are you doing goes well maybe a half hour I go great go up there for a half hour I got nowhere to be I'm gonna watch and I want you just to fucking hold nothing back and then I went up after him you know how I did fine didn't do good then do fine because I knew how to handle myself my professionalism yes the craft of what I know one out yeah but there's no following that with what I do which is totally different and having the audience go oh this takes it to a whole new place no did you ever listen to the day the laughter died yeah Rick Rubin's oh yeah fucking phenomenal great and it's just eating shit two hours he showed up a Dangerfield's for people who don't know it's literally I will never forget I was just starting out I think he did this look this up when that was I want to say it was like 1989 1990 knows after that it was fairly early it was fairly early I was very young in my career it might have been then cuz I was still living in Boston no no it might have been then because 89 yeah because okay I was thinking about me living here now but it was it came out the first time I lived here well I was living in Boston and I was just starting out and there was a great comedian named Mike Donovan who to this day is one of funniest guys I've ever seen in my life and Mike Donovan was laughing to the point where he couldn't breathe at dice doing this set while he was doing fucking stadiums I mean dice was doing enormous Nassau Coliseum what's in the bowl bitch Oh 20,000 people it was the biggest comedian of all time yeah and he just decides to show up at Dangerfield's in New York City randomly and I come Monday in a Tuesday night doesn't tell anybody's gonna be there I mean there's 13 20 people in the crowd he records two different sets and he has no material I mean fucking none he's making things up as he goes along and people are getting angry at him and they're walking out and he did a bit about Richard Nixon about how he eats ass and when he eats ass he does it like Richard Nixon he was like oh I love this he was doing this Richard Nixon impression of eating ass and for whatever reason Mike Donovan thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen his life he was wheezing like couldn't breathe talking about dice doing this impression and I was like wow this is like comedy for comedians but for the people that were in the audience like a guy got up because you're about as funny as our glass of milk the guy said that's him and then left are the best things in the album these people from like Kansas get here about it's funny as are clouds of milk walking off and dice shitting on them it's but the to have them mindset to be at the not just the top of his game but literally the top of stand-up ever no one before him had ever sold out Madison Square Garden multiple nights in a row the way he did I mean guys have done it since then you know Dane and Louie and there's been a bunch of guys who Z's but no one did it like he did then he was the first ever to do that and to do that and then to record these fucking awful sets and then put it we're gonna fucking put it I guarantee that was Rick Rubin's idea do you think so own without a doubt but you know it is dices like dice and I know Rick Rude I bet I bet it was how all of their ideas why maybe he didn't fight Rick Rubin how fast for grew but next time I see him yeah that's never asked him that but that sounds to me like Rick Rubin going let's do this interesting yeah but it was such a crazy bold move I remember thinking at the time because I was terrible in 1989 when it came out I was just like confused like how does one do that like one is so confident they released something that sucks because I had as I was when I was 19 it's me and my girlfriend Marta me and Marta were sitting in my car and I had a cassette player we're listening to dice it was just called dice and crying laughing crying laughs I was before I'd ever done stand-up and I remember thinking wow this guy is fucking something like what what like the amount of power that he had like on stage and these roars from what the crowd and we're sitting in my car laughing our asses off to the seat this cassette wasn't even CD that the couple years later he decides sir I'm just gonna put out something that sucks the day of the comedy died do they laugh or die yeah he's got like one of them fucking paperboy hats on the cover no it's a old man a boy and there's a little picture of him on there is that what is a second yeah small picture I think or maybe it's a big picture of him no it's a big picture we should get up oh yeah so but it is small in comparison to the actual CD yeah see if we can get Jaime um let's get a framed copy of that and put it on the wall somewhere I guarantee there's vinyl yeah let's get find it see if we could buy it and vinyl look I know [Laughter] I've seen him do that at the store I've seen him go up late night at the store look good you look at you over there and just start talking shit to people like meanwhile we're weightlifting gloves whenever his intention people's hands is that one yeah yeah yeah and big Jay oakerson wears weightlifting gloves in homage that's great yeah I was trying to get the two of them together in a podcast but scheduling-wise it never really were not shaken by that shit no no bad shit we're gonna frame under bucks I'll go to dice he might not have it you know guarantee he's got it hey yeah you pay for lunch I'll give you the the album have you ever seen his Instagram never go to dices Instagram no it's hilarious it's just so random it's like an older rich famous guy who dies whatever the fuck he wants supposed to have had coffee or lunch with him a million times I never had it's one of those things just never happen yeah yeah he um his Instagram is him like with a gold gym t-shirt with crazy sunglasses and he'll do like these little sketches but they're so random and weird like him talking to a girl look maybe you and we should do something later in the girls like okay like click on this play this this is like his this is his whole thing you like skateboarding I'm just thinking about it yeah maybe we should do that use the phone what's your name what the claw all right how cool yeah I gotta go take this afterwards he goes he's got another one a follow-up he gets mad at himself for not doing anything about it like go to the next video that's not hit there's another there play this one beautiful night huh beautiful it's that Lenore Elinor Kerrigan yeah yeah they're so random the videos is I guess the the text in that video was like I should have done something what's wrong with me yeah it's but this is him why did I leave I'm so dumb but they're so random it's like what is he doing in dice he used to do that at the store he used to have comics do these little sketches is okay you're gonna run through the door there and you're gonna knock him over and you're gonna go what the fuck okay go and the guy would do it he's run into the door and knock the other guy over and go what the fuck you're perfect through it again and you just it we just film this was like VHS tape you know I got old school one really and then he would edit it together himself but he did nothing with it and this was like dice was giant just fucking top of the world giant and this is what he's doing to amuse himself because the comics would just do it oh Jesus Christ you're just so happy dice is talking to you he's the reason why I started doing the road I would just do the store all the time I was constantly the storm one time we're in the bag goes you're funny you know you should do the road I go yeah he goes yeah it was you don't want to rely on these fucking assholes for money he goes you could fucking do whatever you want go through the road I was like yeah why don't I do the road because I was just doing TV shows and then you know do you do on TV shows you're kind of trapped in this this is how you make your living you got to kind of always be acting and always be going on auditions as I care I was because I wasn't making you don't make real money at the store you make what 15 bucks a set or whatever thank you know I've spent a one-year I never collected a check and then they never had them again at the store yeah I probably I'm guessing with the number of sets I did probably about twenty five hundred dollars five thousand dollars probably donated don't you back to the club yes Tony inspect the clothes I'm not donated to any charities by on behalf of the store yeah no not a charity you're donating to the charity of the store yeah I don't care okay it's good good good donation mm-hmm yeah that's a place is a fascinating place really I was gone for seven years and you know I've been back for four now and it's uh it is just uh I love the original room oh it's incredible to the room that's got it going the me well I love all three I don't they're all different belly rooms okay and the main room Eric by the way the main room performing in the main room does not bother me I hate the green room really hate it why the cocaine piano in the middle of the room and the best piano oh yeah the point thing is most of those people I don't want to see Oh back there yeah this is such a negative vibe really I think that there's a lot of comedians that play there that are a big bowl of dead weight Wow yeah but there's a lot of names but Bubba there's a lot that are joyful and great and I dig and I like watching and my favorite thing to do is laugh at my fellow comedians but on the flip side some people just man they're there their presence just depresses me Wow interesting yeah I don't feel that okay maybe do an impression no no but some really I think yeah because you know the thing when I started in comedy which is 82 working through comedians really were a group that stuck together you don't think that's the case now no I think that I think for the past I think it started changing in late 90s 2000s to where it was every man for himself and a lot of people it wasn't like you're part of this fraternity it was like fuck you I'm gonna do this you know my thing with competition is go do your thing if the audience digs you more great if I'm auditioning in your auditioning go beat me in the room I don't give a crap but there is such a competitiveness and I know that's part of why Eddie doesn't do spots because Eddie Murphy Eddie Murphy because one I work with him I would say why don't you go he he'd say that the looks that I get in the vibe that I get from comics it's not pleasant and I go I knew exactly what he was talking about that's so weird I have the exact opposite feeling comedy now and about us particularly like the store and that's the camaraderie at that place I don't I don't get it by the way I dig a lot of people there but the people who I dig know I did them right and I and I would say I don't dig don't know anything it's not like I spent right of course yeah but there's lots of guys and gals that are great but also plenty of them that like please step away I was having a conversation about this with a friend of mine recently who was living for a while and a place to be hated and he was saying that if you are in a place where everyone's negative you really kind of forget that people can be positive without a doubt yeah so why should I leave the comedy store and at least half of the times I play they're leaving they're driving I'm feeling like not positive that's so weird where-where's by the way I sometimes now arrange it the only set that I do at the Comedy Store now is I sometimes will close the seven o'clock original room show hmm because there's no one after me so if I'm five minutes long no one's giving a crap right and they've already seen the whole show there's no it's just and I can do that zip and do it and get the hell out mm-hmm I'll do a benefit in the in the main room or like I did what's a Tony show right kill Tony yeah we're gonna bring you into the fold Jeff Garlin bring wedding bring you into the fold fold by the way I know the nice we have nice conversations with him but the other people are always there hovering hmm the hovers I don't like how good I don't like a hover no hover is dumped over and that is brutal when you're having a good position if you're not into a grue if your group is not about making people like like I don't care whether your political sociable how you do your comedy but if your ultimate goal isn't to bring joy into people's lives what's the purpose right if it's not about the laughs and joy right and so I find here's the thing I don't dig a lot of ego running around the store when I'm there and most of the people I don't like have the biggest egos do you think that there's time because you're a very accomplished guy so maybe that's why you're getting that weird vial I've been told that before but if I thought that that would be weird so I don't know maybe well that's cuz you know there's a great line I'm not I'm not an alcoholic but I do know this line from the program which is what you think of me is none of my business which I love that's a great respect great perspective so what they think of me is none of my business I just know what they're putting out there mmm that's all yeah I think sometimes people will look at you and go well here's a guy who's been on and some of the all-time greatest television shows ever you know you're you're a guy that's got a massive like your your resume your accomplishments as a comic and performer is very enviable so maybe perhaps a self is a generous guy on every level I like being generous and I like helping comics you know sticking my hand out doing what I can to help so I don't feel that I put anything that they should be fearful of out no but I think it's their own issue I mean I remember when I was yes but I was starting out I would get real uncomfortable when I was around really famous people I'd be like wow this feels weird to be around this guy in real life I get that that can be what a journal you've always been very very friendly that's what I like to be a warm thoughtful person who most of the time prefers stay at home I'm gonna go out if I'm gonna go to the farmers market if I'm gonna go to the comedy store I'm prepared to talk to people take pictures of people be warm to people engage with people because if I don't want that I stay home right and so if I'm in a negative bad mood I really will go do my set and get out but that doesn't happen very often but I'll stay home yeah that's why you need that downtime right yeah you got to be able to recharge you got to be able to reach our side I used to not allow myself that I used to be worked so hard I was reading this article yesterday about Tom Cruise about Tom Cruise's life being very strange Jesus Christ Jeff Garlin what is going on with your phone what is that sense my ringer what is that it's a theme to a man and a woman but dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah doo doo doo I don't know what a man and a woman is I thought that's a it's a French movie she's right but hold on a second here how am I supposed to know that but actually I actually sing that with you know Jeff who plays piano and yes not Jeff Richard Scott Scott he and I shall start I'll look at him and I'll go I'm not singing tonight in the audience most of them goes Oh is if I'm known which I'm in the middle of the show I'll just look at them and go Jean said don't say lend them or send them in the whole zone Jean said and I sing and then when I'm done I tell the audience that I'm and the very accomplished at French gibberish which is what it is but yeah it's a great song so do you have custom ringtones for when different people call you know I just have the one with and join my ringers off which is off now last thing I was listening to his buddy guy whose is alive and well buddy guy's newest album he's I think about to turn 80 - I'm gonna go to Chicago a new album and just 82 and it's a badass out of course it is oh he rips it the whole out yes but that inspires me to still buy the everything about aging is about relevancy how are you contributing right like George Carlin nobody hear that George Carlin was doesn't matter 75 or whatever he was as a mentor he's relevant that's what I aspire to relevancy to contribute to mankind to my art to everything so I'll never be like you know if someone says who's that old dude and I'm not doing anything based on what I'm aspiring to do that's their issue right right now because I will be to my best ability relevant that's an interesting perspective because that it's really true but it's something that people don't think about you know it's like like rock stars in particular like no one looks at Mick Jagger and go why's that guy still doing it because when you watch him do it like oh Jesus he's still doing it he's still doing it he's like yes watching him live is ridiculous by the way he really moves no kidding around like at the oldest 30 no he's phenomenal it's ridiculous he's 70 70 something's still shooting loads in the hot models he had a baby recently that's my stage name but yeah yeah is it that's my band how do you have that stage name that's my band's name I didn't license it though so I'll give it back to you I put my apologies Bruce Springsteen's another one Springsteen's in his 60s by the way I saw that show I saw that show yeah and I my jaw was on the floor I could not believe this Gerard Way show his Broadway show it was one of the greatest things for he turns tomorrow Jesus Christ and he works out I believe twice a day every day does he really he does yoga and he trains with weights and I'll see if he could find Mick Jagger shirtless sure there's ton yeah but I mean like recent right well the tools go to tools to the right and and then go to yet time man there we go I know say right recent see if you can find a recent one there's a lot of pictures of him when it's closed off Jesus Christ Mick put a fucking shirt on yeah he a hot model he's an interesting man but that's why I say to you there's always exceptions there far right what do you got there oh let's not Mick Jagger that's him at 40 with the beard I know that for sure so that's the oldest one I seen okay well either way the guy knows what his movements are what's amazing his voice has not I think it's still amazing and the way he moves yeah it's so fluid it's so beautiful he does a lot of yoga I'm pretty sure Gulas workout Mick Jagger's workout cuz he's incredibly disciplined apparently and then look up Barnaby Jones reunion just like curiosity coming look at him look at that right there takes up yoga at 73 there you go I was already dead yeah oh I should oh it takes up aerial yoga I guess you're doing it on the ground didn't work for him enough yeah not enough you need to take it to a new level that's just ridiculous yeah incredible Mick jagged diet and exercise program live long long stay young what if he only eats peppers I was just in Thailand and when you go to the bathroom right by the toilet they literally have one of those garden hoses that you would wash a car with they play with bidets goes with those peppers we're eating that Thai food like this kind of splatter that you're creating they're like let's just let's just be honest toil paper is not good enough you're gonna need a hose down so funny if there's a guy waiting outside the bathroom to explain that to you you just walk out he says you you're probably a little confused but toilet paper is something I put up on my Instagram today about a sign that I saw that said please don't pee on the floor and I'm like how many people have to pee on the floor before you put a sign up that says please don't pee on the floor and by the way if you're a person who pees on the floor are you really gonna go oh I was going to but now I'm not at all I'm stopping exactly it's like please don't rape by the way the truth is about floor peeing it P ends up on the floor some does yeah some does for dudes yeah for dudes another thing I read that that's very honest that I've read that I agree with some guy said because of smart phones I I pee sitting down much more than I would like to admit no that's a fact we did an episode about that on Curb Your Enthusiasm out I'll just pee and I'll read my phone yeah I'll just just read stuff yeah you guess no look people with their phones that's a whole thing you got a problem with phones as a tool no I do not but as a avoiding being in the present I do yeah they're addictive there are addictive they're very addictive and by the way I gotta be honest I don't remember the show where somebody didn't pull out their phone the last show like when we were to dump or someone is even if it's one person right I can't even remember somebody not doing that and that's the ultimate so disrespectful one of the things I did before my last Netflix special that I filmed in April was I went on tour for three months where you had to use those cell phone bags you did those Yonder bags yeah they're a giant fucking pain in the ass by the way I play a lot at Largo uh-huh and I would just make an announcement and then if someone does you kick them out no I mean some people just feel like yeah yeah but I gotta just answer this text yeah yeah but I just got to do this yeah but I'm a big fan yeah but my response is yeah yeah but I'll see you later yeah there's an issue but what we're gonna say is that it's a big pain in the ass those Yonder bags but this show was like 10% better because no one had their phone and you just sit there and you would actually be connected to the show the people are cured but what if I got a fucking plan later what if I got a dis what if I got a text coming in what's that character's name I don't have one you don't have a name for the Cure Doug oh okay let's stand Toby okay Toby this is Toby oh my god oh don't forgot a call coming yeah I gotta leave the show to answer the phone tell me what your buyers Caribbean movie is your favorite all of them are fuck the huge Johnny Depp fan one of the reasons why I did that because cuz Chappelle was telling me how much he enjoys it and Hannibal Hannibal Buress was telling me how much he enjoys using those bags too but another reason was this woman complained that when she went to my New Year's show that some girl behind her made two separate phone calls and was saying happy New Year to people during the show during the show she's like this stupid fucking bitch was making phone calls while the show was going on the way I've been behind in front of next to that person that's a crazy thing to do to me you're at a performance a live performance and you're calling people and talking them or even answering the phone and talking on the phone but I think if you have signs with a stern language saying you'll be no it's like peeing on the floor bro no but I really respect my audience and I really think that that would eliminate the handful of people that would be douchey yeah most because I play at Largo a lot and at Largo they make the announcement and I have I have never seen anyone during my show was exceptional that's an exceptional place yeah but but you can create an exceptional vibe yes in your audience with by respecting their I certainly agree I'm like it's like you know when I go someplace they want to put a stamp on my hands I just go no no no no there'll be no stamps on my hands and you know what the doorman usually says what okay really yeah so I think they're not I don't really drink alcohol so but so but like if I go to the bar and order a drink the guy's gonna look for my stamp point being is fuck all that I got our respect for but it's like it's like also when you go to the bathroom and they have the sinks I don't mind the sinks to where it senses your hand even though it doesn't always do it but man those type those ones where you push down and you get 10 seconds that's so disrespectful it's wrong wrong wrong really wrong to mankind you don't bothers me what then you wave your hand in a thing and it gives you a tiny little strip of paper yeah yeah a little stingy ass piece of paper to dry your hand give me a real fucking piece of paper tape those powerful new blow ones no that's no good I dig them there's an article that I tweeted about those things what are the problems there's like shit dust in the air from people the premise of the shit does come there so you're saying people take a dump wash their ass wait yes and then don't go to the sink to wash their hands they just go straight for the dryer thing cuz it's fun and let's spread the shit around the thing is with that when you hit that dryer the dust from that the wind kicks up this is science hope you enjoy scientists there's too much for me to think about too much for me to figure listen man I did no research I just posted an article that I read okay it says it those things that's really hygienic and then somebody goes hey if Joe posted it must be true cuz he did his research could be very click beany right they could just go yes some bullshit some bullshit yeah some guy named Bob was a doctor I'm telling you they're shitting there that's my character of Bob was an angry doctor there's shit in there am i right Toby shit dust there yeah yeah yeah I was on the phone you know I don't have time time to wash my hands hand dryers sucking fecal bacteria and blow it all over your hand study fine c-bro go enjoy so I will not be using that anymore I lose the brow dryer and when I touch the thing to have the towel will come down I know that that's very clean yes no no just split this way there's no winning you can take a dump in public there's no winner well there's also the issue of like becoming some OCD person who's fucking completely crazy squirts parrell all over their body everywhere they go cuz they're afraid of everything they touch and then they don't build up immunity I had that's I have a giant issue with with that I got any people who in in auditions won't shake an actor's hand yeah because they've got and that's not well da friends with Howie yes I know that how he doesn't touch you don't he doesn't even bang knuckles anymore he was banging knuckles for a while he won't even do knuckles anymore he's gotten worse that's his business he's a good man he's a very good man yeah I really like that guy alive I did but I want to hug him I want to kiss her on the lips he's such a nice man he's a good man he's a very good guy but I want him to get over that cuz I think it's insane not gonna happen why not you think people haven't worked with him on it it doesn't make any sense you have to want to change Joe your own psychiatrist don't want to change you're not going to change and that's with addiction with anything if you don't want to do it nobody try the way when it comes to addiction or behavior like Howie's logic does not enter the right yeah you can present your logical cases to all those different types of people doesn't matter they gotta wanna yeah well he he goes so far as that he puts down a trail of paper towels in his hotel room so he never has to stay on the carpet yeah I did not know this I don't want to know this I don't want to forgot how we in hotels sorry I want him to be happy in hotels well I'm sure he's happy once he steps on that paper towel you know what's special I loved as a kid what how he from Maui oh yeah it was hilarious he told me I told this the other night he goes that was shit no no no I laughed really hard at that special well it's because he's very funny that he's self-critical every funny person I've ever known thinks they're the best responses just thank you yeah that's good response thanks you glad you enjoyed you if I feel that way look when people come up to me and they go you're my favorite character on Curb Your Enthusiasm what I could really do is look them in the angle really really the guy who does all the exposition Larry David's not your favorite I think you're wrong by the way every blue moon when somebody says that to me I can tell that they mean it but all of them wouldn't know the difference because I think say thank you to all of them no one lives here that shit people do say stupid shit that they don't really mean just cuz they want you to respond to them yeah I tell you you're the best well Fame is weird yeah I learned that when I was at a this is a kind of percent true and I had this moment where Fame became clear to me I found myself waiting at valet parking with Tony Danza and it wasn't like we were even looking at each other or we had an awkward moment together I really wanted to say hello and not because I'm a big target on her hands a fan or any reason it was just the fame factor wanted me to talk to Tony Danza horse not even like hey Tony I'm Jeff Garlin hey Tony Danza oh you know hey and so I thought wow this is fucked up shut up I didn't say anything he seems very approachable he seems like a very nice fella but but that is not yeah when I was a young man I always wished that I was as nice as Tony Danza cuz when I see Tony Danza on taxi and although shows like he always seemed so friendly like why can't I be nice and friendly wouldn't be weird if as you got into show business you found out he was a prick but the truth is I've never I've never had a bad thing ever since I mean there was a fistfight with him at the comedy store one night oh really yeah yeah yeah a long long time ago I want to say like is before my time and I started there in 94 mm-hmm so someone said stupid to him somewhere back in the day and Tony Danza was a professional boxer yeah really good box yeah he actually took a pro fight in between tapings a taxi driver of taxi rather when he was first season in between first and second season he was off for a few months he's like fuck I'll have a fight and then he's like what am i doing fucking actor now yes and somebody got mouthy with them you know by the way when you see someone like that get into a fight you know whoever approached him really there have been times where I felt like it's just not worth it yeah because you you lose you lose I don't care if someone calls you a Nazi right a kike any bad word just move along that's the other reaction right like there's some people that would come up to you Jeff Garlin hey oh you fucking think you're all funny cuz you're on Kirby enthusiam at like maybe once every two three years while you're really continuing the character no but but same guy who's that Toby knows yeah Jim's on meth Jimbo's on math so said no but but I just avoid you know yeah I don't get into it you know what you think of me is none of my business that includes Fame right so people come up and say things thank you that's the right thing to say yeah and and then you want to say to them sometimes and you know this one could you move along because they just stay well yeah they just stay there and it's really awkward there was a dude at the Kombi square scared the hell out of me because he told me how much I meant to him and then he didn't leave and then he was telling me personal things about him that were not I'm not gonna repeat them because I don't want to you know let him rather talking to me but he started telling me things I go wow you're really a scary individual and I want I never have said the words move along but I actually moved along into an area he couldn't enter I remember was behind the Rope you know by the cars or in the bar you know the something to get away and he still tried you know it was skill yeah people get crazy you know what bothers me sometimes you'll be in the middle of a serious conversation with someone they're telling you something like really intimate so I'm gonna go over hey man hey and you're like food Tony's just telling me he's suicidal jump in front of a bus and you don't give a fuck no it's it's it's a big bowl of wrong it's just because really just be respectful and kind anyone who comes up to me as respectful unkind I'm kind to anyone comes with me as an asshole I'm kind you're an asshole you're not either you have a couple of drinks and you don't know what to say what's the number-one rule with someone who's drunk too much but telling him that they're drunk that's good to know saying hey man you drunk yeah hey man I don't really I don't really talk to drunk people I'm not drunk Oh always it's the it's the only go to yeah there's no other go to in that situation Drive yeah I can do it yeah and so because whatever it does it really plows into your ego yeah and so I just make the quickest connection and get get out yeah that's a good move yeah it's true but I'm appreciative when people come up to me I'm appreciative and I treat them the way if someone I'd ugh especially a comedian if I told them I dug them I'd treat the people the way and the more the warmer and the more interesting the person is the more I give them of myself how does Larry David handle it he's not bad yeah I've seen him go through because it was I saw him become famous you know he was on Fridays he created Seinfeld but that still wasn't the fame that he has now so I saw him through Curb Your Enthusiasm yeah become truly iconic so he's had trouble figuring out how to people want to take a picture of people you know yeah how do I do it and it's always changing he's never an asshole it's truly one of the greatest comedy shows of all time well thank you I understand and I have to say the new season we're about to film in October the storyline may be my favorite and it's really subtle and fun it's like one of those things like Oh it's like I think people watching it will feel that they're living a fantasy and after the first one airs I'm happy to come back and talk about it you know I mean because that premise of where we're going is delightful I love how HBO gives him sort of carte blanche they're like you know take a couple years off do whatever the fuck you want like yeah takes him pretty great yeah well for Larry it's not about the money Ralph's course it's about can I do another good show that makes us different than most shows in history yeah and he he only wants to do good work and enjoy himself otherwise there's no reason yeah and HBO is smart that way they're genius they're I mean look if you think about the show Sopranos fucking Game of Thrones you know they know how to let a show a show they from what I understand they give a lot of notes on their pilots but once you become a series they kind of leave you alone that's amazing you know whereas when you're doing a network show or from other paid sources I've heard that the notes never stop well when I was on the radio is the easiest thing to ruin with notes drama can survive notes comedy cannot because it's like the you know doing comedies like you know the the dominoes and if you take one of those and just move it a little to the left to the right you're screwing up the whole thing that's a very good point yeah when I was on Newsradio we weren't successful and that is when you get the notes we were my friend Lou Morton who was one of the writers he would wear a shirt every Monday after the ratings would come in with a number on it it would take a white t-shirt and write it and one day came in the number said 88 I go fuck dude really he goes yeah we're 88th I'm like fuck I was like goddamn that was three years right five five years so the point being is that was an immensely successful show barely that's pretty great no no no for sure it's definitely better than being cancelled but the point being is that we were never a hit so we always got notes we're constantly getting notes like we need a gay neighbor we a black guy we need a we need of this we needed that we need a love interest we need a fine watch that show by the way the gay neighbor and the black guy if that was the name of the show I'd be in that's a probably good name of sitcom Dini black guy lives next to a gay neighbor and it's the problem there's a lot of sitcoms and I don't want to name names but I watch them and I know they're very very very successful and I watched them and I'm stunned I don't understand it it's like they're speaking a different language I don't get it either I don't I don't but I don't watch comedy man I think it's Middle America I think there's there's something going on with tired people no you don't wear something that I noticed this is something that's recent to that audiences now respond to what they think is supposed to be funny like real comedy fans Doug Newsradio like people who Doug comedy I think Doug Newsradio people who did comedy did curb do we have other kind of fans too yes but I find that comedy fans really do get comedy right but everybody likes to say they like comedy or they watch comedy and they meant out of any sense of humor right so I find there was a show I'll give you an example and this one was like this specific and I don't care if I'm slamming it it was the something and the girl and the apartment B or the bitch and something B it was um lead actress very talented but I watched the show and the rhythms were this is what comedy is it wasn't funny it didn't have a natural vibe to it it had no reason for me to keep watching it but it was done in a style that other shows have done since where this is how comedies done this is the way we spin a line or do a situation and I don't know why but it always involves a lot of that that putting the the the spin on the ball or what is it dancing in English it has a lot to do with it because even if you watch a lot of Nickelodeon shows or Disney shows they tend to do that they put the spin on it it's never funny enough just a here's the thing about comedy TV comedy I think for the most part you're supposed to be enthralled with the situation by situation so the situation Lucy got into a situation yes and you laughed at Lucy dealing with the situation I really I bet in the entire time Lucy ran on the rent on the air that there might have been 12 great jokes that she said in the situation you're laughing on how she deals with the situations very good and you look at any great comedy and that's where this it's Larry David dealing with a situation yes it's it's so and by the way one thing Larry and I were very proud about with Curb Your Enthusiasm if one of us says something funny to the other one because we improvise we laugh so these shows you see right people say these lines written by writers and then the audience laughs if it's on stage but yet the actors don't laugh at one another right so on a lot of levels it's just not right and then there are shows now that I've watched for maybe five minutes where my I cannot believe how they're how terrible they are and yet they're successful hugely successfully successful don't get it yeah when you guys do a show you don't really have like a full script in terms a no it was very tight outline we have seven pages wrote line Larry has written the story right and in that story maybe a half-dozen things are like he says this or she says does you have to move the story yes for story purposes not because it's a great job right and then I play it every time differently unless I'm told by the director or I'm one of the producers we have a meaning of like we need to get this across this is not coming across and I'll make an adjustment right but in general I try and do it different every single test that is so crazy and how many takes we do well if it's Larry and I just us he and I alone the scene it we can we can have a scene done in less than an hour but if there's a bunch of other people could be three hours Wow and the idea is just like this is what needs to take place we have to figure out how to write get it across the fact that the refrigerators broke in and we're gonna have to go buy ice and who's gonna buy the ice I don't want to drive to buy the ice right then you're all just talking it's more in-depth than that the story is really there but yes how we approach it and sometimes that can change that's one of the reasons why this show is so good because it seems so organic when you guys are talking it is well that's what I get out of it we don't rehearse that's amazing so the Gulpers we don't even do a lot of rehearsing but I have to stick to the script if I want to improvise on the Goldbergs I have to let the producers know not to get permission to let them know this take I'm gonna do something different and I have to let my fellow actors know that's just to go from two different styles I I don't know that it's difficult but I find the Curb Your Enthusiasm way way more enjoyable I'm sure but I'm really proud the Goldbergs is the number one show on TV that families watch together so I'm very proud of it and I get why people dig it it's not my style but when I watch it occasionally I don't watch it very often I get why people dig it I'm not confused by the show you know what I mean like these other shows we're talking about I'll be confused as to why they're successful why they're on the air but other ones I watch like I watched Modern Family I get why people dig it right it makes total sense yeah you know so it's it's much more enjoyable during the curb thing it's edgy ER and all that but I still dig the Goldbergs and I also dig the crew and I dig the people I work with and I dig the writer so it's a very positive wonderful experience I'm lucky I'm on one of the most popular Network comedies and I'm on the most popular alternative comedy house you be so lucky but by the way I'm grateful I keep on getting told in therapy don't say lucky so much why's he tell you that because grateful because I do have something to do with it but not from an ego standpoint like I've worked hard I've done this I've done that so I'm just incredibly grateful you're lucky - I I think I told you I'm not kidding that dude has taught me so much that might be the only thing I disagree with him on yeah he doesn't know shit no lucky is good no Roger dog haha Roger Daltrey always said be lucky and it's because that means no matter how great you are no matter how much you have to do with this or that if you look at it that you're lucky being on by the way being humble is a big bowl of the Apple the combination of being competent and being humble you can't beat the being aware that you know you could be born in Ethiopia you could have been long that funny in the middle of nowhere yeah you know kid been fine I'm not big on ego ego ego screws me and by the way I was ignorant enough at one time to think I could eliminate my ego you can't you just got to recognize it when he adds up recognize it and and keep it under control what just say hey man don't need you yeah thank you you know sometimes I get asked to do something and as I'm thinking about it well am I saying yes to this out of an ego move hmm you know I've definitely done that yeah yeah I think that's well one of the main reasons why I exercise so much is to try to keep my body in balance and in - not in terms of like the way it looks but so it doesn't get in the way and I think that a lot of your body's and balance then that helps your mind oh yeah that helps your soul oh for sure not it's not a vanity thing no that's what it is - I definitely like looking good well that's also that I think that's more of a respecting yourself mm-hmm that's that's a self-respect thing to me there's definitely that but I think um which is weird by the way because that's not something that people most people generally love they hate going to the gym but they go you feel it your best when you're exercising that is amazing that is awesome I wish I could have that for a week just let me borrow it for a week just I'd always rather nap then do anything I don't mind nothing stand up I'd liked over napping sex over napping sometimes eating not as much anymore it doesn't be it's not a big thing for me anymore so I'd say sex and and stand up and stand up and spending time with my boys that that takes presidents over at my boys are eighteen to twenty-two I'm madly in love with them and so that takes precedence I'd rather be with them than nap yeah when they were little taking a nap with them I was in heaven yeah cuz I knew they were enjoyed yeah and they'd be lay laying against me no good night nurse yeah that's a the pleasure of having children I don't like having these people that you love more than you could ever imagine living someone more than by the way that's the thing like when someone's having a kid they're about to have a kid whether it's a wonderment I don't say to them oh you know because you can't explain it right it's truly a thing that you can't explain and you only sound like an idiot when you try going well here's what it is no you can't tell me it's gonna be unique to me and it's so bit much bigger than I ever could have imagined it's a different thing than you can ever imagine like you become a different person - there's like a literally there's an actual switch that seems to go off and the change of color wait let me just say something because you know people and I know people where for whatever reason that's which doesn't go off and they still stay the most important person in their own lives it's weird and it throws me and that's somebody I do not want to be friends with no it's so people that are bad parents that don't like their kids oh it's a very unfortunate thing it's a big bowl of wrong it's such an it's so sad yeah it's painful I think there's certain I mean there has to be levels of sociopaths right there's levels I think there is I mean just me I don't know anything about that topic I must be you see people people with sociopathic behavior yes and you just go oh okay well it's also the business that we're into the business loves them well for sure they want but I used to do a joke about it that the problem with actors is that they have this big hole in their soul that they need to fill up with other people's attention and I would say not me I'm different that's how I'm up here with a microphone right well by the way comedians are clinically they did and then for the most part then actor will you get child as you also know that to be a great actor you can be dumb as a rock oh yeah it's the only it's the only art form excuse me I little pick up something something happy it's the only art form and I know plenty of really intelligent actors but I know some that are so talented and if I could never have a conversation with it might be thrilled oh it'd be amazing because they're just so dumb yeah but when the time comes and they said they can become that person they can they can fall into that role and there's something something wrong with them what they could do it like Wayne Federman has a bit about it you know unless you were just mentioning Wayne Wayne Federman I love him so I'll it with him way way back in the dead room he's so funny he's a rock man and I've known him since I'm 20 years old I met when I first started doing comedy oh wow we're from I'm from Chicago but I started comedy I'd moved to Florida with my family South Florida and we're from the same little town in Florida called Plantation Florida outside of Fort Lauderdale we did a pilot together 20 years ago mm-hmm 1998 I think it was I think that was his last he had a bit that he was doing on stage once about actors and I grabbed him offstage oh dude you put it you said it like the way you said it you said it the right cuz like also he's free right because you know he doesn't have notoriety he's not worried about running into these people that he talks shit about on stage so he can be free and he was like he was like it's not normal to be able to cry on cue he's like it you can cry on cue yeah cuz you're fucking broken there's something wrong with you by the way that's another change in the world of stand-up the number of people who suit and this started from the comedy boom when people were getting sitcoms yeah actors saw this and they went oh if I do stand-up I'll be discovered yes and so that's brought a lot of people that aren't truly comedians to comedy yeah which and I can spot them there was a dude it's fine oh well oh my god yes there was a dewlap Factory who was actually funny and he was actually good and he said if I don't have a sitcom I'm quitting and by next year and he didn't and he quit Wow I don't remember his name look otherwise I tell you off there I'll talk you about that's not for it no so but the point being is is that if you're really a comedian it is so part of your DNA it is so part of who you don't feels like it's not who I am no comedians it's part of who we are yeah on a deep deep level the passion and caring that comedians truly have for comedy and that's why I look at other comedians as my brothers and sisters yeah so if you're dealing with ego if you're dealing with you're an actor you're trying to get famous if you're dealing with the competition then I got no part of you yeah when you look at me and you go Jeff Garlin has no choice but to be a comedian then you're thinking on the same wavelength as me because I have no choice I have to be a comedian yes some people get very very resentful of those actors like there's plenty of room and I remember some famous actors trying stand-up you know in 91 we try in the 80s like I remember um which is what's her name she was Sean Young oh yeah yeah yes she was coming into the improv and I remember she was doing stand-up Plus but see hers was full of shit so I was like I was the only one there who didn't help her everyone bent over backwards but she wasn't sincere and she did it for five minutes but they like being around a famous woman who's beautiful yeah you know but the point being is that people forgot about anyone can do whatever they want but do me a favor if you're going down that path don't screw me with your negative shit she's an interesting case I read a whole article about her and Fame and her struggles with it and you know you know people forget she was in the original Blade Runner she was a phenomenal actress and so Beautif stunning stunning yes so good too I mean just so inertia probably was a very intelligent woman and there were flaws in her life and flaws in being an actress and thought by the way being in the public eye is not especially now with social media is the opposite of a walk in the park you are you are I am not entitled to any privacy I am not entitled to any alone moment right when I'm walking in a park I'm not and that saves me to look at it that way yeah that I'm not entitled to it right because if I want to be alone I'm gonna stay in my living room I'm gonna sit in my backyard and look up at the trees and the breeze man I can't see the breeze back in feel the breeze but the point being is there there the world of any privacy for you in the public eye gone yeah and you know when I met like a restaurant or the airport in the TMZ people come with their microphones I don't say a word why help them sell that crap and then they turn off the mic and they know this at this point now and I'm very friendly how you guys doing what's going on and I know some of them but I don't have the right to walk through the airport without them in my face that's part of the thing the only demand ever get out of those is you say something stupid and people get mad at you right the only thing you get out of that is saying something stupid and people get mad at you there's no winning there's no time what you're gonna say something to TMZ and people are gonna watch and go that was so damn insightful possible it's certainly possible you can that is such a long shot specifically TMZ yeah but Bourdain got a shitload of death threats when he was at the airport and they said if you were gonna cook dinner for Trump and Kim jong-un what would you serve he said hem walk you know just a joke he's a funny guy he said something funny and no but that's the thing you there's no winning yeah there's no winning because by the way he could say that at a dinner party right you know what I mean yeah and if someone's offended then they're a tool right you know he could say that by the way he could say that in a room full of 11 Republicans yes and they will laugh yeah but you're opening yourself up on your world that's right so I don't say anything you know you can ask me comments about things that go on in the world and I know I'll have us an answer that will not get me in trouble that's the case today with comedy right it's like you're opening yourself up to the world you're not just opening yourself up on people I never when I went onstage was ever in fear of going down a path where I would say something that was wildly inappropriate not while not inappropriate from the standpoint of taking a risk but just because my sense of humor doesn't go away to use certain words I don't use that word right not because I'm scared of anything but so I so people who do that and do that it's like like Michael Richards Michael Richards yeah the purple that's the by the way example by the way you know when he walked offstage and I think it might have been Tom Papa who was standing in the corner he went up to him I went weird crowd having no idea that his life was over as he knew it because by the way I remember being furious because certain people that came down to them on the news like the next day or two were people who I had heard say worse things in their stand up and they were talking shit they were talking stuff it's like when someone's swimming in a river of shit you don't throw shit on them I agree let him swim in their shit have a good time you chose to get in the shit pool you know but I'm not gonna throw shit it's loaded with shit how I felt with Roseanne you know when this Roseanne went down you need to say anything else except she really needs some sort of help and support yeah not like oh she's a Nazi or oh she's a horrible person no no she needs help yeah she and that's the whole thing why do I need us do i when the Harvey Weinstein or any of these fuckers come out I don't have a Twitter account because I also know just like TMZ how long till I say something that pisses somebody alright but there are people and I'm not saying their names I don't want to get into a thing who will come out and go gentlemen that's not the way to behave or you know I mean like right now really do I need to say rapist bad right do I need to say calling a successful accomplished black woman some thing bad is bad no you don't need my comment all these people on Twitter think their comments necessary oh I need to add into this I need to be part of this dialogue no well it's virtue signal you know it's letting everybody know that I your virtue aside I'm on the right side it's a bunch of crap whether it was a guy he was doing zoom that I'm making the right choice I want people to assume because they're not gonna hear what my choices there's a guy who's a journalist who was angry and he was saying that the lack of blowback from other comedians about louis c.k that they weren't screaming at how horrible this is speaks volumes and I was like you don't know what you're talking about that's what speaks volumes about this dude he doesn't know what he's talking about by the way should anyone disrespect a woman to man my knowledge never should anyone be sexually forward in a room and woman in an appropriate way no do I need to say that you don't and and say this is wrong no this I'm telling you this is then no gays I know of the thing I know five days of it coming out of him though admitting that he did it right though the whole thing was crazy like you know this guy was accusing all these other communities of being pieces of shit because they are not wrong they're not intimately you don't need my opinion of something if someone's swimming in a river of shit I I do not need to throw shit never ever it's like what are your requirements as a person when something happens if there's a mass shooting do I need to stand up and say that that was a bad thing right no no it's obvious that was a bad thing I don't know why do I need to comment on everything then why do I need to come in and if that's the case or an action I can do to help right it was it just commenting which does nothing nothing nothing oh really you're letting us know that's I'm saying these certain individuals and I'm thinking of two in particular who I know and like both of them know three of them there three of them actually one I don't know as well no but I'll tell you afterwards okay always in these situations say the obvious like yeah who wouldn't believe that and I get furious especially one of them's a great old friend of mine and it's just a comment every time and it's like yeah I have a friend that does the same thing who's a accomplished stand-up and it's always how do I wear this without giving this guy way it's always about anything that has anything to do with women like he's always standing up for women but while I know that lives in hell right I know he lives in hell like his marriage is shit he like literally hides like he's in hell he's in hell his wife's a monster it's amazing it's amazing though isn't amazing though it is it's just like they just almost like he's like whole thing like when the divorce comes like down the line which is definitely to come like at least a guy I will have a reverent conversations with my friends drinking coffee hanging out sometimes I even talked to loud in a coffee shop but but I will another by the way there's another one you know the worst possible things you could ever hear comedians of the funeral the comedian dies what comedians are saying to one another it is stuff that would be Unforgiven Unforgiven but it's just the way we deal with grief in those situation well it's also the inappropriate thing at that time is very funny to someone like you or I very very fun I was sitting right next to Dave Foley and we went to the Emmys and Phil Hartman had just been murdered and he was nominated for an Emmy any loss to this guy from Frasier and Dave looks over at me he goes the fuck's that guy have to do to win that's great and we're like crying sad we're drinking and we're just so bummed out at his death right and then Dave says that and then he says it was like a total straight face what the fucks guy have to do to win that's really funny in the moment it was just about we say the most inappropriate things in tragic moments to make usually laugh to make sure is left but I'm not gonna say them on my Twitter no I'm not gonna say them to other people by the way anytime I have ever tried something sort of inside with someone not on the inside in terms of comedy it has been a disaster disaster every time how about you not even privately like like with at a party or something what about with your kids parent you know your kids friends parents the the biggest fights with my wife I look back over the years are when we either went to the principal we went to have the meeting we went to the open house something I said I never left there unscathed the only one that you couldn't get that mad at me for was I convinced our tour of a school that the building was haunted that was the only time where she went that was kind of funny but you freaked everybody out including the school officials so yeah inappropriate you're inappropriate Jeff Garlin I am a big ball of inappropriate have to do but but but it's sort of how we get through life we meaning idioms well and and and the thing is we're wired alike we are we share I'm not gonna say DNA yes but we share something we're a brother and sister and we're together so I remember coming offstage this is like a classic one coming off stage at Caroline's doing a benefit and they're not coming upstairs waiting to go on stage Colin's onstage Colin Quinn and he's fucking eating it and I'm thinking this crowd sucks fuck them but I'm gonna go do my best it's a benefit some guy comes up to me and he says I can't wait til you go up I go thanks it goes this guy I can't go just know you're talking about my brother my brother is standing up there doing that you're not complimenting me if you're fucking with my brother that's what I told him because it's the truth right we are together we experience something but that's I'm saying there's a uniqueness and a specialness and not everybody is part of that everybody is an actor trying not I mean a lot of people actors Allah P or any cuz their ego their singing voice maybe wasn't good and if I got to sang it's like and by the way the people that I have problems with almost never are true comedians yet to where it's a brother you know and like like we're really when we're together you know it's almost never it's always ego people and it's always people that are doing it for the wrong reasons and by the way it's not me sitting in judgment it's me getting what they give me hmm and by the way I don't have conflicts with them I let them you know that's something I learned a long time ago that's ego to put my shit on them right right but I Drive home feeling sad yeah so I avoid doing I've learned to not have conflicts took a why don't ya before what I would disagree with something I'd be like fuck you but that fuck you doesn't get anywhere it's like the same thing is like when something happens and you complain about it on Twitter but I you're not changing let's talk about change did you read about that girl from Sweden it's from Sweden maybe who got on the airplane with the guy who was all sent to Afghanistan I did read that this morning I have never been more I think I was afforded and now she knew when he gets back he's gonna die he's gonna be murdered this guy that was her what is this stuff cuz I only read the headline of it hoping the whole story so she's on the plane specifically bought a ticket knowing that he's being deported so she did it I'm pretty she's an activist she's an activist but I don't know what she's done in the past all I know is she refused to sit down and at a certain point there was a soccer team on the flight stood up with her there were other people who said we back you but there are also a lot of pieces of shit sit down you're making us late someone's going to die and look at her putting herself on the line and then she was as she and the guy who was being deported were finally escorted off the plane because she did her research and her research told her that the captain can have them both taken off the plane and take off anytime so the the story was that he was being deported because of ice is that why I say I did I only read the line at Jim so but he they were deporting him yeah and he was gonna get sent back to Afghanistan where he was gonna be killed yes story I was reading about some woman who was devastated because her her daughter-in-law was being deported and she was a trump supporter and her daughter-in-law was being she's been in United States her whole life and being deported and you know just couldn't couldn't believe it couldn't you know what came over here is an infant that kind of thing the the when you're an illegal alien that no one gives a fuck have you been here for thirty years you only been alive for thirty two they don't you get sent back and that's that's a disgrace it really is a disgrace no it's a horrible it's a horrible thing and simple like well why don't you fuckin this young girl young girl but believing so strongly that she bought a ticket got on the plane and then wouldn't sit down but what happens now though what if the guys still get sent back most kill but she's no she did something she did something and maybe you won't yeah you don't know but that's more than just her putting on her Twitter account this is not right right being deported this is someone actually doing something yeah so it was something that doesn't injure somebody else and it can inconveniences people but nothing more than that what if you had a layover though you know a big gig yeah huge I'm on her side I know that from the goofiness sold-out crowd no I don't care filming a Netflix special no are you gonna film a special I am next next spring so when you do have done what the Goldbergs and curb I'm gonna do a Netflix special so a year from now essentially somewhere in the range summer oh so when you do that will you change your approach will you have an outline like you do on curb and like roughly know what you're gonna talk about I what I have stories and things I've been telling onstage they've been coming out of me so I will tell all those but I'm doing three different locations here in LA and three different shows so you gotta film
