hello freak bitches man it you still have those yellow jerseys in your house why'd you have to give them back no good fuck down she put it with an Instagram picture of them everyday that was yeah that yeah I'm not gonna put that picture up again haha that was a great picture though oh you chilling on the couch at 7:00 yellow jerseys on your wall I got I got a note for that one well you're gonna get nuke no matter what you do look but but I look I mean they're up yeah they're up and and and I'm proud of them I really am and I'm proud of and that's the thing too is that as weird as it is and as strange as it is that there's just a line through those years as if they did not happen yeah man I had I was paid to do a job right as messy as the job was whatever I was paid to do it and I did it and I wanted to win I wanted to capture those memories for myself and for my teammates and you can't nobody can take those away from me I still hold those memories to myself and yeah it's it's it's had a complicated ending but you know I still view those as victories and I still view those memories as good the carrying around the lie and being interrogated and questioned and it was that the hardest part about all of it you know I was I was only interrogated or questioned with the press and even you know God if it would have been in this day and age with with with Twitter and Facebook and social media and it would have it would have been a thousand times worse I mean this was you know I mean this was in the late 90s I mean think about that look that was a long time ago and so the level of scrutiny while it was high wasn't nearly as high as it would have been today but yeah I mean once you dig in you know these with these guys you're stuck so once you finally came clean I mean obviously there was a lot of blowback but was there also a relief not not immediately not immediately I mean I I get asked that a lot and I think people people people expect me to say well you know it was just this it was this this huge relief off your shoulders when you when you talk to Oprah or you or whatever you did that that you can now move forward and live the life of an honest man and accelerate cetera but it's taken me let me just sum it up I mean sitting here today having this conversation I would much prefer to have this conversation then the one where I woulda lied to your fuckin face 15 times 10 years ago I'd much rather look like this so that's that's a relief but it but it's not like I walked out of sitting with Oprah and was like oh my god I feel amazing okay that was that was an ass woman yeah and uh so was it like sitting there with Oprah she's asking she's drilling you a new quest how about that start she came out yeah she came out hot yes or no yes when she owned one yes or no I said I thought you know I thought she did a good job she did a great job thought she did a good job I thought it was very compelling yep because the way she structured the beginning part of gas station yeah especially if you're going to do something like that on television you want to capture people and keep him there yeah kind of have to approach it that way I thought she did a good job I don't I know that it wasn't well-received and I and I mean in what way you mean people didn't like you afterwards in that way yeah I think there's two things number one I wasn't emotionally ready to do that interview I wasn't I wasn't in a place where I think that I sit today where it's it's it is a position of contrition and understanding the tremendous sense of betrayal that's out there like my perception of that today is much sharper than it was three years ago when I sat with her the feds and other lawsuits forced my hand I had to sit there with that because I knew I was going to be sitting with her or with you or with Tom Brokaw or I was going to be sitting with a government lawyer being deposed being videoed and being leaked so I said well I'm gonna go I'm gonna find the place that I'd rather sit down and talk about this as opposed to a grainy video that the government leaks to the world and that's you're coming out so I did that but the thing about Oprah is aside from me just not being ready at the time to do it you know people sensed that but most importantly for the die-hard cycling fans and sports fans I didn't say enough you didn't name names you didn't you didn't call anybody out it wasn't detailed enough you're holding back you're protecting people that's what they said that's a very small percentage of the population for the majority of the population those first five minutes was way too much information they were like what the fuck did I just hear like blood bags Ipoh testosterone transfusions cheating it was way too much so you had people that were one camp a smaller campus it he didn't say and I he's holding back here the other camp was like all right that's that's more than I needed to hear and so everybody was pissed well I don't know why they would think it's too much I mean I don't know I don't understand that logic because it is reality or a grandma and Duluth right in you and you supported the cancer survivor cause isn't real and you hear that I mean you're sitting there going oh I don't I don't like anything about this so you're the acai see because they were also supporting LIVESTRONG yeah also supportive of the story right how much of an effect did it have like almost immediately on your foundation I don't know because I was asked to leave the foundation before that and so I haven't been back so I don't know and I'm not and I don't ask is it still around yeah yeah but it must have taken the devastation I think so I mean it takes a hit in terms of obviously in terms of fundraising which directly leads to its you know its effectiveness in terms of helping create change for cancer survivors all around the world you need to raise money in order to do that staff layoffs I mean you name it I mean it's but but I don't I don't have specifics because once I left the board and left the organization and they legally change the name I don't know
