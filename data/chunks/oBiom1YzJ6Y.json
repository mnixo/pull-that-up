hello freak bitches it is what it was just like any other problem that people go back to I mean at some point it's it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to get upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past you know and that's a huge point because people define themselves by the past instead of thinking about who they are now and set up they still look back at a mistake they made and don't just get past that mistake grow and learn but dwell on it think it defines them it's the worst thing I met some guys in band uses singers I've only met him twice two different times years later both times he started tell me about this story about what happened to him when he was in this anything in this poor guy has gone on all these years and he's still focused on the worst situation that he ever had to live through yeah and he's so attached to it well some guys get one breakup and they're done some guys one breakup in their 20s will tank them for a decade I've met guys like that that yeah you know it came out here with Sally and you know she fucking fell in love with her trainer and dude Sally still move on what is that an fucking years ago oh oh you know changed my life bro but Tiger toy are you so disappointed I can't trust women anymore uh-oh you stupid fuck you know what if he got mugged by one person he'd untrusting people every exactly I'm yeah one person was a murderer let's not trust anybody yeah yeah you know I heard about Ted Bundy I'm not trusting people anymore okay great I'm not sleeping tonight we yeah I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life you're gonna run into him we all are no you can learn and grow if you survive you pick yourself up you dust the dust off and then you start going and I don't let this stuff don't let it beat you down it's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in life their ability to face hardships you know and there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and bullshit and then one day something goes wrong and I mean that's why spoiled kids are so sad like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever a young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to keep on rescuing him his dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have the character themselves to be able to get by in life they constantly need someone to help them and bail them out even as a grown man I've met guys in their 40s that still need help from their parents I'm like what the fuck man you're never going to get it right because somewhere along the line they didn't face enough of the adversity to realize that there's sometimes you just got to get up and get shit done there's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push forward even if you want to stay in bed and if you don't do that you just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy keeps rescuing you you never develop those tools you never develop that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your life because you're you're soft you got a cushiony you got a safety net a safety net for your safety net I have this friend and she has this uh this friend that she's been friends with for decades and his poor fuck his family super super super wealthy like unbelievable wealthy billions of dollars and he had that not only did he had he had a trust fund and a backup trust fund so he blew through the trust fund and then he blew through the backup trust fund real estate investments and just disastrous business ventures no character no discipline no ability to stick it out but incredible amount of resources he had millions and millions of dollars just pissed it all away didn't understand it completely depressed and one day said to her he said you know cuz she has children as well and she has sons he said to where he goes whatever you do do not give your kids money don't give them a fucking penny goes especially your boys don't give them a penny that ruined me don't give money wow it's deep shit to be a man like in your late 40s looking back at your life this disaster wreckage that you put forth with the millions you've blown now he has like a retail job his parents fucking abandon them I mean you look at that and you go whoa this is this is wild shit man the guy's just still struggling from the way he was developed from the the tools that were instilled in him at a childhood and in you know in adolescence and having that safety net just provided him with a way to stay in bed kept him weak never developed character now or have an opportunity every time things go wrong every time things feel terrible you have an opportunity to learn from whatever makes you feel terrible and never allow it to happen again exactly yeah thank you that push forward don't don't do it again yeah you know learn from your mistakes we all make them that's where meditation comes in recognizing that and solidifying it in your head and I believe meditation the tank which is more magnified form of meditation I think it's more intense and I think that you can you could really get something out of that if with those sort of ideas in your mind about constant consistent improvement and it's only the only thing that you'll allow from yourself is to maintain a certain standard then consistently try to improve and do that do that and you'll be a happier person that's an amazing concept there to become a part of to where you're involved in Europe the construction of your own character yes through your own efforts and your own evaluation and then to to make the right steps and make the right decisions that you become even stronger as you go
