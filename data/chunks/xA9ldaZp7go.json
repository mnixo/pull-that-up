the girag an experience when did you know that you like the the concept of gender identity to someone who doesn't struggle with it is it's one of those things where you try to wrap your head around it you try to understand it but you never it's like well I always say that a man and woman never really understand each other they just sort of they get this thing where they accept that this is how you are and this is aw but I never understand what it's like to want a baby in my body I never understand what it's like to have my period I've never I've never get it I'll never understand what it's like in any way no you want and being a woman and then feeling like you're in the wrong sex yeah what is that like and have a drink when did you realize it it's a imagine if you felt all of a sudden one day you started saying I feel like a girl it would freak you out yeah it would well Oh without a doubt without a doubt I really most I mean I can just tell you what most of my life I felt that way but my parents did raise me like a boy even though I was a little girl they completely raised me like a boy because I was very much of a tomboy you know little tomboy boys are okay a girl who looks like a little boy and you know you're ten and you dress like a little boy that's okay in this country nobody freaks out on that it's when you start reaching you know puberty and then you start I started growing breasts and then I started you know getting my period that's when everything shifted it was totally okay in my childhood but then people are like uh you need to start treating her like her not like he my parents were a completely freaked out because they always just it was like okay was there an issue because I was just like a tomboy and then when that happened I think that's when all like basically everything all hell broke loose you know it wasn't your folks that have the issue or the community that had the issue your name community hurt their friends kept saying you gotta stop calling her he my name it's a girl a freaky weird thing for people in art in the world basically a man is this and a woman is that but your your penis makes you a man and your vagina makes you a woman thank you just black and white for most people in the whole wide world that's just how it works oh and so basically that's not true because it's really how you feel inside your outer presence is just the shell of your soul and your being really I mean it's to me it's that simple but of course people don't get it because people always take things at face value they don't tend to get to know you or I mean I'm sitting right in front of you now would you say that I am a woman no no I say you're a woman you have a beard no you're basically a man thank you I appreciate no problem it's just that everyone gets so mad oh the government doesn't represent the people anymore it's like well that may be true but what are we doing to organize to make it so that they start listening to us again we need to do that well yeah and no I mean yeah and that something's got to change and no in that really what would be optimal is if the people that were in positions of power realized they were fucking over the world that we the best if they just said hey guys you know we ate some peyote and we realize we're a bunch of cunts yeah so we're willing to like try to figure out how to figure out a way how to reward people for the work they've already done but yet move forward in a much more ethical way of distributing wealth good luck man these are good luck that's socialism talk you fucking commie and these people are fucking human fossils look at imagine taking peyote with Boehner imagine like that's can you imagine looking across at that guy and he's like transforming into Howdy Doody in front of you he's eyes are glowing red no way man I don't know if it's possible it seems like these are earlier versions of human beings who whose entire operating system as is needed an update since the 70s there's no imagine if your if you hadn't updated your iPhone since when I phones came out that's what these people are like with information but they're way worse than iPhones these motherfuckers murder they're on a BBS Board of in the early 90s yeah with a 14-4 modem yeah and the shit cuts out every five minutes they're not they're not on top of the ball at all yeah well it's it's the whole thing's fucking wrong man I really liked I had Christopher Ryan on my podcast and he was talking about how in indigenous cultures the people who never are allowed to become leaders or the people who indicate that they want to be leaders like those are always the ones people avoid as being the leaders and the ones who end up being leaders or the ones who know the most about certain things like fishing or hunting those people are naturally followed right they don't fucking throw makeup on and try to get in front of a try to hypnotize a country by saying the exact same thing everyone always says but everything yeah my fellow Americans president talk that weird cadence why are you talking like that what the fuck is that Lee we've talked about that oh yeah times on the show you and I we air station like if you were sitting at home with a guy they started talking to you like that you would stop them you'd be like what the fuck are you doing are you trying to hypnotize me if you imagine it Joey Diaz we're sitting across from Obama Joey what we're dealing right now bipartisan efforts have been reached we have reached out the Republicans are unwilling to bargain yeah he'd like
