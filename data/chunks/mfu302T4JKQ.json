the Joe Rogan experience I told my dad I wrote my dad this letter recently was getting real deep in our number three of the podcast what Pro nuance I even sent it to my dad but he won't listen to this but I wrote this letter that was like listen man because I thought I had seen recently like his developing relationship with my son and like it shot it put this thought in my head that you know my relationship my dad the kids caring for me the fact that he stayed with my mom and they developed this like place for me to grow and nurtured me and allowed me to become a person in that environment like it was a North Star for me and then I left that environment like I always I never wondered what my path was gonna be I always could look up and be like that bond that I developed my family their love for me is like the thing that I'm always you know I'm looking back to but also looking forward to because that's what defines me and regardless of what I do I can always fall back on that that my dad loves me my mom loves me I love them and I grew up like with this strength of soul because I knew I don't have I have friends that came from the same place that I did same town I did in Maryland that OD don't heroin they live in the same little suburb suburbia community that I did they had parents that were the same age they went to the same high school they lived in the same environment they went down one way I went down another and I truly do feel that that me going down that way was the way of my parents like built this structure around me that was always about that bond that love and the things that that's very very fortunate yeah very and I and that's what in that that me being able to later on in life see how fortunate I was to have that drove me to not fail for someone like me it's so interesting to know that there's still a considerable amount of speculation yes oh yeah well it's it's there's a lot of speculation but a lot of it is pretty off the wall and a lot of people think mine are off the water say okay I'm and so okay you know did thing decent things in the past but you shouldn't trust this abuse now you see so I guess that's what people think I don't know but you see if it's just me I could understand that right but I've got these pose and I got no I mean Ian colleague who's done things on this too and it can't be they were all all off the rails I think there's something out there and now with the Hawking points there's something people can really go out and look for and if they don't see you and there's something funny going on somewhere if they do see them there's something else going funny on which which they'll have to think of another explanation unless it's my explanation they'll have to think of a a different view from the current inflation view which is in real trouble with these observations as far as I can see there is hate speech in the world on isn't you know you don't want it on your platform but you got to decide what is hate speech when is it really hate speech and when is it just ignorant and sometimes the best way to combat bad speech is to let that speech play out and let good speech overwhelm it with logic and reason and a better argument right that's that's really what freedom of speech is supposed to be all about that we work all this out as soon as you start censoring voices and telling people that you're not gonna allow them to talk boy you you start you create this atmosphere where you can start to choose what you're gonna allow through and when you're not gonna allow through and then you're gonna start censoring things that are far more subtle you're gonna start censoring things that you know they don't seem reasonable but you've decided that it's already okay to censor so you've censored this person not gonna censor the next worst thing you're gonna go down the line until it's just people to disagree with you and then you're like oh well my world is perfect now in fact it's actually just a bunch of people that are talking shit about you you you just don't happen to know about it the Dove the Duff company mm-hmm they're probably their most successful campaign of all time has been one where they argued that beauty is a social construct you're all beautiful in your own way now that again is a beautiful message right because if I am someone if I'm a woman who doesn't score well on the typical evolutionary queues then what do I want to hear I want to hear that there is no such thing as evolutionary cues it's all socially constructed if I have sagging breasts if I have poor skin and so on if I have wrinkly skin I'd like to believe that there is no such thing as an Universal Beauty standard yes and in that sense dove has been incredibly successful because by peddling false hope they've actually been able to tap into women's insecurities and incense that's good marketing did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that was widely criticized because they had a morbidly obese woman on who was a you know a bikini plus-size model yeah yeah and they were challenging beauty norms like this is a person that's eating themselves to death you fucking assholes and so your lack of discipline and your desire to shame people who exercise that's what you're doing right to make them feel bad because you feel bad you can't put the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes down as a led you to try to push this ridiculous standard I mean one of the things my point of view was could you imagine if the cover of men's health had an enormous fat guy with his gut hanging over his belt and and people were saying the new standards of attractiveness for men have been changed by Mike who just drinks beer and eats cake if you like get the fuck out of here that's never gonna fly it's not gonna fly with men but it does fly with women and by the way they the fat acceptance movement doesn't just argue that you know not being 500 pounds is unattractive because of the patriarchy they actually argue that the medical evidence suggesting that there is a link between obesity and downstream bad effects is all bullshit they don't not just that they there they also point to one incredibly flawed study that has been widely disproven that says that there's some sort of vigor or vitality involved in being overweight because they they get sick less there's no no truth to that whatsoever they only they only analyze people who were healthy at the time like it's it's theirs you can go and google the study and find out the the criticism of that study but it's 100% horseshit folks being fats not good for you it's really bad for you when you're as big as that woman on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine she's literally morbidly obese she's fucking dying she's addicted to food in a horrible way and to promote that and pretend that somehow or another this is okay and it's we're gonna we're gonna show new standards of beauty you go you giant gelatinous bag of meat and tissue no that's a dying person who's addicted to food she doesn't want to look like that most of my friends we all got busted for drinking and driving the best one was a buddy of mine they read his it was like you know practically 4:00 in the morning we noticed a maroon VW Fox blowing its horn trying to pass on the right we pulled the defendant over after repeatedly asking the defendant to stay in the car he got out of the car threw his keys at my feet and repeatedly stated locked me up I'm fucked up this is funny was my buddy was a good-looking guy and the the judge was a was a woman and when the guy read that you know locked me up I'm fucked up and he wasn't the brightest guy he just kind of human like he's like put his head down like that he was you know a little pound puppy fucking looking dude and she she gave him like a lighter sentence and cuz he was good-looking I think so yeah I mean it all plays in sy ugly people are complaining so much they won't take the time to develop a fucking personality right some jokes do what the rest of us have to do like I don't get mad at Brad Pitt you know how many fuckin cuz he's fuckin beautiful I'm a fuckin bald redheaded male I know where I am in the pecking order and some of these fucking people who are complaining right now who are mad that beautiful people get treated differently I understand racially speaking but you're not going to do the beautiful thing and then there's another thing that I said well society tries to you know they're the ones that fucking dude like you know like I love one like there's a supermodel like this is like an impossible standard of beauty to try and live up to yeah yeah yeah that's why she's on the cover of a magazine she's that level beautiful and you're gonna try and sit there and tell me that that was learned [Applause]
