ambitious and promoting themselves or often telling douchebag well they have like there's a to just two different mentalities like there's a mentality of like promotion which is like I'm amazing you're part of a team we're doing this together rocking on the street yeah actually well like Dane Cook what I like think he's a good dude but I remember when he had a super finger get the fuck out of here man hey real good going good what's like a super figure and we like to fire everybody know what that meant that like his thing it's like yeah so far it was like his t-shirt he got crazy yeah I don't have anything I don't have a finger so that's a dramatic marketing move you know I'm saying you don't have that in you know I want it's too naive to know that I need that right now well you

podcast video blog yeah we have a lot of people put videos oh that's cool one more way to reach people man use them on all angles what's the message that will underneath it all I mean you're talking oh man live you're talking to him here you're tweeting yeah we're doing this what what is it I mean obviously if you were Santorum you just want people kill abortion doctors and suck his dick that's what he wants once guys to suck his dick I wouldn't let people do that that's what he wants you want you think that's what's underneath oh yeah what stars to suck his dick he's gay pretty sure whatever guys trying to stop gay things he's usually gay yes it's probably a little bit maybes 10% but if you're allowing gay things then you're gay all true if you're promoting gay things you definitely you can't wait out of the closet when you're in the closet you you try to stop gay things we got to stop those KJ well that's why I loved what's-her-name's husband as she was running for oh yeah Christine yeah what's the name O'Donnell Christine O'Donnell no no that's the senator of Delaware Michele Bachmann she'll Bob her husband was doing like I learned how to not be gay then you see him dancing and Jim ba is like that's the greatest season I wanted her to become president because what a story that was an awesome she kind of stopped right she got trounced I mean she's getting no numbers and so she went back to Texas and she endorsed Mitt Romney but getting back to gay what's the gayest thing like he had to think in your life there was what was the moment you were the gayest I guess you you - yeah yeah you're essentially in your Europe your fuckin underwear what cop on do you ever get any anybody else ever get any that would be a bomb that would make it a real fight that would we don't instantly transition yeah like your story that you told in the podcast about going on with the rape seemed to grow and yet a bone of the whole time yeah sorry sorry you know I think I did that with jujitsu that would be a real problem yeah don't that should be a sport is two guys wrestling and one only has to get an erection to start the fight and then that guy could attack first yeah and you could only defend until you got your dick off oh that might be the gayest thing I've ever had about the gayest thing ever that might be the gayest thing I ever thought up gay an aggressive dominant what's the closest you ever came to what would be considered date rape like with a girl like that I didn't that's gotta gay yeah I guess when you're young and the girl says no and you keep you keep grabbing her hand and put it on your doing yeah oh yeah yeah I mean that's essentially she say no and you're still trying to put our hand on your dick yeah but you never know when they go okay I know and then it's juice let's talk a lot about rape I noticed like while we're around use was for heat fit we're running you to pores where we're on you are rape instance chicken yeah there's something about you that life I'm not gay this but like all I want to do is fucking rail in the ass oh I don't know maybe it's a Boston thing you grab that dildo with yeah this I'm not correct that would be the gayest thing you've ever done I thought you bought that for your girl you didn't buy fur on your blood for a joke it's for someone not cool dildo how come they're always black cuz that's what everybody wants they want right the one they want Rebbe Reggie Bush dick she knows it's all the way up to the bladder 2-wheel ports I know female at once you can buy a fleshlight that that's definite like a woman's like a porn stars vagina the model do they have that from your porch yeah yeah they do yeah yeah they have that I bet they have a four dudes buttholes you think they do yeah I bet they do gay dudes how'd you like to be the guy who's gonna measure and sculpt it I would like to be there now that would be the gayest why can't everything gain so much let's go back to rate well I wanna I feel like instant at some points in the interview I I started interviewing you and I apologize it was like is a conversation it wasn't even in okay he'll there's some things I just want to ask you okay open-ended existential things because I think that you have unique perspectives on things and so I was curious about some of them like gun control we were talking about earlier yeah and I was always for gun control and a couple weeks ago I completely flipped sides and now I don't think that everyone should have a gun but I just can't I'm a fax guy and I looked at all the numbers and it's very hard to legitimately say that we need to have gun control well there should be some control what some criminals shouldn't be allowed to have guns and I agree it should be screenings you know there should be that that that I agree with all that stuff but what I don't agree with is the idea that we live in some sort of a utopian society where violence has been cured and you don't need to protect yourself that's crazy if cops have guns people should have guns there's a reason why the combines that we've got the cop has to have a gun to protect society well one of the cops out there yeah well you better have a fucking gun you should have a gun yeah I know you shouldn't use it if you don't have to use it but they say brandishing it prevents like 90 something percent of crimes from happening and then eventually you don't even have to brandish it because people have to wonder if you have one yeah I guess look I'm not suddenly like I'm not encouraging it it's just it was fucking mind opening to have held a belief for so many years and then realize that it was the foundation of it was off it's a core tenant of left-wing thinking that you're supposed to get the guns is making this restricted as possible people don't need guns guns cause problems it's like that's you know there's certain thinking like the abortion should be legal women has a right to choose and you know when you bring in we should be able to shoot the navy fetus you bring it up to them like what's really going on when you're saying the right to choose to choose to suck that baby out with a vacuum you kill it no no well yes sort of yeah at what point times of the baby yeah at three months at four months they start looking like things yeah you know and it's illegal then or it's not legal then it's legal when it's a ball of mush yeah it comes looking like a baby then it's not late but no one wants to even have that discussion the aankhen cats at a joke he goes I believe that human life begins after the second cup of coffee but the best is the Republicans ago all right here's the caveat no abortion except in the case of rape and incest okay so what you're saying is that's a human life and it's being murdered but it's okay to murder it if somebody rapes somebody yeah well succeed a lifer it's not Rick Santorum says that you should celebrate the rape baby because it's a gift from God how do you celebrate like you have on TV even have a board like every birthday happy birthday to you gift from God it's a rape baby like a beautiful baby I mean the other guy's a rapist every time you see him you have to think about what my baby looks just like this means yeah yeah only down but he said you should what do you believe should abortion be legal I don't believe I have the right to tell you what to do with a bunch of cells in your body and that we have to decide at what point in time is that become a life and it was it is an early detection issue because it was an early detection issue I mean how much different is it to have a birth control pill that it tricks chemically the body into the sperm comes in and tries to do its job but there's nothing there because the body thinks it it's already pregnant how much different is that than killing two cells because it's a birth control pill actually allow a sperm to attach and then it goes away no birth control pill is essentially hormones that trick the woman's body into thinking that it's already pregnant so no sperm ever attaches to it to and over no maybe it's not 100% effective now with the way it works is that women can't get pregnant while they're already pregnant so it's sending the hormones that let them to body another story partners we can't get pregnant yeah yeah that's why it really fucks with our whole system you know you should just be a way I mean the diaphragm is a bad example of it but our diaphragm kind of thing where it just goes in when you're in the peer of your life where you're not going to have babies and it comes off when you're ready and if you can't and it should be cheap and it should be paid for by the government section well because they used to make them out of metal IUDs room metal and now they make them out of some kind of synthetic metal and your pussy just to stop loads I know yeah look you're a spring but isn't that I mean isn't that a as close to a perfect solution as we can get it's just on/off it's an off switch I guess yeah but then like what if society falls apart and you live in the woods and you really want to have babies now we can Society might die off but you got this IUD stuffed up your pussy there's no doctors available couple sticks pull it out with some tweezers how'd it get in there I don't even look around well you get a little boy Donna pull it out nice nice arrows this is what we're gonna I'm going to tie a rope to it and the end of its gonna put on a horse shoe together hey he's gonna run and pull the ideas ha ha ha and on that note you know Kenny means ORS around or you can go to racetrack hey fella this hat is that on y'all I would then Suzanne we're in this I thought I was a gym part - you don't even know what the fuck is up should have happened BAM no we're um we just got done doing the podcast and it was really fucking fun is that a bad example is reality son yeah doesn't got a numb yourself something true and real poor Ben yes so we just got done doing the podcast the first time anybody's ever performed songs on the podcast and that right Brian us it's pretty badass pretty fucking cool that's a good time I a really good time you had a great time I'm like we hit a stride - yeah I was really about 45 minutes in I think right away yeah funny though well I got a lot of positive Twitter responses okay super excited but there's a couple people that call those pussies but that's an integer that's killer it's good it's good to have the balance most of them register that's really strong pussies themselves perhaps yeah a little bit terrified of being one that you know trying to know I should go pro they don't like female voices did you Charlie yeah what in what way being a pussy but then now I've accepted it and I enjoy you do you enjoy being a pussy or accepted accepted what do the people that call you a pussy are assholes oh but that's true you know that but the problem is sometimes you know you can resent non pussies and that's really not fair use sort of reverse discrimination kind of acceptable acceptable reverse discrimination looking stick shit jujitsu dude you can be a badass we need you yeah I was the yellow bell pepper master yes when you're a little kid yeah yeah yeah I spread delighted Oh in karate okay if you took my shirt there I go oh my god I do it probably take your hand Wow something like that right like a panther predator like wow um but you started doing it recently right you started taking jiu-jitsu I did a little while ago I got the shrimp out I got a couple of them's it again work Oh No else if you know other than the shrimp out oh you have to test me to combat situation like that brother I I can do a full-nelson them I hope but I've apparently heard that was illegal in wrestling I don't I know the one thing I think it's illegal and answer that it's a rear naked choke but if you get it you know like that actually cost more leverage it's like bloody chop yeah as you as you get it underneath you go sink you do the honors this one right here I don't know point here but this one and then this one grab larynx there grab your bicep like this and you karate chop the back of his head up like this but that's where the pressure comes in that's K so I feel like I'm my chin time really really go yeah he's got a chin too ya know we're you want to get under that but if you got a really good squeeze you can take him from there we tell you something well okay maybe okay doesn't always work a lot of these techniques they take
