the girag an experience that's what a real friend does right were you going on so I gotta actually reassesses you know I love Michael schirmer's quote if you've read am doing myself a great dish justice injustice by bringing up Michael Shermer right now because I'll be a rape apologist because I don't know if you know about this he was accused of doing something in / problem proper meaning getting a girl drunk and having sex with her crazy the people are calling that a lot of people calling that rape you never done that I don't know if that happened I don't know what happened getting her drunk my point is I just needed a dresser just to put it out there but the the quote that is that he has is that a lot of people that are very smart believe dumb things because they can explain them and they can argue them very well and so they think they're doing well and winning in the argument so that maybe their point makes sense but it really becomes like a sort of circular ego argument and sound sounds good they've got a good sounding argument to be you know you talked to like Michael Murphy and he he's very eloquent yes he used to be a bit less eloquent now it's purty he is very convincing he's very personable person and you know you can easily get sucked into things like that and then he started beating the same arguments yourself yes and you're convincing yourself because if you're an eloquent person you're eloquent to yourself well it's also in being a smart person and most of us are at least somewhat competitive that we want to be right and it's what you were talking about earlier about certain skeptics being aggressive and they use skepticism as a game wit cha tallying up a social score yeah becomes a debate in the old-fashioned sense of a debate where it's like one person has to argue this the other person argue is the opposite thing and then they fight it out and the best debater wins it becomes about debating rather than about finding what is true and what is not true yeah that's that is a real problem with being able to to put it all aside and actually like look at what the fuck is really going on very hard focus the end up saying things that are wrong because the too hasty to come up with an explanation for things so the lender plagues you know just saying you know this that's not that's not that's smoke from the planes just because like the first thing that comes into the head because they're dead debunkers and they think that if they can think of something they've got that thing work you know they think they are intelligent and they are somewhat intelligent but people fool themselves as to how intelligent they actually are so even in debunkers from your car oh yeah where does their own to sheet it's very it's very annoying from my perspective as well because I get people coming on to my site and then they try to debunk things but there they say things that are wrong about a scientifically wrong and then you have to end up like correcting the debunkers as well well that ever ends a lot of cont√© debunkers we agree there are a lot of kunti dealer who's quite a few you know sure it's easily to be it's easy to be when you're also frustrated with your own vision of the world and then when someone comes along saying they have fucking document to prove to loch ness monster is real and you're like the fuck you do shit head right you don't it's hard it's hard to say what is it was sir what is this proof where we have you got this proof stored may I measure it yeah that sounds like the evidence you were asking for in the UFO thing last night yeah there's ago it's yeah they don't have evidence they have doesn't i witnessed tetanus testimony they have like crappy photos there's no empirical evidence there's no no that's sort of like let's let's see some measurable evidence positive pregnancy tests in high demand on craigslist i'll read it again how crazy is that shit positive pregnancy yes so like just to make somebody marry you maybe exactly they advertise tests for women hoping to trick their boyfriends into popping the question whoa that's crazy there are only 25 bucks 225 bucks positive pregnancy test 25 bucks in Buffalo New York yes you saw that right I'm willing to selling positive pregnancy test ever since I became pregnant I have been asked numerous times for a positive test so I decided to start charging for it !
