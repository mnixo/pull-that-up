haha hello freak bitches it just doesn't seem like a huge product gets everybody gets their phone ruined by pouring a drink on it like that's the number one reason phones get ruined i would say i would say cracked screens toilet I'll take cracked screens are probably higher than water but they're both high speed of cat cracked screens cracked screen is almost universal right doesn't everybody get a crack screen I've never had one eye but I've had to move a turd to get my phone out out of the toilet did you kill the phone or the phone survive have fun survive how long was it in Russia to webmail litter it literally like I got up and then it fell in the toilet now we look at put my hand through or instant grabbed it pulled it out and then and then uh just write it off if you put on the bag of rice no he didn't even wash his hands as fuck no I did the shaky thing and that was good enough though hairdryer oh really what you should do if that happens is 24 hours in a bag of rice yeah it'll it'll pull away with moisture what I usually end up just doing is then having something stop working and then take it to the apple or call the apple store and they will send you one with that he apples great with that here's the weird thing though they put or at least they used to I don't know anymore I used to do like some repairs on these things crack them open and get crazy like that but they used to put little litmus paper in there that would show or got wet it will turn red he used to be in the headphone jack I don't know they probably are still do it I still do it like that but if you call they don't there's no way from this check well here's a question when when you say if you drop something in the toilet you drop a phone the topic should you shut it off and throw it in the bag of rice or should you leave behind it turns itself off but yeah if you if it's still on turner turner okay luckily it shut off yeah so shut it off yep throw it in a bag of rice yeah what i usually do just suck the water out of it oh but but but but i wasn't going to do with the poop ones right yeah why not it's gross because when you suck it off if you look at your iphone like there's the top part where the this this where your ear usually goes but there's water that's in there so you suck that and you're like pretty much sucking earwax it's gross I never I never thought of talking on my phone ever bump into that well like I go like really hard many times have you done product five times so where's your fault with where you're going that you're getting ear wax on that if you look if you look there's like a little grill that's right there if you look really close you could actually see their shit in there I was thinking about the jack itself now you have to suck all of them there's the bottom one that you suck it's like the power but does that work can you really suck the water out will it really helped it's what I always don't you mean they don't getting water away from it is gonna be a positive thing but but it's a guy on the phone is I customary see yes dude listen I've been sucking on my phones that cool I'm just shitting in the most polite way possible I wouldn't recommend it now well and that's a problem because we've we've capitalized and privatize the education system to hear such a degree I mean if you get a degree in Australia where it's Macquarie University or sydney university or university of new south wales it's an MBA one of those schools is exactly same as an MBA than one of those schools here you know you at not only does an MBA matter that also and then it has to be from the right school so an MBA from Harvard or an Ivy League school is Trump's and MBA from university of san diego or something like that and that shouldn't be the way and in fact what that does it still keeps propelling that plutocracy because there's a study done that at least for every student at harvard each student in have it has at least one parent earning at least four hundred thousand dollars per year so we're still you know with the capitalization of everything we're we're forming a system where we have you know the very wealthy at the top and we have everybody struggling at the bottom that the elitism involved in education is really fascinating to me today especially because there's so much access to information so many books so much online so much to read and just you could get so much access to information that would you know a long time ago the difference between going to Harvard and going to San Diego State was pretty gigantic but what with what you have access to today the average person has access to the exact same from information that they're teaching at any school anywhere yeah but I had a conversation with a friend of mine and he was wrong about something and I brought up this woman who had you know she went to the University of Mississippi but she went there and this was her major like this thing that she would that we were talking about and he goes well this guy went to Yale you know but he didn't even go to Yale for that he went to Yale for something else and he's 80 okay so he went to Yale in like the 1960s who knows what the fuck they were teaching back then like what are you talking about man you know like but the ideas first initial reaction was look she went to the University of Mississippi he went to Yale oh that's hilarious but that is the way we think in this country it is and also not only is the way we think but you know these kids that are going to MIT or Harvard or Yale well it's the networks they take with them so when it the jobs are avail you know the only growth area that we have in this country is a technology jobs but that's such an inch Allah job market where only the network's the alumni from these prestigious schools get to really apply from it all the kids working at Google they all in today's you know fancy schools it could be afforded by the wealthy parents Colin quit a long time ago remind many many years where first I gonna open out that I was dating a british girl and she was a real pervert like I drove a Saturn back then I still lived in Jersey and I used to fucking park outside a danger-filled and she would blow me I would trap she liked me to trap her head under my steering wheel and she'd go like I want you to bite me I want you to bite me like she would repeat this oh this a mantra of me biting her on her back but she like to be bitten and brutalized so I would bite her back and she would like how much to make me suck it and I would hold her head under the wheel and she'll be trapped under my saturn steering wheel and fucking she would suck my dick and lick my balls whatever good kid she was a good girl yeah her name is Ruth she was a really cool girl Ruth yeah good five and talk to her in 15 years but she was a great girl I miss her terribly I think she went back across the pond hello as they say and I've always the point of the story Oh Colin she was really loud when I ate her pussy I'm really super loud and it was fluid she said I don't remember just moaning and groaning yeah Jimmy what what are those things yeah why tips yeah yeah yeah he said whatever it was I be a hooligan with my shine oh yeah yeah me bake my pussy like its Manchester United universe but I can't it was a really loud and your pussy was sloppy fucking wet like it was legit hahahahaha like I knew she wasn't putting on a show cause her pussy was sloppy I was getting eat her pussy on the air OPI dear this before I was ill I get every day and opiate said calling your pussy on the air and I was gonna do that and Colin Quinn stop me and you know and he goes you can do that you could put man your comic you gotta say funny shit you don't want to be that guy that does wacky things and I'm like I never forgot that he was almost telling me don't be a stunt boy you gotta say it funny you got to sit there and be funny verbally and I may be in that case he was right because I wasn't the gunner wacko who called up at eight pussy on the air it's like I have to be able to be funny in my delivery and say another yeah it was kind of a good point looking back in hindsight I probably should have eaten her pussy on the air should be a very funny clip
