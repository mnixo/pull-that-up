oh we're live haha oh you guys betting on look look around real quick do you know what's new hmm easy it's easier than you think Bruce Lee Bruce Lee yeah but still but still though he didn't say he goes I wonder if he'll say Rosie gets out I said no I should have bet you money I was gonna say it look this way no I saw it immediately Bruce Lee's dope it is dope yeah guys a bad class to sell there's some there's a great there's a great hip-hop album I listened to in high school and they used one of his quotes one of my favorites that he says honestly expressing oneself is really hard to do I can use I can use really fancy movements and show you really crazy things but - honestly express myself that is really hard to do it's a it's like a beautiful little sound clip before they start the song but it's like just him talking to someone isn't it humbling when someone dies really young like he does and they did way more in their life than you ever will makes me sad like what am I gonna do you'd stop and think about it like who the else has had that kind of an impact and you know he died in what 1970 something in the 70s yeah yeah and he was young yeah I think he was like 30 or 31 or 32 or something like that find out how old Bruce Lee was what he died it's not like I was listening to Hendrix last died on the way the studio or a lot we the Comedy Store yeah one of my 33 and he died when he was 27 um how much Hendrix music is there out there and he died when he was 27 yeah but then you think do you think he'd be happy with what's going on - like I always find that like what would they be doing today that trips me up yeah well you can't do that no I know but that oh that's like oh they had such like a because right there's guys that lasted a long time and they either like are making garbage or they're slowly still making cool here and there whenever they want to yeah there's the the variety set and then there's people that just nobody wants to hear their new right yeah like the Rolling Stones yeah you're like nobody once you hear like new Rolling Stones new ones called car tire don't play that don't play that in that weird though because like there all time greats yeah but if they start playing some song you haven't heard you like that's kind of like a yes yesterday I was when I was running they have this thing called the big three it's a it's a post NBA League for players to play and once a once they retire it was just three on three but it's really sad to watch guys have been retired for like ten years whooping cuz you're like this is just bad it's like it's like you want to just remember them when they were amazing but now they're just old too old to be it's like it's like circusy you know I mean like people are showing up just to like see those names but they're it's really bad to watch how old I mean there is no minimum I just think it's you have to be retired from the league to play in it but like I mean the average age has got to be 40 maybe see it depends on the sport and the athlete the basketball skins was fighting his 40s at his best different though yeah basketball is just it's such a young man's game because he was boxing I know but there's something about it that's like hard to watch and I'll do with gray hair missing free throws that's a weird a guy who used to be phenomenal I understand what you're saying but I disagree and yeah it's even sadder watching an old guy get the beat out yeah used to be good yeah that's that that's an what's but fight it but but there he still probably fights cuz he loves it no no just for the MA nights for money yeah I mean they fight because they love the competition but they get paid they're doing it from well that's what these guys are doing the big three there's no way they enjoy it anymore how do you know there's no way it just looks so sad it's just so sad do you think that I think with basketball to its wear and tear on the knees so devastating left right left right when you watch there's a guy named Glen Davis big baby Davis and he was he always had like big but like problems and League being so heavy on his on his knees in his back and it's even worse there he fell once during it and rolled around for like five minutes I was like this is so sad to watch like the soap and their cameras are just focusing on him and Rapoport is doing the announcing Michael Robert yeah man he's like doing it's so weird man it's so weird he's like a 80 year old 20 year old yes he's just his career is on this crazy revival train and it's almost like he is going back to young Rappaport's die it's a funny dude he's hilarious interviewing I guess it was I forget what what sport it was but he's interviewing these guys and he's like kinda hunched over like talking to him he's a big guy yeah and he's like got this look on his face he's interviewing I'm like this is such a weird combination of like an old guy at a young guy yeah yeah he but he's but he's connected with the youth so heavily oh yeah like he did that but things he did that documentary for Tribe Called Quest like he still want he still is in like that that youthful world of like music and sports and Jersey the rant that he went on after Charlottesville what does tiki torch carry and Waikiki torch yeah please loose you know I mean he's out there he's very funny on the fighter in the kid to he goes on he's he's hysterical and he you know he goes and he fights with the whole Howard Stern staff he loves fighting with those guys because they all do like fantasy football and all that stuff he's he's vocally a massive sports fan which I think him that keeps him in that youth circle so much that he just loves sports and loves talking sports to everybody yeah he hosts sports shows sometimes like he's hosted different people yes one of those radio TV shows those radio shows they constantly they show on TV occasionally yeah you know that one of those who does those they're like Dan Patrick yeah Dan Patrick has one yeah yeah yeah I support theirs it's like guys that left ESPN I don't know jack  about sports man yeah you do I don't know about the sports that you know about but that's all I know about like the problem is people try to talk to me about other sports if I can't believe that game like but that's everybody like some like Ian Edwards loves soccer I can't tell you I couldn't tell you a position other than goalie yeah do you name one forward see but I think that then I think about hockey cuz I'm like I know hockey but I have no idea about who's in hockey the same as soccer just was like I don't know do you know like midfielder yeah the center of man defense forward and defense yeah are they all defense sorta when you're on defense yeah sake I can't I'm sorry I couldn't I was in Italy when the World Cup was going on and it was amazing to watch Europeans watch that cuz they loved it rather go crazy check that I've totally checked out I was talking about this before would ruin it for me as I was in Boulder when the World Cup was happening and those dorky white guys pretending to be way too enthusiastic about the world can I do because the World Cup yeah you know you're not into it yeah you know that fake thing that people do they're like it's not real the Olympics does that too the Olympics has this thing when people get into like it's cool to cheer for your country or whatever but it's so funny when people get in the Olympics and they're like do you watch us and luge did you watch us rip it up and luge no I don't why what do you talking about that's not where we rip it up we were up and loose yesterday I didn't know I don't know I do like the Winter Olympics everyone get freaks out and they have sports that you would never even think about wanting to watch like the cross-country ski and then you shoot on the ground and those skis some more you would never I would never they're getting through basketball is gonna be in the Summer Olympics is it really this big three' thing yeah yeah these are big three that's it that's the that's the the big three is the three-on-three tournament we were talking about with the X NBA players but wait a minute I put them in an Olympics I don't know what kind of competition it's gonna be but the big three success has led to it being included in the next Summer Olympics how many people are in a normal basketball game ten five on five five on five these three on three and it's half court and they have a four point shot which doesn't exist yeah so you could shoot it have a weird world to that once it gets down to four minutes that like there's no I'm sorry this was the the basketball tournament has a weird rule about my side yeah used the two things there's another tournament going on which is like amateur players and teams and it's a 1 million dollar tournament it's actually 2 million 2 million bucks yeah so it's a tournament going on all across the country we could have entered it if we wanted to we sure would have lost but yeah wouldn't it be fun just don't talk negative to me bro cut up bro you don't know my heart you don't know we would have been training goes out of my head bro this former member you guys and former college players whatever bro don't put limitations on us we would had an average height of 510 we'd be killing six nine black dudes these three white heads just hey guys we're here to play [Laughter] hey guys just tying my shoes so um what are the rules there's a four point Joe Joe Joe just hugs the ball just head-butting people out of the way why can't we do that why would can why can't we play like that guys you got to go well we tried I don't have any sports skills I don't know if you fell outs maybe you could yeah Joe we've just used you as the bowl and fall out you just help what happens if you foul out you kick you out you're done you can't play anymore Sutton's then the game's over no but they have two other players on their bench that they rotate Jesus but we would have you foul as hard as you can to really up their best players oh you know I mean that strategy and then Jamie and I would have to bang it out way to Dickie do they have that they have that hockey no they do in the NBA same thing oh yeah and guys get pissed because it ruins the career cost millions of dollars I mean hack-a-shaq was the original like they used to foul Shaq so because they knew what were they gonna do to stop him he's a truck so he would just get the ball they would tomahawk him as hard as they could oh yeah man it was and he used to complain about it was funny cuz cuz cut you know couch sports fans are always like oh shut the up you're huge you have no idea how he is big but another huge dude that's just throwing their arm as hard as they can all game dude Iggy I mean it gets totally up from that Wow yeah Hank yeah it was like the B was like to begin it happened before that old NBA people that's they did in a 70 but Shaq was just the biggest guy that's ever played with so much agility whenever I shake his hand I'm like what is that it's absurd and yeah it's like a desk how you doing Joe big fan he did fear factor with me and him him and I were look he was a huge fear factor fan yeah so he did like a whole episode where he co-hosted it with me and he stood next to me and he like he would do that I'm will do the countdown one shock attack Chaka Fattah and when he would do the countdown almost standing next to him like this is like an eight year old hanging out with his dad oh all I hear stories like that that he's like he's a big kid on set they get like he can't stop around I felt an eight-year-old grown up yeah big J's mammoth he's a big kid that's all I ever hear anyone that works in like he he loves around yeah he loves not taking it serious super fun guy very friendly he's so dynamic he's like a cop yeah what he wants to do like undercover work for in Miami or something right now what floating Florida or some he he would be involved in raids and and pretty hard to be undercover when you're 611 that's a black dude he's he's got to be one of the biggest guys that's ever played right not the tallest but probably one of the most probably the most mass yeah yeah and muscle I mean you know when you get up next to his arm it's it's I mean it's this it's like two of my thighs he got into MMA for a while did he be on enough training doing it yeah training but there was videos of him training I was like look if there was no weight limitations like he's so good does look like it's like a man in his buddy yeah a child child than a grown man yeah I have a picture I have a picture of me at the MTV what was it that movie awards or something like that with him next to me where I was you know interviewing him for this thing and he will always beat the roasts one of the wrote a Bieber and he I mean and I'm doing this with the microphone like full extension with it and he's bending down still you still has to Doug I'm like it chat it's kind of weird that like the UFC has a weight limit what's the top out 265 yeah isn't that weird yeah why is that I don't know does it get there's a hit this is a super heavy super heavy we've never had a super heavy fight but super heavyweight is 265 and above well who's the heaviest fighter that's ever fought 265 when they weigh in yeah after that probably Brock Brock was cut and wait to make 265 wasn't he around 300 pounds yeah and it's a different kind of 300 pounds to 337 his shoes are 20 to 22 they're almost to his foot is 2 feet that's his foot that's a yes but it's 2 feet Jesus but like a guy like that could never fight in the UFC because he probably can't make 265 from now if he did he would be sure I know zero zero fat I want but I wonder about how cuz he's so big he'd have to lose 75 pounds right did they say 330 I would he weighed yeah 330 they look like as a rookie oh my god he was he's so big and he's a kid right there by the way he's proof 20 or 19 or 20 years old right there damn that's crits a full-grown man at 20 mm I mean what did you ever see the movie blue chips do you ever see that no that's a great movie what is it's a it's like about about Shaq Nick Nolte he's recruiting him Shaq yeah it's a phenomenal but you would he would love ulti what how good is that guy oh it's awesome oh he's so good in this movie you know what he's amazing in hmm it wasn't even a good movie but that movie warrior oh yeah yeah he's no could so the movie wasn't that good it was flawed yeah but he's good you know Bryan Callen was in that movie he played me hmm literally did my role in the UFC in that movie oh yeah he's the announcer me he was telling me cuz I'm just gonna do you want to pretend I'm you except for like the skill and the talent and all that silencer burn listen I'm coming after you all don't do it you son of a bitch you fight me Bryan there he is right there but Nick Nolte's in that movie Nick Nolte plays the dad of one of the guys that's fighting and daria's okay dad I've ran into him once man at fries I was so happy that he knew my name cuz he used to date vicki lewis who was a friend of mine she was on Newsradio very talented girl she's that girl's is extremely talented she's young huh Vicki not anymore compared to him though compared that was a big age gap yeah as a big age gap but so I knew him from the set you know he'd come to the set and hang out yeah and uh I'm I'm in fries and he's got his reading glasses on and I said hey Nick what's up oh hey Joe oh yeah I'm trying to get out computer for my kid anything about these things that's really good hey Joe it was weird it's like I'm talking to Nick Nolte should I get a Mac I was only 27 no still confused I'm still I can't believe I'm really talking Nick no hand it up right now it's nothing real this is real good fries hey man Nick needs electronics to come down was during my my quake days when I was addicted to quake and I would make my own computers you love you did all that  oh dude did you have like 15 screens and all that like everyone does that yeah I had a broom in my house where I had a like a conference table and it was lined up with computer monitors and computers I used to build computers man but do you play you don't play any games anymore well we're going to we just got when we set up is origin PCs mm-hmm we got Al and room set up local area network room no oh some plate these play people all over the world fired up yeah well you know what man now that we have the studio there's so much room here yeah my kids come here and play too you know there's plenty of stuff to do yeah this is lot lotsa so I'm just going to it put some games on for them put some games on for me yeah that works I never I never got into it for some reason video games I like I loved him when I was a kid and then there was just weird cutoff and I was growing up now but but so many people still play yeah the non grownups those those non growing up guys but I wish I could play like a big sweet kid a fully grown man chicks love Ultimate Warrior did they love guys who play video games too sit inside all day yeah dude like I want to go somewhere nah just button out just I won't get pale more pale I want a paler I want to be paler Jamie the paler you know what scares the out of you know those multi-role player what is it multi those giant role players work call them yeah what if it what's the name massively multi on massive multi online role-playing yeah the door is that what fortnight is no I sound like a  dad don't laugh at me a shooter it's a third person you third and that's their parent but isn't there but aren't you with a massive community of people yet people yeah yeah that's those 100 people in the game with you that's a lot dude yeah well that's a deathmatch a quake deathmatch a lot of times you'd motton really a hundred but it can be a hundred 100 seems I guess absurd how many people are on your squat or on your team up to 400 point of 50 on 50 match which is like a special is it random assignments of teams or you go in picking your teammates you go in thrown team or you can you actually can't go and random to its you can do everything you want god I can't wait to hear the comments on this video about because you know about fortnight dude I'm so mad this is I have no I see so many references online to it and I know what it is but I have no idea what it is I remember when people you call you a noob to Feroze yet noob noob does it like today they even right now there's two million dollar tournaments going on there's one there I think they're both for charity today but one for fortnight and then another one another game that's just like it called pub G which we've talked about 2 million bucks yeah how long do they have to play it might be I could two or three hour tournament that's unreal so much money in video games now parents used to tell their kids to not play video games like you don't be a loser right and they still have that in their head but it's there's more money in it than like most games you make a fully people make careers out of yeah what if they're a tennis player oh Bobby's a pro tennis player oh well Bobby might blow his  ankles out Timmy over there is making a billion dollars playing fortnight and like yeah this all day I know a guy that didn't I got a friend of my old route my first remain in LA he was like a professional online gamer and I thought I was like what that dude fatality reached out to us yeah Jonathan Wendell fatality I'm gonna try to get him on I figured he's no plan yeah he was the greatest quake player or one of the it's hard to say it's hard to say the greatest there's a few of those guys yeah he was one of them how old is he now probably late thirties something like that yeah that sounds right what is he doing I was no one that I want to know what they do when they quit all that just just breathe just chill and try to figure out how to deal with all the radiation they've been absorbing he's working at fries in front of that computer screen hi Joe all your cells are mutated I think I think some of them are smarter enough now that they realized the how quick the rises and how quick the fall might be that they're just sort of banking money and just riding it out to see how long it goes yeah but it's kind of like okay kind of like how in golf you only get paid paid if you win yeah not a lot of those guys can Bank all that money right they still gotta have something to do after it's done the best of the best bank but I'm majority guys are just making a way yeah I just and this the way it's different though they don't have to pay a coach they don't they're just at home in their part in some cases their parents house still most cases where you might just buy their parents a new house that might be their goal they buy their parents house and kick them the out oh yeah by their parents house yeah Mike video games and take Karen with you Packers  up dude Ryan's kicking us out yeah get the out uh you should have been so mean to him ya know the mom's bitching at him I didn't know he could have bought us this well toughening them up is why he became such a good player twice a man when they're assholes oh yeah this might take credit for I did that hey i toughened you up and that's why you like this yep like you see I Tanya know I didn't and I can't dude that but that's what that is is it her mom was you saw that her mom was atrocious terrible core and then when every time she got something she's like you know why that is cuz I made you that way so she she mind her whole life into being like even at her even when he even after the after the incident you know even after the Kerrigan thing she was like I was always the one that made you the killer that's why we do this oh she her sober I mean she  with her head so deep someone she was boxing oh yeah man Tonya Harding was box they talk about it on bond Stanhope she box yeah yeah I was I was his coach yeah she was actually alright she looked alright she's an athlete man yeah like legit and she and she bulked up to I remember and she was doing it cuz she was trying to cash cheque because she lost all her money man she lost all her she made much what do you think she does now they talked about at the end of the film and I don't remember they tell you what you know when they're like in the chyron with her like she lives and so and so with her new husband and no Dada she'll never talk to Jeff Gillooly again and who's Jeff Gillooly the guy her boyfriend the one that was like the had Nancy Kerrigan's legs yeah he is the kingpin Jesus Christ that's a dark thing to do man to have some Dumbo and the way they describe in the movie it's even funnier that the guy he's the guys he hires are brain-dead her brain dude imagine thinking there's nothing wrong with that plan yeah this plans gonna go off they they claim in the movie and in their story I think to the courts were was always they were supposed to threaten her and these two Dumbo's went up there and they were like yeah we'll threaten her and they were like no no threaten her you're like we'll find her hey it shows up with the police baton you believe that no dude no chance no chance you know what I believe I believe if I'm gonna believe that guy's side I bet he said go up there and and scare and do what you need to do right I bet he left it vague and was like these idiots he'll figure it out I bet they were on meth and they were all good yeah break a just geeking out going dude you know what skaters need knees will  up her knees and they're just like yeah speaking of meth did you see the video that guy who drove into the parking lot of comedy store and smashed into a car and almost hit one of the guys that were there when was this real recently commit dude tweaked out of his mind came driving through the back of the parking lot in the store during the day slammed into a car slammed into one of the employees lahars it was parked back there they got security camera footage of it guys are jumping out of the way this guy's just like completely out of his mind it turns out the guy years ago killed a kid driving yeah slammed his car into some kid and killed him like a young girl and then many years later is still driving holy yeah tried to back out tried to get out of there that grabbed him yeah what is this this the guy yeah arrested after vehicle collision at the Comedy Store yeah that guy killed a kid driving and he's still doing it and she healed all he was peeling off a sunset and smashed into the Comedy Store he was out of his mind man is out of his mind came in sideways went around the corner and like went through the the driveway went around the corner to a lot and came in like literally turned sideways and slammed into a car what the drugs do the wrong kind of drugs hmm who knows what kind of pills us assholes on but that same guy killed a kid you're still driving like that imagine imagine you kill a kid driving  up you get out of jail and then you're still doing it yeah what the he's not even that old you look good yeah you look like a young here's the thing man somebody made that kid somebody made that kid somebody somebody  somebody and the man the woman got together they got pregnant the girl got pregnant they gave birth raise that kid and this is what you got yeah what a bad deal but you can't tell me that that's not part of their fault - there's got to be some that they do to that kid yeah oh for sure there's got to be something I mean that's a--that's a collective effort you get someone that's that stupid right that's that you know you kill a kid and you don't learn like that's not enough of a lesson you're still driving up how did Caitlyn Jenner get away with killing that dude what was it turned into a woman that was the best just slice off your dick that's it they can't get ya it's you know in this day and age it's like she entered into this category of the most marginalized group in America apparently which is transgender people yeah and and by doing that by becoming a transgender person that became the entire focus of the nation she got exonerated for all for these things though it's so strange I wasn't paying attention and she slammed into the back at all we could say he because it was still yeah it was him Bruce Jenner he slammed into the back of this person's car it was a dude right it was a single moms' it was a woman woman nobody slammed into an old lady and pushed her in her traffic then they hit a car with a family of five members a day two kids and a grandma on the plane they live but the grandma sued because she like broke her hip and pelvis or something like that seven-year-old woman yeah it's a up story and it was almost like it just and disappear crazy thing is Caitlin doesn't even address it like it's like some horrific moment in their life not completely responsible and but it shows you the type of person do you ever see Kyle Dunnigan staying on it Perry girl it's the funniest it's but if you ever see the one he did on that CB you find it oh no where he's driving Bruce up and killed that lady but now Kaitlynn got a clean record yeah dude Dunnigan that is such a hysterical character character that he does on his Instagram every day I watch he's such an odd guy I love it he's very very funny that's where that comes from man there's there's beauty in that the oddity oh I love that well he found his groove oh yeah move is instagram with face swamp yep he's brilliant he's got the funniest Instagram page by far and when he with his mom it makes me it kills maybe you seen him do that yes yes ooh and Craig is that guess what guess what get sheet you can tell she's so she's on the folic on a business call and she's like I'm on the phone he doesn't give a he keeps bugging it's so funny man chicken butt Craig character you know people are mad at him for that Craig care why of course bucks new he's being an ableist oh my god oh my list you're being an ableist mm-hmm I passed by chick-fil-a new chick-fil-a near me this morning the vegans are protesting oh wait this is him destroying his mother's painting color the Hamburglar and teacher the diner kid I'm just fixing the painting but don't one that doesn't make any sense you haven't even seen it yet maybe you'll like it better [Applause] pretty much the school I wish it in every podcast here that same drugs day school these kids there that kills it kills me every time are you so funny man every time you post something with that Craig character it rips me up but it's it's funny how he found this niche and that that this this new thing of like Face Swap with you know characters it's perfect well it's perfect because his impressions are so good oh this is so Bill Maher isn't oh my god it's so good it's like creepy when I see when you see it you're like that's Bill Maher behind the Face Swap doing the voice when he does the Kim and Kanye talkin talking to each other with Caitlyn yeah it's brilliant man he's he found he found the perfect roof but I love the fact that there's this new thing that people can do you know like this Face Swap thing there's like a completely new way of doing sketches making characters yeah it's wild yes it's almost funnier because you know that he's behind it yeah you know I mean it's like you're in on it so you know but yet it's so good like what he does like Kim and Kanye when it dad dad I'm lost in my house oh look around you what do you see there's a watch watching this a weird white box what is that white bar it's so perfect it's like lose family that's so wealthy that it completely detached from water stains what is that white box only Marriott now I just love that these like technologies created like there's a bunch of YouTube people that do that they're doing ladies weird YouTube videos yeah there's so many people doing it now yeah but it's like he but he's found it like a real specifically funny niche because he's because he's real to the characters like a lot of times people are throwing characters together in sketches and they're just kind of so cheaply done and they don't have any like they don't mean comedic bass they're just like weird to be goofy and it's like right you gotta have some kind of base man there's a few people that do it right my kid loves this lady Miranda sings do you know that is she's this she's got this show called  what show picture Miranda sings

quantity of mixed nuts makes your balls grow what literally makes your sperm increase what makes your balls shrink there's got to be a food that does the opposite steroids yeah I stopped eating those

for 14 weeks increased their sperm count by 16% sperm vitality by 4% and sperm motility by 6 percent according to a randomized controlled trial this control trial was my husband yeah last week there's a cup and dudes jizan into it every day for 14 weeks well you got going on this week man chiseling her cup with mix I mean mixed nuts and tight looks make a deal with this guy in the study like you can't come at all except for this study in the cup otherwise we're not gonna know because if you're banging all day one day and the next day you don't do anything yeah skew legit tired calm sad lazy cup scum comes out different I don't know if anybody knows but you ever take a few days off of beating off and then you beat off and it's like put a hole the ceiling all over the place working off too much yeah and just kind of dribbles out you feel like a loser yeah hey I feel very depressed if my volumes low like if I beat off and it's just like make you sad why did I do that yeah why why why I find it always depends on how much I build up if I'm building up to it and I get a big one builder oh you edge yeah pervert yeah I didn't know about edging it's  awesome Norton out tell me about it does he edged is he he'd edge with prostitutes you get a prostitute and you get right to the point of coming go all right thanks buddy yeah call another one next yeah why not get another prostitute when was this how long ago like yesterday no when was this one was the prostitutes Oh Norton's like still similar yeah still yeah Jordans an animal bro dad guys the P doesn't give a he does give a  but he doesn't give a at the same time but secretly secretly when they leave yeah he's bummed the out yeah he gets disgusted in himself but that's what he enjoys I feel like he should be free you know that there's like a thing this some guy I was reading some things some guy was doing something an anti shame things as a doctor like  shame was like his his thing but that shame is a weird thing like there's things that people are ashamed of that we're not ashamed of it all right like sex yeah like it like normal sex like say if your wife's walking around the house as a pair of shorts and you grab her ass and she you know and she turns around she smiles at you and the tool you start banging and that's fine yes nor are you married you're gonna love each other you've you're attracted to each other it's all normal right but if you lived in like a crazy religious household where she's supposed to be dressed like a tablecloth that would be a real problem yeah yeah you would she would feel awful she would feel ashamed so it's like what causes shame cultural acceptance right yeah and well and and the building blocks of how your race right like some people get shamed from from their parents for stuff that's they shouldn't feel ashamed about oh yeah for sure yeah and for Norton it's like he pays these nice ladies to touch his penis and that's why they don't have to work at Denny's but they still do yeah that's their shift that's their break they're gonna smoke break and go to a gym for an hour and dishwasher hands kind of like real rink like really really strong fingerprints  indentation on his he's strong like the the you know the lines and the fingerprints that deeper than normal yeah they're grooved all the chemicals from dishwashing washing all day what does he tell your costume how much money does he spend on hookers um well I don't know he's never be brought he's a wealthy guy so it's like not a problem that's the that's part of the problem that it's part of the problem is that it's not a problem he's so successful Jim sells out comedy shows everywhere yeah he's got a serious XM show he's written books he's got plenty of money for hookers so he's like it here he's like the most free guy that I know in terms of like talking about his weirdness and his perversion is he sober yes yes right since he was like really young yeah yeah yeah he had a problem and he got sober I think when he was 19 holy yeah he's been sober the entire time that's fine yeah everyone's got our vice yeah well his vice is it's a strong one yeah but it's like trannies he's really in trannies for real yeah yeah good for him whatever whatever the  it says it like you're not supposed to say it anymore like I just got I got just got in trouble oh dude I got  lit up for that online I I didn't I I was with gay friends at a what I put online having the most fun at a Mexican tranny bar people lit me the up it's not that's not a word I was like okay I was with gay dudes that they joked about it with me I thought it was a okay it's a you can say transvestite you can't say tranny Justin Martindale can say whatever he wants he does he can yeah yeah he does he says amaz yes he's a flamboyant gay guy yeah he can get away with it he does he gets away with he says  every yeah but like a flamboyant gay guy could say that no one say but a straight white guy from Chicago done you asshole you've piece of  Justin Martin oh he yells the n-word all the time constantly I didn't know that no he doesn't but I just want to put that off you tell him stop no I don't think you get that kind of freedom just by being gay but if you were a gay black guy yeah then you can tell you I think you're gay black transgender God could do whatever he wants with no legs and one eye hmm he's disabled gay black trans you know what's interesting nobody I mean no one accepts transracial can't do it no one accepts transracial that is the one thing like that woman one yeah Rachel Dolezal doesn't that one line that we are not willing to cross no  way which is meanwhile it is one of the most realistic lines this is why totally all human beings came from Africa all of them well also race race has a lot to do with culture but butts yeah for sure but I mean literally all human beings came from Africa yeah that is the the cradle of civilization yeah so we're all African so why can't you pretend to be African why can't why can't you just be it that's really what it is it's not pretending you just say that's what I identify with I get it yeah that to me is like that's that's more on the other side of when people say like you can't you can't be a gender other than a male or a female the second people say yes you can and that's accepted but if you said i identify as puerto rican they're like no it boy is there any race that would let you in like that is anyways yeah come on you could be a lenient I feel like redheads are like the I think I've got a little bit of a pass you should have a pair we have a pass guys are maligned yeah we have a pass gingers just kick a ginger dance South Park weird Edward that were gone we're gonna be gone in like 50 years everything a dying your hair no I knew it dude you had red hair used to dye his eyebrows what a weirdo man that's a weird hair dyed his eyebrows look different cuz he was that sad about having red hair when I was a kid when I was a kid it bothered me like crazy and then I got older I don't give a and then when you get older there's some women that like it that like that are that that that think that's more attractive because if you feel bad for them yeah I think they're dumb idiots I know something went wrong it's funny like what people like like some people like thick ankles what's your weirdest specific thing that you that when you like to when you first started getting into chicks and you finally figured out what your style was what was the one thing you're like that's weird and most people don't like that about girls you don't have any of that you know like some guys love cellulite you know some girls like like like like chunky bitches somebody do these fat chicks yeah you get you cellulite pics do you know there's a new show on Netflix oh they're trying to take off the air it's about a girl who used to be fat and then she got skinny and she's getting revenge on everybody that's what's that called I want to watch how would they take that off that sounds even you find it it's some some really pretty girl she's gone all the people that that talk to her when she was young about my fast I don't I didn't really pay attention a hundred percent yeah but uh people are very angry about it about the premise why fat shaming look don't you know about fat shaming yeah what does it call that girl Debbie Ryan fat phobic Disney is it's a fat foot hold on a second hold on let me read that fat phobic Netflix series supports damaging stereotypes for young women well listen I'm gonna tell you guys this really really clearly if your children are fat they're eating too much sugar okay so that's a fact fix that now or try but don't don't just call people fat phobic if your children feel there's a lot of nonsense that's involved in people's bodies and education and the big one is what they eat has no bearing on what they look like that is horseshit and yes bullsháá there's you didn't have giant fat people in the 20s you go back and look at  people in the 20s they were all starving and death they're all skinny and the bread they ate was doing you know what someone told me Jordan Peterson told me this we got to look look this up emulsifiers Melissa fires and he was reading something about emulsifiers that are used in fast rising yeast and in a lot of bread products are responsible for leaky gut and they have an impact on people's sensitivities to gluten and he was saying that like emulsifiers are basically like shampoo you know you have like oil yeah in the water of your debt you know you wash some dishes and all that greasy oil and you pour some dishwashing soap in there in the water yeah surprise he goes that's in food like that's a similar quality and that's what that's what's causing all these like gluten allergies and just a bunch of different things that are causing it one of them is the more complex glutens because it used to be that you would get like like if you had wheat you would have it's like old wheat was like a small little sort of grain it was a smaller plant yeah and then they started changing it and as they started changing and selectively breed what they started doing is making it thicker and more dense and and that way you get a much higher yield per acre hmm but in doing so they also made it more difficult for your body to process yes yeah so but he was saying that it's also they use this fast rising yeast and that there's emulsifiers in it and then emulsifiers are apparently terrible for your body huh which makes sense because you go to  Italy and I know you like to go to Italy yeah and you eat some of that  pasta over there it doesn't make you feel the same no it doesn't know you actually don't feel as thick I feel like you I feel way thicker when I like I feel dumpy when I eat it back home yeah I found pasta that I could buy online that's from Italy fresh-made pasta for me yeah what's not fresh made but it's it's using it it tastes better yeah if you feel better when you eat it no you do actually I know that sounds like a thing an American traveler would say it's better over there but it's but it is true you unseal that no you go over there they're not fat it's awesome if there's someone fat it's an American that's over every time I see a fat pairs of a thousand bucks but there's no mistake oles they've got tiramisu they've got spaghetti dessert and have coffee every night why aren't they fat now therefore they led their lifestyle and their food choices I'm gonna purposely have two kids and I'm gonna feed one of them very healthy food and the other one I'm just gonna have sugary diet and just fatten the out of just to show society what's up dress someone to seal and paw on a boat so I'm gonna have a rope yeah I'll have a rope see the premise of the show you know like I guess would be one of the fad show yeah she used to be fat and then she lost weight he got punched in the face now to get her water her jaw wired shut that no she lost the weight oh my god that is so up that's kind of up wait a minute who punched her in the face her dad yeah eaten cake stop eating cake you  it worked watch that's a stupid premise and then but she's getting revenge on people that talk that's it right she's going back for vengeance on people who hurt her so the idea is that girls are gonna watch that they're gonna want to get their jaw wired shut they're gonna tell their friends to punch something to break their friends me hit me with a bat my head I'm gonna jump off my roof there'll be a Kyle Dunnigan sketch that would be a great done it's bad right the head hit me hit me in the face I wanna lose weight got my teeth summer body but people do lose weight when they get the jaw wired oh yeah you don't eat liquid drink drink her sorry Rob there's a conflict Kanye when he shattered his doing me on that car accident he lost all that weight and he talked about it he couldn't eat anything and he was so  up on painkillers and mmm oh no no thanks dude that shit's weird how vulnerable your jaw is I feel that go go side to side with your jaw yeah it breaks so easy so vulnerable I can't be more people don't crack their  jaw when I was fighting I was always my jaw was always sore like you always get dinged like you'd always get in sparring so like you'd be chewing and eating like this like oh it's painful yeah jaw was always sore you feel it in your teeth do you know you feel it and you're like where the joint is yeah you realize your jaw is in many ways like your knee yeah right like you know your knee gets sore so unique it's sort it like ah it hurts me to do that well you get punched a bunch your jaw gets sore like when you're chewing it hurts yeah what is that the worst or is like rib rib a constant rib punching worse you know the worst is your head always like far yeah by far because it's scary the ribs aren't scary it's like I've had broken ribs like one of my ribs like on this side like sticks out more because it's been cracked it's all  up I probably broke at least three ribs maybe more I think I broke a probably broke at least three I don't know I definitely had some tears in the cartilage in between the ribs to her I promise they don't really do much about it when you get a broken rib they don't put you in a cab you can't do I do much about it you just didn't  agony for a while till it feels up I never broke ribs I don't know that I don't know if that pain for ribs suck but you're still okay when your head hurts you're scared oh yeah I've had three concussions I how'd you get concussions just all sports one football to basketball basketball basketball was bad basketball is twice the same way did you fall yeah man got my legs taken out from under me both times Jesus Christ I'll never tells this story I'll never my friend who's now passed away sadly he he's gone but he called my mom and was like um don't freak out but don't freak out the first words to a parent don't freak out but Andrews in the hospital and of course my mom is it I got my knees I went to get a rebound and on my way down all I just remember seeing the ceiling that that's the last thing I remember my legs were a roof right out from under me and I hit my head so hard on the ground that I bounced up and everyone playing was like standing around in shock and I was blacking in and out but I was so it was so strange cuz you don't really you don't really know it right away you're like what's going on I'm good you know I'm good you think I'm good I'm walking I'm good I'm good and everybody's like sit down are you okay like are you you know we hurt me you could hear it from outside and then I sat down there the EMTs come and I remember like clear as day when the EMT  grabbed my hand and he started to walk and I go I'm gonna fall us I'm gonna fall down and pass out I say I don't feel good I'm gonna go to black and I remember I threw up I barf everywhere all over this I puked and then I woke up again in the hospital that was bad that was the worst one I ever had I bruised bruised all these vertebra in the doctor kept saying how I was inches of pressure away from cracking from bringing my neck because all of my weight went one way that was bad football was bad football was helmet-to-helmet oh that sucks I was a kick I was kicking the ball cuz our kicker was hurt and the kid over snapped it went right over my head I went and grabbed as soon as I turned around whoof I got walked oh and then a guy in the sideline goes you got your bell rung boy I mean I got it I mean everyone was like oh they were loving it I got smoked I look like a  rag doll I'm sure like it's it's a weird thing when people cheer when someone gets gravely injured oh yeah people love it because it's because you caused up the force of it is like oh  it looks incredible to see I don't even think about fights same thing yeah I mean when someone gets head kick  insane yeah you can't believe you're watching it that's why the human the human emotion of like be dead soon like the most disturbing ones I ever saw was Francis and gah no knocked out Alistair Overeem this left hook uppercut combination but sent his head like literally he was like looking at his asshole it snapped his head back so far it was her and he literally flatlined yeah it just flatlined like legs spread out toes curled oh and one punch and it was it was so powerful and so horrific that I was like yeah you can't help but go yeah and but she people are cheering for someone getting horribly injured well I had a moment at at UFC 2 to 5 inch cago I had a moment where I'm sitting on the floor and I was looking around and Tony and I were you know it was it was it was between fights and Tony and Tony goes this is awesome man and I go it is and as I'm looking around it like soaked for a second in me that I was like this is so hit like historic in nature of like people gathering to watch people fight it was so like it brought me to this weird place of like isn't this insane to think that all these humans are just coming to watch these two athletes just grapple at one another it was just it was interesting because the other sporting events don't don't hit me didn't hit me like that but you when remember when you were a kid and like kids would decide we're gonna fight everyone wants to watch everybody gathered around yeah it was way more exciting than what was going on with stupid classrooms there was there was a little there was little area in my high school that people fought it it's like little secret guard it was like a place that you could get to I mean and people loved it who they set up fight two dudes fought over this one girl they were both  well sure she was there that was that was even more brutal the the kid that they thought was gonna win he was he was I mean he was just a tougher kid but he had yeah it was the middle of winter alpha I'll never forget and he had really bad acne and the other kid every time he landed a punch you would like see the redness get worse than his acne in the blood start coming out of his face rough as it was the fight it was it blood one he said fighting over a girl not only do you lose the girl but you also get your ass kicked he was and she was there which was even more brash and that's how girls are such assholes she stood there and watched these two dickheads fight over her did she say don't stop yeah she's gonna cut it out guys please now she know she'd say she knows yes she watched them do it and the whole school watching and then somebody a what probably was in that fight but one fight I remember somebody taped and tapes were getting passed around but this is what's about school these school rule things like athletes we always had this guilty by association if you're there you get suspended even if you had nothing to do with it wasn't athlete code of conduct wait a minute so so so if I'm at a party and it gets busted up by the cops and I don't have alcohol or drugs on me or nothing but I'm at that party and it gets back to the school and the coach Cheers I get suspended from whatever oh speaking of which burr sent me this what there's a code of conduct at Netflix mmm-hmm yeah in like an internal no I'm sorry at just for laughs rather oh yeah just for I'm gonna send you this young Jaime Netflix has a why do I keep saying Netflix just laughs Montreal yeah has a code of conduct they post it everywhere I'm sure oh yeah yeah of course yeah yeah for artists or for people it's got to be for artists yeah for the comics yeah yeah yeah a code of conduct how to behave for comics for adults grown people yeah listen you sell what up people make yeah okay yep okay but we're gonna tell you there's a code oh  make that bigger in order to accomplish our purpose the Just for Laughs festival must be exempt of abuse inappropriate or vexatious I've never read that before you're aware that were before to vex to vex some money vexatious behaviors everyone participating in the Just for Laughs festival must treat artists festival goers and employees with equality respect and dignity no matter the gender sexual identity sexual orientation disability physical appearance race or religion I hope they loved it one out yeah what about cognitive function right it sounds like you can pick on really stupid people still jfl adopts a zero tolerance policy on harassment in all its forms whether it is verbal comments actions or gestures that are repeated in the hostile that a affect a person's dignity or psychological or physical integrity oh so you can't talk anymore what do we do when we're hanging around talk that's the whole human you've been harassing me you've been vexatious with me sir nothing in this policy should be interpreted as a barrier to artistic freedom too late les harán days they got they had to put a French word in that motherfucker's attention teams and security squads what hold on intervention teams and security squads of specialized responders with the mission of increasing the safety of women and vulnerable persons during the outdoor events will be unstraight festival site every day between 7:00 and 11:00 so if you want to molest here's your hours after 11 of December they have been wearing pink armbands and luminous bracelets for better visibility in the dark they will also have a tent located on plus between balm old bamboo days God French is awesome what were the streets what were the streets they've trying to remember we can't we can't molest on these streets boys sews branch out we're gonna go into the formal etc safety cat Trin in addition if you are the victim of a witness a prohibited act okay well it's a prohibited act anything listed above just seems like everything yeah it is zero Conda I mean all that for no rape no touching no harassment all of that but it seems like they're just covering their ass let's go back up to that what you can't do again I want to know what vexatious is what's vexatious inappropriate abusive inappropriate or vexatious behavior everything we do is inappropriate yeah okay the idea of what we do for a living is inappropriate that whole back alley where everybody goes in smokes yes an inappropriate zone every single time it's every time you go back there people are just saying reduce annoyance frustration or worry Wow Wow who's the thesaurus holder that pulled that that bad boy out have you heard that word never heard that word this is them covering up their  this is them being so overtly cautious because whatever insurance they've got on whatever is like you have to give fair warning that we have security for this this and this what's amazing is think about how long it's been going on where they didn't have that yeah I I was in just for laughs in 93 they you're what was your first year in just four jfl 1993 was your first year yeah 93 yeah so how the  93 but they're pulling us out now that's crazy yeah it's been around for forever but I also love that it said on it that you shouldn't you have to immediately email you imagine we'll get back to you you get molested you go to email you still hurts someone grabbing at you assholes got email now you know what I'm gonna  send this in yeah you're gonna ice zero tolerance at hey you get right you get physically abused the email you have to email is ha ha ha you probably shouldn't put that email online listen public that's public don't get us but this is really public yeah well you know you get what you get yes but I mean look we're not Pro harassment don't come no get us wrong but this just seems like a little over the top but see this this in some some semblance of irony this is harassing it's just like poking the bear at people to be like these are all the things you can't do all it's doing is like stirring people to go I wasn't gonna doing that anyway why are you  why are you why are you employing people to walk around in armbands to make sure I'm not doing a thing that I was never gonna do well was it an issue if it was a huge issue then that then I'd like to know well drunken comedians can be gross but drunken rich people are pieces of yeah but you've created a festival where there's drunken animals walking the streets all night long right so well I mean you need to sure this is vexatious vexatious vexatious that's me baby backs it up go mix it up and sex it up whoo I've been vexing all over town I'm all vexatious over here I'm all inappropriate stop being vexatious inappropriate - weird word - because by whose definitions but all that stuff is all subjective whoo standards of anything it's to vex me means to annoy or to like poke and prod annoyances is such a commonality in our daily lives yeah I'm annoyed by that comment yeah that's vexed annoyed that I'm vexed by the vexatious the sign document you thrown fascias but what bursts all that all over yeah I'm sure I'm sure they posted them all over and they're people walking around trying to protect people who what is that about it's weird it's like you you want you need fucked-up people to make rock and roll comedy and rap music yep you need it but in this day and age nobody you know everybody wants no-one to be up I think when people love when people like reminisce about a time when a amazing artist who was a weirdo they do that because they don't they didn't realize what also came along with it you know like they're like you know whatever am a amazing musician they're like they were totally up they did crazy fucked-up all the time it's like they couldn't do that today yeah imagine Jim Morrison be fine he'd be he couldn't do any other thing get he I mean like I used to pull his dick out on stage all the time sit for it piss on she piss on people he'd pull out his dick and piss on someone and people think that like today that'd be the end of times for him the end that's all there I want to kill you but that's the thing is like that's yeah that's that's the whole the irony of this whole performers getting and bridled range I had a buddy man who loved music who's really into like old bands but did not like Jim Morrison's like please anything but why did he not like the doors cuz he was a good-looking guy got tons of it bothered him guarantee you yeah that was part of it make you wait a minute you don't think that Jim Morrison and the doors were good music you don't think that break on through to the other side is a good song yeah what do you mean they say you look me in the eyes you tell me break on through to the other side isn't a  amazing song yeah and it was in 1968 or some yeah you man and he's like that's just not it's not good music man yeah Jim Moore's in the doors so hot so high so gone no shirt on still making phenomenal music Blanche a dongs like a scarecrow feeds every candles he made that intro so long so he could finish when he was getting blown break on through to the other side of the amaze so good he had they had so many amazing songs but that era of music had so much good music I think was also the part of the problem was when Val Kilmer played him that was a big issue I mean yeah that was a big bummer for me I'll kill Murr who's a beautiful man at the time yeah he out of all the beautiful men who are not beautiful man he fell so far whoa what happened Val Val just got into cake and heroin looks like pull up a picture it makes me sad every time I see you like I'm like that guy was bat me was a bat man he was one of the things about that man and now he you're like what did he do did you start drinking is it booze I don't quite remember what well remembered there was rumors about he had he was like covering up he was really sick he had cancer right but then he denies it doesn't he deny it I thought he denied it for a year I thought it was like a thing where people were like he's he that he said he was sick but it wasn't cancer that he was at coincide Val Kilmer's to throw Donal through and come back in the Top Gun sequel oh so he got throat cancer oh man he's Finnegan yeah he's looking better there let me see that don't scroll well stop but the flash is you assholes can't even see me looks like that's what he used to look like mmm you have to reveal the news on reddit during and ask me anything Q&A oh how weird rat it's so funny about that one commenter said a while ago Michael Douglas claimed you had terminal cancer what was the story behind that and he said killer responded okay you can read that quicker he was probably trying to help me cuz Oh what the Wii what the folks because the the screen got filled with all of these pop-ups for possibly new videos that you want to watch while you're watching a video I did have a healing of cancer but my tongue is still swollen although healing all the time because I don't sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather like I refers to cancer as under the weather that's how that's a pretty bold leap but when he got really fat abuts that's one of the reasons why he got cancer I bet he was like really unhealthy cuz I think it wasn't just see well I don't think it was just that he got cancer I think he also was like really up for a while health-wise in terms look he just looked so different booze and chant yeah 2015 he was rushed to the hospital yeah but this is before that but see before 2015 he looks so strange there that doesn't look like the same guy well it looks like he's got a bandana looks like and it looks like he's got a let it look at his left eye that's mm what what does that say scroll up mm what is his left eye looking at and is he looking at someone shoes someone's got a nice tip someone's got great shoes I want it left to juicy running errands and London without his trick tracheotomy and trach tray how do you say that tracheotomy yeah Frankie asked me to oh so he did he had a hole yeah that's Wow but see that's why I mean when they say rumors right I do remember that ki had denied it heavily that he had cancer it was a whole 2013 oh Michael Douglas age eats wage for oral cancer whoo  me Douglas do you know now wasn't that whole thing about him saying that he went down on his on his wife too much wasn't that like a big thing that he was like he said he that there was a rumor that he said find out what the story about that is we probably should clarify because I want to know what he got really mad at that apparently I mean yeah cuz she's like I'm got cancer imagine your wife's pussy's so funky but people do get a lot of cancer from throat cancer from HPV apparently well that's real yeah that's gross from lickin even even eating a lot of venereal diseases are so weird cuz diseases that specifically come from sex Michael Douglas I was sorry for the effect of oral sex cancer comments on my wife okay What did he say though inside regretted the embarrassment caused to his wife Catherine zeta-jones by the revelation two years ago that is cancer may have been caused by performing oral sex she's probably just joking no I don't think it was that his illness was a result of contracting the human papillomavirus which experts believe can be brought on by cunnilingus I love that word the storm made headlines around the world when Douglas was promoting his Emmy winning role in Liberace biopic behind the candelabra after being declared free of cancer by the way did you ever see that movie yeah Diaz man hey man a bit on that that unfortunately has been lost because Joey Diaz has never really done a special other than he did one special a couple years back but you to do a special on Joey Diaz what you really do you need to have Joey do like five nights in a row and just turn the cameras on every night and just let him go loose yep and then film it all and then eventually you'll get that Joey Diaz mom 100th experience but when you say okay Joey be yourself now get on camera and guys clap it in yes just hard for a guy who's that wild and loose to be wild and loose on demand with a bunch of lighting on and they want to put makeup on them and that everything becomes artificial and everyone's the vibe of what stand-up is 100% it's so unfortunately you know Joey be in the wild man that is he's never a lot of his greatest bits are never been captured but yeah he had a Michael Douglas doing Liberace bit that was so good it was so good cuz that if you ever watch that documentary I watched it yeah that's occu mentary the movie drama with biopic Coolidge Cobbs biopic yeah it's so good yeah it's phenomenal you realize like wow crazy Liberace was he had up like a pump for his dick couldn't get hard anymore

problem but YouTube iTunes would hear it right or RS feeds if your Android do you know there's more Android phones and there are our phones yeah good but yeah iPhone so annoying now it's annoying I'm getting sick me too man I'm tired of the  yeah let's do let's go together let's go yeah every listener switch switch switch is me crazy here it is let's listen the song say it's Peggy King I found a

known for playing the piano yeah but he was a singer too yeah yeah yeah but he was with that song he's not singing at all now he's winking will never rot she winks at me she was a huge star mass yeah

off no chance get out of here there's no no one now no one Liberace used Judy Garland's right and Mae West as beer Jesus Christ yes pop ups today are so unknown who Mae West Mae West as least convincing beards ever Wow have you looked at him there look at him right there make that picture bigger he looks so good okay I mean there's people that look gay okay you know here's the problem those other guys look gay too well they're obviously gayer back then he's on her left yes that's him right there right there I mean look at that smile that's gay but so's the guy on her right that guy looks gays does probably one his buddies yeah one of his roommates yeah maybe wes is like I'm so confused nobody wants to me this is so weird I haven't typed in weeks so we're 30 men Liberace had no trouble getting all the dates he wanted and he gloried in escorting well-known entertainers to parties getting his picture taken with Susan Hayward gale storm Rosemary Clooney yeah Mae West was a few times indeed Garland Mae West was the only one of his so called lady friends that I actually met as they say in Texas Mae was a hoot who wrote this she was a drunk mmm this is a gay website cuz what's

Douglas playing him look how good that is dude look he looks exactly like him behind the candelabra well then scroll down when they go side-by-side look at that one right there then the red with the red hue yeah look at that well didn't they put makeup on him and and make him look more likely I know but it still does structurally still kind of looks he has the same kind of clothes enough yeah but I think they did something with his chin childen is a lower the upper right hand one where the the the upper right hand upper right-hand part lumps cute I'm sorry upper left hand the one with the the guy that actually got the work done yeah look he he made him get plate of fat facial plastic surgery so he resembled Liberace so he could his face looked like Liberace that his boyfriend he wanted him to look like himself he made his boyfriend look like him how crazy is that yeah because Liberace had a wig so and part of the movie Liberace takes the wig off that's right hello that's right Rob Lowe was amazing in that movie that's a great move what here's that movie from I was just gonna say he's not too long ago dude let me tell you something Joey Diaz had one of the best bits of all time about that movie I'd like to get you Joey Diaz high and make him watch it again he should read he should rebirth that video no I want to know this bit so  I was so committed beg him to do it but he was good I don't do that Nemo the problem is you would have to he would have to want to do it yeah we couldn't talk him into doing it and he would also have to be enthusiastic about it again yeah want he'd want to want he'd want to tell I have to want to tell the joke yeah what was a whole bit so it was the story was he was watching the docudrama he can't eat with asthma behind the candelabra by Joey

understand me if you don't watch man on fire play this is a movie on HBO call behind the candelabra behind the candelabra the Liberace story some of you guys are very young you don't remember Liberace there's a lot of people are longer the to it you know the  Liberace is Liberace was a piano player from the 60s and 70s that was very popular he was flaming gay and he had a wig but he pulled the Michael Jackson he told people he was engaged so nobody really believed that he was gay I don't give a either way if you're gay and that I am makes no difference to me he was a good piano player they did this movie about him and the funny thing about this movie that he was played by Gekko Michael Douglas play Liberace so it came home one day and I'm like it let's watch this thing right so I'm watching this Liberace dude and he's playing the piano and and whatnot when you watch the movie you're like look at this and all guys got game all guys got damn okay a lot of people don't really it's like the ghost eggy's guy you never see him hanging out with Betty White and a bunch of old hags do you know he's hanging out with 19 year old chicks at the bar and there's always like two of them but there's always a third one that comes and she's like why are you hanging out with this creepy guy he's old little girls like he's not creepy he's just lonely his wife died he just wants conversation he doesn't want none from us he's like your grandpa and all of a sudden there's that one girl that goes grandpa keep around with these old guys you will suck one of their dicks like young guys go right for your little vagina an old guy throws you in a web and they play you like they crawl on you you ladies have been taken by an old guy at one point your life they rock your world and they'll your brains out you catch them with some good old blood transfusion or they believe that  I had a friend who was a stripper that said she went home with a 50 year old guy one night she didn't walk for three days and go again That's not me I come in a minute a half but it's not me at all I'm just talking about that there's guys out there that rule rock your world and Liberace was probably one of them uh the guy that played it elope the guy that fell in love with him was played by Matt Damon okay now I love Matt Damon I'm watching this I'm like this is gonna be  up Matt Damon plays a confused kid that he's he's bisexual and one night he goes to see Liberace play the  piano and he gets impressed by Liberace she goes oh my God look at the way he's moving his hands that and afterward he sneaks into VIP and he sneaks in with his little blonde hair he looks beautiful Matt Damon he's all yoked up and and Liberace's got his robe on with his sandals and he looks and he sees Matt Damon and you can see he loses his mind he's just looking at him with that gay look to him like I'm gonna kill this pork chop when I get my hand on Matt Damon sees this Andrew Santino's a dick he's looking at me he walks over to my god I started playing something he started texting people I was taking selfies I'm pushing the show oh you thank you go listen to the bit folks to Habra the problem with like playing it but everybody like stops and then you pull your phone out wob pose I was checking to see what of the ship to be there right there I forgot to put it back up so that was on YouTube either half of it was oh well that's a problem yeah I'll be bored just like are you listening to you just stand there staring we're watching Santino play with his phone you're one of those no cases on your fuck's dad what's the difference of risk-taking move but but what's what's gonna happen that's gonna break but then I get a new one Wow cuz I'm so first world not about the AppleCare it's it's 90 bucks and you get a new one but do you want it to get a new one don't you want to just protect your phone so you have to go to the Apple Store we not like your phone here's my argument you have an argument here yeah because everyone says it's white look okay this is why I like the phone the sleekness the design the feel is beautiful then we put cases on him and him up they brag about how thin and one over there then you shove a  case on it mmm it loses all the beauty in the architecture of why I like the phone Steve Jobs was in love with the idea of like the design of the phone and that's what Apple's whole stance used to be sleekness design could thin like everything about it was how sexy it was and then we're like yeah I put a  case on its own ever breaks still sexy with this case on nah no chunky this sounds classist but like I have enough money you obviously weigh more than me but like you can afford to break it so I just don't care if I most Americans that like breaking the phone is a big deal I get it I can afford to buy a new phone I don't care Wow I know you're so first world yeah but that's honest that's like saying you know some people treat  some people treat like that also mmm everyone will go knock on wood I've never broken a phone I've never had a case what this is my fifth iPhone come on you are never broken a I swear on my mother's life I've never shattered a phone in my life never once I've never had a case you ever shoot your pants twice once once in Japan once here ever I shoot my pants ever once in Japan once here here not here here here in right here in the studio I'm my pants I shoot my pants in Japan that's a real story yeah what happened I we we've we went out the night before I had the most fun I've ever had in my entire life and my stomach was not having a good time with whatever we ate for breakfast and I was walking the street we were going to like a temple and I and I like had a I just had a little a little fart came out and I and I stopped and I thought no no way no way really I could like I couldn't comprehend that I actually it happened I had to go to like a little 7-eleven type place and in this little tiny room take off my pants take off my  onto we're leaving in the in the bathroom and then and then go wrong leaving underwear in our bathroom so rude move I know I know those people have to go in there and smell that I just posted in the trashcan and I covered up as much as I could see you're not coming up to smell the trashcan no when you throw in the garbage can outside carry it out carried up to things my poop when my my underwear ya know just going like this now know that I had to throw it right in the trash can and disappear that's kind of like yeah but that's not okay okay this isn't that uncommon like in a lot of places around the world you can't throw toilet paper in there in the toilet you have to put it in the trash can what yeah yeah yeah you know go to Central and South America you can't they don't they say please no toilet paper so it's people in the toilet and then they throw the at their ass wipes in the trash Jamie say all right I'm not playing you've never been to a country like that maybe I didn't read their sign cuz they don't because the pipes are old they can't handle all that payment paper it's your pipes you cave people  bucks get PVC cheap dude in Thailand every bathroom that I went to right next to the toilet has a goddamn garden hose like you would use to wash this card out of your ass yeah like nothing like not a gentle bidet like we have those toilets those what are they bond ELLs those are so dope yeah they're amazing yeah the seats warm and you sit down you press the button a gentle warm jet of air hits your butthole and it's so nice yeah this wasn't like that at all this was a goddamn that you'd clean an elephant was like a green hole a garden hose no it's like one of those guns you know you have a lot of pressure on that's what it was you can't flush the toilet paper down the loo in these European countries you go my friend look at all these different ones Bulgaria Turkey Greece Greece Macedonia you can't flush toilet paper you can't it'll break a pipe though what kind of thin walled pipes they have over there that toilet papers breaking no but doesn't make any sense it's the mass amount it clogs up the pipes too many people no it just seems so crazy like what if you have a lot of fiber in your poo like what if you're eating a lot of broccoli and you have like elephant type poo Riley in rocks another thing in Thailand they sell poo paper they sell paper that they make out of elephant yeah because elephant is all fiber so what they do is they take that elephant they wash out the fecal bacteria and they use the actual plant fibrous material they turn that in the toilet paper and you it's a novelty you wipe your ass with elephant so you wipe your with  you're wiping were yeah how does it it can't smell good even if they've done by smelling it bro what is this poop a for me to paper Park yeah that's it elephant poop paper poop paper look at the poop poop popp yeah so they take it and they they break it down building a future in which humans live in harmony with nature okay and they sell the stuff and you wipe your butt with it who sold here funny I get all of it ha ha it's like what someone has a clever family reunion shirt and it's just like ok I get it you know what you know who I'm sick and tired of who by the way people that make shitty slide jokes I think they're funny ooh flight attendants now that are trying to make correct like funny little jokes that that's like a culture now do you know what I'm talking about well yeah but a lot of other airlines are doing because they think it's cute like Southwest does it all the time cuz they're they're trash they don't give a  trash can than this guy but no seriously I'm like I was on maybe Delta but like they make little cute jokes like if you don't know what we have to drink maybe you've never flown before because it's been the same thing for 20 years and then a few people like you know a few idiots on the plane left your don't make jokes to this isn't the time just tell me the and go sit the down and shut up dude I don't like the jokes this is coming from a guy who makes jokes for a living yep for money that's not their job their job is to make sure I get my  sprite let them in my peanuts just a little rush them to go I don't like them I don't like them you do you remember the first thing that you ever did in front of a group of people that got a laugh like it a little inappropriate yeah yeah my buddies a sleepover type of yeah a little thrill that you get with it inappropriately yeah but it's not my job their job is to be the flight of 10 I don't need the joke from the fly to tell you're so rude them he's so mean they're mean you know they're me they're mean most of them are assholes one lady told me that I had to put my fanny pack in the overhead compartment you take it off and now to use it as a bag at a store it as a bag I'm like why should I go what if I take everything out of the bag and put it in my pockets you could do and then she couldn't say she's like sure just take the bag off I'm like this is a Power Move no one's ever told me that before one lady told me to take the fanny pack off I think she was just anti fanny pack but you know see but you know this an Americans that have experiences know when you fly in business are first they treat you like a King and when you fly in the butt of the plane they don't give a about yes true that's what this was in first class yeah but she was doing that because she's fed up with her whatever her day was but most time they let you get away with anything I think she was just chubby and she wasn't getting any dick and that fast I felt at the time a fanny pack she snapped can I just ask you a question a chubby and do you not get any dick is that imagine you said that I just need to know before I put my fanny pack away just because of a lack of dick it would be great if she goes you know what yes and then just walked away you want to give me some deck you can wear the favor you me with just the fatty background reach back click taking it off overhead apartment it is I'll be right back when they ever achi wings hit me I can't wait til everyone at home has that stuck in their head it's gonna I start to shake I start to quiver the things that people thought were entertaining in like the 50s it's so strange when you go back now watch that stuff

police a guy did it so listen it's not outside the realm of possibility though mumble rapper took that doct himself in the head told his security to call the ambulance right away and then went in this day and age people are just doing anything to stay relevant you stay relevant to get attention they'll do anything well that's what they that's what instagram has become that's what the Internet has become it's just become the way to be like huh it's not necessarily what it's become but it's certainly a venue for people that don't have any other options it's big it works a lot of people make make actual careers on first on Instagram but there's people that like Kendrick Lamar's not doing that yeah he's yeah but no I'm saying yeah he doesn't need that but he doesn't need that  but some people

branching away from the sleeves like is it now the next thing you've got you know I'll with my neck now I don't know maybe a leg maybe a calf get a calf done yeah hmm I have zero how come I don't know I think we've talked about this before I think why you get across your stomach a gangland-style gingers rule bro gingers rule yeah ginge the G I'll write you the ginge on my chest how about suck my carrot eat my carrot right above my dick get your vitamin K right what if I did a what if I did a bunny rabbit right right next to my yeah nice do you know I do you know this article came out about redheads we produce our own vitamin D you have to at like twice the rate of a normal human being in fact were so white Thanks wait for redhead I'm not that bad he's more pale than I am oh you guys getting angry he is that's yeah that's the whole reason why people got white in the first place we die but redhead specifically produces more than any other we produce twice as much vitamin E as anybody else on the plane Wow yeah I wonder if there's a correlation between redheads being happy because vitamin D is one of the things that  people up like in Seattle it does yeah it does that's why they tell people do you think most redheads are happy then you think there's a do you think the correlation between I don't know a lot of funny I mean burr you Louie three really funny redheads yeah but I would say this though the majority of American red had different than European redheads because they grew up in dreary  right so their conditions are different well you have Sun you live in California every day probably have massive amounts of vitamin D probably too much like if someone checked you out they'd be like this guy's died in a vitamin D he's overdosing hundred eighteen on D you hear Santino died a vitamin D man it's  terrible that is a weird thing that we have a vitamin that we get from the star yeah that's there's a star that gives us a vitamin yeah I mean we make it ourselves but we get it from exposure to a star you've read about these people that just like eat sunlight for breakfast you know this come on Joe this is real he knows me no they eat sunlight for breakfast they say that they get supplements they get enough supplemental nutrition from taking in the Sun from certain hours of the day that's real good by when I was doing that sci-fi show Joe Rogan questions everything one of the things we did we went to this guy who was he had some cockamamie device that he was claiming did something that it really didn't do but when we went over the guy's house one of the things he shows me this picture on the wall some Indian guy from India with like his face is covered in white makeup and I go what is this guy's deal and he goes like oh that's shriek Bally gaga you know he hasn't eaten any food or drinking any water in 10 years in pot impossible literally impossible this so I said do I go that's not true what is this Henry called eat son we've bought this eat the son he weighs a puny 135 pounds what does that say but he could lift weights what what is it but he can honey but they eat but he can hoist 965 no no he's impossible no he can't look at him with his socks loo those old school gym socks old school gym socks are coming back they're terracotta tight they're like the girls yeah hot a girl with like old school gym shorts and old school gym socks they go up to the knee why is that sexy because it's like a rump it's reminiscent of like sexy youth the something youthful about nineteen eighties teen summer movie yeah there's something about that like the hot chick with long socks and a short skirt socks with stripes right yes you strike up at the top yeah that's hot chunky shoes big chunky white shoes underneath yeah what's with the stripes at the top of the sock like the socks are good but you know what I make it all perfect stripes some color you know that was an accident and threading and they just really leave it yeah that's hot so hot look at that girl whoo the diary of Jane yeah keep his socks on baby really yeah yeah your feet are garbage yeah cover those hooves up yeah that's a look gym socks and pigtails look at those oh there's entire threads dedicated to it it's yeah that's weird as a weird thing that people are in see well this is it to like this section sucks compression socks is a big thing in girls will wear them out out of the out of CrossFit and all that now that's a big thing too why do they wear compression socks what's the benefit of compression sorry it's the same thing as compression sleeves as exact same thing but what are you muscles warm is that were that what it does athletes let certain athletes claim that it helps keep their muscles warm between plays see I've wear rash guards for jujitsu yeah but that's like functional it's but it's compressed it's like you know it's compression it's like it's tight main functionalities not to get your skin skin up ya know there's this for to keep the muscle tighten warm that's weird that's weird man like it's marketing but I don't know  weird I mean listen there's gotta mean there's something to be said about keeping muscles warm when you're working out when muscles get cold they I mean yeah but is that what it does let's let's Google what are the benefits of compression clothes for athletics there's gonna be some some compression salesman that hits us up and just give Rights a nine-hour paragraph I started to shake I start properly design a fitted compression like wear prevent venous blood pooling in the legs and improve like symptoms and decrease the risk of blood clots huh yeah but there's so much blood flow when you're working out I highly doubt there's a lot of pooling in athletes one of the things that I saw when I was in Thailand when they had stores stores starship that stores that were was all compression clothing including face masks men and gloves it's just so that's just like a leather daddy suit with a it was like it was tan like skin colored it was strange man weird we're outside the store I was like what is this what is this compression shops through they had it for little kids no little masks massive little kid now you're getting into a weird territory little pants little mask little shirts it was real strange see that is gross then we get into a territory of something pervy I think it's people that eat too many noodles you just see all those carbs use me down see I know people that travel my dad used to work with this guy and he would travel a lot and he always wore compression he was a bigger dude and he wore compression sleeves and socks and stuff on planes because traveling a lot that's why that piece some people like it for that I think some people use compression socks when they travel up there on planes all the time because you do pool and clot on planes really yeah it happens to people all the time you pull a clot yeah blood can pool on planes very easily don't you need to just go to the gym you lazy fact god damn fact compression shorts it's not gonna fix it that's wrong with your body bro it's pooling pooling they could you just sunk in the sea your gelatinous membrane would you like it if they sir if they if they had a an airline that you could work out on you fly and play a pay a premium had a gym in the back of the plane like a commercial jet no dickheads doing cleans and he drops the bar and it goes right through the floor the hilarious all kids start getting sucked through the little all your own risk and you're in the middle of like the perfect bit you're writing yes I got it you clap your hands together and show your lab cop goes flying through the Horford floor no dickhead wants to do is CrossFit workout of there are CrossFit gym in this guy you couldn't know he couldn't lift weights there but maybe you can have machines yeah there be a cool machine you could do or present those resistance bands machines those like cable cable machines right those 360 machines mmm what is this Jamie it's on its way what Santino's ahead of the curve there go ahead of the fuzzy model modular planes I think that the in the flight exercise project hold on let's go up so we could read that in flight exercise your next flight abroad could include a gym when's this article published may major transpose an Airbus project is displaying a prototype flying gym module at the San Jose Airport the modules can be used for spas napping pods or gaming center as tight Transpo on Transpo's isn't the first to suggest using cabin space for activities that promote wellness although such ideas are intriguing a lot of these concepts don't really account for the business model of air travel says Devon Lydell a principle behind strategist of Teague yeah he's what's called the fun-stopper Devon you  dopping fuckhead what is that does her sleep oh that's like a um like rubber bands yeah you do Pilates almost that's kind of cool man see that seems reasonable but I feel like so few people are gonna use it that it's gonna be one of those things where after a while it's just like hey remember when they used to have a smoking part in the back of the plane that's that's gonna be like remember these two have a so these are the napping pods I guess that shit's awesome when we were flying to Thailand there was this one dude that went to sleep immediately and he was an enormous guy and whose is the loudest snoring wake the up I'll go No hey hey you're yelling you're you're loud I'll wait she belongs you wake them up I do it I've done it before I'm playing what do you say I go excuse me and they huh no you're you're you're snore and just want to let you know you're snoring and they give me they give you like a you look but it's them I don't want to sit there while the plane is crying here you are having apnea I don't need to hear it yeah it was bad yes gross he's bad we went on for hours you can see people covering their head with pillow how long is that flight 15 hours yeah 13 hours to Taipei  that it was great I mean Rome Rome from here is 14 what 50 something about the snoring like that think about think about that they put a gym on there for a premium people might pay man for long flights I'm not not not in the US but overseas flights people might be like I could get a workout in before I land take that snoring guy bring him back there goes boy your time on a machine Walker yeah you fat your heads too fat that's the sign that says peep everyone pays Fathead work out for free you know and I want to know like what when did people start getting that fat Hobbit I mean I mean that that sugar documentary claims that it's in the revolution of corn syrups introduction in the I would like to know though like when people be a transition at what that was they're a rare person like way back in the day they got that fat like what do you think like the sick 60s and the 70s things started to change I don't know I imagine when our technology boom happened in the 80s probably when it all started well it happened before that for sure but there's also like sugary cereals and stuff and doesn't that stuff introduced in the 80s because 70s were like that that was the end of like natural cereal no they had those sugary cereals in the 70s for sure because I was a little kid they did a little kid in the seventies but were they like they are today oh yeah cocoa puffs and like that but I mean the amount of sugar I wonder what it is comparatively because because now there's like 40 grams of cup it's it's absurd I think it was the same you do but then do you think it's because they were using cane sugar then and different no I think people got fat even back then but I think it's expanded its expanded to everything well convenience to right those you can get any fast food everywhere all the time yeah 24 hours is brilliant does McDonald's really put sugar in their fries yeah man they put them in their  buns they put it in everything sugar is in everything and everything they make their buns the buns have sugar in them they add sugar to the bowl yeah Wow dextrose dextrose right sugar sugar Howard Taft the president was 340 pounds and that was a long time like 340 how tall was he so I was trying to look up more information on that but it was all come I just loved come he just drank it hand me my daily gallon have come I'm ready to address the State of the Union but first I need my jizz you know Taz is a big hugger that was his thing my fellow Americans burp Kennedy same thing oops Kennedy was a little calm teacups Kennedy apparently was on all sorts of drugs including crystal meth they'd meth him up he was um he was in the meth yeah yeah Kennedy apparently had like some serious physical ailments and he was in he was bad traits is that true he was a big pill head he was in massive pain they said that in like it's like if he didn't get assassinated he would have never done two terms he would have been dead just from whatever the  was going on with him yeah oh we had some serious back problems and so he was such a young fit guy like he didn't look he didn't look he looked in shape not really he looked young but compared to most present anything he looked in shape there's a picture of look at look at that fat that walls looking I  what year was this no justice on this way nineteen no it's all right he's got he's got food in that hat maybe 1919 but well I bet it's booze right he was always yea serious booze that's so big that's crazy how big he was so easy our fattest president yeah who's our skinniest President Lincoln that tall skinny link is pretty goddamn skinny right he was a rail wiry how was it he doesn't look 340 that's what's funny those pictures make him look 250 show you this one Photoshop Photoshop it in 1929 this is his White House portrait oh yeah they skinned him are they skinned him up for that yeah they did they trimmed him up a little bit cuz it's a portrait cuz they made that chair look big it was a smart move on the artist yeah they they shrunk him up a little bit there yeah a little bit more regal like Obama may have been one of our skinny as he was funny he was skinny as he was fit even though he smoked cigarettes George Bush I guess was our most recent Bush was was not out of shape he wasn't just a big he wasn't a big guy Reagan was thin for an old guy he's same way as like in his 70s right James Madison was 5'4 and 100 pounds damn not even a real guy 5 for 100 that's not even a real good sake that's a fake number what year was that James Madison boy that's tiny five for a hundred pounds of pound grown man what did he eat presidential term 1809 to 1870 oh yeah people back then didn't have any food I think he averaged Hyper's probably five five five six when they were always just dodging Indians if you were smaller the arrows would go over your head reading it's a ducky just stand there Oh what do you think so that's enough money though I bet you if you if you had a sliding scale of the height of the presidents but there was a thing about the civil war where they said that the average soldier in the Civil War weighed 125 pounds because they were like seven sixteen seventeen year old there were kids right most of the soldiers were  like children yeah I'm sure well most of the soldiers today are young same thing we use 18 as a standard but back in the day there wasn't a number wow I wonder what the number was Google the average size of a soldier in the Civil War I'm pretty sure 125 pounds you know that that's so tiny I got a picture out there of Sinatra this is mug shot he weighed 125 pounds yeah he was he was a skinny tiny dude tiny tiny dude 5 8 143 the average yeah look I'm sorry I spoke too quick this was no yeah Civil War an average Civil War soldier was white native-born farmer Protestant single between 18 and 29 and he stood about 5 8 143 that's weird what I think it was smaller than that that also sounds very high 143 seems like a reasonable size for that time when there's no food but you're also talking about there wasn't like how could they have been that organized I'm sure people were just fighting who were around I'm sure people just join the ranks and they weren't like you got to go through the process they were like here's a gun and go and kill somebody do you think they didn't like measure their size I think I think they took anything they could get I think they were like this we need everyone we can get especially in the south menace south was for the south just all against they everybody wanted to join in the south and the north people were like I guess we'll you guys up what we have to what's this why - yeah well it was 12 told you look at little drummer boy common age was 19 holy oldest age was 80 you imagine you're 80 and you're you're in Gettysburg what are you doing man just go sit down oh 80 you have to fight man you want to keep that stupid flag flying dude the fact that they still bitch about it did you watch Sacha Baron Cohen's thing and I've heard some holy  of him getting this Georgia representative to be like Huck in the n-word out like 10 times saying why did he say it what was the cost you know it's Sasha Sasha finagles him into doing these fake PSA ads or whatever right of like anti-terrorism yeah would that be given I don't want to give away stocks and that scares one of the head riders over there who's Tom he was yeah he was he was he says it gets crazier oh dude it you could tell it down you could tell this is them just tipping you they're like a little something for you he says it gets really crazy at the last I was from from this this carrot the one character that's like a the Israeli guy yeah too good as that carrots great pull up a video of that character when he was talking the Second Amendment guy oh yeah like like making like cute guns for kids yeah they do they do ads for gonna oh but the character is so crazy this is most sugar in the Israeli commander tell the kid have safety gun and it's got big big plush doll on top they put like little plush dolls on kids guns and pull his mouth it shoots gun apparently they like those really hardcore Christians Second Amendment cars they love Israelis of course they love Israeli soldiers man this is why he decided to have this is really character this GOP lawmakers to enjoys giving endorse giving three-year-olds guns stuff Dan'l the stuffed animal surrounds the gun you're not gonna see any but see if you can get a video of him doing the character yeah see click that that's just gonna be the full trailer they won't show you yeah but now play it play it play play it no that's it that's it leave my next guest is a gun rights advocate who says the Bushmaster semi-auto rifle the type of rifle that Adam Lanza used to kill twenty children and six more adults is quite a blast to shoot with tons of fun some of them are much more cool than others be proud of what you said it's just a fact in America there have been a lot of shootings in the school and in the university what do believe we'll say is the reason of this in this solution well they blame it on guns the guns yes god yes sugar it is we start a program in Israel for kindergardens okay we train them from the age 16 down to the age three yeah well I think it would be a good idea we've been pushing something along this line for years but really haven't gotten any traction with that we were thinking seventh or eighth grade you're talking much younger than that my son was in the very first program may he rest in peace quite developed Michael dodges where you you you feel guilty about doing something wrong that's developing that you're learning right and wrong if they don't haven't developed that yet they could be very effective soldiers this year in our yes state government they had a bill put in that would have made it illegal for someone four years old to 12 years old have access to a gun we we kill we killed the bill they try to stop four-year-old children from having access to guns yes yes what is the logic that these people come up with they just think the children can't hear them what payables who are real experts at what they are doing not playable to a wreckless yeah and we don't teach two-year-olds because they call it the terrible tools for days I would like you to only do is video they're going to show you yeah you should folks watch that but what's really crazy is the makeup man like look at the makeup that he's wearing man he doesn't he does one where he's like an NPR type of cat and he goes to Kingman Arizona and he tries to build a mosque and they the nisshin that comes out of their mouth the fact they sign off on it the one who knows there's blacks in this town and we don't they don't belong here either and the guys and you know of course he makes a joke and then he goes know what I'm saying telling you is we tolerate them we tolerate the blacks it likes it and it sits in the room for a second you're like good God these are real people that exist yeah they they tolerate the black it's a great great name of show - this is America new Mossberg look at the NPR guy with the wooden beads around his neck he nailed it his intro was hilarious cuz he goes I'm a self-hating white man oh please play that video try to find that video it's really funny and then you and he's a genius he he lays us who wants to see an investment of 385 million dollars guess what you guys are gonna get it I'm not sure to tell you the examples from chosen as the location of a brand-new state-of-the-art mosque I know some of you thinking okay this is just another typical mosque this guy's is going to be the world's largest mosque outside of the Middle East just the word alone scares you to me when I hear the word mosque I think of terrorism this guy sir sir in kingman yes there is how your town will become the whole thing for tours character the characters this guy right there that guy did this toothless dude that was just on him too but the other dude he's the one that's like the  blacks we tolerate it say we have to we do it because we have to it's look at his shoes ready with the pre outfit this is a mane every detail of every character he does the clothing is my for some of the funniest it's real specific what's hilarious is he kind of had to do this because everybody knew what he looked like that well couldn't just do Bora true and just do Ali G except for people in these he you know when someone goes someone will notice you he's famous not in those worlds they don't they if he'd had no makeup on nobody in Kingman who Sacha Baron Cohen is do you know I mean the crazy thing is these put people must have had to sign releases yeah and I did hidden cameras so I know how that works two ways there's money which is always the best way and you make him sign before mm-hmm that's that's it there's there's two drawers the way yeah you make him sign you know we're gonna be featuring you on this a we did this bit Ian Edwards and I did this bit for a Comedy Central for the show that never went I don't know if I've ever told you this but we this bit was so fun to do we made a thing called melon and Mayo mayonnaise mayonnaise that she'd that made you darker real and we put food coloring in Mayo but we introduced it as new Brown Mayo it's a new generation of Mayo and so we got people in this test group we know like real people in a real test group that go and take tests all the time and they emanate sample we put them in a room we made them eat the sandwiches just  Mayo was male they eat the sandwiches all these white people eat the sandwiches and then when they're done we send in this black dude Al and she shows them a video and it was a pre-taped video basically of white people confessionals who have turned we've you know we photoshopped them to have turned more Brown to turn start to turn black oh my and we're like in three to five weeks you start to see results you start to see cultural results mental results you know getting your getting more black by culture you're getting smarter black you're getting cooler black in your neighborhood to your friends like their face it their face were perfect if we didn't have any volume Yuda laughed everyone's like wait a minute no one said we'd be black we'd be turning black I mean they lost their minds people got so scared it was amazing that bit was a date MTV never I mean comics I'll never air to any of them where is it Comedy Central probly hasn't a vault they threw away oh my god yeah that that was one of our favorite bits that we that made us laugh so hard their faces that one woman though one woman to her credit she goes you know people are freaking out and the room people starting yelling at him and they're like this is I'm gonna show you I'm gonna and he's black and he said wipe no I'm gonna sue your ass if I'm black it's like the funny to watch him go it's not as bad as you're making it out to be I mean I was bi was born black and I'm liking it a lot and one woman goes you know it's disturbing cuz it's shocking just to spring this on me but I don't um I'm not scared I could take on being black I'll just let's let's we'll see what happens I mean she was like we'll just I'll just live we'll just figure this out I guess I mean it was insane that they bought into it but also that that's how we did it we  made him sign beforehand and then you paid him out and when it's over we broke him off more money so they wouldn't say no because they still have the legal right to be like I'm pulling that or you pull it or I'm suing you so once it was over did they understand that it was for Comedy Central after after everything was said and done and then did they laugh a few did not laugh you laughed a few people or not but that was one of my favorite things Mellon and mayo and man did it work like a charm people were like this mayonnaise is delicious it was Hellmann's or whatever with a little brown dye in it it's unconventional but I really like this is so stupid that's so funny yeah that was a funny bit man they kill her I murdered a bit seeing people think they're about to turn black and they panic and the black guys enter that was the best part we put a you know owls up there Ruffolo this guy named Al Scheer he's a great improv her and he's in a room filled with  white people telling him they don't want to go black oh my god it was a fun bit so he was saying that he used to be white no no he's saying it's he he just was the the representative for the company Brian we loved the idea we had images and video of people who had turned black people who had turned black exactly right meet the food first then we showed them that we said it was a commercial cuz that was whole thing is like a new commercial campaign for him for whatever fake mayonnaise company we made up and then we had said here's the commercial we're gonna run along with it what do you guys think and we played the course they were supposed to rate the commercial that's they doing those test groups you know [Music] now what did Comedy Central why did they not do that you know what's so funny is they they we overshot this pilot because I think they wanted way more bits for the sketch show and I just don't love things they said they couldn't they didn't want to air they couldn't air there's a few things that were just he did some great bits I just think Comedy Central legal department was just having a trouble with it because he he was balls out he we did this thing called gangster Gardner where we would win to bel-air where he just started like clipping people's lawns and planting trees with a group of Mexican dudes and they were like looked like they were thug the out and these white dudes would come out like what are you what are you doing in my yard like we plant trees we trying to get this looking nice and these white dudes are like no I don't want he's like we landscaping and then he was hand he would hand them bills he'd be like yeah that's 50 bucks 50 bucks for that Bush and these dudes were like I'm not giving you MA you kids you can't just like renegade do my lawn he's like that's how we make money out here these days in bel-air it was like we got in that was a tough day because everyone's like I'm gonna show you I'm gonna sue every in that truck I mean it was like I mean there were fun days but a lot of days in that was like going through you just feel people's of like anger Bob bubbling over and are gonna murder somebody but al was ruthless he didn't give a fighting of a you had to be a certain type of person he would go do any bit he would go do any bit he loved in the racial was always his favorite wasn't making white people feel uncomfortable to do a hidden-camera show you got to be a different kind of person yeah it's a beastly thing I you got to be a up you got to be up and he was good but yeah Ian Ian and I and another person wrote a bunch of those weird stupid it's got to be really hard to do something like that today which is the interesting thing about the Sarah Sarah Beth is Sarah Sacha Baron Cohen thing oh yeah he says he like showtimes taking some chances yeah but you know what they took a chance because he is such a good horse to bet on and look at on that just on yet youtube clip that's not even a showtime clip that was somebody else 150,000 views on just a clip and it's just really recent yeah just they just put it out yeah I mean his they're circulating all over the Internet it's it will just get way more traction as time goes on cuz it's so fun yeah he's a killer got a lot of free PR to buy all the politicians saying that like they'll Boyd before they even put out the shows they're all like we got duped I got duped by oh my god - Sarah Palin they all came out we're like they me over that and then they had a billboard that somebody said he was doing stolen valor did you see that yeah what was that about because he said that he was an injured soldier and X right there was an ad for him as a neck soldier or something and so that got a ton of press a ton of press wasn't it the Sarah Palin one no wasn't I don't know you'd have to look it up I don't remember which one it was I think it was a Sarah Palin one he was a disabled veteran but they were saying you write Stolen Valor Stolen Valor yeah they're trying anything to discredit it well but if but it's complet it's a comedy series it's a sketch comedy series you tell me a sketch character can't play whatever they want I mean that's that's what it is that's it that's like people getting mad say no I mean if it's a if you can play a character and if you can play a war hero in a film why can you play the opposite like born on the 4th of July Tom Cruise okay what's so funny I think the character he has we used that as the the alt-right type guy oh yeah yeah saying is a bunch of stuff like that and see show time countered that claim here with the short time counter Sacha Baron Cohen stolen valor blame yeah they counted well because they because it was made public it's a long statement about it but widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Reddick junior PhD performer what does the counter I think they explained what happened they tore said that they didn't misrepresent themselves they probably thought he was someone really ridic was asked by the senator he was disabled and he stated that he is and uses a mobility scooter to conserve energy and addition burn coal never presented himself as a veteran in the US military former Alaska governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview okay so there you go okay scroll down a little bit lower says on Monday a conservative street artist replaced a billboard near CBS television yeah city complex in Los Angeles with a doctored image of Cohen in a wheelchair wearing an army t-shirt the new billboard was capped captioned Sacha Baron Cohen walks away with a hit and a touch of stolen valor a touch yeah he's trying to say that it's a slight it's a slight at the at the truth yeah okay but how dare you mock those who have fought and served our country truly sick mock politicians and innocent personalities all you want mmm the delicate balance this is a Palin said Palin wrote on face respect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen she's so stupid and middle-class Americans  you you're disrespectful to yeah see that's that's that's the disrespect but but just that that trick she's just trying to game the system but I say and middle-class Americans just get as many people in there as you can pervy Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions foreign commentaries what does that mean under the guise of she's so dumb did you imagine that lady almost became our vice president but you what what the  were they thinking McCain could have won yeah yeah he could have won yeah she was the anchor that sunk that bomb but the idea that they thought that was a good idea well she was a pawn man she was such an easy pawn they I don't think so I think she was I think she was used as this little this good-looking cute item a female this Middle American gun shoot not she was a pawn I think she was a play and it went too far it was almost like they didn't know what they had gotten himself into they I think they thought that was a could have been the it's one of those angry like that could have been brilliant or the dumbest on earth she was the governor of Alaska right they figured hey she's a good-looking woman she's the governor of a state she's a mom she shoots gun disabled child she had all the things that was like wow what a good pee our push yeah it was a disabled child while she was running I'm almost positive right she gave birth like almost like while she was no no I think she already had had a disabled child I think she had had a disabled kid and her her father's home was a veteran right or right and it so she had all these things lined up that were like perfect for America's so crazy it was so when they started interviewing her so what what newspapers do you read oh all of them all of them I can see Russia from my front porch ii see russia I look right across I see Russia from my porch I mean that dang those were like sound bites for for America to be like she but Trump does the same things he just does it in it you know no no he does I heard about that again the other day because listening to the it's called the satire paradox of revisionist history Malcolm Gladwell and they were talking about this the Sarah Palin incident and Tina Fey actually said that and everyone thinks that Sarah Palin actually said it it came from the SNL spoof and completely got attributed to her and she also ruined that whole thing that she could see it from her front porch yeah that was from a sketch that's not what she did say something about she said something about Russia being there her neighbor yeah she did say something about Russia being close like they're gonna come through Alaska she did say something preposterous like that if Russia came they would go through her right snows which isn't the best place to not be looking things up but like they have the article about it and says that this came from an SNL spoke a way instead of googling that just Google Palin's comment on being close to Russia right she said somewhat I googled I googled Sarah Palin Russia from my house and yep no no no no not that steam and Russia from my house say it Palin on Russia being close to Alaska she did say something she didn't say something that's that ridiculous yeah yeah it wasn't a toy said something ridiculous enough that people were like what what are you saying there and that's where through your name you got the influence to make that sketch they're gonna fly in jets dummy take three they're gonna walk right across taking it well here's what's Alaska but I think she but I think that was just you know I suppose she tweeted remember I can keep an eye on them from here yeah right yes her being like this basically that's the statement but also but I think this comes on the heels of her publicly during at press at some point had said something about it it was it this is kind of like how when Trump says something once he repeats it over and over like if you've watched those clips he'll say the same the same anecdote because it it starts to drain the swamp wasn't once I was a thousand times I talked to Tom Arnold last night I know Tom Arnold was backstage he's got the Trump tapes he said we got a gang it tapes he said there's some crazy yeah I can't I don't want to disclose anything yeah he he said there is a yeah yeah he said there's a tape of him saying the hard n-word really well I mean repeated I just made you a face like I was surprised at that for some reason he said it's crazy he said the the tapes are crazy and where's he putting him out again its vice vice yeah and he said people are turning on him left and right because he doesn't have loyalty to those people that are around him so apparently those people are turning on him left and right and testifying and and you know giving up evidence and information like everybody realizes is the sinking ship yeah we were talking last night we're like dude it's only a year in yeah one  year one year this guy's got three more years this yesterday about the call that Cohen has the tape and he said that Trump knew about it oh yeah and that's suppose that proves the collusion yeah so yeah yeah yeah yeah it does not work what does that mean the truck did know about the meeting with Russia then an offended collusion is is is proof proven yeah then and then it can be proud he can be prosecuted can he be okay as a sitting president yeah right if colluding I think you have to be impeached before you can be so they'd like well yeah you yeah rankly isn't present sure are we comfortable with President pence no way is that happen do they just Tim can we have another election do it again can we do it again we could I mean I don't know if attack it obviously hasn't happened but I don't know if Congress can call an emergency election well see this is the thing Hillary has been ramping the publicity lately big-time almost like she's ready to get back in there yeah well because she recognized because there's so much going on to try to people are trying to bury him dude pence would be scary to me man that she's scary he's not a good I agree candy but I'm saying second in line is him in it that does freak me out too there's gotta be a good Democrat out there yeah where it's not a compromised completely corrupt person has been embedded in the system forever and might have killed a bunch ruble I think everyone that you would want to run wouldn't I think you're right I think that's how I always feel and I'm like oh you know would be great that's like I'm not running what a nightmare gig 200 grand a year to be to be they make more than that now what is it 250 these are 400 whatever before taxes yeah what Trump won't pay yeah man it's a it's a terrible job not a terrible job an awful really it should be a job that many many many people do and you know you one persons involved in the economy ecology environment everything military should you play God you're playing gods you have to puppeteer everything that doesn't make sense he wouldn't even work if you had a village yeah and that would cut that would collapse yeah there's one farmer you had allegiance to would get mad yeah you had to control all the crops you had to control all the weapons you gotta control although all the laws what the  yeah get out of control at even a micro level the weird thing is while he's president can he start pardoning people well had didn't he didn't he decides to pardon a bunch of people while he's president if he does that what is it still good if they put him in jail if he pardons while he's in office then they're that then they're scot-free but are you saying after yeah yeah I don't know like if he goes to jail yeah I don't know pardon people already Harry pardon yeah yeah he has pardoned a bunch of people are dancing which is like yeah that's not really gonna help Cat Stevens still not pardoned man peace train still not yea dinesh d'souza right he part did he pardoned Cat Stevens no no I'm saying that but what does Cat Stevens and trouble or you remember this this was years and years ago Cat Stevens like Clinton like said now he's a part of Muslim faith and he left the United States and now but he also wanted death for Salman Rushdie Salman Rushdie right and they wouldn't let him back in United States they took away they took away his entry right I don't even know if he's here now it does concerts in Mexico people go down to Mexico to watch a Cat Stevens concert yeah it's the only way you can get them down in Cabo is that true look it up if Cat Stevens is allowed back in the United States I don't think so where let's look up Cat Stevens tour dates because he went I'm being followed by a moon we'll go see him in Tijuana he's playing the border tour could you imagine if we went to see him that'd be  fun maybe a fun piece didn't know events currently booked yeah he's having a tough time I think he did it because he needed some money Ella told us he didn't have his publishing rights or something like that he lost money so he went on a tour try to get some checks got some chatter and then went back to the mosque when all that cheddar bought some hummus pita pita you guys and you know that's one thing that an artist can do that's a musician that a comic can't do like a musician can go back and do all their old hits yep and still rake it in the mean the Beach Boys they're not they could still go on tour and then a drop of a hat and make a ton of money no yeah well they also they also bands now reconvene with new members and they make they still do that  I mean the dead tour with John Mayer then they're big figures here yeah John Mayer the John Mayer handsome guy that hangs out with Dave Chappelle bro he tours with the dead he tours with Ian's he's saying yes get the where to got on my life man get the and dad cause he wants hippie and deadheads love it no I got a couple friends that are dead heads and I never was into the dead but they were like it's there was skeptic there were skeptics at the beginning they're in love with that guy cuz they like he does it right man he pays homage the right way he's god it's insane John it your body's a wonderland he's playing deaths [Laughter] that's the world world can't get any more absurd no we can't what's here what does it say about cat he played some contracts in America in the last couple he did he's a lot back recently uh who who let him back in on a bomb of the Muslim the Muslim hope that Canyon when the New Yorker about his comeback last year so last year he got bad luck back in yeah Wow maybe a couple years ago so was before Trump so it was probably one of Obama's last moved in office sure sure let him back in come on him that Donald we got to go we got to go to I Castillo no no II gotta go supporting had so was within a year maybe he won't come back now that Trump's president I mean for money he'll go anywhere I'm sure he was here last year maybe is with us the last that's the last tour was last year yeah he's saying now the trumpets around he probably won't come back that's so funny where was he living did it say where he was this doesn't say it specifically yeah he was on the news on the lamp that cat was gone yeah he's in live ears I'm sure if I can hold up in a compound at a cave and what a weird move huh a guy who sings he's like really Pete he's off he's trained the whole was out of picking up people from coast to coast of the peace train well there's people to believe that Islam is the religion of peace totally the sudden a lot of people believe in that so maybe he thinks he's on the path to peace and I think Islam is probably like every other religion right there's factions of Christianity that are wonderful people sure really calm sweet and loving and they get a lot out of it and then there's people that are just loons and maniacs serpent handlers yeah man those people those Christians those are my favorite Christians the ones with the snake protect me from the serpent kiss the snake kiss the snake my my whole family's been serpent handlers since we was shredder we've been apart of the serpent culture serpent or serpent people and they used poisonous snakes - oh yeah wasn't there a documentary on serpent handlers I feel like there's a documentary that I have on my cue I have so much I'm supposed to watch the student I'm so behind I'm I gotta walk away I'm only in wild wild country I'm only on Episode four it's good but it's let's slow it but the big chunks are slow where you're like people say that it could have been done in three could've easily there's a lot of drag out that you're like didn't we go over this already but that's just them being like Netflix one six I want six you want 6x yeah Netflix they don't need more money they own Hollywood do I can't get out xxx comedy specials just from Just for Laughs that's another thing that bill sent me they can't even they won't even sniff one of my fart I can't even  get near them for some reason Netflix wants nothing to do with me yeah I don't know what the they're thing is with me maybe I did something wrong years ago they're doing putting out so many specials I'm like how come I can't get anything to do with you I don't know they probably haven't seen you you know the thing is man yeah nobody can keep up ya know I think there's too much going on the only thing keep up no no they have enough people I really don't I mean I feel like there's so much comedy going on right now I know you've you ever seen more stand-up never in my life it's it's overwhelming yeah there's a lot more  comedy being put out than I've ever seen or not comedy in terms of my opinion in terms of like just just comedy for the sake now of comedy that I'm like this isn't the well-put-together special people didn't take time for some of these things they're pumping them out yeah there's definitely that too there's people that have taken advantage of an opportunity right somebody offers you a shitload of money and you don't really have a set ready they just want to do that that's the one thing that happens with people when they start doing movies when you start doing movies you're on the set 16 hours a day you don't really have enough time to write and you're definitely not performing every no way that is a crazy move to be doing all these films and then do an hour special when you barely really yeah they can do 30 and they're pushing 30 on fun in between maybe even 30 men because not even 30 look like a real rock and Sock'em robots 30 no really no it's probably not a back-to-back 30 like bang bang bang bang no yeah it's more thin than that there's a lot of thin out there Louis said this to me once backstage and I think he's right he's like in order to do comedy to really do it you can't do anything else I mean that's really that's probably the only way to be the best at it was you could do it you could do it good but to be at your best you really can't be doing anything else I believe that I believe that wholeheartedly yeah I mean you think you a podcast cause podcasts just talking yeah this how this is working out for working out at comedy to do a special podcasting and comedic relationships and uh still moving in whatever realm that is for comedy if it's all branching for it but other things acting that takes totally away from it yeah cuz when I go do acting I'm totally disconnected yeah comedy loses its breath for a while well what about when you were doing acting on I'm dying up here I performed almost every night right I didn't give a  I was burning the candle at both ends I didn't care because you had to I love cuz i know cuz i also know that i don't want to lose steps i'm like i don't want to lose steps yeah I care about acting not as much as I care about stand-up yeah you care about it like yeah it's cool I like it a lot it's not your thing no I'm in love with standa yeah acting is like yeah I like it I like it a lot it's very rewarding I'm not I'm not and I'm not disrespecting the art I'm just saying it doesn't do the same thing for me that stand-up does right but what but if I don't go out at night and try to make sure I'm on booking shows late I have to do you Lou you definitely get disconnected people and then people who do it know who they are they know when it happens sure the new sitcoms to the sitcoms will do it to you too because you're on set they killed it for me man when I was on news radio there was a stretch where I was doing set I was doing standing for a couple of years where I was when writing any jokes just doing the same and I was getting disconnected with the jokes yeah and I was starting a bomb and then you hate him you hate the material who would you talk to Jeff to a couple days ago in Garland you know he does it he just goes and wings it all the time yeah because he loved he doesn't want to cuz he's on set all day yeah so I don't know where he's finding time to write stuff anyway cuz Jeff's like no I just like to have fun because he doesn't he doesn't have any time he's he's doing 50 things at once he doesn't have time to sit down and go alright let me try to pump out some new material he's not on a plane on the road to shows - yeah he's on to hit hit shows isn't it funny to saying that he doesn't want to do 15-minute sets I just do like an hour on Friday and yeah I disagree with the two I didn't understand it when he said it's a waste of my time to leave the house the first thing I said I'm in my kitchen listening to it and it's he's go I'm not gonna leave my house for 15 minutes ago  Jo sitting right across you he leaves his house for 15 minutes I did yeah no the you talking about yeah I I think it's different I think it's just a different breed of certain people are like that that they're like nah to maximize that time and only do it at this chunk but certain people you meet off if I that is the maximizing of the chunk of being like if it's just 15 I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure the 15 is he doesn't have bits though not the same way no she's a funny guy Braves and stalks is improv and improv yeah but he doesn't have like a chunk on lava lamps and it's on it on wristwatches you know right he doesn't have that like I'm gonna open up with lava lamps that's not listen he does well no like he did a Fallon set a couple years ago maybe he was a year ago two years ago and it was all about lotion at the airport and that was like a bit that was the first time I'd seen Jeff do it because I you know again again this is obviously no disrespect to Jeff I like Jeff Jeff's a great guy to me but what he does is yeah it's that it's much more like freeform yeah on Fallon he did like a bit I was like oh that's like a bit and I Jeff doesn't really do bits mmm yeah it doesn't chunk out bits he's like if he finds a bit it'll be great you know what I mean but he usually just  around I watched him in Atlanta we were both playing Atlanta at the same time he was just he was on like one of the other comics it was it was hysterical he was just around the other convict one of the other comics I went on before but he'd that took up 15 minutes of him just around yeah and then got into like talking to them well he's loose oh so no I mean one of the funny things that he said was that he's so comfortable with just being funny oh and I have to tell Andrew Dice Clay he was not disrespecting you dice dice went on this whole rant about fat Jeff giving him a hard time yeah he thinks because Garland was saying that it was Rick Rubin's idea to do the day the laughter died right at dice is like no is my and I do I  I very upset he's very happy did he get really mad yeah yeah yeah yeah the ice gets mad like that that's so strange I know he got I know he got I know there was all sorts of dice Sebastian weird strange be yeah what's what happened there I don't know dude it was like Sebastian he's dice had said something online I guess on Instagram about Sebastian stealing his act or doing his emulating him or something he was going after Sebastian for some reason Sebastian is very original he's him no-one is Sebastian but that's who he is well I think Sebastian used to open up her hammer right years and years and years ago is I'm if I'm not wrong people Frank you're right and I think maybe dice felt like he's not giving him his due yeah it's like dice saying like I  raised you and you're not even gonna kiss the ring a little bit Sebastian's first of all a grown-ass man who's built his own career completely on his own right and brilliantly so he does know anybody wasn't it that he didn't talk about dice in his book perhaps that's probably the crux of it I think that's it's layers for the for old friendships like that that have gone sour maybe it's layers yeah it's that it's why don't you go to my dinner party you know I mean it's  it's all wind up when you get a guy opening for you for years and then he's smashing it yeah that's got to feel weird yeah it's got a feel it's it's got a feel we I'm envious of what Sebastian's done and because Sebastian can kind of go anywhere yeah he does anything but but I mean he's like he's really successful but he's also like his weird kind of famous well he could like go to the movies he's famous restaurants famous he's famous but he sells out tickets yeah like he's mega famous well we talked about this when I was in Vegas I walked by Gaffigan it was playing with one of the see it one of the arenas there and had a billboard up that said you know Jim Gaffigan 2829 whatever and I was saying to the comic that I was with I was like isn't that funny that like if Gavin was just walking through the casino there's a good chance a lot of people just wouldn't see him see him do you know they might they might but in that  arena sold out yeah five shows sold out doesn't like unmistakeably famous and stand up yeah but he's the kind of guy that could go to Ralph's and you'd be like someone would go maybe he's now I don't know do you don't I mean like your son but hey hot pockets hot pockets ya know carry your selfie broke my selfie broke it's fine man I like going I like going with you to watch how people ask you for selfies my favorite thing is when I'm with Joe and somebody asked me if they can take a picture of Joe that's the don't look at me if we're talking hey do you mind to me I'm not his head why are you asking me that's the that's so annoying to me don't look at me dude if you want to converse with a grown man do it and not your like through line to get to Joe Gaffigan is doing an interesting thing he decided to on his own to not put his special on Netflix yeah why was a conscious decision because he felt like there's so many digital platforms on he was gonna offer him on all the other platforms so he's got it on Amazon's got it on Hulu he's got it everywhere where the see that find out the places Gaffigan put out his special on I've seen the Billboard and it mentioned is that on the bottom it says like available on all platinum Netflix yeah I get that he wants to he stood out his whole career as being a clean you know I mean like he I think this is another way of him being like I'm also not grouped like that as well it's um I think that he made the decision was that there was just so many other platforms available that he didn't want to limit it to Netflix and be one of the many on Netflix already you know I mean I mean it might be actually a smarter more lucrative move although the access that people have probably isn't as good I just think Netflix is a global brand that's the so giant huge it's but it's the thing yeah but if you have it on YouTube YouTube is probably bigger than anything right more people watch there's a YouTube has a bigger reach but there's way more content on YouTube right but here's the other thing who's watching YouTube on television at home the new generator is a lot of kids that are do because now YouTube TV is like a big thing right but how many in comparison to watch Netflix I'm sure yes Netflix Netflix owns that ass I would think about the mobile though how many people watching Netflix on their phone a lot I think there's well when I just did my special they said half the people it is unreal you tube too yeah half people phone what Netflix watch it on their phone well look at it like this I've never pulled up YouTube on my computer I mean I if I rarely I'm saying I put on my phone every day there's something on my phone that I'm looking up on YouTube yeah that's true always always always always on the phone yeah and if I'm at the house if I have watching something on my phone and I'll flick it to my you know my Apple TV or whatever yeah he put it in movie theaters for a day - that's cool really cool move Wow move well how much long is it 70 minutes that seems like annoying to go to the movies for 70 minutes yeah however you have an opening act you yeah he's got a warm-up guy that just stands up there I want a 90-minute show come on when we were backstage last night we were like you know cuz we had a lot of guys on the show last night though yeah show well like this show is gonna go long we're like Scorsese movies at three hours try match the Scorsese movie that that main room needs a new AC unit though I was me wet was drenched I was soaked throughout it sweat when you gave me a hug when I brought you on I didn't want to hug you cuz my shirt was stuck to my body I mean mine was just like what minutes I was totally drenched by the time I got off so yeah you fix it well they are struggling with money over there money it's a muddy pit isn't it crazy that that place used to be struggling for money and now they just they sold out two shows in the main room yesterday showing the Oh our show in the belly there was just people constantly running through that place yeah every room was sold out there's not a club like that on the planet Earth nope doesn't exist well that's what the dude who runs the social media was saying last night he was like you got to understand like just for Laughs is going on right now this has a way better lineup yeah and when just for laughs used to go on at the store it was like ghost town ghost town it was like no comics were in town anymore audience people weren't even coming out now just relax you wouldn't even know what's happening yeah there's still so many bangers in town it doesn't even matter it's just a weird time weird time for Stan the best time it's poppin' ya know what you know I wonder what is the I mean there's so many different it's you can't really have one factor there's not just one factor but these the Internet for sure is the underlying machine there's like more people have access to stand up comedy through YouTube and all these different ways and Netflix and then on top of that it's podcast like comics get together and people those podcasts become a part of people's lives while Kaylee lives there drive and then on top of that the podcasts start talking about the store like everyone's talked to store the Solarize tour and because you go to the Laugh Factory tonight ya hear crickets someone there tumbleweeds it's just different cuz the laughs actor doesn't have this same kind of talk that comics talk about the store the store is romanticized by comedians it's just like that it's that spot I mean when you look at the go look at the Instagram before the Comedy Store every time they put a lineup read almost every single comment will have someone go man I wish I didn't live in XYZ I would kill to be there it's crazy and it's Wednesday it's Wednesday night you know Thursday night and they're like dude if I could pay for a flight I would do it right now if I could afford it I would kill we have this virtual reality thing the HTC vive you put the headphones on you ever seen that yeah the headset you put the goggles on ear plug they're gonna do stand-up in that thing a hundred percent 100 percent there's no doubt been thinking about that a lot lately when you put that on and you feel like you're in the room with that like that would be an amazing way to broadcast and up into your living room  yeah you could be at the store that's where on your couch just standing up I might even be better it might be kind of cooler yeah they'd actually be in there not cool it'll be in there no being there's always gonna be cooler but cool in a unique different way well it's an I think it's just another ad right like to me you're always gonna want live performance cuz we always have in the history of humanity we love watching performance live yeah and that's just another way for people to access who physically can't get there yeah it's always gonna be sexier to be there because you feel like you're a part of it but to actually be someone in there in the virtual world that will be just as I mean for people that can't physically be here I think that's just that's this close as you can get that's the best you can get when you're there it's live you know it's just a different kind of thing know stand up to me on tape has ever been as funny as it is live no no no no have fun even close you the best you can hope on a television show so you just kind of capture a feel of it when you're doing a special right for television what is this this is as close as they're getting right now holy oh this is like a virtual audience and like a almost like fake movie theater type situation and you're all watching the screen together Wow I can look around and see people any waters in the World Cup this was for the World Cup Wow to start with what that's so you sit down and you feel like you're in awesome seats at the World Cup wow this is happening at the same time that a couple websites are starting what they're calling watch parties where you watch videos I know my friends together online at the same time and this is the actual World Cup this was for the World Cup live yeah so you actually watched a real game with those goggles on yeah that's like your occupation amazing and you're in the third row look how good that looks too and then look you get the Hard Rock ad so they can put ads up well that's where they're gonna start making all their money damn that looks amazing because like you know you've seen a lot of sporting events they use green screen on their ads scrolls you know somewhere they can change for television I mean that'll just be that to be the same thing dude how dope would that be for UFC fights the other than HTC vive want wasn't the UFC do that call them up they do do experimental things all the time right that they try out and they don't always use them yes yes but that seems like the best one yes God's on and that way you could be in the cage you put a camera on the guy was a referee with the ref yeah Reb cam to shoulder cam some some hip cams put cams all over them cam circle make him a camera yeah make the ref okay I used to do that in Pride and pry these two GoPro rosea and you would be able to see it from the ref cam but those are just you'd have to get really good cameras they used to be shitty they're pretty goddamn good now no I mean for VR they got to be really good cameras right don't they go pro so they can get it out I mean it I think they could probably could do it I bet someone could pull this our GoPros always with that fisheye lens so yeah you gotta use some software to not have that if you would because they're built like that they're built with the fisheye on always why do they do that just for perspective angle field of view yeah because yeah cuz I was originally intended for extreme sports and so like that that's always the best view in every extreme sport is the fisheye looked great I think you're trying to recreate your eyes yeah like you have on you know you have a hundred and eighty degree or prime more than yeah but it's not all distorted that's the problem everything's gets all stretched out and weird at the edge nology of class I don't think anyone's figured out that yet mom too hard you know but that's why that's why they're not like that like what 4k is is inching towards of live brought up live broadcast in 4k is crazy they say 4k is more clear than the human eye can see there's elements to it that are clearer than what human eye can actually see and they're going higher than 4k men yeah man what does it do and no I think I slept an 8k cameras what is that camera that you're getting that phone the red phone the red goddamn I always forget the name of it but it's a Reds so it's a cell phone like with the red the camera the red text company red made a phone and explained read that it's like a super-high-end camera the fairy movies with these for all high-end things like I think they base started like $20,000 or something like that that's just that's not even the lens that's just the physical hammer itself and the antibiotic at five thousand dollar battery or not really but so it gets really expensive but anyway so this is supposed to be like a modular piece that's supposed to work with some systems they have coming in the future mmm this like the base of the of the phone might connect to a camera or it might connect to a series of other things it might replace I think they actually said this has two cameras on the back so anyway the other cool part of it is the display is holographic which no one's actually seen yet because it's a new technology like playback can be weren't they supposed to release his phone over a year ago they showed it a year ago and when did you buy it been on pre-order I think I bought it last about a year what did they click before how much were that's the same price as I finally 1200 bucks okay I said to prepay it yeah you'd give me 1,200 bucks so they can advance the technology they needed the money so yeah we all pay and mistrusting red because it's not you know it's a bride by night right yeah but they're also getting I'm sure tons of VC investors to keep pumping money to keep that going there that's the kind of thing that the technology is so far  ahead they're trying hard to get the hardware to a place where it works when is it supposed to come out I'm supposed to be shipped next month some people like there might be the testers I'd imagine some magical day like they're not gonna tell you but like August 8th for instance well August 9th is when the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 comes and that's probably a company dad's coming out now apparently is gonna have the most storage of any phone the biggest battery it's gonna four thousand milliamp battery it's gonna supposed to have insane cameras this is like Samsung's last hurrah with the note if the note doesn't work this time they're just gonna stick with the galaxies the galaxy s 9 did not do well didn't sell well but it was an amazing phone but it was too close to the galaxy s 8 it wasn't much different it was just like a an incremental step better as opposed to like the iPhone 10 is kind of way better than the iPhone 7 you know the seven and eight it's just like the shape is better the fact that all it has is this little tiny little notch at the top it's all screen it's a pretty dope cam I don't know who I don't know who was talking about it I think it was maybe a comic but they were like man if Steve Jobs was alive that would have never been up there that knotch yeah it's like he was he was such a meticulous dude well it's Huawei has an amazing phone called the mate car or the p20 pro this is the Huawei's the company that Trump is keeping from selling cell phone oh you knighted States and there was an article here I'll send it to Jaime there was an article that we were talking about this yesterday with dr. Deborah so and then there's an article on I think it's on B G R here I'll send you this vehicle right now but they were saying there's no reason why they shouldn't have this phone for sale like there's some weirdness going on but this this one Porsche design made their own version of it Porsche design made a mate 10 RS they caught like a rally sport like their brand like ours like my gt3 yeah RS and they they took away the notch like that notch like we're just gonna have a thin bezel on the top and one on the bottom you can have a notch no Porsche designs like nope but that's what I feel about with that guy I got mad at a guy at Apple and I said I said they me over on an appointment or something I was being a dick and I go you know if that guy was alive this company would still be doing better and he was like okay that's mean and I was like I'm just saying yeah they took a tank when that guy died it's definitely someone sold down their laptops or dog dog they're so bad that they're getting class-action lawsuits about the keyboards up hot new smartphone Trump tried to ban drop to its lowest price ever on Amazon but this is the problem is it's the best camera in any smartphone it's three cameras on the back it's amazing forty megapixel camera holy but the problem is it won't work on all bands in the United States because it's European design it's not it's not built for this and it's only it's only GSM so you can have to use it on 18 t mobile you can buy one you buy one for 800 bucks but it's supposed to be the and the the screens amazing you got to be able to jailbreak and manipulate those phones and make them easier to you know because they're not designed for the same Bansi it says right there you could buy it right now 795 bucks but the thing is it's just I don't think it works exactly the same I think if you have an 18 t phone well see that's a SIM factory unlocked so you can use any international sim sim on those yeah but the problem is the radio the frequencies that it picks up it doesn't pick up the same all the same bands that's not like 18 t has or t-mobile has does not work with Sprint Verizon US Cellular and other CMA camera those are CDMA because it's a GSM right but the the thing they're saying is though even if you get a GSM network like AT&T or I'm gonna have to ask one of the dudes that I know like Lewis from unbox therapy or Flossie Carter those guys that do those videos they would know 40 megapixel camera my team I think my first digital camera that I ever had was like five I think mine was one think I was like that's all  bad it was yeah whose bullet but back then I remember being like Crispus look at these crisp photos that point I was trying to make yesterday with the Wi-Fi like that without making a phone call and dialing the numbers there are so many other ways you could communicate with the people you need to communicate with and still make a phone call yeah that points not valid because the place is where you can use that Wi-Fi you also get signal that you could use that phone on the real issue is in the places where signal sketchy like weird rural areas I from Mississippi tweeted me in cities been doing it for years so what he has no cell service just Wi-Fi a Wi-Fi phone it gets around he's like I you could probably do it better in larger cities than I do in Mississippi but I've been doing it for a long time right but so he's going off of like Starbucks so Wi-Fi what's he doing or your house like all the places you go to I did that in Japan but when you're in your car driving down a rural road this is the point you're not going to get a service no you're not going to get Wi-Fi and you're not going to get cell phone service but with AT&T or t-mobile they would have some service in these weird areas that's the only place where these phones to be a problem is the weird areas yeah time spots yeah in LA it would work fine yeah yeah and those weird areas then like that there's more problems than just not being effective means in weird area exactly there may be hunting you know why whoa look at the force I was a pilot for obscure I don't like I like low-density environments like I like to catch a gal out camping mm-hmm cup an eater come no yeah bring her my poetry forced her to listen how can I read you something oh is that the worst somebody wanted to read you their poetry that might be the worst thing other than I want you to listen to my music and have a seat play my music for you nah man I'm gonna jump out the window of this is not even play the music but play
