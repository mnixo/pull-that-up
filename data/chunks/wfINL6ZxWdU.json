the girag an experience you can ask anybody who goes to like China driving over there is crazy they have lights but they don't follow them they're like Christmas ornaments traffic lights they're just over there blinking and no one's following them feeling when you go through red lines like here's a crazy thing right you want to make a left-hand turn in China you don't make it from the left-hand side you come all the way from the right and you turn over there why don't I don't know why it's so biggest thing I've ever seen everyone does it that way yeah what because that's how they do it over there wait a minute wait a minute window and they don't ever turn left from the left lane no man from the right we're over here you turn way over there we find evidence of this online everything I say I know will be instantly googled but yeah man it's crazy me and Steve burn we screamed like little girls at least 13 three times on the ride home it is scary here's the thing didn't see one traffic accident not one over there and the bulk of the country drives on the right oh okay I think there's some confusion here well I don't know what the confusion is I did it I think some of the country and China drives on the right but some drives on the left so maybe that's where the the issue is does that make sense after people drive on the right side and half people at the hub why don't they can you manage around they don't mean blow down dude they just go right in to the they just go right in look at the lane what are we watching accidents is this Chinese traffic no no see Chinese traffic because you know someone's gonna get run over there was some horrible shit that I saw online of like oh shit oh fuck dude on a motorcycle they nail people but see that's what they do they just drive through they don't give a shit there's no no no this is just not oh my god this is nuts you know what I hate seeing stereotypes played out right before my fucking eyes but but where are the Chinese and ass car drivers oh my god he just nailed an old lady on her bike oh my god these people are fucking crazy I'm tell man you scream like a little girl I Drive mixed yeah look at this video this is crazy these people are in the rain with these shitty cars when they just drive in through intersections I hate seeing this because I don't on it what I don't want I don't want to believe in stereotype I AB Ike and the other guy runs over them and then keeps going yeah they don't care dude there's a billion of them oh my God look at this guy trying to make it across this is insane this guy cannot do this he must back up and rethink and get a helicopter that's only way he's getting across that Lane people are fucking nuts man I don't like watching this this is giving me mad anxiety oh one and then got nailed by another oh my god a man the fact that those guys are stopped is amazing it's just like they weebo Jesus look at this oh Jesus look at this boom oh my god these people on bikes are insane they're trying to cross the traffic they just say ready go their streets must just be like egg drop soup everywhere of just brain and you know what they say a lot of it has to do with the Chinese culture and the way the interactive people they mind their own business they they don't look to the left and to the right they just keep keep straight and because of that this they're socially this is explained to me by a Chinese man that the the way they're socially sort of groomed to interact with people in walking because there's so many people you bump into people all the time that they've sort of taking this and then drive they drive with the same mentality they go yeah the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do
