the girag and experience but out of that lack of confidence that you get or that lack of sense of like not everything's threatening not ever it's evenly a roast like I'm not even good at roasts because I take things personally and if I'm gonna insult somebody I mean it right there's no you know what I'm cutting to the bone I'm not looking for the laugh I've gotten better at that I can I can I can take the hit a little better and I enjoy it but but it's really hard if you're competitive person Andrew insecure and you have no sense of healthy competition yeah you're no one's going to want hang around with you and everyone's going to think you're a douchebag and what you said is really part it's it's sort of threatens your self definition when you lose that's all right so that's something a wave right right it your pride you're like you know you're manlihood your you know like how other people are going to see you it's fucking like there was one time this is rock and roll oriented but uh it's kind of a funny story in this that like there's a real difference between judging yourself against other people and and just judging yourself against your own work it's it's a hard shift to make because like a lot of my career was built on like how that fucking guy get that why is that guy popular why can't you get me to get that why can't I be on that show what the fuck as opposed to not realizing at that time like I got all that stuff a lot of my breaks early on we're out of spite and looking back on it I wasn't ready for it and I and I botched it just because like I had no you know I was all about the competition but there was one time where you know if I was at a music camp and it was just basically my parents sent me this camp and they let you smoke it was great I was like 14 we could smoke cigarettes and play guitar all day Wow yeah and then the final night like you know there was a big performance where the people in the camp put together beds and stuff and and you perform for the whole camp in this big band shell so of course i end up with these fucking stoners and shitheads you know and we're just like the guy I had playing bass he was ok long haired dude they're all troubled guys and all we wanted to do is play some chuck berry songs you know I figured how hard could Johnny be good be you know how hard and we should be able to pull that off right we're all on 14 15 years old and then there's this other crew of kids that were complete fucking music birds that like new fucking how to read music that could play better than any of us and so here's what happened so we go on and all the dudes I'm with get fucked up before we go on stage we're just doing Johnny be good man it's it should be easy it's three chords my drummers too fucked up to play drums the guy on piano is not playing in the right key it was a disaster I started singing out of key it was the most shameful embarrassing fucking thing I might as well just shit my pants on stage and then we get off and those other guys get up there and in my memory they played the entire side of a Genesis album that's my memory of it that they got up there and they did some amazing thing and I felt fucking invisible I felt ashamed and did you know literally till maybe two years ago I couldn't fucking I was afraid to sing in front of people for half of my life because of that and if I just you know you know put more thought into you know making the song better and working with these dudes and just like learning how to do that shit I wouldn't fucking it's a weird story and I don't know if it really applies but I do know the feeling afterwards of embarrassment and shame and I felt that those guys had one and I fucking hated him for it this in the Bible man that story as New York sharpens iron yeah yeah people sharpen people yeah yeah so dude isman you need to feel that you need to feel lost in order to realize what you did wrong but you can't live in it yeah you can't live in it but it motivates you to move forward and it motivates you but that terrible feeling shouldn't be ignored it should be figured out it's like you got to figure out what what is what is causing this but you can lock into that feeling for many years like all the crazies like you know the cargo cults cargo cults yeah what's a cargo cult come on I don't know my favorite driver cargo cult yeah Norah cargo look up cargo cult as I explained what it is okay so Papa New Guinea was a staging point for the American army during world war two and they cut these impossible runways into the jungle right and but the people who were living there were like Bronze Age people and so they saw these planes come out and then and then you know they would give them like spam and whatever like stuff you know parachutes so then they left at the end of the war and they started a whole religion on the plane so they built these planes and they come in and they mimic the landing and they mimic the people coming out and they still have the American uniforms and that the tribesmen with like a bouncers nose and you like one dread will come out with like a your captain fucking Joe Adams you know and then they'll bring like the last the empty cam of can of spam and shit and they have these like planes made out of flowers that they pretend to launch and stuff you're like this is the craziest fucking it's really watching religion it's really they made they made the religion because of the planes you know the b-52 is coming with supplies and the whole religion is like the plane is the vessel of God and the captain Joe Abrams who comes out is the is God and the nest rangel spam and Giorgio tsoukalos would spike his hair up and come in here and say is it possible that the reason why these things exist that we learned them from alien so yeah I mean it makes sense if you lived a stone-age life and a plane landed and gave you some spam 100% it would become folklore and it's got to be so strangers are they or that they are they illiterate culture so no I mean there's the allegory yeah the cargo called they do they do the whole religious thing through that reenacting that when the planes first landed but actually there's a thing now they are kind of latina because these people in New Guinea who are fighting Exxon there's a lot of oil there and excellence trying to turn a exploit the oil and these are they well whatever everyone's going to get oil now if there's fucking oil someone's going to get it but the hill see how this tribe but they have this tribe now that's dressing as you know the gods the car the cargo cult and they're attacking Exxon dressed as American servicemen from 1942 Wow I think the whole theme of this is from America 1942 today but like it's it's cuz make big huge white helmets and then uh google god that's Google Papua New Guinea versus X on and you'll see the crazy outfits to have johnsburg he doesn't know a spell pass or New Guinea he barely knows how spells new but it's pretty fucking interesting that there's a whole it's a huge country popping his massive and there's a whole like my big texas sized much bigger than texas really and you have a big big country where like a like huge pockets of it worship cargo from 1944 oh my i changed up 42 to 40 is there um is there a big city like where you can go and get Wi-Fi and the starbucks yeah um there's that too there's that too this is like a cheesecake factory there Papa too might be why you'll get a starbucks can I get a starbucks if I went in beginning you can probably get some sort of pizza hut product Wow you son broadcaster iTunes oh shit itunes recording to server get the fuck out of here server
