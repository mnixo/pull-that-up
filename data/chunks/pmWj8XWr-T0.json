the girag and experience it looks like you just have a huge marble I've never listed a pipe weight market I've probably had in my life maybe 10 paperweight I don't think about 10 and I've never had a bit where I've like my paper has been so out of control I just I just shut windows you know mean like I'm a window shutter I see that as an easier fix than just paper blowing everywhere or and plus there's so many outside like in your yard if you really needed something the way this is one book is one and anything's one like these people who may just think that it's an actual invention that like will build an actual glass object with a spindly thing in the middle yeah and then everybody else was like oh shit we got to get involved with that market right god damn we gotta jump on that globe I wonder I wonder if it's painted or they send it patented I use it could be patented that's always when I say painted how you would say is a think I think that's how I would say it but I still think that's a long way to say it in my accent I just think it was me speaking like a tard I don't think it was I don't think it was anything to do with being Australian it's so bizarre how similar Australians are to Americans even though like you know you guys have a different accent you know the accents a little little odd for us you know I think we've seen more similar to the British person you are as well but I mean it's it's amazing how you go there and what I'm gonna by the way the way I mean it's like you just could fit right in yeah the accent melts after a day yeah that's just what people sound like and it seems like you're in America well I don't notice the American accent now on anybody at all it's only one I have to do an audition and they make me do the American accent that I get a bit shitty with the whole thing oh do they do that they're you yeah make you change your voice yeah and like I fucked that one audition I got a couple of callbacks and then I said the word I said I said I went to the zoo when I saw her zebra I still said zebra and well I said the way he just said that I still said it in an American accent but with British phrasing and they freaked the fuck out I need to hear more this American voice that was a creepy voice to it why is that so creepy whatever dude that is creepy as fuck you talking with an American voice just that is great like I say that I'm sort of I would say synonymous with I say can't a lot on stage people always want me to say can't like when they photos out the way any talking American right now in my accent if I say can't it's it sounds great but even when I say can't as an American I've got oh well that's a bit harsh dude you sound like a totally different human when you sort of that American act like at that dude I can come over there come on what would you never think that's Jim Jefferies there's no way I would think that's you I know that's the thing is you called me up that would freak me the fuck out I'm tell you right now don't do that just cuz the sound guy is that them no it doesn't sound so it's Jan I just want to speak to you very quickly with your problems here right now it sounds vaguely fucked up like you you're you it doesn't sound right it sounds really good though it's so close to like a real person not like there's something affected about do an accent Joe I want to hear you and I do an Australian you kind of make a deal like a fighter dude like I have to actually wasn't bad okay but I like went over that Joe but now shaking your arm and I know we say we don't say you know this sighs shit we don't we don't I do more English like well mine's 50/50 cause I lived in England for 10 years but we don't say the words we don't want to say the words shrimp now this is like Americans called prawns shrimp we call them prawns right Paul Hogan does that fucking commercial where you guys all right throw another shrimp on the barbie for you like that right and now that's like synonymous with the strains when that's not even a word we say I'm people yelled at out of American gigs when I'm onstage go do the shrimp thing I'm like what fuck off isn't it weird how many like crazy personalities have come out of Australia like the Crocodile Hunter about all Hogan yeah Crocodile Dundee yeah oh yeah he was out Diana yeah Crocodile Dundee leaves Rennie some way does it go oh yeah kangaroo jack they only did a couple of those crocodile Dundee's though and then they were done I would have thought that could have been like some Indiana Jones tapes no no I did the third ones appalling hahaha the third ones always straight-to-dvd yeah and it's and it's like cases the whole idea was the Crocodile Dundee went from Australia in the outback of Australia to New York and like what the fuck's you going to do this is such a different place you can survive out there but he can't survive here it's not open for the first two films then for the third film you think let's send him to another country like Britain or somewhere else that's different it's Crocodile Dundee in LA now the thing is he's been living since the last crocodile benefit Dundee film he's been living in New York for over a decade and then he gets to LA and he doesn't know what's going on like it's too alarming for him like what are all these people wearing sunglasses for this is weird cheese these women's breasts are too big like it is not a great film and in the end he becomes an animal trainer for the movies and he foils a robbery and actually now I look back it's a great film you recording oh it is already what the fuck son
