[Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters lovers and children Dana Dr Monde is in the house give it up for Dana Dana and I are a pals we tweet each other back and forth but this is our first time actually meeting each other in real life you're very funny you say some funny shit on Twitter and you said you had a really fun thing where you broke down this Jennifer Aniston fuckin with his name Adam Sandler movie it was really funny yeah if you haven't seen it what you can get it's on YouTube on your what did it say just don't go with it it's really funny and really like you you you know you broke it down like a comic would break it down like how ridiculous it is first of all I thought it was hilarious that you said that Jennifer Aniston was the human equivalent to oatmeal it's perfect that is absolutely perfect like she's nutritious I would have said like a cheese sandwich I would have called her a grilled cheese but there's a grilled cheese sandwich truck you don't see an oatmeal truck anywhere else what I'm saying I think you're being a little unfair I would give her a little more than oatmeal but I know what you're saying you know I wonder I got this new love for Jennifer Aniston she's just a chick trying to get money doing her acting thing video and she's really like be with all the youtubers and like make a viral video to let her think she hurt anybody it's easy to get caught up in hating someone for no reason and she's and she's not somebody well I heard Jennifer get go go after Qaddafi Qaddafi is gonna leave her - yeah go after Kardashian yeah yes how do you feel about that but then you know I mean it's it's also you know if you live in a glass house don't throw rocks right but you're right her stuff what she's doing it's all like god damn bitch don't you have enough money do you want to do interesting yeah everything you fucking do is like the same goddamn it's just blood story you know those romance and the worst date movies ever because if you you're going on this date if you're a guy you're already giving into the fact that you're doing whatever you can to fuck you know you're gonna pretend to be someone you're not you know like I would never ask a check to go see some crazy fucking stupid werewolf movie if they weren't into it you know what I mean I would never but women can ask a guy to go see some wonky ass date night bullshit Jennifer Aniston Sandra Bullock movies those motherfuckers exactly why right I was gonna bitch about no strings attached to because Natalie Portman you have an Oscar but still making bullshit like no strings attached poor me I'm the most attractive person ever me and Ashton Kutcher are gonna have no strings attached friends well they could fuck anybody anywhere any day of the week a new person every single day and they're gonna make a fucking heck yeah Oh which we're just gonna be friends and have sex and it won't get complicated I wonder what's gonna happen you're that girl you have to understand what happens she's sitting around her age and calls them this is what we have for you it's a big movie it's Bubble Boy everyone's all hyped on it and next thing you know AG of read for shit that I really I'm happy I never got you just keep talked into going in on these things next thing you know you're in an office next thing you know you're signing papers next thing you're on movie set and you're doing this fucking terrible movie you know boohoo cry for you you know no big deal but I'm just saying they're just out there doing their shit they should do that movie though where it's like it's sold like that where you know exactly what's going to happen they're gonna fall in love and cheat but then it's actually like he murders her and lashes body like it'll be an alien yeah only wants her eggs that would be a good idea for a movie yeah I saw was it called Bureau what the fuck's he called Adjustment Bureau I was know behind in movies right this is a pretty goddamn decent it's a based on a philip k dick novel so it was really weird it was really trippy like really surprising like I thought is just gonna be a typical dumb movie and it was there's a lot of dumb elements but you kind of have to have some dumb shit in a lot of movies just to wrap up a complicated premise inside two hours it's also like what is his motivation well he's ridiculously in love with her and you know what why isn't this going on really well I mean come on really I mean you're dwelling on this shit three years later because it's meant to be and it's all written down somewhere what about it wrack my brain over back to the future and that's like from 1985 like still things bother me about it so much for almost nothing like the rape part it was raping back to the future yeah Beth tries to rape Lorraine and that's right in the alternate future that we have them like washes cars like it bothers me some really I never even thought about that but yes then again I do take a lot of Medicine I don't remember anything about that movie I'm finding as I get older like I've definitely used up hard drive space and deleted a lot of files because I can watch movies now and it's like I never watched them before I watched a simple mind the other day the the the Russell Crowe movie about that genius man beautiful mind yeah a simple my beautiful mind and it was fucking great I had no idea what was gonna happen remember the movie I know I've seen it I'm just an amount of space yeah no space man that's like that social network that's what's gonna happen with that movie to me in like 10 years like it was a great movie but that's not a movie you'll remember there's so many movies man if you really stop you know it's like and I was gonna ask you this because you do porn like why the fuck are they still making porn movies there's no way you could have seen them all right there's no way you need a new one if you're really just beating off there's no way unless you're fixating on very specific actresses which a lot of guys do but if you're not if you're just beating off Jesus Christ that's one we've seen them all that's one thing I've noticed though it is the characters it is you you like a certain actress and you start wanting to see it like before porn was always to me porn was jacking off but then I never really got into characters since like Twitter where now I'm following people on Twitter and stuff like that now I'm starting to get them though I want to see a movie with that person yeah so I see that now that Twitter is helping it a little bit yeah that's that's that's definitely what's become I mean it's become that with comics as well you know it's like it's absolutely reaching out and you develop like your fan base then you all communicate with each other and then I guess when some dudes walking off - it's like much more personal you know or more fun do people get douchey with you because of that like I'm a fan like I demand this well I mean even like today coming here people are like it's yo Rogen gonna fuck you and I'm like I'm not person yeah like you know like you have your thing isn't that what you do and you know it's like this isn't a movie this is real life and you have your real life and outside of comedy and your podcasts and MMA stuff and TV and movies you have your own personal life right me outside of my Twitter feed my bath ink from my bathtub thing is like what's your bathtub thing I just spend like five hours a day in the bathtub you just sit around the bathroom yeah I just can you not get clean enough never clean do you do it on like a webcam or something no I just like to be in the tub you should do it a web page there is there a psychological thing there or you just like to do it I just comfortable just feels good to be in the top warm and wet yeah and not wearing clothes and keeps me from eating gross can I just get an isolation tank that's part of the cat that'd be awesome when the Cat in the Hat comes back that's where he starts trouble eats cake you know in a tub see that's where it's all done that motherfucker Naturals little kids in trouble almost and then he pulls it out with magic at the very end so yeah most people don't eat in the bathtub well you're up to date with your cat and a hat shit son guys I have a two and a half year old I know she loves The Cat in the Hat and I love reading it look I get all enthusiastic about it it's fucking great writing The Cat in the Hat especially the Cat in the Hat comes back that one's the shit I'm shel silverstein yet no man where the sidewalk ends get that you will fucking love it and be great you will read that shit and you as a kid that's man that Cat in the Hat seems awful psychedelic Canada hats got a crazy hat and magic fuck Michelle still Burstein you're talking nonsense I'm telling you about something awesome you're telling me about something else I have no idea it is very similar let's talk about what's awesome he's a cat with a magic fucking hat he pulls his cat off and there's little cat a little cat a pulls his hat off there's little cat beat little cat C and it gets all the way down the little cat Z and little cat Z has voom and you don't know what the flood loom is but boom fixes everything and when it gets down to little cat Z with the fucking shit hits the fan when the cat fucks everything up he gets the the table dirty he gets a pink shit out in the snow and on the $10 shoes and on mom's dress and everything is a fucking disaster and he keeps pulling out little hats so other cats can help him and they just fuck shit up worse and worse until it gets to little cat Z and little cat Z he's got the Reese wet reset switch he pulls out boom and boom just yep bang no matter what and you look at Z is so small you can't even fucking see him he's not visible to the naked eye okay so they're going macrocosm on your ass man they're going quantum physics all right that's how badass cat in the head is so fuck your stupid shell Silver's l silverstein can suck the cat that has cock how about that that's what I got to say I do you think I need this I need to have some kids could ever read this shit no why anything you know when you don't have kids the idea of reading kids cat and a story sounds like fucking painful punishment yeah people I've when I've been in the position where I didn't have kids right looked at people out kids like oh you trap fuck like oh my god oh you're doomed you're stuck to that shoe right now no way not to you know why not - it's normal if you don't have kids that's how it's supposed to be set up until you have them of your own you're supposed to to complete your mission in life like you're your motivation and your goals are to be as unentangled as possible so when you see entanglement in other people's lives you recognize them as disgusting things you never want to seen yourself that's why like you see like someone's acting like an asshole or someone's acting selfish or jealous those feelings that you get from seeing them like oh it's so gross that's a message to you that's you're supposed to learn from this you're supposed to never ever be what that person is I guess they're there for you when you see people with kids if they're not yours you get this screwy message you get this message of a look at this poor fuck you think about all the worst aspects of all your relationships and how you know you could possibly be entangled some other person and then there's a fucking kid who won't stop crying at all you're doomed but when you have them all of a sudden it's like oh there's this little human and they're your little friends and it's you like it's not really another person it's a part of you that's become its own individual you love it literally more than you love yourself and then reading to them and playing with them it's fun as fuck it's like you got this little pal like she makes me laugh all the time she shows me her dumps she takes these giant shits they're fucking huge they come out this little tiny body can't believe how big her shits are you should start twittering you're her twin no way no way you'd be jerking off to my baby shit fuck if they fix that fix my cock you showed how big your baby shit was we're like you know it's gonna fit in that ass kids poop today Joe exactly there's at least one he's gonna say that yeah but she thinks it's hilarious she goes I just made a poop lar poop is what she knows is funny because it's funny coming out of a two-year-old so that's like the go-to word yeah you know whenever you know what does it smell like poop everything smells like poop like she'll say everything smells like poop and laughs that's fun you got to get you got to get her in on there's a show called Adventure Time I highly recommend it's like a it's like a trippy show for kids but if you're an adult you will fucking want to get high and watch it amazing really and then it's like Maria Bamford on it Steve Agee said that he did something on it like a bunch of really talented people oh that's really cool the guy that used to do flapjack flapjack got canceled so now he's on it too fucking awesome would you ever do a cartoon voice I think oh yeah I think that would be one of your ideal things I think I have well we did it you did a Family Guy or American Dad or something like that you remember you I well I did it yeah I did a cartoon voice on Family Guy and I did fuck went outside done with a little kid shit I feel like I've done something before I've read some books I've read some books that became books on CD long time ago with Mario Lopez oh no way it was kind of fun man cuz you're reading a kid's story later yeah it's fun and I always remember like you know like I was I was a little kid like to like listen to a cassette of someone tell a story it was like fucking cool he'd be tucked in bed and here's some really exciting story you know yeah so it was fun was fun doing the speaking of Lopez out remember when we had Allison on she was extre behind Mario Lopez and she was just staring at him like she was like The Terminator with this really evil yeah well she's done it again but this time she did even better like at the beginning they like high-five when they come back from a commercial Mario Lopez and her and then she immediately goes right back into character and she's just staring at him down looking but she's over she overdid it this giant yeah she's overdoing it this time just acting like just did you be crazy on TV what is going on with that chick yeah exactly 1 mm bitches crazy exactly the first time I met her when she was a Bryant she's very nice very nice person first time I met her I'm like dude is that girl angry like what's going on yeah I feel like I upset her that I say some rumors interacting yeah this mean face but then she's super nice yes the gods were sanitary she just gets lost in over thought I think you know like she's constantly you know just thinking about things and then she looks angry it's called winning it's gone winning winning this Charlie Sheen Mimas hit it's turned a corner it's turned the corner I watched the podcast and also this is not fun anymore there's there's two there's three now but there's two different versions there's one where he actually tries to do like a talk show right it's very strange and it's very cocaine because everyone in the room is like all happy and laughing at nonsense and there's this one guy who won't stop playing fart sounds it's like you know he'd probably listen to the Howard Stern Show twice and you know it said oh this is probably all it takes the fucking fart board and this guy's blowing off farts in the background for no reason whatsoever and Charlie's like reading off cue cards just trying to have those synapses fire in some sort of a reasonable and understandable sequence because it's just cocaine madness in that brain his brain is ravaged dude he's got blowout holes in walls and waters leaking out no one knows what the fuck happens to your brain when you blow seven fucking gram rocks your snort numb and smoking them for years and years he's fried he's barely trying to keep it together what if this is all a setup for a movie would be an item Janis moving yeah I mean maybe not maybe not maybe the best man I will never ever be on Charlie Sheen bandwagon fuck him why why is he that I don't know that's the best way to get people mad I think it's just to be like I'm not into what you're into fuck you yeah I actually have not been watching or following any of it I feel like I there's no reward in that for me but there's a reward in following it there's a reward and studying it like he's some fucking Lewis and Clark of cocaine and whores right you know he's like out there in the woods you know and shit whores have been around very very long time but I don't want only about two milliliters how you discover something new he's got radical amounts of money syndication money and when you have that kind of money that's how there's dudes show up with briefcases and shit and you know and there's fifty girls in the room he's doing he's doing other level shit cuz you're not supposed to get that rich and still have this crazy appetite for cocaine and whores you you're not supposed to be that open about it you're not supposed to be that public about it well that's what's crazy is that that's exactly where TVs going this bullshit is this our life suppose it occurs supposedly this is the realest you can get for reality show now is having a Ustream channel and seeing somebody about to die cept maybe you know oh yeah boy the whole thing's fucking fake fake and directed by shel silverstein and this is gonna like the next biggest movie ever fuckin in 3d it's it's so scary when you look at his body and its face like the latest ones the latest - it looks like he hasn't eaten or slept in days like his skin is loose on his face yeah an old man yeah but it's because he's lost all this weight how looks like so here's older than me and I don't know I know I don't look like I did when I was young I look at myself and I was young I'm like wow how weird is that like that's me I'm decaying right you know I'm like my body is morphing and changing but I look better than that dude yeah that looks like Hugh Hefner D Hugh Hefner right there yeah that's an old man wears like a 60 year old man by the way we're looking on ustream he has all his videos and channels w YT are on Ustream and this is WY TV bro you know here's that I think that's just one of them that's on I mean I think you can you can watch the actual Charlie Sheen one on Charlie Sheen's Channel this is the guy who's competent oh it looks like but this one almost has a million views though doesn't it yeah might be it okay maybe it is it but here's what disturbs me look at it the pointyness of his shoulder yeah look at the bones yeah that's weird he's dying he's dying yeah that's that's real you know he's dying he's winning yeah he looks like he looks like Steve Jobs right there yeah do you need a liver transplant yeah maybe that's what it is maybe that's why I saw those horrors in his house he's like one with the better organ a mangy bitch she's come out I say that about that Dick Cheney the Dick Cheney probably has like seven Secret Service agents but only six are real circuit service agents one guys just some dude who's got his blood type waiting to die so they're gonna cut this dude open like a fish harvest one guy with a truck with ice in it it's ready to throw the heart in there while it's still beating what blood type are those whores do you know what you are I don't even know what blood type I think I have like a cat blood type or something Oh positive Oh Dana diamo is the only one here that's not hi nervous I am a little nervous it's very hard to be in the same room with people who are professionally funny because I'm not funny I could just fucking open my ass and like accept a huge cock you know and everything will be okay things will pan out everybody will like you yeah way to go yeah because I can fall back on just you know being pretty you don't enough you don't have to worry about anything just be yourself you don't have to be funny you don't have to be just you are but you know what no more than you have to be like the beautiful thing about this podcast for real is that it's like a conversation you know it's like what people get a chance to see is it's like you get an in on an interesting conversation you know so just yourself good just be funny Thanks well you are you are funny and if you haven't seen that clip it's very funny have you ever thought about doing comedy um I don't know cuz it's kind of hard because I'm like already socially social and marginalized by being a sex worker and then people kind of expect you to be like sexy and then I already had this conversation with Brian about female comics and how it's like that's already you're kind of a rundown on the latter because you you know my boyfriend my period my cats you know kind of stuff and it's really hard to get out of that it's that is a business very hard for women and somebody like me coming in like being pretty and being a porn star and you know being like having a dirty mouth or whatever I feel like I'd be kind of painted into a certain corner of being expected to can you be painted more than you are already I know but as a porn star how could doing be in a female comic which is I mean arguably the general consensus it would be a knotch many notches above on the social ladder like how would it possibly fuck you up by being funny as well as doing what you already do I mean it's very intimidating like I I do like you comedy bits for videos and stuff like that and people can have always called me because they need like a a pretty girl or a naked girl or someone will do full frontal and whatever and I would also for and I get jokes and stuff like that but you know I don't know if I can just be like here are my series of jokes and then try to like change it from you know I feel like I would have to fall back on being a porn star for the basis of my comedy which is something that is kind of counter productive to what I do as a porn star because I sort of market myself as a girl next door in a normal person mm-hmm you know so if you like fold it in on itself no but I really don't think it would because you would just be yourself on stage maybe we're not I think I think what you said just reading your tweets I think you're fucking hilarious and even if you just took what I do is I usually think of a tweet that I really like and then I've tried to write a little story around that tweak is that pretty much is like the meat of the goal or though I'm sorry boys I open that up so we can see what we're doing just in case yeah but that's like the meat of a joke you know like a tweet tweet it pretty much is the best part of a joke usually you know so I think you'd be very good at it just based on your on your what a tweet is is just on and 40 captures just writing material you know it's just it's it's just and and not and not that's the beautiful thing about it sometimes it's just whatever the fuck you think about anything you know I was talking about like I've made a tweet last night that I was watching this Charlie Sheen thing and then he sounds like hunter s Thompson boys you know he's got this crazy nutty gonzo thing going on I'm like wow this is weird like now I'm stuck like is that like a drug thing it's not like you just go too far over the edge and you just you know everything's firing all fuckin goofy is that what it is well Charlie Sheen has been famous pretty much all his life and he was like born into a famous family too so I mean that kind of sets you back a little bit to begin with because you're already scrutinized and being watched pretty closely and you're in a bubble because you're rich sure from the moment you're born basically yeah what stand-up comedy makes you do is be real as fuck you can't fake it you can't pretend something's going on it's not going on you know what's happening is happening when you're talking about something you better be actually thinking about something are those little animals out there gonna smell it no and it's not gonna work like me fucking happy heckler I'm the worst yeah you heckled Mike Young I know it was so funny though it was entertaining too like the 11 people that were there well listen Mike Young needs it he needs it as long as you don't do that to anybody good and don't do it just bombing sometimes we bomb when we're trying to work something out like working things out I'm sure you can I'm sure you you just felt insulted by what Mike Young was selling yeah I know that feeling he was like peeing on my shoes and tell me it was raining yeah you can you can you know guys can go down a bad road and then he was like hey I see you you have bangs and I was like oh yeah you can come door loud you can come do a Joe show tomorrow if you want to do a 5-minute set every two years we're doing a show tomorrow yeah before I even with this weekend is comedy and magic club so this Friday and Saturday were the comedy magic club in Hermosa Beach and tickets are there's still some left but not much and then next week Friday night we're going to Gotham he's beat me and the wild Jew in nice feeling and that's next next Friday night yeah and then Wednesday tomorrow what happens Al's Sal's comedy hall in Hawaii Tom Segura Christina and a lot of people aiza Schlessinger yeah a lot of people going it's gonna be really fun and that's a great place to fuck around I came up with two new jokes last time I was there really us on stage yeah that's awesome because it's such a little intimate or an environment and everyone knows that it's like you're there for that you know it's like everyone knows that either I do my material but I'm really there to do my mate I want to entertain you but I also want to like go down crazy roads and see what happens all right completely free ball and you can't do that in a big crowd you need to do that in like an 80 seater a 90 sita then you just you really know what's funny and what's not yeah you can't get off any tricks in an intimate environment a really small room you can't get off any tricks it's like it's either funny or it's not you know and it's very truthful you know and you could do that I'm telling you you could do it it's like when you're when you're talking about not wanting all these other things but not wanting to be to me you've already managed to avoid that in the most demeaning job possible yeah I guess I have seriously I mean I don't feel like it's not demeaning I think there could be first fuck anyone the judges and it worries anybody that's not hurting anybody if anybody does not hurt anybody whatever you're doing how weird it may be happy I'm brainwashed or maybe I need to be rescued or maybe I just I was raised improperly you know I'm some kind of a heathen or something that I'm just you know I need the right person to slap some sense into me because well they I think that because for most people that's the case for most people in your business that's the case I mean it's not an irrational reason for them to think for a percentage it doesn't account for all very abilities there's a lot more variables variabilities there's a lot more variables it doesn't count for all of them and there's people can be you know into all kinds of things for no fucking reason and to say that it's all from abuser so you're happy you were happy growing up happy person yeah very you know mom dad brother cats everybody almost it just really open about sex in your house like how did you become so I don't know I like I'm weird and I've always been weird like I asked my mom what was I like when I was a kid and she was like pretty much exactly the same way as you are now just shorter and I was like okay been like this kind of neurotic silly person for a very long time and I never had like any sex talks with my parents I think at a certain point they were like it's really normal to experiment with sex and drugs but you probably shouldn't drink and I was like well I'm gonna go get drunk because if my parents think that drugs and sex are cool they must suck or be nerdy or whatever like I think I kind of went out speak heaton on them right little flip man that's something you got to really be aware of when you're raising kids you can't just tell them what you want them to do right no you don't yeah you gotta kind of figure out a way to trick them check the little monsters yeah so you just gravitated towards the alcohol to be a rebel yeah I was like a like a really bad drinker when I was younger I went through phases where it would like not drink at all but then like pick right up and like be a drunk person until I was like 23 Wow yeah I was just like I didn't like sex oh I mean I wasn't like super interested in it like I had boyfriends and stuff and like my parents never tried to make me feel bad about sex but the men that I was with always did like that made you feel bad about it and what about like having a boy sex with or like what I'm into or whatever and I were just like I always found it to be pretty strange so I guess my parents raised me to have good ideas about sexuality but really it like wasn't really pant like laid out for me in any way well for men you know you want to know how many partners because then the likelihood of her leaving you becomes assessed like how long's she well that is such a sensitive thing to say which i think is really interesting because I think that a lot of people would say you know you and to see if she's like a whore or slutty or if she's like diseased or whatever herpes there's that - there's that she's not special I think that's pretty yeah pretty interesting well I'm gonna give your love up to a girl yeah well what the fuck is very you're an accumulation of all your experiences sexual or whatever the fuck you wanted I mean maybe you may miss the only problem is it becomes like you find out about like trains that were run on ER and like how many times damn bitch like how many gangbangs three fuck you know then you start thinking how can I ever think that that sex is special between us you know how can I ever think that uh that this is this is real worthy of my love real yeah it's not what I see in the movies you know it's not what I see in Sandra Bullock's movies Sandra Bullock never gets a train ride on her you know she doesn't go to work you get funny with you so she could fuckin do whatever now no yeah not for a woman she can go full-on vanish she's on the verge of vanishing already she's 40 years old 43 years old she is very cute but I mean you're not gonna want to see her as she's 60 in a romantic comedy about a woman trying to find her way and she coaches a bunch of black guys that are playing football and she learns a valuable like and the blindside maybe she's a little bit of a like a mom not like a girlfriend yeah or sexy boss it's so funny how we identify what summer I was going through some crazy television but I do wonder why she was married to that Jesse James lately tattooed all over the plan what is that about I never really understood that is that like they both enjoy clean he's a charmer charmer there's some guys are charmers and I think he was very obsessed with being famous listen to me I'm like I'm fuckin its grace what we have here is a charmer he's a bullshit artist and he's good getting this girl to believe him now we have a dead baby in Florida talks about there's a dead baby in Florida Nancy Grace is on that ship you look for this story on cnn.com you will find nothing well here we have the mother come home from work boss cigarettes with the baby in the car she hates Casey Anthony so much she like killed her daughter Caylee and seems cool but no but like the thing is she's not like ever trying to percent herself it's like an impartial news person she's like in Casey Anthony they will figure out the truth about you as you murder your baby well she's not a la she's not supposed to be a news person she's like a discussion person but she's a former prosecutor like that's the interesting part of her case she's got figured out that's a crazy thing is like when she when she's talking about Tiger Woods like whoa whoa whoa settle the fuck down hooker I thought you were all about dead babies in Florida what are you doing about black athletes that like to fuck what really you're gonna you're gonna strap in three weeks working on black athletes that want to fuck look really that's who are these girls where do they come from how did they get his phone number well Nancy Grace Nancy Grace would probably if anybody could use some black pockets Nancy Grace I could see her enjoying it couldn't you I pay for that I could see her enjoying it I should see her getting stuffed somebody just finally fuckin treating her like she's really sexual at hot for look like the first time in 20 30 years big man tango Abba nice Ward Ward yes knows how enunciated the WZ that's fuckin comedy right there that's timing you could totally be a comedian there you're good you could totally do it I'm telling you I'm saying real comics and comics and porn stars are very very similar we all come from some fucking weird place where we didn't get what we were supposed to get weary and there's a hole and you know you fill that hole up however you want with jokes or with dicks there's room for both my hole yeah I'm telling you you could do it you could fit hands in there and shit I guess people didn't clap you got five minutes tomorrow at Sal's comedy holes oh my gosh you don't have to do it no pressure okay I don't want to fuck look what happened with her with drinking you can't push her in a direction she's gonna push back take your bullshit fucking tricky I saw the funniest photo of you she is by the way she has an obsession with trannies like she like is addicted to tranny I saw his big black giant seven she's like 7 to 74 something she was giant okay she was that huge girl she was that even a turn-on that I just thought she was like really owning her shit no she was like working the room like it must be fucking like I'm five eight and I feel like I'm a little bit too tall no you're five eight yeah tranny like sometimes I'm in touch with my inner tranny inner tranny my masculine side my masculine feminine side Nev a pussy a boner it's a femme bone FEM bone or less bone I don't know what is that no but I'm why does it terrible time to get your balls caught in your pants and you have to adjust this conversation is going on like the last thing I want is anybody to think that I'm getting hard right now but I'm shifting in my balls black bar are you talking about like femme bone or something oh my god I didn't have to adjust my balls I'm terrible timing I'm very obsessed with RuPaul's Drag Race I've been watching it for all three seasons and I really like the drag drag queens nice to hang out with track means a lot when I what's the obsession just you find it cool just aesthetically when people are just really being themselves right even if it means like dressing as a different gender or whatever it's just like that's like what they feel it's very ambiguous and I really like that why not right yeah why the fuck not I used to go out and like pulling drag looks with drag queens in Florida and I like blended in with them because they thought you were a big woman dude dressed as a girl dressed as a dude dressed as a girl like some pretty next-level inceptions have shit it's the next-level shit yeah your hands are too small and your feet are too small dude you are really one of those people that was supposed to be born a woman yes you know how that would be the worst it's way better to be a woman who looks like might be a tranny than a dude who looks like a woman but those journeys that are like the like girl like Jin they're like jeans are just messed up and they just ended up with a dick but they're like really more woman right they have like a whole different like if they want to do tranny porn they it's a very niche and they look more like women than like someone that maybe started transitioning later in life as it was more masculine right and so it opens their door to like be like the best transsexual prostitute or a porn star or whatever or like they could really like cash in on that you know if people really want to make their keep taking a shape or and deeper gonna be the best possible to compete who's the best training yeah they like Bailey Bailey Jay got the best transsexual performer follow the training she's addicted tranny follow me and I follow them back and well they know me and I think they're just hot girls they're probably just happy that someone accepts them you know I shouldn't any why shouldn't anybody accept them Joe Rogan you're right exactly I think there's a broad spectrum there there's a huge spectrum and all I care about people thought they were gonna hear about like that fighting stuff or like fucking stuff and we're teaching people helps values yeah well I mean that's what this this thing is about this is this a conversation yes you know we it's so easy to judge people confused and we naturally gravitated towards teams and if you're not on Team dressed like a guy all of a sudden there's something fucked up about you but if you're a fucking guy who loves dressing like a chick fuck who's anybody they say there's something wrong with lady girls dressed like guys all the time I never have a problem with it I mean I don't want to dress like a woman but I don't give a shit if you do every time Villa schnikes hot whoo Hilary Swank I think she's hot every time I dress like a guy someone goes look Hilary Swank I think she's hot like a dude I think Hilary's like I've heard dude say that they think she looks like a man I'm like I don't know maybe you need to get a certain amount of man in you you mean to be a certain amount of masculine to appreciate a beauty like you know what Hilary Swank which is a little on the manly side you need to be more dominant more masculine yeah you don't want to be like a frail man and you want to fuck Hilary Swank shall mount you and ground-and-pound you so I feel like I'm I am actually probably more masculine than Hilary Swank the person I would have to see the two of you together because when you see someone in real life like people always tell me when they meet me god damn you're so fucking sure like I never thought you know it's true five eight but on TV yeah but on TV you know you look big you know you're on television then these people meet me and they're like towering over me and they're like well you know I mean a guy's like six fours ago thought you were four could Poehler like you don't know what anybody's like do you actually meet right I mean you have to you have to see like I've met celebrities that I thought were like these big people and there's these little tiny people I mean look like Conan O'Brien I never knew he was that tall which I'm sure makes it awkward when he does his show because he's a towers over all these people and he wants to be unassuming and you know yeah you know it's it's it's interesting thing so who's more manly you are hilarious right she'd have to be sitting right next to you when she did Million Dollar Baby and she played the boxer she looked pretty fucking manly all right yes but she was yoked do you remember that I could work out if I didn't love not working out so much right but she redid it so I'm pretty sure she's more masculine at you I don't know look if you were together right next to each other isn't she buff doesn't mean they're like masculine the fuck it doesn't yeah it does it's all directly related to how difficult would be to rape you that's that's what it is like you'd be a tangle like goddamn I can't even get hard cuz I got a fight and fight for my life here if a man feels like you just absolutely run away with you like grabbing just morning I'm like tortured people on their balls I don't think I would have any like problem like trying to like punch someone in the face or rip their eyes out or kick them in the deck or something cause I've been like very aggressively sexual towards men and shame them right so I feel like that would be an advantage of our rapist rapists out nobody tried to rape me because I can kick your day I'm not saying I'm not saying no please don't rape Dana yeah please and if you're thinking about it please stop thinking about it ya know what I'm saying is that's when a woman becomes manly which it looks how it's very rude right answer it it's so inconsiderate I want to fuck you even if you don't want this girl I've been talking to the other day on she said she was raped twice you know and I'm like I'm like was the better one you got to do that tomorrow night at South 100% that is a bit no doubt about it that's really funny I'm like the BTS of porn movies I'll try to be like when you lose your virginity and some people just full-on is like how old are you see her 80s yeah the behind the scenes footage okay industry talk oh sorry that's from like that's one for our side that wasn't there oh I thought you were saying like a message board like a BBS like the little behind-the-scenes footage people are like do they show you guys like douching and and cleaning your bar I'm always trying to trick people and sit like watching me pee and douche and stuff because they're not really supposed to film readying no because like did you have like a problem with it well it might bleed on people some places obscene but um I did a movie called girls life or vivid all directed by E Makai and had a girl taking a pregnancy test and she peed on it on the toilet and they can show it because it's like in a : yeah like a normal environment like pipi goes in the toilet anus mouth person's mouth oh I saw what you think I saw a guy pissing someone's mouth live is really funny I think it's funny I think it's more hilarious than anything that you know some people like they want to check off to the movies and I went see naked people and they want to see some weird shit but then I also kind of like want to laugh I think it was a guy that used to do it called extreme Elvis and he's buddies with Doug Stanhope and Doug was opening up for him at this bar and guy goes up there he's fat as fuck and he's a really good singer like he's really good and the ban is tight you know it's not just a bizarro show and then the guy takes his clothes off anything my callous I'm a complete microphallus I mean it's like to the point where people are laughing and staring I believe it's still up on my website I believe I took a picture of his dick and and he's pissing in this woman's mouth he goes who wants director Chris I do I did she gets her name and I took pictures of the whole thing I took pictures of him pissing in her mouth pissing in a glass she drinks the glass like it is fucking crazy he climbs offstage and he's in the crowd and some woman tries to stick a beer bottle up his ass you like pee on cue yeah some woman tries to stick a beer bottle up his ass and he goes that's the wrong holes right here get it right here like he helps her stuff this beer bottle up a jasmine and she panics and just drops the bottle like she panic but she thought she would stick her beer bottle up this guy's ass and he was freaked out hey what the fuck get in the wrong hole it's right here I'll guide you there and he starts helping her stick a fucking beer bottle up his asshole like that sounds like this guy's ready to go yeah sorry Rienzi I mean I think that's art I run into him so fucking friends a show I run into him at the Paul Provenza show and now he's no longer Team Elvis I think he's like hey I'm sober now he used to get hammered yeah fuck before he did that show and you know I was talking about met him before a while ago like at the bright spot or something and I was talking on the Paul Provenza show about a guy that I used to know who was a male feminist that's how he would describe himself as a male feminist and it was just it was just as like really sad weak guy and yeah dubby yeah it was very savvy and he was this guy like this really like a bag of jello as a human beings just like and eventually she left him and so anyway I was mocking this whole idea of like how the fuck could you be a male feminist and after I get off stage he goes well I'm a male feminist and I'm like oh wow I would love to debate you on that like we should do some TV I'm like you just said it you just said exactly what I said like the fleshy ball of jello with a microphallus and you're a male feminist well of course you are lady well basically no no offense you're you're a bad motherfucker at what you do when when you do that crazy Elvis thing but like you know talking about being a feminist like be whatever the fuck you want to be but you can't tell me it's not ridiculous you're you're like really into the female of the species like you're really like thinking of them first like what the fuck you talking about how about being a goddamn human how about being a human across the board sexually whether it's male-female gauge straight training is a shit how about being across the board not a fucking feminists you dumbass you can't defend that but you only want to help women you only want to promote women you fucking weak bitch that's weak shit yes we i don't even call myself a feminist I wasn't seven say like I'm not not a feminist and whatever but you know there's so many different waves of feminism that people come behind you and just it's just creeping everything together stupid begin with yes all groups are stupid you know all of it I think were you looking out for what I mean you can't fucking fix the world I mean there's some things you have to have like you have to have some sort of a group that's there to investigate claims of racism when it comes to jobs and stuff like that I mean you have to have some groups but it's really a possible resentment that's good sure yeah as little as possible these little goddamn groups as possible yeah that's the key you know people get on fucking team mentality mode and they start just going after I'm on Team strict I'm on tune queer you know I'm on there's some on that you they they can't help it you like it I like it all everybody's got a light in the fuck up right Tina yes isn't that the key for this world the way I say that weed could could fix the world for real it sounds silly it sounds silly coming from a fucking comedian and a porn star and a video comedian but we did it real obviously so maybe people listen to us because maybe we're a little bit more informed I read this post on a message board the other day about this dude who talked about he had smoked pot for the first time in like seven years and he was absolutely terrified to his core and then it brought up all these crazy thoughts of childhood and he could not handle it and if we can open up this fascinating discussion because um you know some people are saying that's normal and some people are saying well you got some shit you got to deal with it's fucking with you in the back your head and you in your sober life you're not addressing it but that's why weed is good for you you're supposed to look at everything all the time and a lot of us don't we like to burry shit in the back of our hand and try not to address whatever is fucking with us and we just turns a light on that shit whatever you have in your life that's fucking with you that you're trying to put deep in your subconscious marijuana does not allow that it doesn't allow it so people say oh it makes me paranoid no no it's making you think about the shit you need to be thinking about you should be fucking paranoid you should be aware of how vulnerable you are the world is very fucked up I had to like move because people were stealing my mail when I lived in summer like I had to like move to a high-security building I couldn't I knew where you were yeah fans like that's and I was like I did think I was paranoid but I was like no these people are for real like know who I am and it's kind of trippy did you have a happy childhood you think oh yeah absolutely really I my parents weren't involved in everything PTA Girl Scouting I was a figure skater or they say finger skating how do your parents deal with what you do now I don't know I don't know if they deal with it I don't know it's not really something that's a non-issue a non-issue yeah really they're like no big deal you just yeah having sex on film yeah wow that's fascinating pretty much well they also say that you know I have a reasonable you know amount of following and fanbase and people who appreciate what I contribute to the porn industry besides just being like just you personally wormhole yeah in a bunch of fake hair it's you know just so you contribute being your personality and yeah yeah definitely but my my parents respect my decisions which may be kind of very foreign concept from a lot of people people's parents tend to you know tell them what to do and my my parents are opposite they told me like were they religious at all no that's the reason my parents are religious yes what is their background oh my my grandmother was from Germany and I don't think that my mom was raised with a village and my grandmother was like a new AG what did you dad do for a living whatever my dad does a kind of weird shit like a he works at a catering company now but he was like an on-site security manager of a storage facility and he used to be a CEO of a software company and he quit that to be a fish farmer and then he like went to like ranch cattle and Oklahoma like my dad is kind of all over the place wow that's kind of cool though my dad is like kind of like a genius at free spirit all all sorts of things but like for that amount of time you know it's just like yeah he's like turbo thruster like you're like why not man shouldn't I be able to just fuckin change careers in your life my dad does all the time and my mom works at a company that makes stuff to blow up brown people in Florida Wow wait a missile company like some some yeah some form of arms yeah it doesn't have to be brown we might Jackson yellow people in North Korea keep talking shit keep talking shit rice-eating motherfuckers we got some shit for your ears a bunch of people got mad at me people this MMA forum because I there was we were in Kentucky and there was some fights going on and this kid who was a wrestler was fighting this other guy who's a kickboxer from Italy right and he lives in America but they were chant USA and I was like really Kentucky I'm like that guy lives in Miami all right we're all immigrants all right everyone in this fucking country descended from immigrants and no one was here ten thousand years ago was all ice you fuck all right that's the whole deal with America this guy actually lives here in your yelling USA and you know and people were like saying like you know something wrong with patriotism and you're enforcing your beliefs on other people oh my god I'm making fun of shit I think it's stupid you know you're being colored commentary silly you're yelling at USA what you just watch these guys for their goddamn technique and their courage and what the fuck they're trying to accomplish and the difficulty of the task is a great goddamn fight between this all-american wrestler who beat Phil Davis and Ryan beaters badass fucking wrestler and this Italian kickbox who's trying to get his ground game together it's a great fucking fight and he's dildos who are you if they spit all over the back of the person's head in front of them this dumb fucking mouth breeding cocksuckers house no and they get mad at you for being upset at it how else did you feel about that your time over in Kentucky because I grew up around there and I going through Kentucky was always a fun time anyway so it's great Louisville is a great city yeah the comedy club is fucking fantastic people there are super cool the people that work there were super cool it's like it's got this weird southern sort of the bite looked almost hippie thing going on there's like a lot of like young people there there's a lot of like open-minded people and then there's a lot of old money and then there's a lot of get oh yeah so it's this weird combination of shapes car no not Lexi not Louisville really Louisville's old money it's like it's a rare part of the south where it's like there's a lot of like really establish like social clans and groups and socialites a lot of money like really really old money down there but a lot of educated people too but they're on that show the first 48 they're on that show all the time you know I got a I got you verse or shows real dead bodies that's so creepy it's dark like weird that you can show you know anybody getting shot in a movie but you can't show people really fuckin yeah it's amazing I like a woman experiencing sexual pleasure it's like okay if it's like the dude go girl orgasm it's very not done yeah right this does it ever happen yeah you never you never select the girl coming so it's now even if the guy private parts and the girls like on the speaker like having an orgasm how we're just making the noises Assefa I remember that was so shocking when that came out like that was so yeah when that movie came out fuck yeah that was hot she's sitting on the speaker and he's gone yeah that was cool that's interesting that it's not thought of as being very important if you come because it's all leftover barbarian shit when you still hold you down by your hair and just shoot a load in you and run away that's what it is that's how people made babies back then that's it is gross but it's the reason why men are stronger than women why aren't you strong - you're not strong - so we can rape you easier there's no logical reason why you wouldn't be like we're we're stronger to fight off other men that want to fuck you and kill the babies that's what we're strong that's totally right strong to rape you and to fight off other guys wrestle each other so they get off this shit that academics haven't even considered yo they haven't even looked into this so deeply they're scared because of social constructs alright we had a Ari Shaffir on his own podcast had a guest that was addicted to going to bath houses or arming massage parlors up to get laid did you say his name no no but I do have a mom with a mask on yeah the spider-man mask on oh yeah dude I almost said his name yeah I know yes hey but anyways oh sorry this is live maybe we should consider not having a slide even Charlie Sheen edits a shit but so anyways he I never knew like I always heard the the handjob thing or they said they say Han Jones but he was talking about how there's places here in Halloway many places that he can get just like fucking full-on hooker say what and he says they he's gotten to the point where he has places that has favorite places with his favorite he's like yeah this is like an LA ten at this one place and it's a hundred and fifty dollars and he's fucking there sit there and fuck after you do it at fifteen massage oh and he says he says they even bring out the women so they can look like the bunny ranch where they all come and say hi and stuff like massage parlors is their thing where you can get you a massage part of your sex massage at the end they give you a legit massage and then they jerk you off at the end I would take the massage at the end the crazy thing is it's very yeah fast out the gate and then I get like the wind down oh I see yeah so you would go wow that's interesting for a guy I think is the opposite right give me the massage first and then beat me off don't be yeah yeah cuz after you beat me off I just want to go away yeah I'm done see ya I don't mean a massage that's good I feel good I'm loose y'all ago when men have an orgasm there's a fucking instinctive need that you have to overcome to just run like you come get away it's true real life fuck the movies in real life when a guy comes I'm telling you he wants to run away I mean you want to stay if you love your wife or your girlfriend and you you know you have this relationship together but if you don't if you don't know each other that well and also do you fuck you like yeah there's a lot of times when you're not there's a lot of times when you just want to run especially if you're drinking if you're drinking and you know that somehow know that you glad the alcohol and your penis to talk you into some unreasonable situation and then as soon as you orgasm that it just becomes clear what the fuck happened and then you want to run away get me out of here so what I'm trying to say is it's way better to get the massage first okay loosen you up then we're done we're done here we're done thank you he also said that out how he got an escort once he was in this weird like small town it was like 3 o'clock in the morning and he he only had two options and like on the internet he found like their web sites and one the lady was already out doing something else but the other one you know like it would show her eyes only and then it would like show like her leg or something like that because they couldn't show the whole thing and so he's like fuck it I might do this and she had a really nice or you know it seemed really nice on the phone or so then she comes over and it was like she she was just like had like stab wounds she like her teeth were all fucked up and her boys sound like PJ Stansberry was like like that no and he said it was so bad that like he would they felt like he it was impossible to fuck this girl so then he's goes yeah I have this thing that I like to do it's where you give me a blowjob I put a blanket over you while I watch the porn and she's like all right you know and then afterward she's like do you mind if I finish myself up you got me all hot and bothered just puts one leg up over all it just starts fucking masturbating oh it's called skeptic tank to a Ari Shaffir skeptic take to it that's what I I have a friend that has been addicted to going to those massage parlors forever and he's never had a girlfriend as long as I've known them yeah I've known him for more than 10 years and more than 10 years that I've known him all this guy does is he's not a very good-looking guy and he's not built very well and he went bald really young in life and he's never been successful right and just has a real hard time he gets real nervous around chicks so he just goes he's Asian massage place just gets whacked off all the time yeah so a good percentage of like it doesn't make a lot of money so the good percentage of what this guy makes every week goes just getting whacked off and like he takes them out on dates sometimes he was talking to me about it once we're playing pool and he was talking to me about it's like yeah well you know I'm taking her on a date this Friday I go what you okay all right so don't judge up Joe um no no I'm saying do you think is she gonna be your boyfriend are you gonna be her boyfriend like what's what's going like you guys gonna yeah okay good romantic comedy right yeah sure wax off dudes all day and then along with your but I felt like this I felt like what the way he was telling me it was almost like he had talked her into doing it cuz she didn't to lose him as a customer I know times are tough you know when you get that steady 700 a week coming from one dude you know you think about it he just do it himself like every other day or something yeah kind of he'd like to fucking find a fat chick with a mustache and just look we can fuck each other once a week but I have to get really drunk every time I do it you can get jerked up by cute asian girls we talk plateaued higher alright you know I've spent human nature son you're talking some unrealistic nonsense doesn't work that way right Dana that's right Joe traffic today we got you as a comic yeah yeah light my legs real nice oh that's him up do this he had a leg greaser for sometimes it seemed likely sometimes it would go like Mary Hart's legs were just like greasy like she just [Laughter] does that make sense to you being being a woman being a woman seeing like men like freaking out about body parts and seeing like that's what you need like sell a car and some woman with slinky legs that like folds them over and gets in the front seat yeah everybody wants to buy that fucking Cadillac there's pussy in that car some crazy Canadian what does it like though to be a professional woman like that to be a professional sex symbol like dudes are they look at you and 99 percent of them are thinking about sex or thinking about sex you've had and what you're selling if I wasn't in the business I'm in I feel like people would probably look at me that way anyway really yeah wasn't because I'm always like I'm trying to talk it out with my coworkers and stuff and I'm like I think this guy just wants to fuck me because I'm a porn star and then like Manuel Ferrara looks at me he goes no idiot they want to fuck you because you're hot and I'm like okay yeah I can make up whatever backstory even if they've seen like a like a digital image on their computer or not people cannot like when you see a hot girl you are have a whole your imaginations run wild if I work with my Bath and Body Works I would want to fuck you the whole time I was a bad Body Works exactly why would I yeah I've just this is information that I've acquired know what you said it's it's also very possible that he want to fuck you because he saw you fuck people on film you know I've never once I've watched her fuck one time on film there that's fine yeah like you have to stop looking at me naked because we're friends now that's just not the way that it goes funny there's no social taboo between you watching porn that I'm in just because we're friends a lot of people that I find in porn it's kind of strange there-there's lawns that they draw you know there's very distinct lines like I remember this couple that I met we were doing the man show and his couple came on they were talking about how they're allowed to fuck other people while they work they're both in porn but then off work you're not allowed to just go randomly fuck people right I was like wow that's a that's a weird distinction like how do you how do you figure that one out like you're okay with them fucking whoever at work but that was the other thing like one guy was on the set and his girlfriend started sucking this guy's dick when the camera wasn't running he's like hey what the fuck and he got all mad that's weird how crazy that's weird how crazy is that he's like I'm fucking you guys aren't even filming she's just second I've actually I've worked with people and have the same kind of thing where it's like they can do whatever they want on camera but the guy has to like stroke himself well I think he's like getting ready to go like the girl can't help it looks like cream again there it's like maybe they might be the same people I don't know isn't that crazy but yeah it's just they're socially monogamous a line that you draw well I allowed to fuck I used to date a guy in the business and outside of work we didn't fuck around or whatever no and he did some things that I found were questionable and he was and he was like there's a camera in the room and I was like you're a fuck fucked up that's not the same thing oh that's hilarious yes like one doesn't count no I mean just your your boundaries are your own and it doesn't matter what you do for a living just because you're a comedian doesn't like no one's allowed to tell jokes in my house basically you know just that's just not the way that life works right but you know if you have like some kind of contract like marriage or you're with somebody and you say okay well we live together now so like I don't want you sleeping with other people even though I do porn for living do you know I'm saying it just yeah that's what you've arranged between the two of you that's weird you know why I arrange anything why why make something that someone can't do if you're allowing the most sacred of sacred things you're allowing this person to fuck other people right on on film why not just allow them to be themselves why put any boundaries just here come here at night and and this is where we live because I don't know if sex is not that sacred to some people maybe maybe like the people that I work with they don't have my address right you know what I mean and maybe that's a little bit more my privacy and my security is more sacred to me than actually the actual physical active that's true yeah that's true like pleasure is like would you get mad every time you masturbated to the video or you know no what I'm saying is why put a boundary on it though well I put a boundary not necessarily I see what you're saying you know they want things to be a certain way you know so they can be people do what the fuck they want to do and find someone who you're compatible with and trying to turn them more of someone in to your expectations that's the number one problem with relation a table yeah people find people that are incompatible with them and they try to make them fit and it doesn't fucking work that way one person's our control freak and the other person's ain't no they don't want to do you know like it's not compatible what they've agreed Webster compatibility lies that they both you know for what reason or another think it's okay to do porn but outside of work they agree to sleep with only each other and they can run together that's definitely a compatibility yeah good point yeah if they're all I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it I'm just saying it's an odd thing that you you don't have a boundary on someone fucking people on on camera but you do have a boundary with them doing it for pleasure on their own right with another person because that might be a motion of our is or what right yes it's it's understood whether you're right exactly porn is acting and athleticism athleticism fighter monkey I'm a crazy person and you know and it's not comfortable it's it's not for you it's for the camera it's you know it's and it's hard to do something that does not feel good and act like you feel like it feels good oh you literally get fucked sideways sometimes it really fucking hurts you ever stretch it out before shoots and stuff like that what is it what is it me - I have like a huge butt right is it easy for you to poop faster but can you just sit down and like take care of it in like three seconds toilet just have an airtight toilet she puts her squeezes her legs together and cover their snatch with her hands so that shit doesn't blast out through the bottom of her legs just take a shower every time she shits this is the back of her legs looks like she went skidding down a muddy Hill it looks like the back of your shirt when it's raining outside you're on your bike and the mud has skidded up the back [Laughter] [Music] I'm discussing myself so as it so now i show the but you're not you not in the butt section real life are you good at sex in real life like is it the same as the same we're better on film yeah because i like to exaggerate my movement right why don't you do that in real life lazy bitch very stationary are you like I'm only on the top down and like smash are you serious yeah well hey I actually genetically need a strong man to train your own like being you want to let you want to feel that I wanted to take it he could take it sure that's what is natural your big girl not bad not in a bad way you are a good specimen you if you wanted to make warrior children you'd be a good specimen would warrior children with flexible bundles you need you have the perfect DNA for it yes is it hard to be to date people as a porn star do you find or it is is it like more of a challenge do you think I did a couple years ago and when we met like he knew what I did and stuff like that and I did not want to be involved with him and then we started sleeping together after a really long time we kind of like worn me down a little bit and like kind of fucked out it was we weren't off to a good start I'll admit but yeah I get bored too so after we had like started dating or fucking fucking and dating he then like looked at porn that I was in and decided that he wanted to be a spaz about it and be like I don't know like knowing you do those types of things I don't know I'm like yeah you already knew but now that now you want to be bothered because you're a drama queen that's nothing to do with what I do it's just that you know the feelings were awesome feelings were also getting you know starting now before it was like zero feelings I just want to fuck you now the now it's starting to cut like love gets involved you know I think that's probably the natural process of wearing me down it's like I don't judge you like I think it's fine and it's like really great because you're really successful and then it just kind of nosedived into like those things I think for a lot of men it's very important when they meet a girl that they're sexually attracted to they want that girl to like them and I think that is the root of a lot of bullshit and the guys don't even realize they're doing it it's a genetic thing it's a a predisposition to wanting to be sexually attractive and so they start pretending to be someone who they're not and then they get into the relationship but then it's a couple months in and they're relaxed and calm I am I with this crazy bitch I don't not even into this and yeah yeah it's like there's there's a lot of dudes that are just trying to put it together like they don't have the luxury of like actually being honest and trying to like meet someone that they actually like they're so caught up in a game of trying to fuck a chick and it's so difficult for them that when they finally get when they tackle or they get it in their yeah like got one good okay what did I pretend to be doing to do this I'm not a fucking vegan I wanna you know they meet a girl that's willing to fuck them like once every couple months and they gotta work hard to take it back play it's just sex well weirdly we we do together is love that's just a movie you're making you know oh yeah that's a man drama guy he was like yeah I was like being really depressed or something like that and he like wanting to lay it on me like you can't live inside your own pain and I love you and I was like yeah it was like you're full of shit the worst the most sexually unattractive thing ever is someone's full of shit yeah it's just so gross people are full of shit like oh god it's such a such a bummer you know when you hear someone say some nonsense you have to mock them and then they get mad at you for mocking them and it all fucking falls apart oh I just ate this girl used to write poetry and it was nonsense it was nonsense it was I mean it was her form of expression but it was so clearly affected and faked and just designed to like yeah fucking fire off all the rights and it was just so artificial so clear so clear that was just a bullshit that she was slinging it was so offensive are you a poetry snob though or do you like it high quality Kowski you know what I love about Bukowski and you know I mean it's a lot of his stores look really dark as a poet but it's that's a fuck what that guy's thinking about for real yeah you know that is his real life that's we think that's all I require of an artist what what inflames me is when I think someone is trying to pretend to be someone else whether it's a human or a singer or a comedian or an actor if I feel like you're bullshitting me I feel like you're bullshitting me it's offensive yeah you know you treated me you're fucking crazy poetry hooker some salt things here intelligent you're mad at me that I'm laughing at this nonsense tell us a horror story from bit doing porn what's what's one thing that sticks out just you fucking like you just awful experience did you ever like say okay never again I used to do a lot of like BDSM stuff where I was a sub that is everybody who's not crazy BDSM most people don't have any idea what that means bondage well it's like sadomasochism sadomasochism when you say is one that they tortured sub submissive and dominant right that's bondage and dominatrix know some shit like that yeah it's like a code I don't know whatever right it's like being in the army yeah talk about extreme things they try to invent little shortenings of them oh yeah so yeah I would be like electrocuted and entire like you know where your nipples everywhere nipples like in your body with like those odds pussy inside on my butthole oh my god like while in like very strict bondage oh my god whoa whoa whoa are we challenging you know and it was something that was really legitimately interested in when I was in my early 20s and it's something that I thought that maybe you know so I consider myself to be a kind of a tough person and I felt like if I if I've met these challenges it would prove how tough I was god damn yeah I don't know yeah cute inside your butthole yeah what percentage of the population has ever been electrocuted inside the bubble you're one of you I mean they proudly attends units and I mean they're sold like as medical equipment and stuff like that I'm sure a fair amount of people have gotten their hands on them you say well let me stick this thing in my ass what was that 9-volt battery on your asshole with more penises you don't know that there's no more than willing to submit to you on this I'm outfitting the entire room know me so how long did this whole session take whether electrocuting your vagina and your asshole oh man it was a first site called wired pussy calm and you know it's all electrocuting pussies as a site female on female septum and they electrocute pussies yeah and they like play games like who can take the most electricity or they'll chase blindfolded and partially tied up women around with a cattle prod that makes noise and you could either go toward it or away from the sound but if you to way from the sound just when I thought I'd reached the bottom of the dark ya know electrocuted have you have you ever had your pee-hole fucked you've seen that what about this before yeah there's videos out there of guys fucking girls is my and it stretches just like your asshole never you gotta reach goals you gotta you gotta buy my body I went through a phase of like piercing and some of that when I was younger yeah you have some tattoo above the cookie I do but I'm having it removed and that is so fucking painful is it really than any like butthole electrocution I've ever gotten really removal is so painful it um like agitates the ink molecule in your skin and makes it explode with each treatment it just gets smaller and smaller and it grows it metabolizes out of your body it's right you have to wait a couple months in between sessions just like long enough that you could forget how much fucking pain you are in you have to go and do it again guys I'm just keepin waterfalls waiting I'm gonna sleeve that I'm done on my right arm and I have an old tattoo up here that I have to get how much how much worse is it than the actual tattooing it's so much worse because you have to go like 20 times really and it's like and it's like it's just like a fairy it's like you could feel like the impact of the laser going into your skin it feels like being snapped with a rubber band really hard it instantly burns that it makes your skin swell up and not one when you get a tattoo it's kind of scratches the surface of your skin mm-hmm when you get lasered it's like affecting the color inside your skin so the blood kind of seeps out like a sponge oh I'm gonna I'm gonna wait 10 years or wait for the technology to get a little bit better you just turn me the fuck off that laser cats I'm thinking about cooking my arm like that like what damage your skin no I mean it's safe it doesn't scar it doesn't know that I mean that's the purpose of it being such a long slow process I mean you could just cut it off if you wanted to but I wouldn't say that that's the best idea ever so let me ask you this if wired pussy calm calls you up next week and says hey we're looking at the shoot you done with that yeah I would top I've gone back to be the Dom because I feel like I can confidently say I know what I'm doing and I wouldn't do something to somebody else that I haven't had done to myself yeah but look what you like I know and if they're not a badass bitch like me they don't fuck me would you ever do part porn yeah yeah I for all the time in my movies you fart in your movie it's just like when you get fucked in the ass like your butt is open and gaping it's like the big thing where they want to see in so they want to say Laura : they want to see it all I don't know why people like it they just do and I you know and just whatever so like the air goes into your chasm and you just kind of fart it out it okay fart like I'm eating can of beans like a hobo right my first reaction have you accidentally ever sprayed no no I think I've accidentally peed on people at work and then be like I'm squirting or whatever and I don't know what is wording exactly is this really when in the movies where girls like shooting or obviously you can see it coming out of her pee hole right I'm assuming that a lot of people that watch these movies don't know what a vagina looks like or anything and they don't know that where the all the liquid shooting out of the girl's vagina area her her zone or whatever nerds call it but isn't a pee hole hey but hold on a second because that's where it would come out anyway because isn't a pee hole like literally when a woman gets her testosterone treatment to become a man her clit grows become like a small penis pussy boner and that the penis is obviously where any sexual ejaculate would come out of so of course it's gonna come out of where you pee I don't really what is it is it real I mean this is I mean I did I used to date a girl that fucking juiced on me and like in my belly button like a puddle and it was about it wasn't pedo it was just it was like wind of woman's vagina gets moist it's not dripping over pee hole it's coming from inside I don't think this is moistening it's not lubricant that's that's what squirting is supposed to be and we really need coming out of the pee hole it's pee whoa spider-man like trick that they do when they like finger the pussy and I like press like on the outside man so yeah just like when spider-man is web yeah this is like the axial Brawn method I watched instructional videos and I was like what are they doing and they're basically just like pushing on the bladder and just forcing pee to come out Jesus Christ yeah what it is like if you had to force piano somebody that's exactly how you would do it so that's what all that spring is yeah so girls are spraying on dudes they're pissing all over yeah unless they have like an extra juicy cheese spot or something like that like I'm not gonna say all like I'm not going to say female ejaculation is a myth because I'm not a doctor and I can't say that I mean and you know pussies get wet and some pussies are wetter than others yeah we're talking to an expert here dandy Armand here Levin who's not a doctor not a doctor : now can you put can you put a condom on a dick with just putting in your mouth and doing that trick I know I cannot even remember the last time I used a condom god damn do you ever worry about diseases no I get tested every three weeks yeah so how do you keep clean when you're everybody every three weeks right then you have three weeks for a pornstar though Jesus Christ how many you don't you like sorry dicks can you be exposed to well like I work with Mark Wood twice last week so it's like the same same wiener same same wiener same week you guys develop like a relationship when you have like on screen yeah I mean I I think the people I work with are cool it's not like I'm like ooh like I'm super horny for you let's do things after that how many of them like he's married to Francesca Leigh you know and they were fucking awesome I know both my work with both of them how many of the dudes that are in porn wanted to do mainstream things we couldn't make it and have like some sort of a weird thing where they I don't know like a lot of guys are musicians and they're all like trying to get together like a band dude swinging dick yes you should call it that'd be a badass name for a band yeah dick I don't maybe I'm a I don't know maybe I'm just like oh I'm at work I'm doing my work things but I don't really ask people too much about they're probably with Tyler night yeah Tyler's a very good friend of mine we were actually just both on Star Trek The Next Generation oh really a xxx parody digital finish and revolution ax coming now is like a big he was Geordi yeah and I was she's a huge Star Trek fan mature-looking I was stoked I called my dad and I was like I'm reading for the part of ensign ro for the Star Trek parody and he was like that's so cool and I was like no dad if I don't get this part I'll die like super seriously like no I need I this has to be my part or I'm freaking out Tyler is a friend of mine from jujitsu and he's a really good writer have you ever read any of stuff no he's got a blog online and he's very smart guy and he's smart and he's very polite yeah he's very well-spoken he was on the podcast we had him on and he's a very he's a fascinating do but I already knew that talking to him at jujitsu I stuff but his writing is great really interesting stuff and his writings about the porn business he's got this one story that he wrote about a gangbang that it's just like you fucking feel the loads on the floor like as you're reading it you feel like this sticky room you feel the heat of all these guys behind me does a masterful job of describing this fucking incredibly gonzo bizarre film that they're doing they would get paid 50 bucks and you wait in line you're like one of a hundred guys waiting to you know you're jerking yourself off as you're getting up to this girl who's just covered in loads there's loads all over the ground everywhere you walk there's Lois it's just like slippery and wet you Stephanie come everywhere everywhere you've never done these little signs that say slippery when wet that they have to put up around the woman you know I gotta rest who was the first person dude that was in Houston she the first order was probably before I was born because the numbers just keep going up you know one point in time I was like the sex Annabella Chong and she's got it's a fascinating documentary and like you she's very intelligent she's very unusual she was a UH I think she was a student at UCLA I might be wrong UCLA or USC but she was like she's an intelligent person and she just had this weird desire to test the boundaries of her you know acceptable sexuality by I'm doing a gangbang film but it was really interesting like it was uh it was cuz it was you know they really like got into like her purse psychology and who she is like that was a complex sort of a fucking case where this woman wants to experience the ultimate taboo you know my agent called me one time when he was like what's the most number I don't fucking care you know he was like no how about eleven I was like fine like what difference does it make if I fuck eleven dudes in the same day or in pairs of you know ones twos and threes on well I imagine I have to like the third or fourth giant black cock you know lips would started getting numb in your head eleven cock day is that the same amount of time when you stretch your mouth off like that shit would that seems like it would make your lips numb a huge mouth I do have a huge it's good for my career comes in handy now did you know that you wanted to be a porn star when you were younger oh I did I actually did like part of this as like a bit with the midnight show go guys they didn't this is your life Bob Guccione this is the midnight show guys yeah you see be okay you know how how men think and stuff and I I was like oh this is your life Bob Guccione and and I come out and I'm like oh I've been such a big fan of you for forever and stuff because when I was like in the grade probably six years old I found a stack of Playboy magazines that were in the woods my no they were my uncle's my uncle stayed and I remember I took I took one of those magazines to school to first grade and I was like sure this is what a naked lady looks like you know I was like such a boy I was at a tomboy when I was that age but I but even that I was like this is like what a sexy lady looks like and I want to grow up and this is you know I want to turn out like this a sexy lady like that's kind of like that appealed to me I thought wow she's she's gorgeous she's all made up she's you know pretty and naked and thin nice boobs you know and I was like yeah that like really appeals me from you attracted to girls before you started doing movies yeah and I know you also thought like if I'm if I don't turn out to be this I had like a fail-safe in my brain I was like if I don't turn out to be a sexy lady I would at least want to be with one like have one like us my girlfriend or like just you know be in the presence of that because it was appealing to me and I found it attractive I came on your show because I want to say that I'm out a big pussy boner so how did you get into your first film how do I shoot seven years seven years what we doing before that I was a stripper I was a drunk stripper - oh and how did what did someone approach you and say hey I like the way yeah yeah no absolutely not no I actually quit drinking I think I already told this story in your show maybe I quit drinking and I got fired from being a stripper and I had been thinking about applying to this porn site because had fucking machines on it and this is how I got into the business fucking machines just of sure like morbid curiosity of fucking a robot and just really thinking about it and he's like masturbate in the shower like right but it's not gonna robot and fucking a robot on the internet - totally and I heard it's awful by the way what was your experience like fucking machine oh yeah a lot of fun yeah talk to girls it's fuck robot actually talked about it today no joke really this comes up all the time people feel like we can approach you and talk about fucking robot yeah he seems like the guy so yeah I just ended up applying to that site and that's how I got to do all that bondage stuff is because it's the same company I ran hogtied and wired pussy and all this whole and they even have a female wrestling say Ultimate Surrender where they have women wrestling so they've got the market cornered on kinky pain shit yeah absolutely what a weird business the armory up in San Francisco they it's basically a castle you know when I saw that online are on a television show brother there was some sort of an expose on it about how much money they make and how big their business is enormous but they also they really improve that neighborhood they give back to their community they do a lot of stuff you know they they open their drill court to you know when they have parades and shit like people can set up their floats they open their their private business to the community to do things or not swap meets inside their disco like it's like a crazy jungle of naked people running around and like people in offices like on computers San Francisco is a place where that would be accepted San Francisco's in my opinion it's the most open-minded city and in the whole country you would be surprised that were in the wall street journal' talking about like people are there Pino there's people fucking in there and what doesn't matter there's always gonna be some people like that where do you think their neighbors come from the amount of people that would support it would be much larger in San Francisco than anywhere else of course you're always gonna come across people that are very vocal they want to fight something but all in all San Francisco is the most open-minded city I think in the whole country I mean I could you imagine that happening in Chicago where there's a whole block filled with you know people that are tying people up and fucking them with rubber robot shit you know that could only take place in like San Francisco yeah I don't think there's any other place that could that would accept something like New York maybe I mean it seems like New York has a lot of fucking at the bondage club New York and LA or the only other options I think and I think they'd be met with a lot more resistance in Europe yeah anywhere Berlin was in um Berlin and I turned on the television and no not Berlin Oberhausen over housing and I turned on the television and there was no gangbang on TV just a full-on gangbang it's just no warning just flipping through the channels and the yeah there's ten people fucking in a room like wow this is wild like they have a totally different attitude about it they just show the shit on television it's pretty intense what are you doing it right there just looked at the basis for house and chains died when uh what Mike Starr I don't know he was on Celebrity Rehab they found his body in Salt Lake City well Charlie Sheen lives winning barely snap tiger blood I don't know who's now but honest DNA it's a freaking rock star from Mars well I guess that guy probably didn't have to pay girl thirty thousand dollars to have sex with him he's probably eyes he's got a lot of money crazy thing is Charlie so come like a doughy like slippery sweaty guy with five kids totally Sheen I would rather pick a rock star than like somebody has fucking five kids well the crazy thing is that Charlie Sheen calls himself a rock star but he's on this like the longest he's on this completely family sitcom no I mean it's like this really bland you know kind of dope did a wonk you know it's no edge to it the eggs like really vanilla you know yeah it's the number one comedy for some reason I talked to my friend today he watches it every week and I'm like really Charlie Sheen and like a gay guy yeah yeah but he's like well it's like it's the exact same show every week you know it's like the same premise every week but he's like it's it's it's one of those shows you could just kind of watch you know and it's easy to watch smooth and smooth and funny enough well you know what man means reality television has proven that you don't really need to be that funny to get people to watch it you just need two people people you need it needs to come a part of their everyday existence they get like let's see what's going on Ice Road Truckers shit the boys are on a slippery road again becomes I mean Ice Road Truckers there's a show about slippery roads I mean if if that can exist you can have a show about anything and a sitcom that's like been around for a while it's fairly decent got a few good laughs in it but I bet for Charlie Sheen it's like he's smoking coke and banging whores and then he's going and doing a super bland television show I bet that built up inside of him I bet that like made him go more over the edge his character was pretty much himself though in that in that show I mean it might have been Ella's show but he still was a drunk guy that just fucked a bunch of chicks I mean it was like it wasn't he wasn't really off his road a little what really hot guy that's in trouble and what was the movie that Charlie yeah there was just that's your nose hooker what was the movie shots he wasn't scary - what was the movie that he Charlie Sheen played himself but it played like him like he was friends with the main character evening at a John Malkovich yes John Malkovich that was an awesome cameo with him in it do you remember that no yeah I don't know Charlie Sheen DC platoon he's about a motherfucking good you know what holds up dude Silence of the Lambs holds the fuck yeah I watch Silence of the Lambs Illinois it's a good goddamn movie still it still holds on in the basket yeah it's good it's well-written it's one girl dude fucking Anthony Hopkins was a bad motherfucker in that movie still you know he's become like this guy that does like these movies at sake please the wolf man's dad you know I mean the wolf demon in every movie and you didn't see the wolf man no but he was also in Super Mario Brothers wasn't he he was in something fucking retarded even in the movie man even the wolf man which is a terrible movie he still like has these scenes he's moments where he's just this bad motherfucker he just he's just doing crappy ass movies but you go back to Silence of lambs and you realize what he's capable of if he gets a good script if he gets a good part Anthony Hopkins just smashes it out of the ball having that move fucking smashes him dude he's so on like it crackles like it makes you nervous for her while she's talking to him and you fucking believe 100% that dude has murder in his mind when he's talking he's talking about Anthony Hopkins is fuckin thinking about eating her he's thinking about cutting up he's allowing himself to go to some crazy dark place where he's acting well you could tell like that's really what he's fuckin thinking about man he could turn it on he can go to that dark crazy psychotic worst-case-scenario human example he can go there in his mind that's the difference man that's just like comedy man it's like you you you have to really be fuckin thinking about what you're saying there's not just the words and the noises that represent certain things to me I gotta know that you're thinking about these things as you're saying you know and you that's the difference between a great performance and a performance that's just kind of mediocre and can trick done ease you know if somebody really nailing it I told a 22 year old actor that just got here from LA I was like acting is just pretending like you don't know what you're gonna say next and he got so offended and he end up moving back to Tennessee can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen bitch listen if that's all that set this fucking kid off some porn star telling them that acting is fake I always said that even if you can lie you can act and if you can lie to a crazy girlfriend you can act under pressure it's not that hard it's just pretending the hard thing is auditions auditions are way harder because you have to pretend that it's happening when you're in this really unrealistic scenario yeah I'm sitting in this office and there's people in desks chairs and they're facing you with paper and they're reading off the paper and you're responding like it's really like this is just like this is just too strange it just doesn't it doesn't ring real to me have you done any 3d movies for real yeah yeah I just did three penthouse movies and how did they do they how do they differ from like doing regular movies they make you do weird angles like you have to spread your lips out towards the camera or something you like sort of throw your clothes toward the camera or kind of like put like one leg off the bed like kind of dangling toward the camera or something so what about one guy shoot loads do they shoot them at the camera like in the zone you'd have a pillow behind you you know like eight feet away for for the 3d effect to work so you got it you got it like clearly you've never seen very low the distance about some dude what did some dudes eat like Peter north what does that guy eat to make so much sperm it's ridiculous so what I'm saying and my ex-boyfriend told me also PC exercises like the muscle that you use like stop your pee oh right you know like like a Kegel like a woman has a Kegel muscle like you the PC muscles what guys have I guess apparently if you just do that a lot it can strengthen the muscle and you'll shoot further really yeah I dunno right now practices some people just egg whites yeah they think if it looks like loads loads will come out more with some placebo effect it's like the secret but with loads I'm sure the longest load ever who do you think is the furthest anyone's ever shoot a load because I remember hitting him myself in the face once when I was 16 and being shocked oh yeah coming off and I pulled out and you know I still do that I make it rain all the time I got a fucking why is this squirting on my forehead yeah I don't know we're really far like what's the forget in the lamp anybody's ever shot a load what is the furthest I I was more I would say so I mean art no it depends like there's the headwind yeah yeah it's like depends on how long your dick is cuz you got like you know some giant dick John Holmes type dude we have a massive advantage yeah he's got a six-inch reach advantage it's like John Jones it loses some pressure going yeah but maybe a shorter barrel you got a lot make sense alright like a 38 special but it seems like a rifle would be much more accurate right yeah here's a little tip by the way if you put a little bit of green Saint Patty's Day you know the same Heidi's day this is awesome st. Patty's Day put a little bit of green of food coloring around your dick before you have sex and when you shoot out it actually isn't green yeah that's good and what if you make a baby and it's fucking looks like the Hulk what have you ruined the baby what if it gets in the spermatozoa and the spermatozoa get some crazy green signal and shoots it into the egg and some honor the kid becomes great how would be fucking awesome what if it's before I mean I mean if any not that but I mean if anybody's ever like done something where like the kid came out of funky color because of that yeah like I know the sure that people probably been tricked to think that like maybe a white woman having a half black baby and back in the old days right look that's the story of Jesus right I mean the story of Jesus most likely as it marries a whore right yeah that's the story of Jesus right Immaculate Conception right come on bitch what kind of crazy shit is this but back then in the biblical days you just had to accept it maybe she was raped by one of those strong maybe yeah she's dressing like that and the fucking robes icy bitch sirrah maybe she had a dirty ass too and back then you only lived to be like thirty you got to get your rapings in Y you could listen you've had an electric charge inside your asshole this is horrible so is this conversation yeah we've all agreed to be here so these people have agreed to tune in and I know 2360 of them right now are regretting their choice a lot of people sexy - it's gonna be a lot more than that you've done other podcast for right it does - death squad good Marin I just did the Nerdist podcast Oh see your that's what's fascinating about you it's like as far as like girls that are in your business you're much more known for your personality than any of the other ones and I think a lot of it is those videos that you do you know yeah you have a mailbag we read people's email in my space when I when my space was before it was like just a spam graveyard I would get like this really super heinous hate mail that was so just so many different levels of wrong and rude and misspelled and English and English yeah just like really me and like I hope you get fucking cancer and your brain and dive aids cuz you're a whore and you should accept Jesus in your life right Jesus Christ would not fucking waste his time to wish me dead of AIDS and cancer yes Jesus Christ to try to help you out you fuck ignorant as well there's a lot of that out there you know when you're allowed to be anonymous it's a very uh normal situation it's an unnatural situation in human behavior we're supposed to like we get rewards and we get pleasure and we get all this from interacting with each other but when you're interacting with each other completely anonymously through like wires and it's all ones and zeroes to take them down a peg say something really mean dude I guess of that all day I get it every day on Twitter there's always some douchey dude who says something and just block them like I'm not I'm not gonna argue with you sound like we we can't spare followers two hundred thousand something with 37,000 something I mean it's closer than that I would rather have one that follows me that's nice that's it yeah 280 million people wanted to be cunts I would stop being on Twitter you know it's it's fun though the cool people way way way outnumber the shit heads yeah and like you get like really cool interact like last night I wrote on Twitter that that Charlie Sheen was reminding me Thompson always talking and I said we were right outside of Barstow when the drugs begin to take hold and then I got like hundreds and hundreds of tweets of people quoting hunter as Tom's yards from the book it was fucking and wait it was really good let's get down to brass tacks how much for the ape and they just kids just kept coming over and over again I'm like this is fucking awesome like this is like a really interesting thing to interact with people yes yeah I have a message board and I want you to be a part of it because you would fit in like a fucking yeah it's a great message board and it's all psychos and weirdos and calm you're a moderator board it's on show really right now we'll make you I'll make you a moderator for surely we need more women we only have like a couple of women moderators I got to make sure that you know you can you can handle it at first yeah you just can't you can't snap and go crazy it's not worth it but when people are douchebags I send them to the retard room I have two rooms I have like well one is like the main the main forum you can go to there's a combat sports forum for like MMA stuff and then there's a a regular forum and then there's a podcast form and then there's special ed and special that is if you're a douche bag if you act like a shit yeah you want to insult people all the time for no reason get in the fucking cards and I mean yeah but because of that we've like established a pattern and accepted like levels of communication and everybody's really cool there it's a fascinating yeah and fascinating fucking shit comes out of there you know there's so many interesting there's a story that I read on there the other day about these new fungi that they found in the Amazon rainforest that turns ants into zombies oh yeah it takes over the ant's brain ants they're horrible anyway well that's why they're there they're there to to keep the am popular at bay this fungus grows inside an ants body Wilson - it's right out of its head grows out of its hat it is dead yes amp juice out of its and it also causes other ants and cannibalized they cannibalize each other and there's four different types of them and then when one bullet ant will find that this fungus has infected they are they're all to fill it and take it deep into the woods that's like they know what is fascinating I was like I'm life narrated by Oprah Winfrey I wasn't real and I think that I think that was it was like the generic version of planet Earth okay such a badass bitch I was watching I watched the Oprah network fascinates me I watched it every day yeah I got a TV in my gym and I was working on the gym I was you know and I was watching the Oprah network and I was watching her she was considering whether or not she should have Nadya Suleman on her show whether they should help her and they decided to get someone to come on and help her financially she'd help her it's interesting no it's interesting listen the Oprah like how she talks and how she thinks like you get behind that woman like she's like she really is all about reaching out and helping people be the best person they ant they they can be and love but that's really what she's into like it's so easy to criticize her it's so like cliche she's on TV all the time you know it's like it sees an easy target but when you look at like what she does like she is a bad motherfucker yeah you know Oprah is like everyone would hate the shooter if she wasn't like the amount of money that she has is if she was like being when Charlie Sheen is people would be like fuck you you black brunch I got this bitch now I was like life rock star I'm like a freakin rock star from Mars my friends if anybody's a rock star from Mars its Oprah you know I mean she has some man that's just like in the shadows and shuts his hole that guy doesn't even talk unless spoken to sits around waits he waits three spaces behind her and he doesn't say shit unless she asks him a question I bet Oprah has a very big areolas I don't think they'll finally force it out yeah I think yeah full gale that's the that's the rumor right that's what's up that's cool I mean that the own station has like a bunch of gay friendly stuff on he had a great show the other day I was on the Oprah network and it was all about transsexuals it was a very eye-opening man to look into because I have a friend whose son is becoming a transsexual his son is about to change from a man into a woman and it's really strange because it sounds about to change from a man to a woman and his son is like into girl still no son is like becoming a lesbian very very bizarre and he's gonna go apparently I don't know if he's gonna go through the operation I don't know what the entire full story is but they had this whole show dedicated to it and they had some kids I mean there was a boy that was like a little boy okay he looked like he was like seven or eight years old and he was wearing a dress and he wanted to be a girl you know I'm like whoa like you you know the younger you start the more convincing you can be if you just avoid going through the whole mail cube everything you stand a chance of being a more convincing woman after your transition yeah maybe I mean if you can really be sure of your choice at that young and age but it's God you talk to the parents and it's like very convincing what they're saying it's not it's so easy if you're a normal gender oriented person you're like seven years old you're like I'm changed I'm transgender yeah it's not a very rare I agree with you but who knows if it's a part of what's going on as you're young and then as your hormones kick in as you become 18 to 19 maybe say no I'm just a gay man you know maybe maybe it's like that simple maybe like straight right what I'm saying is I don't I don't think you should really necessarily be fucking with your hormones until they settle in I mean I can understand someone being a grown adult and saying okay I want to be a woman I faked this long too long this is what I want to do but when you're a child shit I don't even know what the fuck I was gonna we got could you imagine you know like that's probably normal for straight dudes you know what you know and if I turned out to be like a completely straight person I probably wouldn't been like lusting over nudie magazines and like showing them to people and meanwe I think you have to cut a little gay change I'd like a little gay gay girl right well you're talking about children I think you have to account for a change you know I'm not saying you should be completely discreet this you know discredit the idea that this is really a girl trapped in a boy's body what I'm saying you have to account for change like as far as like adding maybe antibody and stuff like that seems like a really radical choice one of these kids was like 10 years old they were crazy medicine and they're kids and they're right right you know which is another fascination I mean it's better I think it was would be better if a child was like I know this about myself instead of like I'm going my kid is unreasonable like because they let the TV babysit it and then like pump your kids full of Ritalin because they're hyper they're just maybe undisciplined I have a national neighbor they used to live down the street that was ritalin up there kid and it was really fucking your kid up more when they try to identify their sexuality or their gender the kid was not a bad kid the parents were terrible they were terrible at parenting and the kid was lost and the kid always seemed to me like they just wanted someone to tell them what was up give him a hug tell me what was up there though two of the most lost kids ever because their pants were a fucking holy wreck he would yell at each other in public and it was just a disaster and they started pilling their kids up and it was like I was living next door to zombies it's like look at this like did their zombie but these people been taken over by spores I mean that those pills might as well be the fucking spores that Jack those ants the same thing it just takes so it's a chemical thing that happens to a kid where it takes over their brain rewires it and makes them think and behave totally differently and then also these kids were like these little slack-jawed zombies I was like wow they done neutered their fucking kids brains yeah you know it's fucking crazy crazy how easy it is to have that sort of that that sort of power to just do that to your kids I know to another person who I know his kid is not fucked up and he's got his kid on some sort of riddle and shit because his kids too active because his kids is fucking alive and they're older they didn't have the kid until they were like in their 50s can't keep up at all so they have this fucking kid is nothing's nothing wrong with this kid I've talked to him he's just a wild little motherfucker you know so what are they good they got him all pilled up it's like all right good luck one is how many generations and we had of people that were pulled up like this though no I don't think so with social engineering made prozac came into mind when I was I believe when I was in high school was the first time that was like institutionalizing people in the body lobotomizing people and shock their jewelry like a blue iris right but she's never normal after that but it's never his lawyers get she electroshock therapy repeatedly oh wow no let's try to cure a porn a lot of people don't know who blue irises she's on the Howard Stern Show a lot she's a old school porn stars yeah and she passed away she passed away yeah yeah this is a difference between the few people that are so completely out of control that need to be institutionalized to people that don't like their job so they give you a pill so you don't feel like shit at the end of the day every day there's a lot of people that are just doing that they're physically not healthy their diet sucks they don't exercise and they do a job that sucks and they wonder why they feel depressed the other day I mean it's real simple you don't need Prozac you need a new fucking life I mean that's what you need to do you need to need to figure out what the fuck you really want to do and realize that you're only here for X amount of years so the more time you spend not moving in the direction of your actual interests the more you're gonna fucking hate yourself you're gonna be depressed it's just natural but they don't say that they give you some fucking pills there's a lot of people that's why I join her Colton oh that wasn't water you need funny chicks our cult is all you do is just don't be a douche bag it's so simple I don't know well you do our little but that's natural look at what you do look at how many people are yelling at you look at how many people point at you and sending you shitty emails all day it's natural to be on the defensive it's start fucking with diaphragm Chelsea Handler was like Angelina Jolie is a cunt because you like Jennifer Aniston oh really that was look at Chelsea Handler sticking up for Jennifer and only she'll see forever oh my god no Chelsea since the early days of I wrote one of the reviews of her book her first book was a my horizontal life she's a I loved party girls to me I think it takes every kind of people at that song takes every kind of people when are you gonna get her on the podcast we need to get probably way too busy I wouldn't even ask her she's got a sitcom going on she's got some sort of reality show going on about her show and then she's got her show she's way too busy sure that's already a show really yeah that's very Sanders show but she's got a show fuck it she's got interesting people behind the scenes she wants a showcases including our they're really good for any Eva she's on that show Eva from Denver yeah used to work she's assistant oh yeah he was the best I love that chick I haven't talked to her forever she was this really cool trick that worked for the Denver Comedy Works just super on the ball and super friendly she should take us to media like one of the nicest people ever and then became friends with Chelsea and she was such a diamond that was just waiting for someone to come along like I told her like if she moved to LA I would give her a job as an assistant um yeah the coolest chick ever my god I've never even thought about having an assistant cuz it seems so preposterous that you really can't wait what the fuck you got a business manager you also need an assistant could you give me a latte you know I get out of here let's dig but for her I would do it come back screaming and covered in Burns dishwasher dust vacuum sure ya know the line have fun you know you can make a game of it get him a riding mower right my brother loved that when we were kids he was it was like uh my parents bought me this thing so I could mow the lawn I could write at I can drive this thing like so I was actually working well we loved done mowing a lawn there's an aesthetic sense of pleasure a sense of accomplishment like you've created something visually that's pretty it's kind of an art form I work for a landscaper did you I fucking hated my hardest annoying thing I only worked for a landscaper for a whole week and he let me go because I kept burning too many lawns what I mean is you fuck up you don't know how to use a lawn mower that well and you scalp the lawn no I scalped a couple ons he got mad at me it was hard fucking work and what'd it be paid pretty decent for what it was but you worked every goddamn day from 6:30 in the morning you showed up at work and you work till three o'clock in the afternoon and there was a gang of fucking houses to mow you had a whole route of houses and you had a mow their lawn and chop trees down shit it's back-breaking fucking work and everybody's a douche bag you working with mostly like there was like a few guys that were kind of cool but there was a lot of like you know there's a lot of resentment to anybody knew that was coming along there might possibly take this shitty job away it was a real man terrorism junkyard dog type of shit hard man a job as a laborer and any sort of realm construction or that's one of the most the best waves to get motivated to get your shit together as a guy get a fucking job carrying bricks around all day you know get a job where you realize what work really is well you realize what it really feels like to be exhausted for five dollars an hour five dollars an hour and you're carrying bricks all day I would have no idea worst but it makes you think about that shit all the time if I ever think about like not writing or ever think about not working out or not getting in the tank or anything like that I'll think about working on a construction site and carrying bricks and cinder blocks and bags of cement I think about a hard that was like what I have to do I just gotta get up and work at something awesome just get up bitch you know it's like this is a lot harder things you could be doing if you don't have that experience though if some fucking terrible thing you know like for you when you are done with all the electrocutions of the asshole like doing a regular porn must have been like goddamn it's a cakewalk all I have to do is blow somebody well yeah now actually there's a little bit of a transition that's happening in porn right now where they're kind of going away from that like my blonde wife is getting fucked by six black guys to like more of wait a minute why are they stopping that's being phased out now that's like making a cheeseburger Adam a taste yeah parody they're making parodies they're making romance movies that are like romance romance II novel like rom-com type of how many vampire horns are there a lot of I like parody they made I don't know they made a parody of absolutely everything yeah some dude on my message board as an avatar parody and

one inter no I didn't really love Enter the Void but yeah I wasn't in the end of the void but that's also because I've actually done DMT and I'm like this is the representation of it a soul so simple and well I have a lot of problems that may be but I just thought it was cool the visual effects well yeah what I thought was cool is the first-person perspective that was really interesting after them I felt like I was really that guy you know if you really got into it I mean like why I like seeing it through like almost like a video game a first person shooter perspective yeah I thought that was kind of cool there's parts of it I liked but it was just too much it was - I didn't see anything that was like Oscar movies I think King speeds is that about Martin Luther King or what the fuck is
