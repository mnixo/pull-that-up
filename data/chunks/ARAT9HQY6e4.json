here we go four three two boom Jorge Lockhart John Kavanagh how I focus hello sir great good to see ya good to be here um so Saturday night what are your thoughts now that we're sitting here it's Monday morning the the khabib McGregor fight went down Saturday night um obviously hugely disappointed yeah you can get the results from the night I still enjoyed it I tell it's a great fight I'm looking forward to watching a back many times all IKONOS fights I always pull it all the lessons away that I can pass on to their the next generation of coach bud yeah overall I really enjoyed the fight and I'm devastated that we didn't get there yeah how much time did you hear have to prepare for this fight I mean he's always in the gym you know he's always knocking about but I guess it was official about ten weeks time example even since the eddy fight I kind of knew or at least I thought his next MMA fight would be happy if it just just kind of made sense if it wasn't going to be the Diaz but then as time went on that that seemed less and less likely and happy obviously was doing great get you know kept on winning so was there a part that was gonna collide was there anything that was surprising in the fight um the the right hand in the second round yeah who's the cracker was beautiful overhand right immunity it's a staple of wrestlers overhand right in close but he doesn't generally do that he's more job and then close but that was a great shot and this style of takedowns everything was kind of what we expected and we'd spent a lot of time and preparing for that um yeah just I you know kind of expected round one for sure gonna get a takedown so the the goal of round one was to get out of it still having energy we didn't want to put a huge amount of effort into trying to get back open real one it seemed to happen many times and his other opponents and he kind of got back to the still you know really tired so realm on make him pay you know do our best on the way in fight as hard as we can but if we do end up down it which is against figured we'll be there tried to stay seated up if we end up in our back just tried to play guard until until until the Bell except it'll be a 10-9 round and for round two again same same plan do as much damage as we can but if we end up on her back and don't put a huge amount of effort in trying to get up he's an absolute master Reid grounding people and that turned out to be a 10-8 round you know he got some good shots there and obviously he landed the great right hand so that was a bit more than we hoped for Roundtree teams started kind of turning a little bit in our favor and we did a lot better at keeping it in the middle defending the takedowns so the plan was to slow him down a little watch him slow down a little bit in the third fourth and fifth yeah exactly yeah so I think at the beginning that the the consensus was Carla knocks him out in the first or Herbie you know takes over from two on like first to win the third round was probably a bit of a surprise to people but and you know you know phthalic went to fight if you look at that from eritrean he wasn't able to hit any takedowns and so hoped that's what we have a go around tree we could defend two takedowns a lot easier and start landing air shots and that did happen for a fir entry not as well as I as we plan not as well as we hoped and then round four you know we hit another great takedown made it mistake given off the over hook exposed to her back and that was all she wrote yeah he has such a unique ability to tie both legs up with his legs yeah and round one I thought Conor said well we practice for that for to keep our legs bent you see guys he straightened her legs and then from and Conor did do that a couple of times but he was able to continuously get a leg free so not until the last 30 seconds or so of round one he didn't really tied him up and get him flattens back for the majority of that he was against defence you know used his hands to keep upright tried to learn little shots yeah and George you you dealt with Connors weight cut you deal with his overall nutrition as well yes sir right you can move it up if you want to see where you were take me wedgie hey it's a work in progress you uh you worked with him on his way cut like what what was his weight before he started camp um you know it's almost exactly the same way it was when we we actually started the cut you know we want to make sure that his weight was little higher than you know obviously with the boxing with Floyd you know speed is everything and we wanted to kind of slowly drop that way down but with this want to keep him as big as possible and then you know cut all that weight so he what was his way he was about 171 when he got back into that cage so so what was his weight when you guys started camp uh about that same thing same thing exact same thing yeah it was all about so it's not an extreme way cut no 15 ish pounds in terms of cutting it was easy what's the most you've ever had someone cut um so you know on record with drew Dober he showed up at 185 on Tuesday and had to make 155 by Friday so yeah that's the biggest one biggest one on record he's a big fella I've always looked at drew Dober and go huh fuck is that guy make 155 right no every time I see him I'm like you know yeah you made me work my you know we're for my money yeah well it seems like it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world for him to do either no I mean I'll never I'll never be like you know weight cutting is the happiest thing in the world but I will say that like because the amount of muscle mass people look at somebody like him and they're like embalming he doesn't have a lot to lose and he doesn't have a lot to lose but he's got a lot to cut muscle is about 17 muscle tissues about 79 percent water so more muscle you have the more water you can cut you know so if you do it properly the more muscle you have the easier it is for that cut and that's why he's able to do that how did you learn how to do this honestly man like I could be like when I got this degree and I got this degree but there's no degree in actual weight cutting Marine Corps and I was a heavyweight when I started fighting and then I ended up as a welterweight and Wow yeah yeah didn't do so well as a world away kind of the opposite of Anthony Rumble Johnson right right you know was definitely not it wasn't it didn't work out well for me I was better at cutting the weight and I was actually at fighting but learning through this process okay this this this works like this and this works like this and there's I mean there's so many studies they're out there you don't like you like the NSE yeah you look at you know PubMed and all these other things you you see I study over here and you see a study here okay we're gonna put these two together and actually see in terms of actual weight cutting it's it's rough because nobody's ever actually gonna do a study with the level of dehydration that these guys are doing you all right like oh yeah this this how you rehydrate these people mm-hmm it's never it's never gonna happen so you know luckily we've you know the amount of custody we work with over 200 UFC fighters and just just I mean just in the UFC I mean you obviously work with a lot more like Bellator and stuff like that but being able see that okay this works this doesn't work when you say you work with them if you work with 200 fighters how hands-on are you with 200 different fighters it changes you know based on you know how how much they need us you know a lot of the guys we literally don't show up until the week of the fight you know some of that corner you know I'm out there six stay weeks I'm out there and monitoring everything and you know the people that we are out there for four four eight weeks it makes life a lot easier now do you have anything to do with his meal planning as well like during the camp corner yeah a hundred percent everything to his mouth I'm monitoring so from the moment you guys start in camp 100% what about outside of camp is he taking instruction from you and yeah yeah Carter you don't you get me okay I'm doing this you know like in terms of like workout that's one for him like all that pre-workout post-workout what should I be taking I tell him exactly what he should be taking and then you know he basically stays on a regimen and acting today man like diet the word diet means fujita habitual way and I like guys to actually live life a little bit you know what I'm saying when you're you're so regimen like okay I got a I got account this car but I got account this I got it's it's ridiculous you know what I'm saying so you know the fact that he actually is like okay I just I just need to monitor what I'm taking pre post-workout makes life easy for me did you go to school for nutrition like in the Marine Corps I was a combat conditioning specialist I was that actually instructor trainer so like when you go there's this place called martial arts center of excellence right and they actually hand-picked Marines he kind of been you know like in you know certain situations in the military Brian Stann was was actually you know a part of that and then they actually started something called the combat conditioning program and I was actually the the guy that they actually had to teach all that so they sent me everywhere like I got to work with the the people from the Olympic Training Center you know I got to work with the P I in Florida you know like just learn from a lot of different people but in terms of like I always say this from way cut and there's actually not a saw like there's not a course like you know if you're a dietitian or whatever that's that's great but that doesn't help you with in terms of wake up right you go somebody's like hey man I gotta lose 30 pounds in three days you know it's a very specific kind of discipline and so it's something that you kind of have to learn along the way and no one's gonna teach you in a school 100% but you do have a back some sort of background in nutrition 100 and do you vary your diets based on the way guys trained or is it like pretty standard or does it vary depending upon how much weight they have to lose no no it every diet is different like I mean people like themselves never be the same twice the same person so like if you wake up at 6 o'clock the morning versus eight o'clock good morning you have to have a totally different diet you don't like we feed people from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to bed what would be the day if someone likes to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning versus someone let's get it up at 8 right would it be in what time they have to train that would that be the variable that's one variable you don't we base everything off type tight timing portion size or hormonal responses of foods you know I'm saying like most diets nowadays they actually you know they kind of stick to one aspect like the Atkins diet you know it sticks to the types of foods you know like Zone diet is portion size we we actually stick to all of them you know like type timing portion size women response food because you know if you look at all diets they they all work all diets will work you know like if you're if you're consistent to every single diet if you do the same thing every single day you think you see you're gonna see results but are you going to get to a specific weight and is your performance gonna be you know increased overall if I camp you know that that's when nutrition becomes you know the extreme valuable what would be the difference between someone getting up at 6:00 and someone giving up an eight-oh time the you know so if somebody wakes up at 6:00 they're gonna eat it 6 o'clock the morning somebody gets up at 8 doing either 8 o'clock in the morning we feel you have them you have a meet as soon as they wake up yeah absolutely yes sir you you you feed somebody till the moment they woke up to the more to go to bed like what would be a typical breakfast meal we we we live off the the basic rule you give give people what they need when they need it so you know if you're aerobic all right your body's primary source of fuel is gonna be more fats your brains primary source of fuel is gonna be carbohydrates or glucose right so we we give them like a lot of fruits right the glucose feed the brain a lot of fats you know we make sure that we you know we get a good measurement of Omega 3s 2 Omega 6s basically about about a 2 to 1 ratio so throughout the day you know if they're if they're we throughout the day we give them you know fruits vegetables omega-6 omega-3s and then when once they start working out then you know depending on the work out then that's we start giving like more starches and stuff like that so basically just sort of like breakfast of fruits and things along those lines to get everything moving understand and then after you first work out like what's a typical post-workout meal I depends on the actual workout we use something called when you got the metabolic equivalent right so basically the met is the amount of oxygen your body uses and that that's going to determine basically the amount of calories at your body so let's say a strength and conditioning workout what if they're going to do weights and sprints and things all right so what we'll do is everything is actually like a formula everything's everything is brick broken down mathematically so we'll take their met and we'll we're going to scale of one to ten and we multiply that by the actual amount of weight that that individual has like kilogram so we'll say their intensity is a ten let's say they have a hard workout intensity of ten we multiply that by the amount of kilograms that that individual has I believe and then look at the formula we basically divide that by 200 to multiply that by the duration I actual workout and that'll give us the amount of actual calories that that individual was actually using for that workout so every workout is going to be different so if you're if you're if you're doing like what's the word I'm looking for like training in terms of like guard passing and stuff like that it's gonna be a lot different than if you're sparring right so a lot of people they actually they feed themselves the same way if they're if they're doing form versus actually training like sparring you don't they they do the same thing I'm gonna take two you know I'm too stupid protein I'm gonna take this this and this you have to you have to actually feed the body differently every single every single right so we'll take that formula we find out okay this amount of calories that this individual burns during this period of time and then we actually break it down even more because if you jog and you burn a thousand calories right and if you lift and burn a thousand calories same amount of calories but you have to refuel the body differently because if your job your by using a lot more fat if you're if you're a lift and your body doing a lot more carbohydrates again it goes to giving the body what it needs what it needs it so we'll look at it like okay well if it's a level of 10 and then will literally eat when we have the formulas forward so I tend would be 80/20 so you find out the amount of calories this individual is burning and 80/20 meaning 80% carbohydrates 20% proteins right and kind of carbohydrates you mostly funk so your body has some called you have receptors in the body right you know people think that like well you'll fight a fight if I need carbohydrates my body's just going to ingest them and it doesn't work like that your body can process about one gram of carbohydrate per minute right but if you are able to actually access more actually use more than one transporter than at a time you can actually go to about 2 3 2 point 3 grams per minute and yeah yeah blue one blue two blue three before and you got sq 1s clue too it's one of these has a different thing that actually activates him right like an Eskimo 2 is a soul independent transporter right if you if you use a sodium dependent transporter blue forest is an insulin dependent transporter blue one is I believe I'm sorry blue 5 is a fructose it's activated by fructose right so if you use more than one of these transporters at a time you activate these transporters they're literally you're able to actually synthesize carbohydrates twice as fast so you're doing different types of carbohydrates and mixing them together saying like what would be example of a group 1s blue one is sort of independent transporter so you gotta make solar independent you got to make sure that you add sodium right blue for is the insulin dependent transporters what what's gonna help insulin be transported you need something that's a glycemic so something that's dextrose - what what is like a food that's a good one well salt break it down salt and then glute goo 5 or a goo 5 would be fructose which would be fruit right so we you don't offer I'll break down fruit for them and then dextrose is basically like any type of sugar that you have you know I mean so that's basically we we incorporate sugar fructose and salt you put those together now the funny thing is is when you incorporate caffeine it's been shown that caffeine post-workout you'll you'll see four times the amount of glycogen in the muscle post-workout if you take the the caffeine really yeah did you take it in form of caffeine pills or do you take coffee oh and I'll incorporate it with like the the post-workout you know like coffee shake yeah it's I and a hydrous like that it's a it's a stronger type sometimes I'll see like okay if he's if he's obviously go to bed later it'll be more of a green tea type caffeine but yeah I mean the funny thing is like it's shown that caffeine post-workout four times the amount of carbohydrates are in the muscle and I have yet to find out why I I thought to Andi gallopin yeah yeah bro I wanna get you in the room for like an hour just talk to you but I was like I asked him and he's a connoisseur I don't know either and I'm like shit so but you know the thing is I don't know why but the one thing I do know yes 100% you know caffeine post-workout everybody's all about you know caffeine pre-workout caffeine post-workout is extremely important and with our sport it's so important because you got guys that are working out two three times a day you know they need to be rehydrated they need their glycogen storages they need to be up so did you essentially learn how to wake up by cutting weight yourself I learned everything every way not to a good by myself rehydrating uh yeah the the rehydration III did through you know lots and lots of studying lots of studying you know when I look back at what I did for rehydration I see my head oh my holy crap well it's a relatively recent thing right think about it with wrestling I mean wrestlers didn't do such a good job of rehydrating and they were basically competing the day of the weight cut and they're trying to be a little bit better about that with the way they allow people with hydration tests and colleges and you know it's still yeah still rough yeah but at least with them there's no head trauma that's it yeah that's the big thing about MMA is rehydrating with head trauma how much more difficult is your job now with you sod in place where they can use IVs I love not having IV man really swear to god yeah why um you know if you look at every study out there like the oral rehydration is actually better for the body everybody's so funny nowadays everybody's like ah you don't like organic you know earth grown nutrients gonna have this get out of this and then when it comes to like cutting weight it's like now let's jam a needle into the freaking body let's shove nine thousand milligrams of sodium chloride in their freakin veins and that's gotta be good you don't if if God honest truth if they were fighting the same day a hundred percent like yeah you need an IV but they have over 30 hours to rehydrate the body you know the body can do that on its own and it's gonna be a lot nicer a lot more natural in terms of absorbing nutrients and giving it what it needs here's the thing when a lot of guys cut I break it down like this is the amount exact amount of sodium that your body needs a lot of a lot of people they were taking in like two two bags of IVs right one bag is nine thousand milligrams of sodium chloride they would take in 89 two bags that's 18 thousand milligrams of sodium chloride and they wouldn't take any any potassium your body's is it's got to have a it's a balance of everything yeah yeah like oh you know like omega-6 like you look at fats you like you so many studies at the omega-6 is bad you know like causes all this information still a deal maybe six does cause information your but your body needs it your earth needs it your organs need it but it needs a good amount of omega-3 to kind of clear that out same thing sodium needs potassium you know when you look at a muscle pump you're like sodium goes in to a muscle potassium comes out well how does potassium get back in what it needs magnesium magnesium if you don't have magnesium you have to have this this balance and it's funny because these guys with you know Beckham day they would take an IV and then and then what they have they'd have soup in there like I mean did take more salt they would never basically look at the amount of potassium now these guys are like a George what do I take my all guy ethers he does he did and I think it's a lot healthier for him so they're getting more sophisticated with it Johny Hendricks recently said that one of the reasons why he retired is because of you sada and they could they wouldn't let him use the IV's anymore but he said it made a big difference with him yeah there's uh there's a lot of people that are in this job Joe that they have no business being in this job doing what I do like I mean I just got our streets I've talked to him oh how many people like you are there out there I know there's dolce yeah and there's uh who else like there's a nutrition and I think perfecting athletes things like that I've talked to a couple people you know like out you don't at the end of damien aussi I always tell people I'm like yeah come on white this something you know a game is baby she's like what I'm like it's the ability to percent Lee you give a fuck right and I'm like like you know real game is is actually giving a fuck you know I'm saying like there's a lot of people that they're like I want to help you I don't want help you out you don't sound like that people actually like oh cool but then they realized and that's why they work with us because they we actually give a fuck like we care you know you sit there and just like we taught you know like we were working with a great Jackson well it was it was there's Johnny bones and there's a fight or whatever and and I'm like I might hey guys you know like obviously we work with DC and DC he's got exclusively with us like how's he doing with the rehydration like he's using a rehydration I'm like dude the rehydration I gave you guys was before the IV ban like this it's not the same oh you think you talked to his nutritionist so when to talk to him and and I was like you know what's osmolality of the the water that you're giving them and you know like you looked to me like I had a dick on my forehead like he was like the fuck I'm like what how much fucking salt you give him he's like I'm not giving him salt I haven't give him salt this dog you know fucking trying to camp why would I give himself and I wasn't gonna sit down and give him a fucking whole lecture on nutrition but like how the fucking body works or anything like that but I was like I just I went to Johnny bones and I said bro fucking start eating fucking salt like your life depends on it brother because I mean basically the muscle contraction that like you have a lot of that depends on the amount of sodium that your body has you know the amount of you glycogen absorption the muscle contraction neurons in the body it's all dependent on fucking salt I mean I guys are like why I don't fucking know salt I think a lot of guys were in this in this game because they want their name of a fucking highlights and shit like that you'll see me like well it's real bizarre that this is such a gigantic sport yeah I mean it's an enormous sport but in terms of even the way people train its I mean no one really there's not a consensus on what's the what's the correct way to do it and then when it comes to nutrition there's not a consensus and then there's the rehydration and dehydration factor that doesn't exist in any other sport other than boxing I mean this is the only and I think it's more extreme in MMA than it is even in boxing for the most part right it's just it's such a crazy thing that you've got these super high level athletes that are dealing with jimbros I mean there's a lot of role like real high level athletes and I've talked to their trainers and I'm like what did you just say like you're a gym bro how did you get with this guy this guy's a fucking world-class fighter and he's got some Schmo from fuck Gold's Gym no offense Gold's Gym but you know what I mean some fuckin guys got a tub of shit with them is like gotta take three of these and for those because I read about it in wheter you know I mean they don't really have a strict protocol and it's not really based on science and blood work and and real science 100% like it's it's sad because the sport is at the other day like yeah my guys jacked your the strength and conditioning coach you do like biggest fuck you like yeah you're seeing it is not you know like and oh you know a couple people your now my agent you know I mean like right right you know like in terms of NFL like we work with you know we work with a lot of different people that we you know with Demi Lovato and shit like that like if it's a distant close to you face are sorry gets everybody does it I saw brother it's alright and I know my voice is there people like good you're gonna have subtitles on this not the years it's the mileage Anderson Silva got popped and then people start circulating photos of Anderson's trainer he's 70 years old built like a brick shithouse I mean it's got veins coming out of his fucking muscles they're just like garden hoses have you ever seen him no it's hilarious when we found out that Anderson got popped for steroids then they saw a picture of his traveling well I wonder where he got them he got photo the guy is a picture of him taking a selfie at the gym no no that's not the guy this strength and conditioning guy he's fucking jack he's a darker gentleman and he's built like a brick shithouse he looks more like a bodybuilder than he does a strength and conditioning coach you got it the guy with the white shirt on yeah that's him but that's not the photo I want there he is he's he's in his 60s Wow yeah see see well it smells good without my shirt on whew south of the border supplements but you know but the point is that even like the best of the best world-class fighters they don't necessarily have a background in nutrition or kinesiology or exercise physiology they don't necessarily know exactly the way to the right way to approach things I mean shit for years fighters wouldn't even drink water in between rounds right you know I mean they thought water made cramp and there's a lot of like crazy shit involved in this sport still to this day yeah you don't know what you don't know and I tell you our goals by the end of next year we're gonna work with every single fighter in the UFC we have over 200 fighters in the UFC right now every single one so you're gonna push everybody else out fuck off fuck everybody fuck everybody you know what are they doing wrong everything what's what are the other guys doing wrong everything they don't know what the fuck they're doing job that gonna be sent they have no fucking clue what the fuck did all of them Oh 100% I have people fucking shrieking they're like all the trinkets see like the drinking uh was it assault water doing the fucking during the week of the fight and uh you know I hear guys from ATT like a George Wyatt why the fuck would they do that I'm gonna because this fucking that's asinine I have I have people fucking be like all we don't want to cut carbs out because we want you know like it takes a specific amount of time to rehydrate carbs they you know their thing and it takes like four fucking days but when you actually do it properly like this is this is all scientific shit like it literally takes 24 hours to rehydrate some of these fucking glycogen stores if you fucking take their water right so every gram of glycogen holds on to 3 grams of water right and we can literally find out based on the amount of muscle tissue that individual holds exactly how much glycogen their body holds and how much water that is attached that glycogen do you work with you all Romero we did yes that dude I look at that guy and I go how was the fuck is that 185 pound man you want it you want to hear that you wanted some stats with us man yeah so people people were like uh you know like I don't have a hundred percent you know like rate Joe and I ain't making weight I'd say I think pride and I say you know cuz I'm taking motherfuckers that I know they're not gonna make way I know that you know Zayn what dude I'm like game am I you know I don't want to either a be there to be like bitches he's not gonna make it and I cut that shit I cut it I've got coaches that I'll he's being a pussy I'm like dude he's gonna die he literally is fuckin cut point two goddamn pounds in the last 30 minutes he's got ten pounds ago he ain't gonna make it he's kidneys are gonna peep nah he's being a pussy I'm fucking fuck you guys man I cut it off you know I'm saying with you well so in Australia he showed up at 198 and he missed by two and a half pounds right with us he showed up 217 pounds and point two and the only reason that he fucking missed by that point is cuz the fucking Athletic Commission yeah New York Rome off they fucking came in there like I was like eight I'm bro I'm like cool down you know take your time I gave him 45 minutes like fucker just chill we put him in the bath that did the Commission came in there and alike how you feeling is that I feel good to go and they were like you know the guy you literally said he said you know unfortunately that's what all heroes say but of course the all heroes are dead and I'm like first off that's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking her in my life like there's a lot of fucking heroes that are still fucking down down the line you know I'm saying what's a quote and I'm sitting there like what's the fuck are you talking about you don't know saying right but they're like he's you know he need to be downstairs we're like well he has a whole hour and they're like no no he's in his be downstairs anyway he got down that he was still sweating on the fucking scale Joe and it was only point-to-point fucking - that ain't shit here's my thing he showed up to 17 and we got him point to over to 185 M on that Highway 197 and I stand next to him I'm like how in the fuck is that a hundred eighty-five pound man he is a straight-up silverback that dude is so jacked you want to talk about genetics I mean what kind of fucking genetics is that dude how first night we fucking we're doing the KO with them he had never done he never did a bath I know he never did a bath because he went in backwards like literally like we're like no your head goes over here bro like he'd never been in a bath he got out he fucking lost a lot more weight than he expected and he fucking what ask naked man fuck comes to us ah I defy you oh yo bro fucking not hug me like shaking me and shit oh Jesus I'm losing my man card tonight but you know if I can I'm not gonna fucking you know he's that that's he's like the freakiest of all the free Catholics yeah you know of all the dudes where you just like you look at him you go what are the odds that someone turns out like that you know of all that all the guys are like like a regular looking guys like an Evan Dunham regular looking guy and then you got a you over Mara like the world's not fair and that's him on weight right I mean what what date is redemption okay yeah so that is him back in the day when you had a cut actual wait for the weigh-ins that's before the like if you look at them with the new ones where he gets to rehydrate yeah such a freak man fuck where he tosses and the fact that he's in his forties like what in the fuck and they test that shit out of that dude yeah they don't even make sense like one plus one is 18 how come you don't work with him anymore I do just we had we were working with Robert Whittaker and they decided to not use us the last week all right so we call it you see the last week bro so I said there's a lot of shit you know how it's good yeah I do know how this game goes this is this is one of the more disappointing aspects of this game is that I feel like fighting in particular is so it's so dangerous it's so personal it's so it's there's so much involved that I feel like loyalty should be at a premium and it should be one of the most emphasized things like your team it's long as you have a good team like your team is critical I mean it's it's it's everything for the the motional stability of the fighter but also for not feeling like you're a piece of shit you know and I think there's something to that these guys that just dump their trainers and and dump their coaches and then hop from Camp to camp and don't get a better result from it I think there's part of them that realizes like hey man this guy brought you to the dance and you abandoned them somewhere along the way because you know you saw a greener grass on the other side of the fence and it didn't turn out to be greener and you don't feel like a champion you know you feel like kind of a weasel right and there's a lot of guys like that but then there's guys who are there in a situation like TJ Dillashaw right where he was in a situation where he was like this doesn't seem right like you I don't like the way this camp is going and then Duane Ludwig comes along he's like I am fucking learning and growing with this guy and he's like look I gotta go guys I'll still train with you I love you but I got to think about my future and then they're like you fucking weasel you left us but look he's right you look at the results clearly he was right I mean TJ right now he's he defended his title beat Cody twice one of the best in the world you look at his improvement his overall growth and his improvement inside the Octagon like he was right you know and so it's a it's a it's a weird balance like when do you pull the chute when do you Bale when you get out of there you know when uh you know the first person I ever work with Brian Stann you know me and you were in the Marine Corps together you don't like it so a reason I'm actually doing what I'm doing just cuz of Brian yeah you know I love that guy dude he's just all around I wanted to run for president bro I understand you know motherfucking sure like you know I was this analogy I'm like oh you know that people are like oh this guy's a good guy is never you know cheat on his wife you've never done this done that I'm like dude look at the motherfucking let me have options Brian that motherfuckers got options yeah he's like I'm like you're so goddamn good like you yeah you get texts from like a female and they be like hey I just did a photo shoot bah bah bah but my wife would not appreciate you you don't text me in this foreign fashion I'm like I hate hanging out with you bro you made me feel like a horrible person just another day he's always on you know he's just a good mother a great guy he's a great money fucking guy you know I mean but you know I think that a day man like yeah you know he like you built like a goddamn t-rex you know big head fucking short arms you know what I'm saying and you know it double you see you fucking one of the words I don't got to you know UFC it wasn't working out for him I'm like you need to go to 185 you know you help me out cut fuck yeah dude that's Rob's doing in the Marine Corps helping guys get down to a weight and and then the idea that she performed that's my job in the Marine Corps so your job at the Marine Corps was helping guys get down our weight so that the performance would be better in combat right you you have to actually you have you have weight standards and you have performance standards in the Marine Corps so how would you dial that in based on body fat based on just how much mass there can't be carrying around there's a lot to it but yeah it depends on you know yeah absolutely like okay this is to build this individual this is our activity level this what time they wake up's with them they go asleep this is what their MOS which for us that's military operational skill like you know if you have something that's a recon marine they're gonna have a lot different caloric needs and somebody that's a fucking madman you don't right right so you know we give the body what it needs you know what is it you know and it's funny because we never have a base diet you know like if somebody is basically they don't have an anaerobic work out throughout the day you know like a Kennedy a diet is perfect for them you know I'm saying like they don't need those carbs they don't they don't like those like you actually need a ketogenic diet because you give the body what it means when it needs it when you're aerobic your body's primary source of fuel is fat your body's primary fuel is is gonna be that fat so what do we do we feed it the fucking fat you know what I mean if you are anaerobic and you're you're training throughout the day then we actually incorporate a lot more carbohydrates I'm just giving bribe for someone who's lifting weights doing my blow Civ shit yeah yeah you know people nutrition a lot like religion if you fucking don't agree with somebody like I'm officers like I did this guy I don't know what the fuck he's talking about I've noticed that it's really it's very bizarre and I've had some conversations on the podcast recently about that recent one was the most civil one was between Lane Bryant and Dominick D'Agostino where they were named Norton rather where they were talking about ketogenic diets versus carbohydrate diets and bio Lane you know do you know Lane Lane Norton yeah well I I did see that super super smart guy George won on the podcast better watch this okay yeah super smart guy very but more emphasizes carbohydrates whereas Dom D'Agostino was a they're both scientists like legit scientists he emphasizes ketogenic diet and it's it's very it's a very interesting conversation because Lane really never was on a ketogenic diet for a long period of time whereas Dom emphasizes that when you get fat adapted over longer periods of time four to six months it you your body there's some legitimate benefits with cognitive function yes and even performance benefits as time goes on but certainly is in terms of your energy level your ability to perform was that systemic no matter what systemic how so yeah so like a day like you know like guess I'm like Connor you know if I put him on the ketogenic diet he'd be fucked you know I mean he's powering output quick fast in a hurry you know your muscles use that glycogen from that that part of the muscle whatever they're using right there and then because he's explosive a hundred percent yeah you know and that's and that's where I think people have a problem like you know like you I'm not you know I will say Voltaire you know he says you know the true knowledge the individuals not by their by the actions of you but but by the questions they ask you know like a lot of people are like a la carte you know like peanut butter good for me what want the pen I can't talk to you when this road is too long ha is it good time to travel motherfucker is when is it good for you that's the wrong question it's when is it good for you like what are you doing what is your activity what kind of peanut butter is that shit that's piled up with sugar or real motherfuckers did I tell you this is people like it's like people like Wow eat healthy I'm like what the fuck is healthy you're putting oil in your gas tank and putting gas in your oil pan you know I'm saying everything that you do in a restoration you beg you break down your body your body's using fuel on a different ratio based on the activities that you have and it's like well if you're giving your body carbohydrates but your body is using fats why the fuck is that healthy you know I'm sorry it's not it's not it's so it's so simple but you know we we start people follow this program row and and they're like holy shit I feel I'm never hungry you have energy in this because you're giving the body what it means 1 all the time yeah now do you limit any foods are there any like do you do you allow people to eat pasta or bread do you cut anything out of the diet they I mean honestly they can have whatever they want at the right fucking time you know like if you look at like the metabolic equivalent right and for somebody like yourself to say you go on you fucking bust the fucking workout out you can burn 800 calories you know you burn 800 calories gonna work out no problem right so if you're burning 800 calories and you're anaerobic and your body's primary so the fuel is gonna be carbohydrates let's just take all formulas and all the math out of it for a sec but let's say 800 calories there's four calories for every 1 gram of carbohydrates for you to fuck it replies what you need you need 200 grams of carbohydrates just to replenish what you just did for a workout how many motherfuckers do you know take 200 grams of carbohydrates post-workout none none very few but by the end of the week feel like I'm tired so what kind of carbohydrates would you like say if someone wanted to do like something like a CrossFit workout or something like that a lot of kettlebells chin-ups box jumps shit like that right what kind of carbohydrates - do you have them refuel with post-workout fructose dextrose caffeine and salt that is all those 100% because that's going to activate all the salt as a carbohydrate no no no you just add it - yeah yes because in terms of transporters that is one that it activates the glute one is a sodium dependent transporter now how much car like would salt how much salt would you add and what kind like and how much weight they lose so so say if I did a hard work out of I lose seven pounds so what if I kick you know I beat the shit out of the bag fucking run around the block do hill sprints right I come back five pounds lighter or whatever just give me a number okay so basically with sweat now this is I'm negating a lot of fucking other math okay but every pound is basically 500 milligrams of sodium every pound that you lose for salt you lose about 500 milligrams of sodium you lost seven pounds you would need basically 3500 milligrams of sodium to fucking replenish with fuck you dude that seems like a lot yeah let's think eating a lot of other fucking things I'm telling you but a lot of things like people are like that's a lot there's a lot of science did you look at this is from fucking average Joe how many average joe's you lose seven goddamn fucking worth zero right really I lost half a pound so that's 250 take 250 milligrams of fucking sodium you're good to go I mean so how do you have them take the sodium in what form hmm it's all gonna be like I actually want them to take carbohydrates during and post work during yeah so we'll do some fruit fruit yeah so it's gonna be blended fruit and in the dextrose is gonna be a specific type of sugar they drink it and what happens is when you increase insulin that actually decreases cortisol right cortisol is not a fucking bad thing it's a glucocorticoid that actually helps get rid of information problem is like people like nowadays like ah it's the fucking stress hormone so your body doesn't create a fucking hormone that's bad for you it's not going to like your body does not create something that is bad for you this is bad for you at the wrong times and then the wrong dose excessive against yeah yeah is instantly bad for you fuck my ask your diabetic they're like fuck I wish I had that shit you know but we're only having an excessive amounts you don't and that's that our problem right we just we don't know winner taking how much to take so do you have guys take those glucose gels like those like runners take or no no no no no I actually you know like can I find out what guys like - you know I didn't add a like consistency on a diet is the most important fucking thing if I get something on the Zone diet the Paleo diet the fucking grapefruit diet through 75,000 diets in the fuckin you know on the internet right now today if I fucking have you consistent on one diet you're gonna fucking see results consistency and I always tell people I'm like I'd rather you be 100 100 percent consistent on 10 percent of my diet then a hundred percent cuz consistent on 10 percent of the diet you know I'm saying like so at the another day like I have guys that are laid they have sugar teeth line fuck me alone goddamn eat some fucking Twitter post-workout your body's gonna fucking use it your body is gonna use it you know I'm saying I heard that before people that recommend can be a hundred most work out is it the best no you know like you know I know you have run the Patrick talk about the ATP trap and shit like that but you don't like when you're when you're done working out you know your body needs those carbohydrates quick fast in a hurry it's gonna activate toast those transporters and your body's gonna use them is it the best 100% no but it's it's keeping your sanity and it's consistency if somebody works their ass off they're like I know if I work my ass off I get some fucking Twizzlers yeah you know a lot better results so what would you recommend though so if someone isn't doesn't have a sweet tooth but you just say say hey what should I use to replenish my glycogen lock heartily supplement line no honestly like like a fructose fructose is from fruits right breakdown fruits right sugars like a dextrose is it's a it's a basic sugar you know like yeah it's a monosaccharide so you can find that in just about any kind of fucking sugar like cane sugar what do you think about like chocolate milk I know a lot of guys were doing backend stupidest things that was a big thing for one dude this is thing about studies and she like I mean like it was like this is this is the best thing for fucking post-workout right saying fuck that was from the NSC asea come out with another fucker study was like well you know like 89% of fucking Latino populations lactose intolerance 93 percent of the African American populations lactose-intolerant fucking I was like 90% of the fucking Asian American populations like this diet I'm like you guys literally just did a goddamn study and you shown that most of the goddamn populations like this entire but you're saying that the milk is the best goddamn thing if I can give a stupid it's asinine you know like caffeine protein like again it's easy if somebody's like if you take you know chocolate milk post-workout but it like so what do you what are you using when you workout what is your body using when you workout is it using carbs you're using protein if your body's using protein as a source of fuel you're fucking doing something fucked up man you know I'm saying like literally your body go through you know gluconeogenesis yeah like fucking you know it'll it'll turn protein and the fucking carbohydrates but that aids the way it's supposed to fucking be right so you would never recommend someone doing like that carnivore diet no no no I see I'm never I'm never never guy like I'm never gonna say never you know I'm saying because depending on your lifestyle you know if you're sedentary and and you know you don't do anything that's anaerobic I'm gonna um I would promote the the ketogenic diet for somebody yeah it's not even a ketogenic diet that's the thing about that carnivore Drive yeah the Patrick went over pretty much in detail and she thinks what's going on for the most part where people are seeing results is basically calorie restriction because you're not just you're just not eating that many calories meaning only steak you know and in terms of like how much you're using throughout the day and a lot of these people are eating like 1/2 meals a day and they're losing massive amounts of weight they're down to the weight they were when they were 21 and they feel fantastic all the gut problems go away all the different you know issues they have with autoimmune diseases go away and she's like this is all mimicked by calorie restriction diets she's like this is most likely what you're experiencing and there's a bunch of other nutrition experts that are sort of examining that because it's become quite a movement this yeah coin board diet you look at like people are like calories and calories out you know like 40% of calories from protein or actually using the breakdown of protein so if I eat a hundred calories of protein 40 of em all the fuckers are used to actually break down the protein and then there's a thermogenic effect actually heat the body like you eat a lot of fucking me you knows your body's hot as fuck I'm saying yeah that's one of the things that's one of the things they actually recommend if you're cold like if you get drenched if like you're you know and your to rewarm like these things that they do REME warming drills in the military and they recommend you eating yeah and eating is a big part of trying to heat up because your body starts generating heat to try to break down the food that you're taking in yeah yeah there's so much that we look at like 10% your metabolism actually comes from breaking down food 10% that's a fuck ton of calories man that's yeah you know and that's when we actually come to rehydration like in terms of the fighters getting ready for the fight we actually take a look at that like do you want your body breaking food down while you're fighting and stuff like that right you know your enteric nervous systems your body's not gonna be like you know we're gonna break this food down oh actually you know like with your nervous system it bodies you know if you see a fucking bear bite it's like hmm we're gonna break down food we're gonna run from the fucking bear you know we're gonna fucking run so it says the nor I laugh a nephron through the body fucking you stop digesting but it doesn't doesn't mean that shit's not stealing your fucking gut right but with that being said like in terms of the mean shit like that yeah I mean like a lot a large percentage of that is actually used to break down foods and it's like we talked about glucagon and I get so many fucking people that are alive that's not how the body works you know like I I get that's not how the body fuck course we need when you fucking eat the protein like it's not like your body's like oh we're gonna shoot goo gone through the fucking system but how many times have you eaten a fucking high pancake fucking breakfast and you like let's go fucking kick today's ass no you were like the fuck let's go back to bed yeah you have a big ass omelet you know you like suck today's dick let's fucking go kick some ass you know I'm saying like you have energy this blue glands fucking neo threesome obviously like it's not the way the body works but you know in essence like when you're when you're taking specific things at specific times you're gonna you're gonna promote the usage of carbohydrates more or less so those pancakes wouldn't be a bad thing after workout after workout 170 now what you really haven't wrap that up so fruits but what other kind of sugars do you recommend a guy take post-workout hard workout I mean we we give like who work with so many guys like you know like they're sponsored by this supplement company this company but William whatever the fuck they like in terms of the dextrose and dextrose is just a monosaccharide it's basically just a simple strain away from that fella there you go bring it to you moves the arm goes this way goes that way jomi in technology genomics this just keep it near you just keep it near you that's all you do you don't have to lean it moves towards you that's what I'm trying to say but grab the arm alright this is really good and before a fight yeah what do you have like when like say if Connors gonna fight it 9:00 p.m. is the main event when do you have a meet and what do you have miss oh we have to bring it down to the amount of meals right so what we do is you basically find out the amount of muscle tissue that individual has so exact just weighing what on the day of the fight 170 years right so we have things like it's not necessarily your like your weight but it's true lean muscle tissue so you have your lean body mass right so if I let's say you're 200 pounds right you're 200 pounds I'm gonna say you 10% body that means that your 180% 180 pounds of lean body mass a lot of people like that means I'm under 80 pounds of muscle now that actually means the only 40 percent of that is actual lean muscle tissue now each kilogram of lean muscle tissue holds on to 13 grams of glycogen so we have to find out okay how much muscle bladder how much lean muscle tissue do you hold all right now how do we find that out is 40% do you have them submerge no do you brother I have literally like we've had the hydrostatic testing we've done the the fuck you think is Canada thank you thank you I appreciate that's what that's great bro fucking this big word jackets cans the one that they use the performance they got yeah I don't think I'm saying it correctly but piece of gear right yeah fucking the road they're in crisis they're wrong it was a really hundreds and bro I literally here's the thing there's things that you know scientifically can't happen your body cannot be anabolic and catabolic the same fucking time so if you're like you know I got some of so many people like hey George I went on a game muscle lose fat so do i man I forgot that but it's impossible it's impossible your body cannot be anabolic and catabolic at the same fucking time right well we went we went into that machine last year with fucking Connor right it showed him and the other day I'm like that's how good I fucking him but it showed him gaining muscle and losing actual fat that's impossible those are incorrect those really impossible over a long period of time you're saying obviously some people do gain muscle and they do lose fat like if someone's on the side like so if if you gain so here's think okay if you gain muscle mass your your body fat percentage can go down right you lean out right so let's say like oh it's like okay I gained 5 pounds of muscle and I only gained like a half a pound of fat my body fat percentage is gonna go down cuz your body weight got heavier the hundred percent but could I lose fat no I did not lose fat if you look at like ok your body has it make sense yeah I see impossible so how does one lose body fat well you got to be the kid Bogg state you got to be at a deficit and when you are at a deficit you're not gonna gain muscle lose my Hut who said yeah if anybody says otherwise they're full of shit and they're on the infomercial if you buy today so that's just how the body works the body works in that if you're gaining muscle you might have less percentage of fat but that is because your body is getting heavier right right yeah you could lean out like your body fat percentage can go down right but if you look at like a DEXA scan it's gonna be like okay you have let's say you have 50 pounds of fat it's not gonna be like it shouldn't be like oh now you have 40 pounds of fat and more muscle right 100% I see what you saying so you calculate how much lean muscle mass he has melee muscle tissue excuse me and then you coordinators meals accordingly right yes so say okay well he's gonna fight it this time or she's gonna fight it this time this is the amount of meals that they're gonna have dictated on the amount of you know like after rehydration and so on and so forth this month this amount of carbohydrates that they actually have to have and it's funny because men and women are totally different I know men used to work with cyborgs I don't work with cyborgs that was an extreme weight cut though right yeah we'll go with that yeah yeah I mean she's yeah she's it was tough yeah chris is a I mean it's no fucking sign you know she's a big girl you know yeah like you know so she walk around that mmm you know I don't remember but I think it was like in the 70s you know saying she got all the way down to 140 yeah we make any fucking sense I wouldn't when they were making her do that I was like why are you making her do that when you don't even have a goddamn weight class for it I was like a you making her do that to show that she's close to 135 right right a sense like there's a 145 you could 5 her fight at 145 9 on the 140 like what there's no 140 weight class right right doesn't exist right it's so weird that was so weird with her and I would see her like the videos of her fucking crying and trying to get her down that wait I was like that's insane yeah no it's definitely and you know like with every way cut man it's fucking tough you know like well Chris like me and her God we got close I think we got a little bit too close you know that's one thing I learned like I have to keep I have to have a separation you know I mean cuz I'm like it's fucking a bath like right you know yeah out that and with her I was like man we were so close as friends like fuck dude Brian s what you're saying yeah you can't get hardcore yeah fucking weed a bitch are you crying you don't really have to do this do we like right yeah who's the hardest that you've ever had to lose weight fucking Vick James goddamn bear really yes bitch he's six fucking for fighting at 155 he's a big fella yeah I dunno I got him sweet tooth George touch come on man that's Mario's like LT makes weight like near some Oreos we have we have we have a little you know gay no they're all right you get two Oreos if you do this you notice he walk around he's in the 90s man Jesus Christ mm-hmm how much do you think that affects his actual performance do you think that hinders him yeah of course man it does so it's a point of diminishing returns right like you got to figure out when do you hit that point yeah because you look at guys like Dustin Poirier done much better at 155 yeah it looks better did I mean I work with you know I'll never forget like I work with Dustin when he first got into UFC and they were like it needs to be 145 in in 21 days let's fucking do it man you know like him and fucking you know it's so many motherfuckers you know I mean you're absolutely right you know you look at that Kelvin Gastelum you know people don't realize like the point of a fight camp is not to make weight the point of the fight camp is to increase your skill increase your ability like it should be pure ization you know I'm saying we're talking about like the big beef yeah you know big motherfuckers yeah you like this guy's the street conditioning coach you don't know shit about periodization do you work with Calvin yeah we were together a lot and it's you know like now we don't work so much together you know like when he was and that's one of things a lot of guys will work with us when they had to make weight there's certain guys like Frank Jaeger Eggers like didn't he invests in himself he knows that does he I mean he shows up almost on weight but he's it's all about performance he knows that you know I mean same thing with what he's a guy I've fought at 155 when he really was 155 I get him to 125 waxey's de 125 because people were talking about him fighting on 135 you saying you could get him to fight flyweight armasight but you know and then people's like well I'm that and I'm like this is my first whooping ass at 145 and 155 like when they were talking like oh you Skidmore and he was champion at 155 I'm like why the fuck am I gonna try to cut this guy if he's a champion well I mean like you know because he would be the champ champ I know like 125 you think so bro have you talked to him about you pull them aside no i havenít sound I will never ask you I will never sit down if Frankie was like George why he gets 125 of my thank God or like thank goodness right but he's never asked me it's all never bring York with TJ I have worked with TJ I don't beat him a good friend and this this thing with me Joe like I work with fucking everybody so like in terms of politics like I'm like I'm a dirty little slut that goes from one room to the next you don't do they allow that more so with you because it's a weight cut thing it's not like you're you're not teaching it's not like you work with TJ and you go oh I know TJ's tendencies and then you work with another guy I'm not I'm not training you to be a specific individual you're training people person a more specific way what I tell people is I'm making you the best you that I can be and in terms of business I'm like don't you want to beat the best them and they're like fuck yeah alright so it's okay so that's why they're okay with it right that's interesting that's like that's a rare section of the sport where you can do on but you have to like and I've had you know we we have a pretty and we have an awesome team you know I mean but as one they have to tell him because they just so fuckin you know like when you're with that with the fighter for it can't be it super close and I'm like bro like that's fine here close with them but it's it's it's okay to root from but we never get to a point where root and we talk shit about the other fucker team because right so we work with them and we work with khabib you don't I mean for a long time you know what I mean so who does he work with now I don't know I have no idea and he's had some real struggles in tough cut man he's a tough motherfucker what was he doing wrong you know and it's funny because I I think that it's uh there's there's like a language barrier and things but you don't like there's also like let's say you're cutting weight right and you're looking at like okay common sense if I drink water I'm gonna fuckin be heavier right so fuck drinking water but you don't realize you got you're reading you know NGO attention aldosterone system that's fuckin gonna be activated if you fucking cut back water early people don't realize that shit man you are saying so what they do it's meaning that your body tries to hold onto that water yeah everything everything in your body is created from a stimulus you know I mean like first stimulus is you you're hot right when you're hot would you buy these fucking sweats then what happens well oh shit like my body's dehydrated blood pressure starts dropping and it starts releasing a th you starts releasing now you know aldosterone so like that and fucking you from sweating you know so they don't look at that what they look at he's like I drink water puts weight on we're gonna start drinking water early how long you even work with Connor um since the Josie Aldo the first time I work with Josie Allah do so it's been quite a long time yeah yeah yeah and how much of a difference does it made John yeah it's huge because until then I was winging it you know the way quitting part of the sport is cloaks and daggers and you're trying you're overhearing conversations and you're googling so you know I was it was pretty much guess working on my end you know I got them to 145 nearly 20 times on my own but when we brought George in there and I wasn't even just about making weight what I what I noticed with him was that every session was productive there was no sessions where I was he didn't have to pop in his shots or soreness or you know that would just be a normal part whereas when we brought in George and that that was a lot each session was a lot more effective so it wasn't just about making the way it was making the training camp where he was improving the whole way through it he got down to one 45 a couple times and he looked like like a monster yeah like a zombie yeah it was terrifying yeah yeah I mean that had to play a big part in your decision to no longer have him fight at that weight yeah yeah I mean I we'd already gone up to 155 his his final fight before going to the UFC was was at 155 and I was kind of like oh my god you know this is this is suiting him better because me joined he was a sort of a scrawny 16 17 year old but any start becoming a man so getting down there was getting scarier and scarier and then his last fight outside UFC I thought you looked fantastic it was a handy way cut and he just looked at stade looked like a tank now the offer came in a couple of weeks later Sean emailed me and said we're offering you a 145 fight in in April and of course I told Connor and he's screaming and running around we didn't care what weight class if he had a said 125 we would have we would have done it Ryan Sean specifically want us as 145 and we've sort of went we went back to you know back to that lighter weight class and was almost accidental and then as soon as we got the opportunity you went back up again yeah he looked very thick at the weigh-ins he looks heavier he ones bigger yeah and it you know that's a part of a you know the life cycle of an athlete if you're with the same guy for over a decade you're gonna see changes you know he's turkey now he's not 18 anymore it's it there's these different things going on in his life so yeah you know it's that's the benefit I think of working with someone for a long period of time rather than you know kind of gem hopping that you you'll know what they kind of can't do and he does a lot of unconventional internal training right in terms of like physical conditioning like I know he is he still doing that all that stuff with IDO portal yeah anytime Ito's in Europe he tends to drop into Ireland we have a great relationship with them and you'll play around with that I you know the reality is he's most of our time is going to be spent on the fundamentals of MMA and the great thing we do is he especially in training camp he'll come in near the end where you're just tired of doing single leg defenses you're tired of doing pad work and he comes in he does all these fun games so we're still working out we're still he's firing his brain in different ways he's where he's working on coordination on balance for me is the you know the head trainer it's like it's a nice break you know is I am I'm sure John John Wayne pirate heard say you know when you have a fight coming up you know how many miles you're gonna ruin you know many kicks you're gonna troll every now and again you want to come in and one do so long back jumping in the air spinning elbows itself is it breaks the monotony yeah I'm amazed is Fanta because it's all the martial arts together it's you're almost never going to get bored because you can always do something different but it's still there's still a repetitiveness to it but it's nice to break with something unusual now how much does training change when you're dealing with a specialist like a guy like khabib who is just a grappling phenom how much do you shift the emphasis of the training to takedown defense working on grappling and do you work mostly takedown defense or do you just work overall wrestling so the takedown defense becomes a part of that as well all of that but yeah definitely maybe talk about later like it was one thing I could change is that I think I was too defensive in my mindset for this training camp but habib has very specific types of takedowns depending where he is whether it's shooting on the low single on the in the middle and then on the fence I you know long before economists used to fight I'm I loved watching him that's kind of my areas defense I just love you right from the Randy Couture days how to use the fans and and a peep dozer to a you know a new level and you know when to take down as a here in Conor he hadn't actually done it until the Alec winter fight so it was nice that we kind of got to see that at the high crotch Oh I see a bit of DC in that the high crotch and then tripping the fire leg and I think he blocked the ones but he did catch him with it and so you know it's very specific takedowns um definitely for this training camp was the most specific that we went and then I remember about a week out or whenever it was he did an interview and he said well if if he doesn't make it we'll fight Tony I don't care who it is and I was going I hadn't even looked at Tony's fights and so long so I mean the other coaches like start like okay what does he do again oh yeah he has that style and because we wore so specific for this one Tony could possibly be a fight in the future when when you when you think about the future now after the khabib fight how woody what are you thinking he's thinking about just rest let the dust settle and then look at the landscape like what how did you approach it I might but he doesn't what is he he's screaming and chanting for the rematch within minutes it's hard to push for that rematch though after that fight right sure no I understand the logic of that you know Tony's kind of earned and stuff but I also understand this is a business and it it would be a huge fight you know the rematch would be a huge fight don't you think that it would be difficult to sell because of how dominant could be wasn't that fight I'm sure I I do think the ground Trey showed promise and like I said I would like to have change things up a little bit specifically a more offensive mindset I thought defensively we did quite well but offensively we weren't really where we usually are and and you know right when the fight was over I was thinking you know what I was kind of going into this like not to lose but not to win you know I mean his shots warden as crisp as they normally are he had opportunities to hit him especially in the third round and he just seemed to be deranged something was off and it had to do with the fact that he hadn't fought MMA in two years absolutely you know that's right yeah of course of course and we tried to mimic as close as we could in the gym and I brought in guys that he didn't know and I would say this is fight day and he did you know he would do with George exactly what's gonna do in fight day and we'd have a referee and so to get the fight for but it's still in the gym which was you know is he at a position now where every fight has to be a gigantic super fight and is that Ness is that a problem in that you know what I thought after the fight after it was all over I was like you know what a good fight would be would be him versus Pettis like that would be a really good fight and it would be a really interesting fight in terms stylistic matchup and it would be a great fight I think for Conor to sort of just get a wild three-round or I guess it would probably the main event it would be five rounds but uh it would be a wild fight yeah that would probably favor him yeah yeah I mean that the boxing huh you know when Tyson Fury was kind of coming back together man yes you know not the toughest going into World shit doesn't happen if it doesn't happen in MMA there's an issue with that I think yeah you know Eve's yeah you know in his early stages who's fighting all the time and as is natural as you get older and as you achieve more it is going to start becoming you know once or twice a year it's just a natural progression of an athlete I don't care who you are but the wild fights that he could have at 155 pounds whether it's James Vick or just engag or Pettis or there's good fights for him yes that aren't necessarily could be they aren't necessarily Tony Ferguson but they're a good fight to get that timing back get everything locked in you know 100% but you you have to factor in his personality and he's only fighting now for fights that are really interesting to him he's not that interest in anybody not that I feared Mayweather paper right so you know yeah what more can he you know even with his spending well that would be the the eye on the future and odd the eye on the rematch you know getting everything dialed in so that when he does have a rematch with khabib he is samurai sword sharp yes sir as opposed to having two years off one one boxing fight in between them and then such a grappling heavy contest yeah I don't disagree that would be a trainer you know for me as a trainer that would be the ideal but it'll be hard to motivate him for that I think it would be hard to motivate them and it's it's not the you know it's not really the UFC model it's there's obvious it was gonna be though you know I mean it was gonna be those anybody could tell the UFC what time it is it's Connor W time yeah anybody is the guy that can say hey this is what I want I want a fuckin tune-up fight I wanna I want a tough guy he absolutely could yeah and he absolutely wouldn't you know it was like when he lost it he has one fight yeah and backstage he was screaming and shouting all the top brass epic in the rematch at 170 as quick as possible i man I'm in the background going please don't they did you not see that fight he's a terrifying individual right let's get a 155 fight and and yeah yeah okay maybe you meet him again but he was not letting that go and four months later he fought the the exact same guy over and that's where he is right now with khabib that's all and that's all I'm hearing from you yeah well listen you could sell it for sure especially with the fucking chaos after the fight and you know just keep Dylan dannis at home he's grounded yeah so with what would you do differently um like I said from it from a strategy point of view and my number one thing would be to be more to think more offensively that we definitely had opportunities to land shots and then when Connor line shot you know you know watch the Eddie fight back again it doesn't take him a whole lot of shots and he rarely misses you know even if you look at strikes that didn't land those strikes were for a reason they were to see what way he holds his hands he was like you know you still watch an Anderson Silva back in the day and I thought they were the you know they have a similar kind of approach but this one we just didn't seem to be landing and my only when I looked back at the training camp I did spend most of her time with a defensive mindset and and I think that's a mistake but don't you think that a big part of it also was that he had to be tired because khabib is so such a mauler 100% and they have some sort of in effect and ability to land those shots yeah yeah I'm sure I did and that was part of the strategy for one and two you know if we did end up on our backs was not to put a massive amount of effort into getting up just play guard and stay safe because you know the next round starts on the feet and tried to do damage there but it's still tiring you know I'd you know up Connor gets a hard time about as bad as cardio all the time but who is could be faced that didn't look like that after two rounds I am Quinta I quit yeah yeah I mean I was super impressed with Ally Quinta in that fight especially considering he came into that fight looking for a third a three-round fight I mean that was what he was trained for right he was trained for a three-round fight and it changes up and all the sudden he's in a five-round fight for the title fucking crazy yeah crazy set of circumstances but it almost makes you wonder and this is me you could speak to this better than anybody how much how much is too much and in regard to training for a fight like this like maybe training for a three-round fight is the way to go when you have to fight a five-round fight so you're not so fucking beat up by the time you get to the fight if you already know how to fight five rounds you've already done it and if you're a guy like Connor has just got so much experience in the game it might be that it's like there's a point of diminishing returns in terms of your strength and conditioning and that guys just go too far push too hard and just don't have it when it comes to I mean how many times have you seen a fighter be over trained when they fight very often definitely you know they've given their best rounds in the gym and it's very difficult well in those last two weeks because anxiety is starting to grow so you want to train harder right you want to get one more sparring and you want to ya know because the fights coming it's almost like when you're back in school and you're cramming for an exam well it's the exams tomorrow I'm gonna stay up all night studying right you know I actually got me to college so it worked so much but but I'm fighting we got to do we got to do the opposite we don't have it we gotta have a solid taper off period and that is hard when you're dealing with a 20-something year old man and he's dealing with what's what's coming around the corner so but you know that's that's the trainer's job you know how much did he taper off for this fight same as usually we have a better two taper off period where we start bringing it down he did out you did actually spar even after that and you know we were working very hard for this fight and the limit you know somewhat limited period of time so we did didn't taper off quite the way we would normally do but roughly two weeks if you want to do a rematch and the UFC did grant agreement this is obviously dependent upon how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handles the legal ramifications of him jumping out of the cage attacking Dylan Danis a subsequent brawl the chaos that ensued visas I mean you're dealing with a lot of legal shit in this fight that that could hold things up I mean they held both guys purses correct well he held Habib's Connor got his yeah okay Connor goes purse and could be between who the fuck knows what's gonna happen with him you know and yeah I hope they're they're lenient on them and I'm not just so we can get a rematch I mean I love watching a fight first night and and I can I can stretch myself to understand his reaction yeah I can stretch myself to I can't stretch myself to understand the other guys reactions on what they did yes leave Egypt over the cage and he jumps lights it's not the end of the who was the guy that jumped in there was wearing red who punched Connor yeah I'm not sure I think that's his boxing coach but I'm guessing he's a fighter he fights for the UFC in the red okay there you go I don't think it was either well like I know is a different guy he was you know he hit Gannon yeah and a guy in a suit that I heard is this Russian manager he hit Dylan either way um actually in the cage when your mind went in and hit him from behind there yeah you know I can't I can't understand that like I said for her babe I didn't think it was you know it was it's just it's almost it's such a foolish thing to do because I think today they already won yeah I know that Dylan was talking shit he was angry but well yeah she didn't say anything because I heard a few people saying that no I was we slide Dylan I didn't see what he did but I could hear so he didn't say anything when I watched the back I seen he kind of beckoned them on yeah you know just stupid and the fight stuff but it I didn't think it justified that level of response and maybe there was something else in the lead-up you know Dylan is a bit of a troll online so there was probably a bit of a buildup of voter stuff but um yeah like I said it wasn't that big a deal to me what happy did yeah just really wasn't well there's two ways of looking at it in terms of like the trash talking and one way is that man does that sell a fight I mean it sells a fight mean Connors one of the best ever at if not the best ever at talking shit to opponents getting them riled up I mean it is the reason why Joe's a Aldo lost his composure and came charging face-first at Connor I mean you've got to think emotions played a big part of that it wraps up your stress it ramps up the fighters anxiety anticipation and it ramps up the pressure on them to win until and this emotion that they're fighting with fuck's up their judgement it just does and it's a major tool that Tonner that Conor uses and but on the other hand people say well I'd like it when fighters are respectful and this is one of the things that could be saying this this this sport should be about respect you shouldn't be talking about someone's family shouldn't be talking about someone's religion you shouldn't be talking about someone's country but you know on the other hand that's one of the reasons what Connor is so fucking huge it's not just his results it's all the other things that come along with it it's the excitement that he generates the shit-talking the who the fuck is that guy like that kind of shit that's a big part of who he is it's a part of who he is as this cultural icon I mean it's one of the reasons why people love them I mean they don't just love his ability inside the Octagon which is quite substantial that they love the Swagger they love when he comes in with rubber arms and struts around the caves they love all that shit they love all that ship it's like when is too far and that is the question when is too far yeah yeah you know if Connor is a real a divider you know some people will love it and some people hate it I'm really died interesting people's opinions on things I'm just interested in what is and what is that sells fights yeah you know there's a reason he's the highest-paid guy and so if that is what is and that's just natural for him to do as well it's not an act it's not you know when he's sparring like I him an hour to my best of friends and every single Sparty should talk eat your shit today you know I'm forum today and you know people listen to them like whoa they hate each other and then it's big smiles at the end of it it's just part of the game for him it's part he enjoys it it's a bit of fun this one was darker you know as Dana said it definitely was but it's just part of who he is I don't really involve myself in it I tried to stay outside of that and then just focus on the task analysis you never get cringy for you because you are a very respectful guy yeah I mean it's absolutely not my personality it's absolutely not my personality but again I don't find my own opinions on things very interesting I'm only interested in what is you know there's a fact that he he does this and it's gotten the results he has okay well I guess that's what he does it's not how I am right I mean you look at the two biggest names in combat sports Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor and they both do it yeah I mean you know like my favorite fighter back in the day was phaidor and there was a man that barely said anything and the purists if you want to say loved him but he was also fighting mostly in Japan and it's different vibe it's a different culture than here yeah you know you could be that guy and I almost have the two extremes I've got a Nelson who you never hear a blip out of yes and then I have Connor who's you know the other end of the scale and you know you can only be true to yourself but that I look at their you know their followings and their sponsorship deals and their fight purses and stuff and it's obvious which one is doing better you know if yeah if the if the we can agree on the object the prize fighting is to make money and that's is the object of martial arts I think is very different but the object of price fighting and don't ever lose sight of that as soon as I hear a fighter saying it's for some other reason I'll try to make him retire as quick as possible is not being smart you know you're taking damage for money and keep keep that in mind no matter what your do you have guys in the gym that you see that sort of mimic Conor of course of course yeah you're talking you're dealing with teenagers and and and twenties yeah and that's you know I look back at myself it's a hugely impressive impressionable period of your life you're all you're looking you know we young man almost try out different personalities yeah and he's such a strong personality in the gym oh definitely I can I can spot the 18 year old walking in with the man bone and the zoo telling me he's gonna be the next year I probably would've been the same it ID you know it's it's not different but I true again months and years of conversations you know not telling them what to do but conversations I sort of say there's a completely natural thing to do but start to find your own voice and find your own way and if that's who you were you enjoy that side of it roam with it if it's not who you were even the fans will say true or very quick as well you know the fans can see when someone is genuinely doing something and I'm doing it as an act now who did you guys bring in for wrestling for this camp you know as sergej his wrestling coach since day one yeah we're not big into like oh if you bring this guy in under six weeks to go we're gonna learn you know that's right it's not the approach not the approach to learn for a camp but like say now right like say if you you got like here we are it's October if they say we're looking at July of 2019 substantial amount of time from now plenty time to Train and also it's a gigantic card the fourth of July weekend right let's let's let's target a rematch for them who what would you do differently well who would you bring in in terms of like wrestling so when you're dealing with somebody for this long you also know there's personalities you know and it's one of the reasons why george worked so well he's he kind of fitted into the how the team structured so you might bring in someone who's and i get so many great offers from guys with their you know really good credentials but what is the use of that if him and Connor are going to clash right and I no matter which athlete son dealing with so actually to me even almost more important than anything is is is that they can connect and that the have a a good working relationship now let me let me state very clearly as well surgery is a fantastic wrestling ko he's he comes with Janna you know generations arresting in Moldova he's got the real slick kind of Russian style of wrestling you know it's not just about kind of power doubles he's very very slick and we have some very very slick wrestlers in the gym so I think we're good there and both guys coming in passing true and we had Helen Helen Morales there the the the female Olympic gold medal you think she's the first American female to get a gold medal she did a lesson O'Connor and was worked out brilliant so things that they think that what would happen naturally like that I've a busy gym I'm always getting fighters coming true we're always stealing technique so I tell my guys to be technique vampires get what you can out of everybody that comes true you know you're never gonna have a mindset of like I don't need to learn from that guy don't know something you don't know right um so that but for a structured okay let's train with this guy for three months I'm we're going it that's not really have skill is is passed on as far as I can tell from my experience of it it's got a work personality wise and I like I said I what what is there some secret technique that I remember watching an interview with Dan Anderson he was saying when he start doing jiu-jitsu tournaments he found it so strange that he wouldn't warm up for each other or that they were afraid to see his deep half guard move because in wrestling is yeah I know what you're gonna do you know what I'm gonna do is just gonna come down to who can hit it on the day and he would actually warm up but with guys he was going to be competing with right it sometimes even because I made the match a little bit battered he had a bit of a vibe going yeah and I don't think there's any like big secret moved that Connor could learn that would suddenly reverse on Habib I thought we did quite well it he almost took him down at the start you know we were ready for that that low single and he we had a little technique for there and he actually sat him down for a moment he didn't drive in we should've ducked you on the hook there and went in did you did two modes and start passing but instead he were true and could be did a great job he followed them back up in the single and then it got a finish so I don't think it's necessarily about trying to bring in a four-time gold medalist or over there and make a big wrestling program that doesn't quite fit in what we do you know do you think though that it would help him to bring in high-level wrestlers to have like intense sparring sessions with him so he could feel that kind of pressure that could be put on him because the level of grappling that that guy brings to the Octagon it's very difficult to match yeah yeah it's kind of like on the reverse who would you bring in to bring the level of striking that Conor can bring in you know it's right we as trainers we're always looking for that at that Carbon Copy so we can get as close as we can and we did we had some big 180 you know when 85 is rushing guys who you're actually begging is not the branding online because they can't go home but AM so we had guys that were you know we're American but there's a reason why Habib is is undefeated on that and the world champion it's you can't get another guy like him you know mimic as much as possible and you do drills and you do scenarios and you know deal and donnas was a great training parent he's up for 200 pounds and you actually come to wrestling before jiu-jitsu he's got ready good takedowns and he's got a real good eye for stylistically trying to match somebody so yeah as close as you can can I ever be the exact guy no so you feel like there's enough room for improvement that if you could go back to the drawing board and give yourself a few months that you could get him to a point where he'd have more success the day I don't think that well I would quit you know yeah so I'm completely biased and I'm I absolutely think that if we could get another shot at it and we can Conor think so as well absolutely what did what did Connor think after the fight was over like What did he say um crystal up he's very down you know watching by he hates he hates me hates technical mistakes about right hand you know that that he was very disappointed he got caught with a shot like that but it's actually funny I was just thinking about this you know that right hand have you showed it to a boxing coach you said that's horrible you know your heads down you're sweet yeah again I don't really care about people's opinions and things I care about its effectiveness that was a damn effective technique yeah you know it's one hardest clean shots comes being caught within his MMA career never mind and but the boxing you know you bring in a boxing coach for Habib you trained at out of them know your hands here go straight comes back so you got to be careful about the individual arts you know you wouldn't high-level Olympic boxing coach wouldn't teach a buta but it's very effective Dan and since careers that techne yeah so things change though when you add in takedowns right it's not weird at that yeah you know it's a great it's a lovely part of being a such a high-level grappler you can go in and swing crazy you know kinda has to go in be always worried about the guy comin underneath is under needed shots yeah so yeah things change as does it's what makes the sport so interesting yeah we made the comparison between Kevin Randleman when he fought Mirko Cro Cop that cro cop was so worried about the takedown random and comes with a big punch and knocks mouth yeah it was a similar yeah set of circumstances kind of recovered very very quickly but he's got a hell of a chin yes he does yeah he's he's rarely he's really hit and that's of course kept his chin strong because it does diminish you know yes he's 15 years sparring almost daily you know if he didn't have that style of being elusive if he was a war gym war guy he wouldn't be able to do his head you know how hard does he spar well it's a little bit depended on who were against if I brought in a sparring partner it's like a fight you know it's gonna be like a fight he's looking to finish if it's a training partner the team mate we're probably doing about a lower level and if you bring in someone there's no pocket area they're ready they've got to be ready I tell them well I'll say it and I say two teams one he's gonna talk to you don't take it personal this is Harry lives where and two it's gonna be a fight so protect yourself be ready no I referee and I'll be quick to to step in but we have to do this we have to get a level of training that's gonna match the intensity of a contest right um you gonna do that all the time no you know that's that's only in at a certain period of the training camp and it's only going to be for us it's once every for once every eight days is kind of depending on how the Spira went and how the body is the more of that we can do it the better because it more directly correlates to what we're actually gonna do but then again you've got to be matched against well if he was a gym war type guy I'd have to pull back his sperm because he'd taken too many shots Brian Karl could go training camp Rove being hit and he's just he's so elusive okay so good at judging range and and so on so for him you conspire all the time you know it's like you I think another example that maybe Darren till he's he's the top dog in the gym so he can spare all day long because he's never accepts in damage right but if you're number ten in the gym you probably should inspire all the time you're taking the shot for him particularly he loves fighting he love sparring absolutely his favorite part of training you do that seven days a week of eleven he you know he trains together areas but is there's always the glint in the eye when it's what's today sparring oh here we go how do you decide do it do you have a set schedule or do you yeah yeah yeah so we do things in cycles and we it will vary up for him but it's roughly on an eight an eight day cycle that I do with him and day one and day 4 will be will be sparring again a little bit depending on where the way it is and how the last spiral went and how he's feeling but if I can get that out and that's that's what I aim for now when you train for the mayweather fight what first of all how much time did you have to prepare for them ten weeks to the day that doesn't seem like a lot no no I remember just getting the getting the message do you think that that was calculated on Floyd's part maybe he's a very smart guy because it seems like most of his fights are planned way in advance yeah that one was like what it's a couple months away just just sort of happened yeah yeah it was was it August is that when the fight took place and it was August talked yeah and so I remember hearing about it and thinking like wait wait August that's fucking really close right right for a Mayweather fight you would think six we are six months or something along those lines but I would feel like for Floyd is as great as he is and probably the best ever in terms of boxing technique and not being hit I mean so elusive still really wouldn't want a guy like Connor preparing for a long period of time a really getting acclimated yeah yeah it was kind of funny how that all came about because when he fought Eddie in November the year before I remember shortly after that we were out of function and I kind of pulled him aside and they I shook his hand I said right you're done all the best enjoy the rest of your life was kind of shocked over saying this somebody said what's he going to do you you're the to a champion you've you've got out the other end of this grind this is this meat grinder with no damage you you're in a very small percentage and you've made plenty money often enjoy yourself and then Tommy my past couple of months my past and then this to me with her fights they're talking and I could I could understand it because now his grandkids were gonna be financially secure so it made sense because it was a big payday didn't really make sense for and you had a reason he enjoyed it the competition side of it that's no matter what you're doing with Conor is gonna be competition I don't care what it is he's gonna look how quick did you do that you're like I went for a piss yeah I'll do a quicker yeah he's just that way so whenever I'd start having a bit of a back-and-forth he's like yeah okay let's quit the boxing and be the best boxer in the world and for me my set you know I was on the outside going okay I understand what you know that makes sense to do nothing else was really making sense at the time it's gonna be damaging boxing is a horrendous sport to prepare for and to compete in because we're just looking at one thing really punches to the head you know of course the body shots as well but but it's it's so damaging the only justification I could see for that was you know your grandkids are financially set yeah tremendous tremendous height behind a tremendous amount of money did you think you could win of course I'm always going to think that way you know that that's my mind said let's let's prepare as best we can that's it sister options here when he landed that uppercut yeah like even when he went to have to do that so you know we did a whole training comp and we brought in you probably heard we probably and that was my first time ever seen him against a recognized boxer it was in the gym we have locally happened in those sparring sessions because what we got to see the the clip that was released was countered lighting Malignaggi up mm-hmm but Paulie Malignaggi insists that most of the sparring was him dominating now that's not what I saw um you know when we when he came back from look he did it a spar he went away it all broke because a picture got leaked and then he Paulie did a lot of interviews he was on the East Coast work in the show so when he come back he came back it was coming back to have a fight and was actually was a weird night in the gym because that the the Fertitta brothers come in Dana command was a few celebrities command was a fight you know and and the the referee was there Joe Cortez a great guy and they did 12 hard rounds and I do it I think there is something being released on Netflix soon a documentary based around a fight and I will have all the have all the round so I guess really yeah I mean we have of course we have the rounds we have two twelve rounds and it's as far as my where I just actually did an interview for recently there I think it's a three-part documentary that's gonna be on Netflix soon and so people will get to make up their own minds about it but just going back to the fight so what did you think though about the sparring alright well he walked when they walked out first and I went to myself I have no idea what's gonna happen I Tanen bucks and amateurs back home and some pros I'm horrendously ignorant to the boxing world I just I just don't really follow it and he was school and those guys I was like you know but they're in a world champ Union at that elite level so that night when he went into the ring appalled I was like you know renown or kind of like what's gonna happen here is he is he just gonna get tooled and then we have to you know scratch your heads and go shit we gonna do here right but he came back after the rounds of me normal going wait a second it's not magic it's still punching in its range and there's techniques and so I got my confidence was growing my confidence was growing so I knew it I knew no matter what happened it was going to be a good fight it wasn't going to be you know you could win and just right terrible ease is missing what every shot and he's being made look silly it was a good fight you know it's entertaining I think no one in the crowd was saying that was ridiculous no one was saying I was a waste of money it was it was an entertaining fight and it's gonna be one of those things that I'll be an older man that I am now and I'll be talking about the time we we went into the boxing world and for flight even though the night I was kind of just look I scratch me what am I doing here yeah that's a winner and it's dad over there you know of all the boxes I always preferred what's employed and anyone else because I love defense defense to me is the most intriguing part and him and Tony and those those are the guys and that how we worked the Philly shell and it was it's beautiful so interesting to watch and he's getting on a bit and but still able to compete so for dad see business whole career was defensive base you never really took two shots never never was damaging the gym never was damaging fights but yeah when he were working in the corner in air corner I'm just gone what the hell is Connor doing fighting flight this is just strange even even at the beginning you know I'm so used to Bruce porphyrin it was a different guy and he hit the bell three times I was like oh you had to do that in the Rocky movies I remember that ding ding ding ladies and gentleman done at the beginning of the ceremonial right I was like oh shit the Derrick's you can epoxy the end it was still just head scratching and then you know fly coming over at the end and giving this a little compliment you know he's got a hell of a shot on him he's tough as nails and it was just it was a great experience and I wouldn't do any different it's the Paulie Malignaggi sparring session which he said was like a fight if it was scored as a fight you think Connor would have won the fight and yeah of course I'm gonna say yes and say well know everybody was there and tonight had you know as Dana I asked Dana knows a lot more about boxing to meet it than I do and all of those guys were going okay we have a fighter hands here this is gonna be this is gonna be an interesting contest so yeah I'm of course gonna say yeah well I guess people who see the rounds and make up their mind but it wasn't as one-sided as those clips that were released without of course Paulie branded his shots as well of course he's a brilliant boxer was for me as a trainer was it was amazing look at he's put on a little bit away easy and you still have to go 12 rounds because after background for was going he's not going to continue because he's breathing very heavy and he's been hit hard and you been shot down once whether it was a Porsche or opponent you'd you guys can make up your own mind and output a lot of heavy shots I was thinking he's gonna be over here by six so we had another sparring partner ready I was like okay just be ready to go because I think this will go by six rounds and then Paulie just hit this rhythm and start lining his own shots and it turned out to be a great a great content you know it's a contest because it wasn't inspired they were talking all the time Paulie was talking to me he was talking to the cameraman he talked it uses almost better than Colorado it's great too everybody had a great night and I think people actually bizarrely enjoyed it it's like kind of conner innate it's Batman and the Joker like you know you both need each other but weird dynamic when you see a contest like that well Pauly was campaigning for a fight yeah get connor to to box him yeah i it's not out of the realms of possibilities really it's absolutely not out of the realms of possibilities there's there's all sorts of crazy rumors going around the the management team and the fight team and what might happen next it could be boxing it could it could be him it could be Floy Floy it again.i all sorts of names are being thrown around well one thing that happened in the fight that was undeniable is that Connor started to fade and we've talked about this the the endurance issue like what what do you think is that issue well it's certainly in in that fight you could see and what I learned about it was it was just brilliant to watch Floyd how he managed his energy I think it's one punch and round one and maybe not much more around Terry it was just so you know it's such an amazing strategy and then and then switching from the usual style to kind of just hands up and walking in and and Connor did unload a lot on his forearms very inefficient which is the opposite of what I would describe Connors fighting style he's efficient very few shots maximum return this was a lots of punches and was one of the few bits of advice I gave him in the corner that was of any use because I'm not a boxing I was that's picker sure there's a reason why he's not trying anything you don't try anything this is 12 rounds it's almost like this tree parts to a fight is 1 to 4 this 5 to 8 and then there's 9 to 12 and Floyd just worked that beautifully and it be something that we would definitely do a lot more if we were to ever get it in order boxing fight it was recognized that there's 12 rounds pace yourself he was he was kind of in the MMA mode of the big shots and like the guy output Floyd's the best in the world not being little do you think it's a pacing issue and not an endurance issue or think it's both if but specifically for the boxing yeah it was it was there was a pacing and an endurance in a new field no clench work at all we had a few little kind of funny clinch techniques we were going to try it was the hammer fist to the back of the head it was well he was aiming for to decided ahead it was supposed to be liked it you know it we played around with little stretches of the rules and we'd see what Joker taser pulls up on and could we do little you know I mean llama chanko fun as well and you need comes from wrestling and you see him doing kind of what almost looked like arm drags and then and tie ups and stuff so we were trying to use that and we just got broke every time we we had very little opportunity to kinda you even going towards the back and holding the hip and hit me with one hand I couldn't find anything in the written rules that were against that but but we were pulled on the straightaway so some of the areas where we taught we had to rest and maybe make floyd use energy zone used to clinch we didn't get that it was it was immediate breaks and that's you know that's the sport of boxing I am but that's just how it is so yet it would have to be all those all those types of adjustments one of the more fascinating rumors was that there was going to be some sort of a striking match in the Octagon that's with MMA gloves that's being talked about it was being talked about is being talked yeah that's being going around as well talked to Jane about that he said it was horseshit oh okay well I don't deal with you about this I'd heard of it who is talking to you about it is Matt you know speaking with Conor and I know to talk about like the you know neutral leg kicks but you know that would be the end yeah I mean especially the side the side on stance is you know what it's like if you got a leg kick and that way you must face straight on so you can check like cakes if they allowed leg kicks and only leg kicks no head kicks Conor would fuck him up hundred percent quickly 100 person I think it would be the first kick no one even understands would be the first leg kick yeah now I will say right away that Conor absolutely dozen want to do that he wants to fight UFC rules or boxing rules zero zero interest on the high rank kicks just that alone a hybrid fight just leg kicks alone yeah he would fought Floyd Mayweather up doesn't he want to fuck Floyd Mayweather out he does but but within one of the two real sets it doesn t say leg kicks just let him throw like it just a few I mean it don't matter what fucking stance Floyd stands in either inside leg kicks outside leg kicks just one of those it would be like we've a lot of you know our lenders we have very good boxing history and very good athletes and we get the odd time and a good boxer will come down for spar and you know these guys can take shots all day long and one leg kick and they run you know it's such a pain that they've never felt before you know like you said it just it changes everything very very quickly it would change Floyd's entire game he has no idea mm-hmm do you remember when cool Vince Phillips fought Masato and Japan no when Vince Phillips is at the top of his game when he was you know of a real elite boxer was just starting to slide and he went over and fought Masato and k1 and Masato chose his legs it was horrifying to watch the only one that I remember that went over there and actually oh Shannon cannon chanting the cannon Shannon Briggs fought Tom Erikson and Tom Erikson cracked him with a couple of leg kicks Shannon actually talked about it on the podcast he's like champ he can't be with a couple of those leg kicks I was ready to quit champ he was like it hurts so bad she goes but I'm pretending he goes I'm pretending nothing he goes I'm an agony chair it's just a different pain it's just a stomachs you know whacked in the head all day long and you know most fighters won't even recognize that put the right body shot you know you had that liver or the right leg kick and there's just no grit and true it it's stunning for people that have never been kicked before it's stunning to watch like what just happens all the time and if you watch like a k1 match or a you know a glory match or muy Thai it's just crazy how often they get kicked and they just learn how to absorb it they learn how to check it and eat it and you know mm-hmm just takes time it did fall but that would that would be if you could somehow another talk Conner and Floyd into a boxing match with leg kicks did Floyd actually say that that would be something I didn't see it was just one of those like while I'm talking to Conor he he reg Litro still fight me down the hell are you talking abou your conversations yeah and this was just one of them where it come up that because the possibility it is and they were talking about hybrid rules and he shot it down straight away you'll fight him out you'll fight him obviously and I'm a realist of court I deal I think Floyd he's a very intelligent guy he's absolute intelligent guy he's not gonna do that I don't even think you would do the leg kick I don't think so biter I think he flirts with a lot of this stuff and I'll come over to your world yeah but he's no he's no fool he's a super smart girl I just can't imagine that he would spar with one guy and eat one of those kicks and he would just be like oh fuck this no thank you yeah fuck all that it changes the way you're allowed to stand yes I mean he would have to be very light on his front leg he'd have to learn how to condition his shins I mean it's like the whole thing would be different but they have talked about some sort of a rematch in boxing it's like I said it's just one of those things that's thrown out there and get a movie role and you hear this and this but you know the owner has the world as his feet too so many people want to pull him in so many different ways but he seems to have avoided some of the more obvious Hollywood type traps yeah you know because like Ronda Rousey got sucked into all of them right she was doing everything she was all these TV shows and movies and I remember before she lost to Holly Holm thank god she's getting stretched thin like this camera good this can't be good you know I was worried about Amanda Nunez Amanda Nunez was the one that I thought would had Rhonda's number I'm like that girl punch is so fucking hard and she's a leet ground specialist well you wouldn't be a picnic on the ground and Ronda you know takes girls to the ground and submits them yeah but I was like but you got to get through the fire that's Amanda Nunez his hands and I remember seeing her and all these other things and these television shows and these movie deals and I was like that those things will rob you yeah they rob you give you they give you something to give you some money they give you some Fame you walk that red carpet you look wonderful smile Ronda look over here smile Connor but they steal things from you they steal your ability to actually fight they steal your ability to have all of your resources and Connor's done an amazing job of avoiding that for the most part I mean he's you know it's proper 12 whiskey comin l and that photo shoots you know had to be done and but no movies he's only the movies the movies are the ones that really fucking robbed you yeah yeah you actually have a small part in a movie when he was when he was just starting off eighteen nineteen the large movie 20 scenes little head nurse he played a prisoner but yeah yeah he's because he's obsessed with fighting he loves fighting you know it's he beautiful you could see in the lead-up to this he didn't want to do much much you know media and press and they camped an agreement what be done he'd rather do none of it and have no build up he'd if you Connors ideal world I think would be the fight in every UFC every Saturday night that'll be his ideal just live near to your C and Phi Saturday night and then have a fun night Sunday and then get ready for the next fight we loves fighting like whales you do my god I'm scratch my head about this by the my ticker indicator could be no thank you I'm good he wants to get right back in he wants anymore fight Floyd and definitely heavy ones that's that's that's the fire if you had to guess what's next what would you think um you know I won't pretend to understand the business side of things him an already empowered I'm day they do all of that and you know the fans so much and I'm and the officials aside and who gets the next shot I I only deal with what you know what's gonna be put in front of me and I think will be the be rematch that's I think it will be that and now I'll be getting torn apart and where it isn't there this and this guys I'm only saying what I think is it gonna be someone else will be you know it's Tony I don't really know but that's what I see him talking about so that's how my mind is what do you think would be different in terms of the way he approaches it in terms of like trash talking and all that other stuff he's never gonna not be him that's that's the side of his personality you know and you know it's a it's a dividing line and my you know my parents are not mad about it but kids on my gym love it you know it's just one of those it's just one of those things Conor's never not going to do that that's that's like in Dublin you know we're we're from there was always that guy in the class that was just sharp width you know had the quick reply and from the moment I met him he was just that guy that's like you can't make a tiny'mon figure out you make you feel stupid very quick you know and I've been on the end of it yeah and but I remember going to I remember that guy in school as well and it just happens that he has a you know lethal left hand on top of that yeah and then he has the look and he he's just an unusual package study that it all came together so by I don't you know they build up for ds2 is he didn't stop it wasn't like he was gonna go I hope I don't lose this time and you know he went them the same kind of mindset he had and I've note that he would go into that fight as fully prepared as we can and he be 100% sure in his mind he's gonna destroy him and around because that's how he always thinks if there's another fight that would sell and there would be huge it would be that it would be Diaz 3 oh yeah that could be especially if Diaz gets past poor yeah yeah in deep shit even if he doesn't I mean just that fight alone I mean there's the the history between those two guys I mean that would be that's it's so appealing stylistically as well the fight you know like I'm a grappler heart I love grappling but I also understand that jiu-jitsu tournament will put people to sleep you know even if you're into jiu-jitsu is hard to watch it ajussi tournament yes but I need body can see a punch hitting someone in the head and then falling down that's yeah you know that's exciting and him India's such a great personality matchup it's such a great skill clash you know if I just a design somebody that's gonna bring the best ever corner he'd want someone that you know couldn't hit back and take a big shot and put up at the trash it's it's a beautiful fighter III always I would love to see that very much yeah the thing about Diaz when they first fought was that he didn't give a fuck about trash talk it didn't bother him at all it was normal yeah it was like oh okay we're doing this yeah yeah it was amazing it was it was what everybody wanted to see at the time it's cuz Conner was so good at talking shit and people would get so flustered but then Diaz didn't give a fuck and you could tell he didn't give a fuck it was just so normal for him and it was like wow trash talk doesn't work on Diaz yeah really doesn't work yeah like I'd known about some of his train partners and he's like Connor like in the gym he's dressed talking his brother you guys are new every aspiring it's it's because it's fun you know and yeah it's always just you know when we have Connor having a big spa you know the gym will be packed that everybody wants to come down the same is pattern and you see you know he's talking to the guy at hallway true whether it's a close friend like Artem or whether it's someone we brought in that he doesn't know it's not gonna change him you know I'll be I certainly don't spy remember little roll rumors of an even trash talk to me when I'm trying to tell my but it's you know it's it's this personality so what time line or do you think we're looking at in terms of his return if you had a guess it was funny I was looking at a March 16th is you know Patty's Day is March 17th that's a Sunday March 16th is a Saturday Oh imagine like MSG on the Saturday night before a Patty's Day oh my gotta be insane and wonder if it's not booked yeah I was actually gonna go ms she's booked pretty far in advance I imagine so I divide itself and they're doing one in November to do two at MSG in a year I think you could do Connor in there every weekend good deals every weekend and it's gonna be it's gonna be packed out you could do the TD Garden in Boston - yeah more Irish and Boston and you could do of course Vegas anyway yeah but just I saw that date but I'm you know like you said just the big summer card as well you have fight week to delight to like hard yeah I think probably some are next summer is probably realistic you know we have to obviously see what punishment if you get so you know everybody was so amped up after the fact and I you know I was like oh man this could be terrible but Monday morning I'm like the fuck happened really mmm nobody died nobody even got cut a couple people got punched in a place where people get punched you know I mean it's like yes no I have to get her hat and in that I am I have a big commercial gym I coach kids I had president of the amateur MMA Association back I deal with politicians all the time and this is the exact thing that they're arguing with me you know when I'm when I'm wearing a suit on Wednesday s meeting with the Minister for sport I'm not so I'm looking out to come great that's what's gonna be proud of but my next meeting when I'm trying to get governing body status for my for my life's work my art my sport right and I'm trying to tell for 60 year olds that this is legitimate and they're showing me this and you're you know so for that it was terrible you know there's no other way around it like I said if it was it if it had been better done that isolated I think it was that big a deal Brannigan's up because he didn't really hit the alone bit of pushing and pulling nothing who cares your man come on up and hit and it was absolutely dangerous you know he's a trained fighter he bare knuckles and he's you know hitting a guy who's tires on hard rounds who's taking some head shots and you know he went for the illegal shot you know there's a reason why you're not let it to the stem of the brain there and there has to be something that there has to be ramifications for that it can't be just like a door hitting each other and you can't allow that to happen no no and and I example has to be made so that order people in in the height of it go wait a second it's not just a slap on the wrist something substantial happens if we do something criminal you know it's assault yeah it literally is and I really worry about him in terms of him having a visa and being able to obtain a visa and fighting America again and I I believe he was supposed to be fighting next month do we find out who that guy was you did right starts with Z one of them was the guy that artem was gonna fight next time was it okay let me read it yeah that's the guy that's the guy he was actually bragging about it on social media yeah I see zoo zoo barrier talk cool goals with other consonants and islam makhachev face UFC access Conor McGregor ring attackers revealed yeah sue Barry I don't know how to say his name I'm sorry I think he's the one that was wearing red that jumped the cage and and punch Conor bare-knuckle Islam maka G he's the one that hopped over there it did that happened right to me what yeah yeah I don't think that was him in the red I thought I was gonna black that him and Connor had a little exchange and then they get the other guy hit him from behind but I thought that was gonna be wrong which I'm sure we're getting in I'm not meeting Texan yeah to correct us not sure yeah ah either way yeah that can't happen again that's tough you know I hope well I hope it all gets worked out well thank you gentlemen thanks thanks for being here George thank you for illuminating the very elusive art of weight cutting it's uh it was an excellent conversation you're all dipped out now huh cognitive ability by back to you hundred percent and dip increases your cognitive ability by 290 why are all those truck drivers so stupid you know truck drivers listen right now let's say 80% the scouts are made up on the spot that's what I do I'm all about making shit and thank you John really really appreciate you coming in it was a lot of fun and hopefully would do it again under of
