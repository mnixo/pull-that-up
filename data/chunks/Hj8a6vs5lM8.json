looking at those going I want a pair of those how awesome was haven't I Scalia it was amazing shit we're also sponsored by audit comm makers of alpha brain the cognitive enhancing supplement if you're interested in these or any alpha brain or any of the other nootropics that we have we have New Moon which is a 5htp and serotonin boosting supplement we have this stuff called shroom tech which is let's got a lot of b12 in it in quarters EPS mushrooms and it's like an endurance enhancing supplement and there's another one called shroom tech immune which is a fascinating one where it's a mushroom that actually tricks your body into thinking your body has a cold and so it pumps up your immune system for a fight that never takes place I'm not explaining it as well as it can be explained but if you go to on it calm that's onn IT you can get all the information on it the way we have it set up is the way we're trying to rip people off the least and by that I mean you when you order the first set of 30 pills if you ordered from us if you don't like it you get a hundred percent money-back guarantee you don't have to return you just say this stuff sucks I'm not into it and you get all your money back we want to make sure that people are numb number one don't feel ripped off before we even think about making money and these are all things that I've taken I've taken a bunch of them I always talk about bill Romanowski is neuro one which is a great one I started taking that years ago and that's how I actually it's a do name no name from the Alice morning radio show Sarah no name oh yeah he's big yeah no name was working out with Romanowski and he's turned me on to that neuro one stuff that was when I first got interested in nootropics but it's a it's a very complex and fascinating area of study and there's a there's there's debates on both sides the argument that are fascinating but I've been using them for a long time and I absolutely believe them I can feel the difference between when I'm not and when I am I feel like I think clearer I feel like it gives me a more fluid connection with my thoughts if that makes any sense everybody's different if it doesn't doesn't really hold up water for you like we said one hundred percent money-back guarantee try it out enter in the code name Rogan and save yourself ten percent all right you dirty bitches Michael Rupert's here or we're friend to get to the bottom of shit I always wanted to say that we're finding at least I could say without irony the Joe Rogan experience trained my game Joe Rogan podcast by night all day just to clear things up there's a lot of people in the MMA world they're saying hey man Nick Diaz no-showed to a match with Braulio Estima they were supposed to have a jiu-jitsu super fight and Nick Diaz no-showed and they said are you gonna take him off your the opening your podcast and I was like how dare you how dare you suggest that I would ever take Nick Diaz off the opening of my podcast that was one of the Graham's greatest moments of my life sir I love it it's my twin my favorite part and I don't know why you know show it I'm sure he had his reasons you know I don't know what the fuck happened behind the scenes I don't know who pissed him off you can't piss that dude off all right if you want if you want that dude to fight everything has to be smooth as silk like the UFC there's no bullshit everything's handled everybody everybody smooth and professional and it goes off without a hitch and he has no problems with anybody but you can't be pissing that dude off and expecting him to show up he'll just he'll just vanish on you what was there wizard some controversy like was there a reason that he got pissed off it was a weight issue apparently they were supposed to fight it they were supposed to weigh in at 180 pounds 185 pounds the day of the match like you had two weigh-ins and apparently Braulio Estima didn't know this and then he he weighed in in the morning he lost the weight he had a cut weight here to cut like nine pounds so he cut the weight he waited in the morning and then he Denny rehydrated and but the confusion of him not being on weight or not knowing what the weight is or when to weigh in it's real that's that's where it gets confusing because it's it seems like it's the fault of the organizers it seems like there was there's a big confusion as to like when it was all supposed to go down and then of course with Nick Diaz you like I said you can't piss him off if you piss him off it's just not to show up you know and they fight they fucked up in that regard they should have had everything working nice and smooth but I don't you know I can't excuse it it was a I would have loved to seen it man nick is a bad motherfucker you know and for him to have the kind of confidence to get in there with Braulio Estima Braulio is one of the two or three best jujitsu guys in the world I mean he's amazing and as a pure grappler I mean he taps out other amazing pure grapplers very smart guy you know and you know it's it sucks for him more than thing because you know he came over here from England for this this is like a big moment for him as a representative of the best jujitsu that's currently available to have a grappling match against what is a representative of the best you know martial artist mixed martial artists we have available I mean Nick Diaz is in the elite of the elite you know he's right up there with the top guys in the world as far as MMA is concerned as is Braulio in jiu-jitsu and so that would be so fascinating to see them go out and it sucks that it didn't work out I don't know why it didn't work out but uh it seems like all these guys have weight issues like that's a huge problem why don't they just have like like four girls on staff they just have to like focus on weight issues they seem like they would be pros at that well they won't you know you got to leave that shit up to a fighter you know and this is this is a different sort of situation because there was a lot of confusion apparently as to when they were supposed to weigh in and different people Nick Diaz weighed in one day and brawling a weight in the morning of the next days is there's obvious confusion I don't I don't know exactly what happened you would have to sit both guys down at sort of peace the argument out but it sucks I was just trying to get Nick Diaz to have some girls on staff just trying to help the guy out ladies and gentlemen Michael Rupert's here and he's gonna get down to the bottom of things Michael Roberts been yeah yeah I've heard that Fox magic is particularly strong this type of month Fox magic been working this time with the Fox magaz it's working Fox magic been magic and all over the place like yeah and yeah yeah but as far as what's going on that's what I came down here to find out try to talk to you to figure it out I don't know if I have any answers for you sir I have a feeling anything that we come out of my mouth is pure speculation good but from someone who's completely unqualified well let's speculate all over the place well you don't know just a ton of shit's going on and there have been some major changes and ever and and as far as my life goes things are changing for the good all over the place I've left collapse net now explain for the folks who are uninitiated what is collapse net collapse Network collapse net.com not collapse net it's it's a it's a company we started two years ago after the movie the dock collapse came out and if its purpose was to help people to prepare for the collapse of human industrial civilization which is well underway right now and over the two years we've grown to six members in 68 countries and we got really busy we specialize in bringing really accurate news reports from all over the world it gives us a real picture and telling people what's really going on but also connecting them through a directory with 1,600 hand-picked entries that's free the lighthouse directory for so you the lights are just going on maybe it's a good idea to grow food or maybe there's going to be more blackouts or maybe this that sod and a lot of work has been done or the course of a couple of decades by a lot of people so we bring all that data there so you don't have to reinvent the wheel and then we bring a lot of great feature writers and stuff so it got to be big and we had some big challenges we got massively cyberattack this year man they just oh they just laid into us twice this year and we had some big struggles but the way it the way it all evolved and one of my lines is like evolve or perish you know grow up or die and one of my big spiritual lessons now is about letting go it's not it's you know it's letting go that really gives me more yeah options and so anyway isn't it fun that you figured it out like later in life everybody does oh yeah well when you're young it's like the big problem I spent 21 years in 12-step and and I lived that program so letting go came to be something you practice when confronted with you know so letting go collapse that turned out to be perfect I gave the ownership back to the you know I'm out completely but now they don't have to pay my salary and they're all on their own and they're just so energized and they're just so on fire and now I get to step back a little bit cuz I'm a tired motherfucker you know I've been at this a long time do you ever put nice stories on like handy storage like someone found a box of kittens and they were purring and all them held beautiful smile no we went home and they had a great day and the new episode of Game of Thrones was on and we watched it it was awesome and they had Fox magic as you what kind of music is that Bryan Fox magic song okay okay we have it we have a sound for it now do you think it's possible that civilization won't collapse is it possible that we're just stumbling and that will uh will balance out is that possible absolutely totally that's one of the reasons we're I'm going through this big change I mean we not only did I in two books in the movie and everything else kind of predict all this stuff based upon a model that said that that means civilization is collapsing so if you see these symptoms that's a pretty good chance that's what the disease is but now just recently Fukushima is so totally out of control reactor number two is so hot that any robots they send to the reactor get fried and and so they can't get in to work on this melted core that's lying at the bottom and and then they've said no machines that can handle that radiation have even been designed yet oh okay that leaves a reactor to out building four with all the rock that's it I think it's amazing that someone made nuclear reactors in the first place I think it's amazing yeah you know I I did a joke about it in my act but it it really is fascinating that you you can build something like that that you can't shut off that someone allowed them to build something like that where in some unmeasurable event where the power gets shut off and can't get back on in time it's fucked forever there are 450 more reactors around the San Onofre just had a major breakdown where's that that's in San Clemente on the way to San Diego really and they had a mate or something it's down all season so you guys in Los Angeles are going to be having some some humongous blackouts this summer really and brownouts yeah I'm surprised see we had that on collapse net but they hide it from you in the mainstream news here that's why collapsing that's so good at what we do whoa so because of the what's wrong with your reactor that's the one that you see when you drive down reactor number two at San Onofre right by Camp Pendleton so it said it's a weird feeling arrived by ANSI at nuclear reactor to there was problems with the cooling pipes and then I think they were checking another reactor G the x-ray showed some faulty piping but now so the reactor is offline indefinitely it is such a stupid fucking idea the idea that you can make something you can never shut off that the that you would do that that's so arrogant it's so incredibly arrogant because if it fuck's up and people like well most of the time it's clean and safe what are you banking on if you look at the permanence of any fuckup it what a massive amount of time it takes before that area is not deadly to go near if you look at the fuck up that's we're talking about thousands of years Japan is dead Japan is mortally wounded and I've been saying so impaired and it's clear Japan's economy is imploding they they are now a net importer their debt is like two hundred and eighty percent of Gd and how are they getting their power knows it half very good question Japan has replaced uh was that a Japanese impression by the way no I can't do better what if I don't want to do that no no that's all so Japan was what happened what they're running emergency diesel widely which is diesels a whole separate issue worldwide but they're running diesel they're burning now fuel oil and coal oil which excuse me to two grades of oil but and they're importing liquefied natural gas now that's where you build this four hundred and fifty million dollar floating gigantic bomb of liquefied liquefied natural gas and you floated across and you know one of those things would is almost the size of an atom bomb oh if it goes off oh my god so this is energy desperation but when so great and when you talk about diesel you know don't buy diesel now and here's why DS 'l sorted you all over the world in india they got 30,000 and generators to to handle blackouts at the Taj Mahal and the city that's around there we ran that story twice on uncollapse net and there's so many blackouts in India and Pakistan they're all burning diesel and they're short of coal I mean it's happening all around the world right now but Diesel's in a really short supply what are they going to do with all these nuclear power plants they can't shut them down right there's no way you can you you can't like it's not you can't shut it off well if you combine that let me just take it a little bit further ahead to where the point of all this is going okay because from four different directions they ain't going to shut the nuclear power plant off they can't control what they got and it because electricity is industrial civilization right have industrial it just seems so ridiculous to put something like that in an area where it's close to humans it's it seeds the idea that you can completely contain that insane amount of energy it's like it's so arrogant okay that that's one prong of a fork yeah Fukushima here the second prong one of the aides know what happened aids aids just put it out aids came out of the gate like Tyson you know AIDS was killing people left and right but now you hardly hear about aids anymore it's the best diet in Hollywood right now and also generates a lot of medical money in the in the medical business do you ever read like that Peter Duesberg stuff long to know who he is yeah he's the guy he's the biologist from the University of California Berkeley and his claim is something along the lines of that HIV is like a weak virus I may be paraphrasing here and that when you're seeing it in people most likely it's because they have a weakened immune system that nor a strong healthy immune system fights off HIV fairly easily that it's not the culprit of AIDS but rather symptom of a depleted immune system that's from a variety of different things and you know it eight so it's a crazy argument because if it's true it's like how could this only this guy be figuring that out there's one biologist and all these other guys they haven't noticed that I don't draw that tricky I don't trust any of the science behind but does that is it possible that's that's not possible though right I mean it's not possible it that AIDS is a hoax that's not possible not smoke it is definitely possible it was man-made rum it's a real it is definitely possible that it was intentionally released you really you think you feel like that yeah I've seen this was goes way way back to like the 90s when I saw these but these were whu-oh documents showing the first outbreak of AIDS and at nope and superimposed were WH ov AXA nation programs and there was like a perfect match Wow you know yeah I don't know yeah obviously I'm no biologist but I don't see how one guy could be out there saying something like that and all of his peers disagree on how it works I mean obviously people think that HIV causes AIDS but is this guy's mind he's like these people were all doing it I think it's is there was a drug abuse and you know partying and he was that's what he was attributing to their their depleted states they were doing like crystal meth and droppers and amyl nitrate and stuff and that apparently his immune system crushing this amyl nitrate yeah that was a big in the eight-hour 70's one I mean when I was a cop I ran into a male on the street what would I do just pop it and then they smell it or something like that oh okay Sam Kinison had a business the story of the funniest dead body I have ever seen in my life you want okay yeah the funny is about it you said in my life yes alright and this is I swear this is true I was working Wilshire division and I was a p3 had two stripes and every Christmas cops from one division will go cover for another division when it has its Christmas party you know so we were covering for Hollywood divisions Christmas party so I'm I'm driving up around in Hollywood we get a call six eight forty to meet the are a dead body such-and-such address maybe on Cherokee some so the re is a rescue hang on so we pull up and it's a it's a three story standard California really bare-bones interior courtyard open about you know balconies it's up on the third floor and and so me and my partner we go walking down and I noticed that the paramedics are just outside the laughing their asses off they're down on their knees they're laughing so hard okay and I'm going oh okay guys this is the dead body call right hey yeah and I said what they point and I go in and there's this dead guy on the floor and he was I would say young 20 ish light-skinned african-american guy in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee holla and and he was laying on the floor and and kind of spread eagle and I looked and there is a broomstick pull protruding from you know we're okay but there's only about a foot of it protruding Oh from you know where Oh God and and so the table had been pushed up against it was easy to figure it he I guess this was before a man could buy a sex toy or something I don't know but he had been up masturbating on the table with the broom and the purpose of the anal was to strike it right as you've come right yeah but what it does is it gives you an involuntary back no and oh my god that's my amyl nitrate story and the broomstick went up his ass killed in him he looks satisfied of what oh what a way to go man yeah there's been a bunch of dudes that have gone asphyxiation style right yeah that's like the INXS guy that's actually baby Sheridan Carradine yeah that's actually pussy shit because like the real guy would do it the other way with the broom coming at you from like the bristle part side that's that's the real way oh look a man yeah like a man that's like then it is West Hollywood shit oh that's how I can talk about gay Samoans handle it let's say you to rite of passage you gotta use a broom the other way humor was good oh fuck yeah that's a dumb way to die do you think one of the things I heard is like that the big of the big conspiracy would be if you wanted to shame a person you would kill them and make it look like they died masturbating like an idiot I mean that's like in a couple NWA so yeah just leave what she gave horns around like that would that would be the ultimate joke if you found your buddy dead you're like all right he's dead so listen there's nothing I can do about that but what I can do is put his dick in his hand and put a bunch of gay porn all around them and then take pictures of him and then put it online like oh I got you the last I got the last one bitch I got the last one come on that would be heil arious thank you miss kahn like it because if you knew you know if you knew that guy and you loved them and it's like the one last joke you get out of them that's so fucked itself hugs up it's so fucked up but it would be hilarious hope you got to have a good sense of humor come on man it's hilarious all right I'll remember it I don't think that you remember that yeah I remember that too bitch that sucks uh why do you even release that into the bed there's already photos of you out there with dicks in your hand in your mouth and that's the golden rule of the Internet yep I'm a generic serious yeah Neos bad oh no it's not real Oh Mykel Ripper went with the sunglasses on that's when he's gonna get deep is that a weird thing like that that's a cool guy thing to wear your sunglasses you know weird thing I tell you one thing I got that no meme with the sunglasses come down what you did you two deal with it I love it does that word come from with wit have it I love it too but where did it originate I don't know what is that from I don't have to deal with it's everywhere though I see it all this all over the place sunglasses drop down deal with it it's beautiful but how did sang that what is this be cool I don't even know what that means anything with what that means is whatever you know you have issue with why don't you just fucking deal with it and leave me alone okay you know deal with it get out of my face well he's a cool guy he's got sunglasses on like I'm just super cool yeah oh but I'm why how does that make you cool well how did sunglasses become something that makes your core because you look different yet your eyes are you look like now you look like a fly and you know I've been wired what you do right there those are actually pretty dope yessiree closely nineties record HD but those are oakley's right yeah no they're not no they're just there no she focuses that is amazing that's HD what a world we live in yeah how long before you get a chip in your eyeball that just does that you don't have to have seven days now what this probably going to be we're going to be insert and shit into our bodies eventually they're going to give you something that just works way better like this all you need is this one little microprocessor in your body and you will never have a disease again it's just Bing you have like this microprocessor that regulates your body they put it right in your pituitary gland and it regulates your body like a little micro messenger and then that shit's going to start getting viruses but every 10 years I have to give you a brain surgery and open it up to change the battery wait yeah yeah but imagine that that that computer oh hello Joe magical computer inside you that computer inside you fixes all the disease now the show and then that computer gets a bugger that car gets a virus and you have to start making medicine to help that computer so you put lures like that in case of virus it turns you gay yeah imagine that no iris and all of a sudden you just could not stop you carriages that would probably be the first thing virus right thinking what if john travolta had that and all this time people are just being mean to him and they don't know that he has a disease he has a genetically designed like a disease from like the russians maybe if you know if you wanted to do that makes them like super aggressively gay the government has worked on this right this is not a joke michael rubin will back me up remember and during iraq they were they were trying to figure out how to make a gay bomb this is not a joke they have using god i can pretty much guarantee that with all of the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that the black ops community has had to work with in the secret budget all these years they have tried every stupid fucking thing in the world you could think of this this idea was that they were going to be able to spray something down like something blows up over these guys it sprays all over him and it makes him gay I mean they were really like looking into the possibility that they thought it would like demoralize them did they ever hear about the Greeks in the Roman uh some of the greatest fucking soldiers of all time they were boning each other constantly yeah the samurais boned each other two dudes boned dudes back then and they were cutting heads off everyday that was a wild time you know you can't think that you know making these people guy is gonna it might make Megan better fighters well you don't wanna fight for their boyfriend now that what's you up that's what the system does pretty much everything it takes something and it bends it it twists it yeah you accept a way to look at it that is a basic fundamental lie anyway yeah you know I don't think gay or non gay has shit to do with how good a warrior you are exactly you know yeah there's a lot of gay Jews who can beat the fuck out of you know my ass kicked once by a dyke as a cop what I did yeah with Riley was six two and she could bench like 260 or something oh my god did you underestimate her did she charge you like what happened well it was we just called I was at 4:15 fight at a bar and it was what is 4:15 that's a place call for disturbance you know it's 4:20 really pot no that would had nothing to do with police no no what is that I said that's a colloquialism it's a native you know but as far as LAPD no I never heard of 420 is how did 420 become pot anybody it's probably a good history behind that it might be a code in some County in Northern California okay so I'm sorry so 415 comes out yeah I go to visit it's it's a it's a pleasure bike we go in you know and there's a fight and you know and she was fighting somebody else and I go to step in and she ain't you Branka wanna walk one point back yeah how's the room man you got to be really careful because big big women can knock you the fuck out what's that's for real there's some big women out there they can knock you the fuck out yeah I know a chick that's only like 130 plus pounds maybe like 140 my friend Tommy juniors girlfriend Katie and she can punch a fucking hole in your face man his chick knows how to punch like and she's a strong girl there's girls out there that can fuck you up you got to be careful especially if they sucker punch you oh that's kind of it there's a great video though some fucking asshole who's yelling and screaming at this woman and she grabs him by the caller's and headbutts him and knocks him unconscious it was like a security camera in front of barré the guy was just being a drunk douchebag and the girl it was the girls badass man she was like a fucking character in a movie cool I mean she wasn't a big girl but she grabs him by the collar and just fucking headbutt some right in the chin that dude goes out it was hilarious yeah it's a beautiful video have you ever seen it Brian mm-hm pull it up because it's it's um there's not even any audio it's a probably girl headbutts guy kay oh yeah maybe I don't know why I'm asking fine it's probably a billion of those right I mean how many videos online there about girls head-butting a guy and knocking him out I could find it well you know I am the only guy in the history of the Los Angeles Police Department now this isn't it who have been bitten in the left testicle in the line of duty really oh Jesus the only guy ever was it a slut I know is because you're right had your hand on it and you're massaging it under no no no like why did someone bite your ball uh we got a call this wasn't a day when angel dust was on PCP oh my god it's the worst thing I've ever seen drug I've ever seen in my life what is the effects for the unwashed masses oh my god well it was supposed to be it was designed as an elephant tranquilizer that ain't the way it works in humans it's it's it's it's a powerful hallucinogenic but it gives people a feeling of superhuman strength and they have it they display you get a real thin sheen of perspiration and you get this glassy I love just love this that's how I look old-time and and and and these guys would you know throw five or six cops around they would pull fire stupid Strength's things and quite frequently they had to be shot because they did there was just they wouldn't stop so Ren who got his finger bitten off I was on PCP so so we got a call a wilshire sergeant was requesting a backup it was just south of the station south of Lybrand Venice they're a few blocks and we go rolling up and here's this sergeant Tim Wright was six foot five he's just backed into a corner in this apartment and here's this little bitty black guy about five foot eight like Sammy Davis jr. but he's holding like a 35 inch color console television set above his head those things were heavy I mean he's and right away you knows it was dust and and and I was I was known as the fire sergeant Sarge says Rupert get him so like five of us went in there and you know it was just like one of the cartoon melee things Oh God we finally got him handcuffed and then flexo cuffed around his ankles you know the plastic comes called an ambulance put him on the gurney to canvas straps on the gurney went over like torso and one over visor knees mm all right so we figure we got him we take him out to the ambulance now I stand up but you know when you're lifting the going to raise it into the ambulance you pull it up oh no oh no so he he monk the canvas strap over his legs oh my god and everybody went back to his legs and then wow he went like that oh my god honey bit your ballsack holy shit how what is the recovery on something like wow did it hurt a lot nothing was damaged but the fear he was like he must have been horrific like just like looking down for your first time I hope muscle beam is horrific yeah must be yeah so oh yeah I wound up having the nickname of Inspector Clouseau not not okay though you know I got kneed in the dick once in jujitsu and I didn't know how bad it was is before I used to work up now I work up smart man yeah and I I didn't realize how bad I was till after I was done Chen it fuck it hurt like hell but I I figured it's just me being a bitch cuz I got hit in the deck and I like oh my poor dude and I'll tell you think like it's just it's like it's extra sensitive is my baby are you wearing a dick see I wasn't wearing anything I was wearing a jockstrap hidden deep and I'm not I mean I was wearing clothes I should be wrestling you doing boy and my friend Einstein was passing my guard he slammed his knee in you know trying to pass his knee through my legs and he just miscalculated oh and caught my dick and I didn't realize how bad it wasn't I was taking a leak after training and blood was all over my jockstrap my jaw strap was like with blood oh great my dicks leading this is awesome so like a retard I didn't even go to the doctor instead what I did was I went to see if I could beat off I'm like well if I could beat off like any good it can't be broken if I could beat off and I beat off successfully and what didn't even hurt that much and when I came was like blood and come together okay like I had a chicken like a little chicken egg so I said alright well let's see if this heals up if it feels even a little bit funny tomorrow I'm going to the doctor so I peed blood for like two or three more days but I felt great so not it didn't didn't I was just checking for any inflammation or feeling of irritation or I think you know you just heal up but like it's like would I go to the doctor if I did that with my nose and I mean the answer was no no I would have done it with my nose a hundred times how did you a lot of orange juice and tried to make orange P you know anything try to make lemonade yeah it would be like pink lemonade yeah but seriously that that's something that you probably you probably didn't want to get checked out because you didn't want them to like have to put something in your penis hole or something like that no I didn't want to be I would've I didn't want to be a pussy I mean if I if it was my ear I wouldn't go to the doctor it was my nose and why am I going to doctor if it's my dick I wouldn't want to go to the doctor if it's like infected were they gonna do how are they gonna fix it were they gonna do they're gonna put a splint on it so he has a bigger play two popsicle sticks and send it back in like a wounded soldier um I don't I don't know what the fuck they would do I it was nothing wrong with it it was just hurt you know no man I just needed to heal up but if it was hurt if it was more than that I would have noticed after a while I'm sure I was pretty sensitive that's a great physical metaphor for what happens emotionally a few times in your life when you taking the dick yeah you heal up hopefully yeah you heal up hopefully yeah hopefully that's a good physical metaphor for them yeah it's very difficult for people to accept the idea that sometimes people don't want to be around them you know some people aren't meant for each other their fuckin personalities clash and that some people of different I'd it's very difficult to find someone that you can hang with for any long period of time definitely we just got to learn to be nicer about the whole process you know it's the getting kicked in the dick emotionally figure out how to don't worry about what that box of that for you you know I had a party recently at my house a little kids party and a couple friends came over including two friends that are exes their ex-boyfriend and girlfriend married two different people now but still great friends it's so cool to see that when people can connect like that and keep people can actually really be close friends like their kids play together they go out to dinner together you know they go on double dates together they're genuinely friends so it's it is possible but goddamn for the most part most of them end up like fucking like those air shows where they touch wings and fuck it go into the crowd and a ball of fire well you have a go to an air show man you were going to an air show oh yeah I grew up in an Air Force family Jesus crying I've been to quite a few have you ever seen a wreck like that No thank God whoo what uh what kind of jets did you flying I didn't my father did you've never been in one oh I'm not not in a fighter jet no I did I do it did a thing for the Blue Angels they would take celebrities up and oh I told ya we went seven and a half cheese and they don't wear suits either man you know when they do their shit they don't like theirs most places they wear like some sort of a compression too that allows you to deal with the pressure but they don't they don't wear them they just do it all with their their body you know they have to be like really in a really good shape yeah it's just a matrix yeah all kinds of creamy and gymnastics lifting weights you have to like really strengthen your body just to deal with the chief oh it's fucking incredible man the feeling is it's amazing how much pressure it is when you realize that like going fast doesn't just it doesn't come free like if you want to really go that fast you have to move your body in a way that's completely unaccustomed to moving through the universe like the amount of pressure that comes from that kind of speed it's like monumental it's hard to even wrap your fuckin head around I love it dude seven and a half G's is insane and it feels like consciousness field literally feels like an elevator door you could see black on each side it's cool it's a crazy feeling man but when they wreck they wreck hard oh I remember my dad was a radar intercept officer an f-89 S&F 90s that's those are two-seat interceptors he used to fly over the North Pole waiting for the Russians to attack during the Korean War that was his mission Wow and we saw a few UFOs and some strange things she needs us anyway but so the worst and it was all Air Force so it was in late 70s early 80s that the Thunderbird the what we're doing a five formation loop ground loop and that something went off in all five flew straight into the ground oh my god and that was like that was like just go oh my god whoa oh my god holy shit that's great words fail you know that's crazy yeah what happened how the fuck does that happen something you I'm not gonna say I mean it wasn't it might combination of pilot error and mechanical failure because everybody follows the lead oh my god nobody else is paying any attention to anything except the lead oh my god that's so crazy that is so fucking crazy yeah that's hard to even think about that's one of those things it's hard to wrap your head around you know what that must have been like to be a part of and know that it's happening like right before the fucking plane hits the ground oh yeah they didn't even you know they might had a microsecond to know the guy that took me on the Blue Angels fly was a bad motherfucker I wish I could remember his name I have it at home it's on a signed photo but we went through these canyons and we were going it was it was so fast it was ridiculous and we're only like a couple hundred feet off the ground and it's just yeah yeah when you realize what those things can do and just think about if you were on the ground and one of those motherfuckers was looking for you holy shit god damn that scary I did one of those fighter jets looking for you while you're on the ground would have to be one of the most frightening things and well they fly too fast I mean I know this is this is where I have some expertise because of the life I've led hanging with some green beanie guys and you know they can't see anything they fly too fast to fight too fast so you need a helicopter yeah well you you would want a helo with a FLIR forward-looking it infrared radar for night that's a third gen night-vision where you can pick out the heat moving very easily could they use like a blimp or something just floated up above the sky and get a big view describe that shit there really ain't there dude that will micro copters and they they got all the money it's like Jack Nicholson and Batman where do they get all the toys you know there's just that's what they did why did they feel like they have to control things so much why is that why is there has to be so many so much resources spent on this aspect of society it's the infinite growth of monetary paradigm but it's also people who who have control if you will we good some will call them the powers that be I'm getting the column the powers that were because they're failing monumentally but they must maintain control otherwise all of the crimes that have been committed for eons welcome starkly clear to a lot of people all at once that's like the awakening of the hundredth monkey like holy shit we re human beings really have been farmed what is that expression the awakened over the hundred hundredth monkey because I've heard it more than once well that was in that was in the dock collapse and it's it after the second world war and they were playing with the atom bombs they wanted to see how long it would take to repopulate an island so they went back to this island and four or five years after and then it introduced trees and they got things growing they brought in like ten thousand monkeys to see how they would survive there was enough for everything but the the coconuts were slightly radioactive on the husks so the safe way to eat the coconut was to wash it in the stream and they taught like ten monkeys to wash the coconut and you know so then then other monkey's looking pretty soon there's 15 and then 47 and then 200 excuse me up you know 88 but when they reached the hundredth monkey all 10,000 got it all at once buddies oh yeah okay so then they all started washing the coconut yeah and and that's a that's a parable about you didn't tell me the story the last time you were here what did you know no that was in the movie that's what it was okay um but so that's a metaphor that's a parable about a radical shift in consciousness and right now a radical shift in human consciousness is the only thing that can possibly save us hmm and there's a part of me for all of the stuff that I've done bringing the bad news which was my mission that was my duty for like 30 years was like to warn and now this now the Fox medicine spiritual message says they've had all the warnings they're going to get but now I'm also very aware that this change of consciousness is happening and I'm seeing enormous ly encouraging signs of that one day we won't have to think about how we suddenly try to get governments to be honest or you know interview one day listen this government right now one day is going to be embarrassing it's going to be embarrassing they're going to look back it is I agree all of them have been it's we're going to look back on this time with shame because the people that are running this country this very small percentage of the people they're not going to be able to maintain it it's just this - there's too much access to information these days it's not the same animal as it was when this whole monster was created if you look Joe um anywhere in the world every government is failing yeah there is not a government anywhere that world that's succeeding because the way they're set up is ridiculous the whole thing is ridiculous and after a while people just they can't take the inequity of it they just people snap everywhere they were this if even this one the best one there is without a doubt I think America is the best setup there is I love it here it's the greatest country in the world but god damn it could be better it could be better by a million fold it could easily be better I don't think America can be fixed that doesn't mean that I'm an American what I mean is I think the United States of America as its operating now is not fixed well it's set up on a bullshit financial system that's that's a real big part of it it's utterly corrupt I'm Thomas for some here I'm saying this Thomas Jefferson said you need a revolution every generation have you ever thought about just moving Hawaii and saying fuck you you ever thought about doing that no no I I spent four months in Venezuela that was a unusual story but no I'm where I'm I'm up in Northern California that's where I'm staying staying yeah so the last word I'm planting my ass in there they're going to have to come by the bulldozer take me out of there you're out there making it happen doing well I are you sure that this is all gonna fall apart though it is falling apart what it what what is the possibility that something can happen that can pull us out of the fire something that's going to keep us from the old laminin to the mountain the only thing that can keep us from slamming into the mountain is for the human race collectively to see it's slamming itself into the mountain and decide to do differently it's got to be a change of consciousness this is not going to be a message written in a letter put out in a broadcast put out everybody's got to get it I personally think all ones the Internet itself is very psychedelic in the fact that it's responsible for a massive expansion of human consciousness not from a drug forum but from an information form the fact that here the access to information is so spectacular and so the whole viral aspect of it I think that that human beings right now is a very rare time we're in a balancing and right now but I think the information that we're getting from the Internet is expanding consciousness as much almost as a drug would you know as an influx of you look back unlike you know 19 between like 1994 and now what a massive change in our society has come about because of YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and the interconnectedness of society the massive extent of it is so much different than it was the evolution for though of on via the net are amazing amazing but I think that that's going to influence the the way the government works I think it's going to influence who that are in positions of power I think that's slowly going to root out the old the old system that's in place was all these fuckers were around before the internet all of them except Obama the old Salama you know he should have been just a little bit he's a little bit older than me so he was a grown man while the Internet came out he should have maybe maybe was too late for him too maybe maybe it's one more generation after this where they realize you can't fucking lie anymore because there's new technology that lets her read thoughts and then everything has to be done transparent I don't think it's going to take anywhere near that long this this this whole system is going to collapse because it will be satisfied with nothing less it's seeking its own death it's doing everything to kill itself intellectually anything running this world right now is being defeated do you think that's because the current people are greedy and they're just looking out for themselves and trying to just score short-term and just get out cuz that's where the money's at Michael Rupert I think that they're trying was good right it was good I think that they're trying to do anything they can to hold on to put what power and what information they have because they do not want the power or the information that they have to be shared and it's a it's a total desperation move and they're going to fail if I was a doctor for the world and I looked at this problem and I was like hmm oh I see we got this is this a bunch of cunts that haven't done mushrooms and they're running things that's what it that you have a bunch of old greedy fuck heads that are that are just uncited Ellie inclined they've never had consciousness expanding experiences they don't know the beauty in the love that you get from a psychedelic experience with friends where you you realize how much of the way you behave and live and interact with people it's just an insecurity it's just it's just stupidity it's nonsense I'm not shit out I'm not sure that would divorce things happen but somebody will cure it all baby or 7 billion doses of DMT you know yeah I think I think it would kill the ego I mean that's that's really that's what you have to dare you go there to kill the ego that's the dilemma that's the issue and and that that's why I'm writing a third book now because well that's why everybody hates a Chicken Hawk you know the idea of someone who wants to send people into battle that's never been in battle sounds well of course you're so confident and so of course you're so aggressive about this this is not yours to risk you know it's the the ego has not you don't understand what war is maybe if you had been there you would have a completely different sort of appreciation yeah you wouldn't be so callous and it wouldn't be such an easy I know I've come to a darker conclusion than that Joe and and and that is that these people literally look at us as cattle expendable cattle that have been farmed for millennia this is real or well this is this is this is what it really is it is all about human beings are born and bred to be slaves and consumers to generate wealth and that's the way it's always been roughly since there was since we started doing money this war who are they is it a vein or it is it just a series of shit choices that have left us in a situation where people are copying things you know there was a thing we talked about really recently on this show about the Salem witch trials so the Salem witch trials there was a woman who wrote a paper for a history class that sort of solved one of the major puzzles of the Salem Witchcraft Trials and it was that there was an ergot poisoning of food it was causing people to have LSD type effects and that they thought that this was responsible for the original murders but then they kept it up as a tradition for years later then it became a hysteria and then even though people weren't even a god poison it would actually become learned behavior and I think that in situations like where you have greedy business people and they set up corporations and there's patterns of learned behavior that come about from the way these corporations interact with their consumers and the environment they have their their businesses set up in and that this momentum gets carried away to a point where the greed and the bottom line supersedes human nature it supersedes the idea that you are a group of people and you know in the documentary the corporation they went over this that a corporation tends to act as a sociopath well I think we just have to make everyone aware of the accountability of their actions in that situation and remove that remove that as a design remove that that the diffusion of responsibility that you can get by being a part of a big group that does something really fucked up but you don't feel responsible from because you're just one piece from from my spiritual perspective and let me just add that my dear my DMT journey I think my cans just went crazy what'd you do to my headphones what happened what happened my cans just when I went into an echo chamber it's cool you're right you're right you know it's on right now I don't hear anything okay it's Fox match you know it was fought yeah that's the folks listening at iTunes there was a photo of him Michael with his dog and he's got the glasses on and I just deal with it yeah Danny's getting dog as a fox face that's brilliant very that's that's awesome DMT trip on the message I want a copy of that what is his name DMT to Mt understood DMT underscore trip thank you buddy I don't know if he made it but whatever what was I talking about um Fox magic no it's somehow another came up what were we talking about Oh DMT I approach that very spiritually I do medicine journeys as part of my spiritual practice and and it's very important for me that I always approach medicine with a clear intent and and it's always to seek and learn something better yeah you better expect it yeah yeah you have to respect psychedelic trips if you think you're you're the shit and you can handle a little fucking throw young there's a lot of people I spend days preparing do that yeah well there's a lot of people that won't listen to man if you left hammers around a lot of people going to use in the build houses some people going to break car windows with them some people are just going to hit trees friends of ours is like it's like they go do it and go to the UFC and I'm like man that's not that's crazy like you don't want do you really want that that's you do if you were Joey Diaz yeah I would say yes I would say if you didn't do it what are you a pussy if you were a real hunter s Thompson fan you're a fan of Hunter s Thompson and Joey Diaz want to do mushrooms with you at the UFC - fucking mushroom sure what are you crazy I of course that's not respecting the spiritual truth you mean fuck it isn't what a grand opportunity that is in life to do mushrooms at the UFC with Joey Diaz goddamnit that's the best seat in the house I thought I had the best seat in the house as a commentator I don't the best seat in the house is the dude who gets to eat mushrooms next to Joey da UFC cuz you know funny Joey Diaz would be on mushrooms it will me it would be a non co-op chuckle fest everyone would just be howling laughs and you'd get to watch the UFC at the same time my husband sonic attack sounds the greatest day on earth you might have a panic attack I think there's just too many people I like I like being with nature if I'm gonna go on any kind of spiritual trip I want nature I won't be able to elect are you talking about spiritual trips for smoking a cigarette it is just a trip it's just as it's a shitty one it's a de backhoe trip it is if you're Native yeah sure bad tobacco holds it there's a strong ritual for well it also um is a part of the ayahuasca ritual for some reason like a lot of ayahuasca rose I think that's how they said they they they blow tobacco smoke on people it's part of the whole thing yeah I mean nicotine or the tobacco end of itself and even nicotine is proven to have some really positive health effects there's something about nicotine that actually is like good for your heart you know some like it's not nicotine that's really the problem it's like caffeine caffeine is not bad if you have just a little bit if you're fucking crazy you're drinking Red Bulls all day and dirt dirt I check this I'm sixty-one okay I smoke everybody knows that okay my I just had a physical resting blood pressure was 60 blood pulse rate was 60 that's incredible st that's really good what pressure was 120 over so in really good shape do you do a lot of exercise very low I eat really really really good and and then I exercise as much I'm weed-whacking two and a half acres now so that's that's work that is work you know and yeah I mean you know George Foreman when it was training for fights used to chop wood so well-known fact you know it's like real work real work is hard work there's no shit that gets you in shape man that's a pretty low resting heart rate though yeah so you know what I'm saying is I'm I'm just real sick of buying into all the propaganda I'm sold about everything mmm-hmm because the way the people that run this world up or is they do at 90% truth and 10% bullshit and because you're not trained to separate the bullshit the bullshit winds up staring you one of my favorite articles the came out during the time that the Patriot Act was administered was a it was on CNN they were talking about how the CIA has announced that it's going to leak fake news stories in order to send terrorists in the wrong direction and I remember reading that and I was like wow that's like game over like they just came out and said we're gonna lie to you that was right at the same time that CNN let it be known that the Department of Defense was permanently stationing military intelligence personnel in the CNN NEWSROOM hello I screamed about that from the wilderness that was my newsletter for eight years we had some great people there we were just kicking Bush Cheney in the balls every chance we could get why was it from the wilderness why'd you call it from the Wilden because for my personal story I had you know I've been trying to expose see I was bringing drugs into the country for like 18 years and nobody had listened to me then Gary Webb stories broke and I confronted the CIA director at Locke high school and the game changed a little bit so I started FTW like a year and a half after I confronted John Deutsch and I was a voice crying in the wilderness but I was the guy from the wilderness that nobody had listened to and and then you know and so that came to stand for over the course of my career many hundreds of people and organizations who were all voices in the wilderness and nobody was listening to and damn we got it all right you know and there's some just amazing people I met along the way it's an interesting name I remember when I when I first found out about I was like what the fuck is but what's that from the wilderness I was like sounds very Unabomber asked found it you know look her out there this was before hearing at the disease society out in the distance ah ya know what this this was just hey you know pay attention were pretty successful we got to have 60 members of Congress and we broke the pat tillman the whole the whole cover up with Pat Tillman was was a seven part series we did at FTW and that's one of the good things now for me about giving collapsed that over to the employees I didn't get a chance to do that with FTW cos our computers were smashed in the Tillman series I mean police falsified reports leaked to editors who were having sex with my children and for defrauding me and they really threw everything but including the kitchen sink at me up and a link to editors that what was what was that oh there was my computers were smashed in part five of the Tillman series that's right when we were nailing Donald Rumsfeld and he was eventually forced to resign he was forced to his on because of the Pat Tillman ins yeah that was what did it yeah he just resigned real suddenly right when Henry Waxman's Committee on governmental affairs was getting ready to call him what was the issue that he had created he first of all if you wanted to have a bad guy in like a Batman movie that was like a bad government guy that was actually evil would not Donald Rumsfeld be the fucking perfect guy huh Dick Cheney's right he's right up there to both of them yeah but so what what exactly took place well we eventually needed the series was being written by Stan Gulf who was my military affairs editor at from the well that a stands a retired Master Sergeant from US Army Special Forces Delta Stan taught at West Point Stan is just one of the most amazing writers and human beings on really cool people I've ever met my whole life and brilliant guy and Pat Tillman's mom Danny contacted me trying to get in touch with Stan and and I immediately said we'd publish anything and I drove down to the Tillman house in south of the bay and copied overnight 2,200 pages of army records that she had been given all redacted you know all blacked out and pages and stuff but I they weren't files and sections and all this stuff so I returned the papers and drove back up to my offices and I flew Stan Gough into Ashland Oregon and we stand did most of the work but absolutely because Stan knew it all so he decoded the documents and figured out who was who and what was what and where was where I caught some things that helped but Stan wrote the 7 part series that proved that Stan that Pat had been killed by friendly fire at close range and the Silver Star awarded him was I think that that was probably the most offensive thing the for many in the mill in in the military was that that Silver Star was fake that just destroys the value of the Silver Star and so we broke that story and and very similar than what they do mean it's been the Jessica Lynch story they changed that story up to it apparently any story that gets released any big story gets doctored um favorably mm-hmm and so this one was an unfortunate incident it wasn't a murder right no one's claiming it was murder oh no I think people claim it's murder I think Danny believes that it's possible that her son was murdered I think she said so she said so to me um I it could not have been premeditated because it was in a fubar situation there it was not really combat it was an exaggerated stage play in some respects there had been some incoming fire but it was like three four hundred yards awake a couple of muj fired a couple rounds and ran away and and and here a whole lot of Rangers just start opening up on a lot of everything all at once this is basically the way that plate and but Pat Tillman's last words when he stood up before he took a three round burst from a sauce squad automatic weapon right here I mean it just took his head off or I'm Pat fucking Tillman and that's not disputed that that's fully in the record Oh who is the guy that pulled the trigger it was a sergeant in his cereal what was he just was he on edge or was he trying to kill him I can only speculate here if you add us but hat was a really smart guy and he was honorable he had seen that that the war was all fucked up it was all lies that you know and he was disheartened now here he was a pro football star right and and quits the NFL a huge move to join the army to defend this country because he thinks that you know yeah everything that you see in the movies is how it works out and you're supposed to rise up when your country gets attacked as a patriotic American he will do his part well well let me just continue with that a little bit and he kept a diary and so there would naturally be fear that he would come back rejoin the NFL and start bad-mouthing the government but that didn't really factor into it that that could have been controlled in many other ways than that Pat hung around frequently with special forces and that's not that's kind of a no-no in theater because one group does what they do and and anyway that's just the way it works um and I I think he was something of a grandstander you know a little bit and sitting he was making a lot of noise and he was pissing some people off and he was complaining about how fucked up things were and somebody might have put it to him he did yeah and and I think he became a ranger before he became a soldier and maybe only Rangers would understand that or SF would understand that but it's it's a it's a totally Shakespearean tragedy I mean it's just like so fucked up all the way around for everybody yeah did you ever hear the eulogy the brother gave mm-hmm it's pretty intense too you think it was something to extend to packing up hats not in heaven Pat's fucking dead someone was like I always a in a theist or something God you didn't know him because then he would have like lipstick all over him pictures like I don't even joke about this I'm gonna choke about unfortunately but you joke about what I almost I came close to but you joke about it with me you know made out of your head got blown off your head got blown off I wouldn't put a big deck like dam should try to suck at a smaller dick yeah pull your head off bitch that'd be the last thing I would do for you but neither Pat Tillman's like an American here room right the whole thing was sad it was very it was um you know it was sad that he he you know a he chose to jump in and it was sad that it wasn't what he thought the truth is is that everything about those wars the the post 9/11 was everything about those wars is fucked up and when when when you start off with everything on the on the floor you're building on that fucked up the war that takes place on top of that field can't be anything but more compounded Lee fucked up right how do you have a just war when you go into it with you know ulterior motives analyze yeah it's amazing that there's a lot like a fucking army of people in jail right now you know it's it's amazing amazing that they can get away with that level of corruption and not be accountable it's really but but they do in the world of ones and zeroes you know the Cartesian world measurement will matter and of course we know there's such a thing as spirit there are things other than matter but they operate as if everything is matter today that's what we got it to man we got to bring them into the light that's what we got to do that's the solution to all of it it's not as I'm not even fight them it's like they are us they're just us in the worst case scenario in the worst possible position doing the wrong thing exactly I think that we are at one of the most ethical times in human history of course all of human history and I really believe that what I said in the movie it is happening that that our species is being forced to choose whether to evolve or to perish right to grow up or fucking die well it's obvious when you look at like what we're doing as far as like sucking fish out of the ocean and depleting resources and polluting things it's like we're certainly not doing it in a sustainable way right now and now I don't I don't think it's impossible if if we kept the population exactly how is it it is right now it might even be possible to run the world the way it is and use the resources you know might be possible as we move along if it's not how are we doing it right now we we are overextended but we're doing it right now no no we are about everything is imploding right now right but right now we're doing fine right now we have electricity we I'm on the human yes oh yeah food ok it's not everybody this is this is your this is the ego bomb because this is where I know the hardest trouble but getting through to people but because they say ha how long do we have when is it going to happen right and subconsciously all they're really saying is how long before it fucks with me yeah how long before I'm uncomfortable exactly one you know a candle like here we are but I you know that's why collapse net exists because we bear witness to the fact that all over Pakistan cities are having blackouts and that by the way was very authentic plucky stockist on yes that blackouts lasting weeks at a time same in Mindanao India major power blackouts right uh civilization is collapsing all around the world and just because people choose not to hold it in their consciousness don't mean it ain't going on so you you recognize it as an inescapable trend that only a shift in consciousness can alter so if the shift of consciousness occurred how would that alter what would what would be the correct thing to do if the human population was brought into the light and everybody sort of figured it out and said hey we have to react responsibly and stop being a bunch of greedy cunts what would we do I think it would all spring from a fundamental overriding awareness not a conviction belief just awareness you know you're living it you know you know of the oneness of everything of the connectedness of everything that's the place where you start and once you you do that among other things you overcome the pairs of opposites good bad rich poor fat then whatever you know this world of duality and and I think there's some amazing work being done in quantum physics that is totally barring this out there's some amazing research out I mean co2 ami is a quantum physicist and great book out by David Wilcock and other stuff that a lot of stuff that I kind of became aware of along the way so there's I think the awareness of that once it once it comes or it flowers in the species and pray pray God's got a spirit it does soon we just won't we will just automatically stop doing all the stuff that we're doing that's turning this planet into a living hell come on the Gulf of Mexico is totally destroyed they got shrimp with their guts hanging out in one eye and that eye in their ass and crabs with half a shell I mean we've been running the photos of this on you know uncollapse net so climatologically there's there are plumes to one two kilometers across 20 30 of them of methane venting directly up from tundra in Siberia I mean it's like methane is 20 times more powerful of greenhouse gas than co2 this mess is out of control it's going to come crashing down the only thing because by calculation I had a guest on my radio show great guy a professor from Arizona State I'm having a brain fart on his name it'll come up in a minute thank you very much but climatological that there's an incredible study that says you have to stop all economic activity now or else all of everything dies irreversibly as a result of temperature rise it's hard science so you know on all these fronts with all that stuff happening I just stood back reason I went this train wreck cannot be prevented at this level of consciousness the only thing that can save us now literally is a miracle right a miracle a revolution of human consciousness but if that does happen if this revelations revolution whatever you want would want to call it if that did happen what would we do how would we fix everything that just seems to me that we have to ship things okay we have to move we have to manufacture shit we have to move it around places because people need stuff you know you got to get food to supermarkets you gotta you got to keep growing it you got to keep me keep a good cycle going on so you got to burn something you gotta use something's got to run those engines then a con top of that you have to have leased public transportation and then people were gonna want to have cars okay how you gonna get all the shit drive drive you crazy thinking about that don't well it's amazing that we got so out of hand we got at us as a society we're like it's like someone who was just at a college and you gave them an unlimited MasterCard and you don't have to pay for the first year and they just fuckin went bananas you know they went bananas to the point where it's completely unsustainable and then you realize you have this debt of the the way you're living it's just so disproportionate here's the ultimate kicker to all of us there are not enough resources in the world to pay off the debt that has been printed since 2008 all the bailouts are debt so all the resources in the world like as far as all the gold all the diamonds all the oil about iron and copper everything food but energy is the first resource because without energy you can't use anything else so that's amazing so how is that possible that we have an economy that's not based on entirely weather what anything could be worth that that just shows you how completely full of shit the whole idea of the economy is if they're the hole all the resources in the world and you owe more than that someone got fucked someone someone someone fucked you out of the whole world yes yes think about that yes think about how strong the fuckery is in this economy that is so bad that literally we owe more than there is value in anything in the world to pay off it costs more to make a penny than a Penny's worth the same thing I mean it seriously that's that by mahir's lights every here's here's usable here's the catch - all of that is found founded on on a premise of infinite growth Wow a infinite growth on a finite planet it's not possible - finite resources hmm yeah you ever read black gold stranglehold you know the the premise behind oh oh that was who was that was that your own course no that was uh that was a disinfo book was it really I had it on my disinfo show really yeah so it was a book that was reduce its did sound completely ridiculous I was like wow how do you how is the only guy that knows it uh the the premise was that gold that oil was not a byproduct of fossil fuels abiotic yeah yeah that it was a process of the the net is like literally the blood of the earth earth has an endlessly filled creamy nougat Center that will satisfy your every desire for as long as you're kinky ass should crave it what divorce evil vampire cunts people are we just suck the oil out of the earth until it's dead that's what we're doing we're running our entire crazy business on the blood of the earth we're like the crazies exactly what it is - yeah it is the blood of the earth oil is life all we're doing is burning ancient sunlight that was stored in life it's all solar energy and one for bruh nother on this planet it's crazy when you really stop and think about it like that it is gosh it's amazing it's amazing when you really think about what it is why why do you think the natives call it father sky because they were dumb they didn't know about planets a lot of shit they didn't know oh yes they did didn't even have fucking the horses man we had to give them horses settle down fuck magic that might be all fake listen man those are the pea that came across the Bering Strait and it was proven recently actually when this Mormon dude tried to tried to flex because he in the Mormon Book of Mormon whatever the fuck that nonsense that Joseph Smith character wrote when he was 14 years old yeah everybody followed along with it was said that they believe that the American Indian was actually the Lost Tribe of Israel and that he was going to prove it with a genetic test so he ran a DNA sequence on the American Indian and most most of it is actually Asian most American Indians are actually they came down from the Bering Strait Hopkins Siberia Joe 1860s running a DNA test what no no recently ran a Tommy thanks on American Indians to find out the origin because if they were Israelis he could like see this is the Lost Tribe of Israel if they were Semitic and you know he could I guess they could find that out but it was not it was the most likely that they were Asian religions or business and it and I really think overall Christianity had the best business plan that's what it boils down to yeah but what's happening now is people are also beginning to understand that part of this Great Awakening is that many of us are returning to wisdom that existed before really the word religion even existed it was it was the knowledge of the Ancients living in direct connection with this planet and everything on it you can absolutely you can absolutely learn from other people's revelations that are written down and recorded but the moment that people start attaching gods to them and sorry that you're talking about a bunch of shit you don't really know what the fuck you're talkin big then you really don't know what you're saying you're saying you're saying a bunch of nonsense right you know either you learn something or you didn't but the when you when you start thinking about things like Mormons or Scientologists or anything where it's like just even a whiff of crazy it's like how do you address that idea do you allow it to happen as I'll tell you I've never met nicer folks than Mormons some of the nicest people I know are Mormons they have a great sense of community in the Mormon Church I've actually been to services before because I had friends over morm and I've been to a more funeral before they're very polite and nice people and if you wanted to find like a religion we said well here's a religion it looks like it enhances family life a little bit they do a lot of things together there's probably a lot of benefits to it when you get past the fact that it's based on some nonsense fairy tale a young con man Mormons are also very very very smart in that they have focused on food storage and food preparation for a long time and that is the single most critical factor for who's going to make it and who's not and you go dude you can't you have to bring everyone back to the end of the world doom and gloom well no need take it we might have a wake-up it was the last time you're at Disneyland man oh my god I know it works today but you should go to Disneyland before like fucking Planet of the Apes stock collapse of civilization happens and you're out there Mad Max in it and you're fuckin biodiesel truck and you pass by the Disneyland when Anaheim is a fucking ghost town and you have to get in the car because the zombies are coming this sounds like a movie yeah it is a movie woody Houston would

Space Mountain I'm waiting like 10 minutes to go on a submarine I know the submarine I like the teacups that you spare kids love tea kills are fun those are fun Disney less fun when you when they're your kids it's really an amazing thing that happens when you have kids is that you get the actual joy of them having joy it's really strange like I used to see kids having fun and not go oh that kid looks like he's having fun that looks awesome and it would make me feel good but it doesn't make you feel good like you're a little kid experiencing the happiness when you have a kid and they're happy like jumping around and laughing and have a good you actually experience that feeling it's like you live through it it's amazing you do it amazing you know and I don't like I don't like when kids have that that thing where they out of nowhere they just like start grabbing on your Legg like like like holding on to you and you're like a random stranger kid you're at your gardener just grabbing it yeah it's uncomfortable you like uh-oh do I do with it do I start documenting like I don't wanna be happen nothing kept it does it by yeah well I don't want to pick your kid up and have you weird out - hey so some dude just picked up your kid you'd be like hey man what are you doing - baby yes Oh God see that what a commentary on this world well yeah absolutely there it's like there's so many of

download I'm just checking what's going on in the universe around here and well that's it I just think it's possible that a lot of people okay here's here's a funny thing when you're worried about the end of the world you worried about the collapse of civilization and in the meanwhile people see you smoking cigarettes and they go if you want to stay healthy and happy why are you poisoning yourself

amazing people get tired of you kicking their ass it's amazing what raged ya can do you know it's fuckin assholes out there man we have to but if we have stopped that Michael Rupert that's my number one goal in life lately to figure out how to diminish the amount of assholes in the world why well hey I beget off the internet I've been up here today that's the secret I became a cop trying to do that and and you know clearly that's a losing battle that was your motivation to become officer to try to make a difference absolutely do you remember when you started to realize that the system was almost like unfixable well you acquire that in stages I mean I pulled one worm out of a can CIA bringing drugs into the country I said this is wrong soon as I get this to the right people's attention they'll stop it immediately wrong of course that was before iran-contra and and so that worm turned out to be all of human industrial civilization it turned out to be the whole economic paradigm it turned out to be everything was crooked everything was a lie everything was manipulated I had a CIA friend recently who I was talking to former CIA guy and and and he had been in a meeting that was the first briefing of Bill Casey as a DCI under Ronald Reagan Director of Central Intelligence bill Casey were the classes start ran around contra he had been a stockbroker before he became CIA director there's a clue and Bill Casey took us domestic cocaine consumption from 60 metric tons in 1979 to 600 metric tons and that money went to Wall Street Saudia Casey had his first briefing as DCI and he said gentlemen we will know that everything that we are successful when everything that the American people believe is true is false whoa Jesus Christ I've been around like I kept good notes that's why I'm alive I took a really good notes and I left a good solid record you know so you think you're alive because you've said too much already and there's nothing they can do about it it's like it's it's out there no big deal let them live I also think I'm alive because spirit wants me alive spirit I've had I've had spirit intervened so many times in my life and that's part of what the story is now that I have to tell in my next book because there is something powerful and and I think wonderful afoot here and all I can do is tell the truth about it but it would be dishonest at me as a journalist to leave that out of the work that I've already done when you exposed all this when you expose the CIA when you stepped in front of the was the man's designation the guy who in John John Deutsch he was DCI director of Central Intelligence appointed by Bill Clinton that was an incredibly courageous thing to do on camera you know to step in and and not just say that you were a former Los Angeles police narcotics officers that we were that had caught the CIA doing this but you named operations you mean you you you gave that information it wasn't just it wasn't just a blank I had I had a lot of shit yeah that must be the worst fucking case scenario for the the creepy industrialist cunts that run the world some dude who wants to be a superhero some dude who wants to save the world so now well done I've just pissed off I hear in just fuckin that right you don't listen pissed off for a good reason and you don't you don't want to recognize this but that's a hero move okay when a guy does that and stands in front of a motherfucker like that and you say what you said it's a brand you have that clip well then pull that clip up cuz for the people who don't know who haven't heard this or seen this this is pretty intense stuff man gonna make me smoke yeah go ahead smoke well is it's a it's a courageous move man I mean it takes a lot of it I know you couldn't help your courageous you can't help but you just it's what what I wanted to get at was sorry what was what was your thought process and what was it when you finally got that information out when it came out of your mouth what was it what was it would that feel like when that whole courtroom was chairing that was you knew there was a high school auditorium there were 12 12 over there in uh-uh it was high I was a it was unbelievably high it was like super peak awareness you know you know how it is and when you know how it is yeah and and it was like wow it was like one of my favorite Maxim's is don't shoot unless you got a head shot and I had John Deutsch in a head shot right and I pulled the fucking trigger Wow and that cost him his appointment as Secretary of Defense really yeah and as he clowned him like that uh-huh didn't have anything say more like a sound be wringing his hands and yeah you know he looked like the typical evil white dude that's exploiting yeah that's it back back it up so people can see it this is November 15 1996 as a former Los Angeles police narcotics
