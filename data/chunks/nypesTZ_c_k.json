Drew mysterious terminal illness yeah I called I like coke yeah but maybe that's what he's doing I don't know I mean he's pretty fucked that's coke there's girls are talking about him doing it having briefcases of coke delivered that's not some shit you just get over hanging out by the pool you know drinking margaritas he's still getting drunk all the time he drinks he drinks whiskey or vodka on a show on that show he's got like a bottle with him he's trying to hide yeah cuz they're not paying me they're not paying you I know Charlie Sheen you a million dollars per show it's weird how other people are reacting to him like Roger Ebert got pissy with them did you see that now after Ebert and Charlie Sheen got in a Twitter war and it was like I wish you know I could live like Charlie Sheen but then my wife would leave me and I don't want to be alone and miserable like him am i whoa the claws come out Roger Ebert alone with it why is Roger Ebert even talking like that about Charlie Sheen that I could live like that first of all dude no you couldn't you can't even talk he doesn't have a tongue anymore right right Roger Ebert had mouth cancer his jaw doesn't work anymore you would think that would be the least of his worries would be what Charlie Sheen is doing you know that's so bizarre they would even comment on that and then Charlie Sheen responded back and of something about you know that we've never had five girls at a time winning raining earn it plan better that's not 11 is it most guys you must be like really lazy because if you're having sex with that many people you just kind of stay still and let it like come around a friend of mine told me about when he first started making money and he's a famous gentleman so I can't say his name but he got two hookers at the same time and he laid in bed and just see hope and I almost his voice like you haven't lived until you've had all these women like tongues just licking your body ever really he goes yeah it's like

see quite a while you leave the door open though no you with you you're leaving the door open see this is what I just don't want to lie to myself I understand you know you don't have to you can promise yourself and then keep a promise but you know this is the thing like when people talk about what you want to show with you you know and you say stuff like that they really you know Charlie Sheen was sober for a long time when you making 2 million a week and it just fucking keeps coming in and you got a stockpile and you got a lot of balls because everybody's kissing your ass because you

magical you fired up for the show tonight I am this is exciting it's gonna be it's already packed inside and it's incredible when you get to go out in front of Joe's audience because it's real comedy fans and it's exciting we almost lost everything there folks it fell but only a small candlelight is that way yes we're sitting here it's like ten to ten Bob on stage al magicals on stage right now this is the world-famous Comedy imagine about the new most of each California so one of the most historic comedy clubs in the country there's missile riding on this wall from 1978 and look at that that's like the earliest I think people have found the 78 but this is like a real classic classic comedy club Jay Leno comes here every Sunday and works as a lot of auction we're just sitting here freaking out about how crazy it is that we've done almost fuckin podcast this pretty bizarre doesn't it mean isn't seem crazy yeah that's a lot of if you think about that's times two hours mostly yeah how many that's not ours I think what what we try to do on the podcast is we hope we're all trying to have fun you know we're all hanging out together we're all talking about cool and interesting shit we're trying to have fun I think that's what a lot of fucking people are missing in their life they're missing fun and they're missing two people to hang out with you know where everybody's enjoying each other's company you know that's that's not present in everyone life and with the podcast it sort of allows them to be in on it there that you know they can hang out and have these cool to our conversations with us they can't talk back but they can be there for like a real conversation not just brown just a show but really how you think about things really how I think about things and so you know sometimes it's weird like me and Pete Johansson you know we don't agree at all and sometimes it's weird like Andy Dick he's trying to fuck me or you know sometimes it's we were like when we were talking to Danielle on monde Dana Dean Armond stories strange as fuck man she seems like this really cool normal check you know and she's this crazy porn star yeah but she's like really fine so it's a it's a fascinating gig you know I'm so glad that we started doing this you know we've been doing it over a year now just over here and it just started off as a goof where I remember yeah we wanted you know the idea I think was when I we were always trying to do the justin.tv thing I like doing like a weekly video like live from the green room while we're on the road and stuff and then we I was always trying to like push for that video thing so I think it started off when we've we didn't even think podcasts at first we were think of doing like a like a video show I've once a week and cou Mia inspired me yeah does that live at the compound yeah there's so many funny guys that are smart you know when you get guys like Duncan and Brian Cowen and Eddie IFFT and Arya there's so many dudes that would have interesting opinions on so many different subjects I said the luckiest thing about the podcast is that we get to have regular conversations with all these cool motherfuckers well hasn't it mean is it do you think it has improved your life has it improved your life apakah yeah oh yeah absolutely is it improved we think yeah because it's finally getting like putting my thoughts and ideas to an audience so absolutely I mean that's what I've been trying to do you know at least on the internet for a long-ass time yeah and now it's finally coming together hey so what's the thing the best thing we've ever done it's the best thing I've ever for sure because it's the only thing I've ever done where it's really 100% me you know you kind of like get to know who the fuck somebody is when you watch them in a stand-up routine or when you see them act or you know maybe when you see them do some interviews but interviews you're fucking quickly they're over but you don't even know what the fuck you were supposed to say you feel weird when you leave like every times on your Tonight Show interview or one of those things when you sit down the chair next to Jay Leno I'm talking about I'm just trying to be funny I only have like seven minutes you know I'm just trying to keep it together hey come on hey ed how are you no seats so anyway but with the podcast when you're when you're on for like two hours man you know you really get a chance to talk to somebody you know exactly though like now people understand the brilliance of Duncan you know Duncan is a really good dude he's a fascinating motherfucker you know but it's really gets Illustrated on the podcast and Bryan Callen there's a lot of people have no idea how smart Bryan is or no idea how funny joint fucking Diaz does that's what I think is the best thing because like like like what you're talking about like in with the death squad I get to put fucking these people out of nowhere that no one would ever know about at least to an audience idea you you've created a radio station the death squad is a radio station we're gonna use this as a video commercial and it's brilliant idea Bryan red berries are fucking genius a master Monty you saw a head a soft to the future created a goddamn broadband internet radio network type thing of podcasts you can't fuck with that you can't fuck with Todd why are you trying to fuck with Todd can't fuck with it figured it out crack the code you hack the system top 20 on iTunes what's up with that top 20 just so fuckin dude from Columbus Ohio making people

this bikini contest it never happens and they say well now instead of bikini contest we can have the comedian's moon walk away and crowd disperses ago and I look out the middle of the audience as I'm starting up and there's a little boy holding his parents hands just going like this looking at me flipping me off just holding it not even moving he didn't flinch at all you just held it my entire set I just looked away and that's all I could think about this kid as so as I was doing I was like this is horrible so any time but I go up and I don't see anybody paying attention you know we're talking
