always gonna be someone who's upset you yeah matter you yeah for trying for anything you'd rather I don't try anything no matter what you're doing to someone pissed yeah it's such a crazy place the internet it's so crazy and that's where we make our home that's what's really great it really is nuts it's just in that light phone now no it hasn't come yet it's coming at the end of October oh oh I'm trying a regular phone this month a regular phone yeah so I got a new number spark that oh yeah yeah like a real cell phone like a smart phone no I got a new number and did a regular flip phone okay but the old number I'm keeping it on on a smart phone I'm seeing if I can handle it for a month I don't know signs are not great already it's the fucking being alone and just kind of flipping through well watching Walking Dead and then flipping for like double screens my daughter has a phone now but she has a little thing my young my middle daughter not like the older one but um where she has a screen limitation where she can only use the screen could you turn it off can she yeah it's not just one alarm no she doesn't get to we do it so got an hour and then what happens after the hour stops working what stops working everything except phone calls you can get phone calls in an hour of total use hmm see I need that but I can't find anything like that so how does she not be able turn off because you have the passwords for it yeah oh sorry just don't give yourself the chance to do the passwords what do you mean just just put it on an hour when the hours on over just accept it in your head that's not gonna happen that's crazy talk Jamie it's his plate oh that's crazy talk doesn't work I know an hour what the time limit is as soon as you see like your time's up there you go oh well let me finish sending this one thing I'm hoping that Bert and Tom both say that we cheated already we're good dude the first year everybody dinner somebody said Kent bucho they were like but you are cheated oh that guys do tell me right now if is cheating cuz I'm done yeah that's cool I'm out one of the great things about our contest is there's no real ramifications other than talking shit you know like Bert came in last but what happened to him what happened to him nothing nothing he just talked we just suck it all I do is talk shit and then dealt with no repercussions we all knew that we couldn't lose to Bert that was those a massive motivating factor for everyone including Tom and when Tom came back and he ran 13th fuck he was done on injury he was done he's sick he got really sick yeah yeah he came back and the day back he ran 13 fucking miles to try that I catch up and he did catch up this half seven passing belt this year now the belt stays well I feel like that there's no belt because it's not a competition this year this is the problem the prim we're gonna explain this folks on the sober October podcast which is right after this but the problem is we none of us have the time for the competition I can't go crazy why what's different from this year to last year I'm too busy is questioned yes is your schedule not exactly the same as it was last year more podcast for sure are you doing more podcast yeah more podcast and other various activities outside of the podcast and then the heat that I took from my family like my kids didn't see me for a month yeah that's why I thought I had some sort of chance because hats we hope but I forgot that you guys also have gyms in your home yeah I have a full gym I had that 24-hour gym I would go to yeah on the way home from sell that's where I got some nice points yeah that's a good move well you when you first figured out that you could just watch a movie in that that distracts you enough to do cardio and you can get some cucumbers okay oh that's pretty smart because that does distract the shit out of you it makes it way easier yeah I would just post my workout would just be the movie that I watched dude I'm already high from the cigar yeah right I feel like we're out I'm just hoping Tom and Burt come in together first place let's have a dance-off for first place dance-off when he was talking dance-off I was like he's just gonna take his pants off I know what he's gonna do and then he did that video and that's exactly it fucking first two years in her comedy when he was said he was terrible he would do the pants off thing good million out some persons doing now 28 years in a comedy should stop but people get mad fees if he doesn't take a shirt off I know it's he's a trap I would be mad too if I went to see Bert Kreischer his final time doing stand-up in my city what smell Ben is loud it sounds like there's a fucking tornado in here does it I can hear it through the headphones is it because we're talking cigars oh yeah I know damn I got a head rush off the cigar that's what I'm saying we're high dude we're cheating we're fucking for sure cheating I know what I'm gonna do dude this whole fucking the Yankees are going all the way I'm gonna have to put your Yankee games we're out take a drug test right now like elevated levels of nicotine we should be doing so bombed we really should be going for it the other way talk to those guys into it let's just switch it up you guys some whisky meals really go hard um mushrooms every other day yeah imagine what kind of a person you'd be at the end of month you did mushrooms every other day can I tell you a story sure so I went to a music festival and there was this guy who had a lot of my camp had never done any mushrooms and this guy did mushrooms for four straight days four straight days he the second day he was like we do mushrooms again I'm like they're not gonna work you really have to twice as much and just kept going third day kept going just munching mushrooms for day it didn't touch his phone at all didn't touch it he had like four percent battery the whole time was off and then he turned it on and he's texted and he had to tell work he wasn't gonna come in the Monday you know he'll work from home they gave him some shit he just looked at his phone after being on shrooms for four days he looked at his phone you just see it rushed into his head like this thing brings me such fucking misery and I had such a good time without it and you could just see all that set on his head he just goes fucking launches it well he just chucked his fucking iPhone as far as he could Wow yeah it was such a great moment you can't do mushrooms do many days in a row you get fucked up yeah what did he did he sober up after that and then no his phone his other friend went and got it and like held it and pointed out like no I'm holding this for you it wasn't broken no it didn't break are we guys that was a dirt he threw it on it was on a dirt slash rock path yeah could easily hit a rock yeah easily oh you have a case on it I don't know no no I think what the point is that he threw it the new ones are supposed to be way more resistant to drop it I love how the as soon as that came out though I owe and if your job of more than a foot away it's gonna break this brand-new design the iPhone doesn't end it is a weird thing right we're guarantee you're gonna drop it t if you drop it it's gonna break like I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on recently and he's always got no case on his phone that's the thing he marvels about there's a design that's amazing design and what you do is you get Jamie rocks no case because of neil degrasse tyson's people copy gotta listen to her why would he say but anyway he came back and his fucking phone was broken really had dropped it cuz he pulled his pants off like or his jacket off or something like that and was in the pocket of his jacket and it fell to the floor when he like pulled his jacket off a car yeah he didn't he didn't account for the certificate force of his pants coming down on the outs of torque yes of all that you didn't duck out so he has this starry night van Gogh painting it's better a thing on his back the back of his phone and little bits of glass we're coming off it and realized that it was cracked like huh so smart that you don't have a case but it is weird that there we have this super expensive thing that everybody carries around with them that if you do drop it it will get fucked up yeah what me what just had a new fold phone that cost like $2,000 years ago use a pen or you can't use your fingernail or anything it'll scratch Oh what that's crazy how does the galaxy fold yeah yeah if you use a pen like you can't use like that S Pen you can't barely no not even a fingernail how do you use it so softly just fingertip like it's none it's not doors not ready that's the second design this is second iteration of it in the first iteration like immediately started breaking as soon as all the those you know those influencers those YouTube guys like unbox therapy and MK HD mkbhd wanna take the be up mkbhd is that right you got it a lot of letters marques Brownlee anyway he's Oslo these guys these YouTube guys make these videos explaining all the details technical details these phones they got them early and they all broke everyone's bra so they had to send it back and they did a revision of it was supposed to come out in April and now it just came out here in October and a couple people haven't broken already it's 2 grand you know it's so expensive for a phone the new iPhone does maybe 1200 bucks I think I'm not buying it either I don't like the fold I don't like the whole idea but it looks nice but you have a tablet on you as the point right every moment you have a full tablet you can really try it but it's not that much bigger than like a Galaxy Note but this is really big for YouTube videos Netflix video on the go that light phone I'm excited about the light - you download uper on it and stuff like that you know a couple apps there's yeah there's a ride-sharing app I don't know which one I guess probably over right there's a some maps aft but like this that's pretty good look how this works oh well protected this is the Scotty's case it's a special case and as like a little salt and little thing on the line this is my note so I have a note now and I have an iPhone but the note the s-pen is pretty fucking sweet I'm not gonna lie there's a lot a lot of sweetness to it yes but you do write on it mm-hmm yeah write notes on it but the the thing about this thing that's very impressive there's a lot of things the size the fact that when you have it open it has an imprint in in in screen fingerprint reader but there's no bezels what's a bezel there's no outer rim on the outside it's just all screen there's no thick black line around the outside edges oh right all right yeah it's just off screen there's one little button on the top one little hole on the top where the selfie camera is I'm excited for Joker yeah looks looks pretty good it does look pretty good everyone Joaquin Phoenix was pretending to be crazy yeah what was that you could sort of tell at the time that he was sort of pretending yeah yeah he was he's he had a character he was doing for a documentary yeah and it was like what what is this I don't get it did you see the guy from empires speech like interview yes yes yes that seems almost like he's not pretend like he's if he's pretending he's doing a better job acting them joacquin Phoenix what is Terrence Howard a flower of life well Terrence Howard the guy who interviewed me for Rolling Stone told me the Terrence Howard is like a legitimate genius like you said you talked to the guy who guys absolutely brilliant maybe figured it all out I think you got high as fuck on DMT that's what it sounds like he's starting to figure it all out yeah it does sound like that right 100% yeah yeah it all makes sense like it but the inability to explain it just kind of like it's all connected but he was not explaining it very well but very articulately like he was using it wasn't like nonsense talk right he was like like oh this is like shockingly coherent for a ridiculous thing to say if I've seen on to talk about what happened to him Shane which one che mas no he did I fo yeah no I just really had him on back you with which which what happened to him though I think he's in mushrooms every day for a month or DMT every day for a month and he also covered himself in I'm getting the terms on but maybe Syrian Russo this shit couldn't come out of his system and he went a little bit another how long it was this mmm maybe a year and a half ago okay so I had one before that yeah so we went to see Roger Waters he's got tickets for me in Providence I went down there and he was like talking like he was like I figured out these math equations and he was like the whole time is like dude I know I'm getting I'm a science guy I get this seems ridiculous I understand why you wouldn't believe me but I can like figure shit out to the point where mathematicians are like mmm I never thought of it that way he's like I don't understand how it's possible but I get why you wouldn't believe that yeah yeah he was like he was you know when you're coming out of a mushroom trip yeah for like 30 40 minutes you're like not quite coherent cuz got a foot in there and a foot out here he was like that for hours and I guess for like months yeah it was just in a constant state of coming out of a mushroom trip I did DMT three times in a day Wow the the third time it was a really strong one and it fucked me up for a while I don't remember how long afterwards but this was during the Fear Factor days but I remember reality the way I described it the reality was very slippery yeah very slippery like I kept thinking that cars we're gonna fly over the incoming lane crash into my car and kill me oh really yeah I kept thinking like be really careful but then I realized that what that is is like my ego trying to protect me by making me aware of imminent threats and trying to reestablish its position as in the chain of command because like one of the things about really extreme psychedelic experiences that they dissolve the ego to the point where you realize like you don't really like you're a part of some crazy system and the only reason why you think you really matters cuz your biology wants to stay alive because there's these inherent existential threats to your existence that have always existed throughout time and you know ultimately though it doesn't matter because you're just gonna live and die and probably live again I again and yeah and you're part of some one of those guys at any time you're like fighting it like you're stuck it just means you haven't taken enough I think that was like Terence Mckenna or one of those guys was like you just have to take more and you can't fight it right you're gone you know yeah but I was fucked up for a while really but I was functional I was but I was real nervous and weirded out by that long a long weeks maybe months why'd you do it three times in a day were you trying to do that on purpose or the first time was light I went in but I didn't go in too deep yeah but I saw the visuals and I lay there and I was like I got to the door and I could see through the windows of the house but I didn't go inside the second time it just like opened up a fucking vortex and shocked me through to the center of the universe and then it was really really really intense and then I did it again after that it's because I loved it because it was so awesome I wanted to do it one more time I gotta do it more mmm vape pens yeah that's what we should do on November 1st very pens yeah we should do DMT in the morning yeah in here you're gonna be in New York oh yeah well soon as we get back kind of my apartment okay yeah that'd work what that'll work yeah yeah you could comes out those fights no I got no wedding oh Jesus yeah who's getting fucked prints oh no not yet remember this game over t-shirts showing where they're all the rage I love my better speech I love those whoa that's so bleak it's such a crazy institution that works out half the time it is not stirred I was talking to my high school friends it's one of them we're talking about how long they've been in their place without their wife or kids like how long has been since they've been alone in their house you know not on the road and not without their wife but with their kids but like alone one friend said it was ten years he hasn't been alone alone and slept alone in his house where no one else was there well I think that for comics one good really good thing about going on the road yeah get these little resets and you miss them and you come back yeah you happy yeah I meet guys that don't ever leave their family yeah ever and they look beaten they just look emasculated and shrunken deflated fuck you man I'm happily married I believe you why is a mad man I believe you I believe you I'm just saying I see a lot of people that are beaten down people get annoyed with each other look if you and I live together you need a break here there if you and I lived in a two-bedroom kill each other be so mad at each other with it how long a month or even faster we would be first of all I'd be immediately saying okay this is temporary we're gonna get our own apartment there's no way we can't last like this but when I lived with Duncan in my big house yeah nine for us six full-time living me for six months I think some of it helps if you know it is temporary kind of like summer jobs were okay because you knew at the end of August this is over but then that first year were you were just like working you're like there's no end in sight well to see roommates can be cool if they're cool right like if they pay their rent if they're never there that's the best thing you can do is to never be there yeah or if they clean up after themselves yeah always clean yeah that's big that changes everything like if your roommate just leaves their shit everywhere it's annoying even if they're not home but if your roommate cleans up yeah then they don't leave their shit everywhere then it's just a person that you really like that you see every couple days okay what's up man what you been up to yeah but my have sex themselves this is kind of big and stretched out so Duncan was over on this corner and I was over in that corner it was done with your Kate oh man he did his job he was like I didn't really see much of anything yeah hey what are you gonna do I didn't really see much of anything the guy's been really cool to me didn't see much of anything ask me again I love in this attention I didn't see much of anything about I did an audition once with Kate oh really yeah yeah there was something that I was doing with McGuire and some other god that never wound up getting made but anyway we were all together and Kato came in to read for it how shitty is stand-up when on your way down that's what people go into but more the last I out of out of complete show me Daniels is doing stand-up now Piven yep yeah they're all like well I just tried this at the end well stand up if you look no respect but here's the thing if they did it and loved it and respected it and was fuckin gung ho for it I I have a unique opinion I mean I know a lot of comics get real mad at people trying to do comedy yeah I feel like anybody trying to do comedy is a comic yeah if you respect it and you treat it well that's how I've always treated open-mike errs have you are an open mic er yeah in my opinion you are a comic that's that the one last thing you always say no no that's not anymore oh no no it's now it's it's only Asians of a certain we say even joke around about anymore they're serious there's so serious Hey Dude there's been so many more Asian jokes around the scene lately it's almost seems like this has reminded people of that whole fucking angle yeah yeah we should not be talking about cuz right now there might be ninjas in here in this room yes that's good I'm not high it's fucking that cigar we're totally cheating but no I really feel like anybody what boy yeah yeah yeah straight trans whatever the fuck you are if you're doing stand-up you're one of us that's how I feel I mean you might be you might be terrible you might be on the one you know your first couple of days but yeah you could eventually be my peer I think that's why the stores civically even there's this like respect for the door guys because like they go on to become the real comics and half the real comments were door guys yeah arch number so there's like yeah you're just me but earlier yeah I mean you Duncan there's a bunch of you Sam Kinison Bill Hicks they were all door guys yeah yeah the store is uniquely special in that way that it really promotes there's a lot of people the Improv to though that our comics that's cool but the door like the store brother they make a big deal out of the fact that you can get spots you can get those late-night spots which are giant you know it's five minutes to open to that those are huge and you know you get those occasional belly room shows and although you you get to meet guys like us that'll take you on the road we also get to see real good comedy night after night after night ten styles yep you need to see the murderers the murderers yeah don't you grow a lot in ways that yeah how's he doing killin do you think you would like intentionally fuck up for five minutes when he was doing like 30s and 40s you know like fuck over five minutes and get everybody I kind of against him and then I could test his stuff out yep yeah you do no purpose corny jokes he would do corny jokes and he would also just go what else what else okay till people like I don't know the guy we just an actor yeah yeah he would just dig little what else I love that what a comic does that what else do that if you could dig those holes and then dig yourself out then you know that's a real bit Bret a bit that digs you out of holes a real bit that's a cool that's a fucking shovel you can dig a hole with that shovel you know like two bits you know bits are pieces of expression but some of them are just tools so we're they're they're tools like like it opening bits like I've had opening bits we're like okay I need to detonate this door to get into this room clear boom detonate the door okay now we're in you know I mean like it's a tool it's a tool to get the job done yeah yeah Jake Johansson's do this joke I opened for him once in DC he's a great guy yeah he's really nice real he's really nice killer stand up to ya never see that guy yeah I've never run in the road yeah mostly always but um built his own house he's tall guy who's like fine they get showers they're coming from over I don't defend himself I had somebody build I mean I'm sure yet someone built it oh yeah no that's not that would be he's out there Unabomber in it yeah but it's all I got lame and it's all falling apart because I'm doing like band-aids over holes she left me that late night tape that's supposed to stop leaks keeps a boat yeah up the bottom of the boat is filled with tape but yeah he had some joke at the very beginning and you'd go behind so like you introduce something that you go off so I couldn't tell what he was doing he just said it's good to be here in DC and everyone would laugh and I'm like what is that joke and I asked him I finally saw it every night I would do it and he would like it's good to be here in DC and everyone would laugh and I'm like I don't see where there's a joke that you're only here so I ran out to the curtain it opened up slightly so I can see and it's just an easy one he just goes it's good to be here and then I turned around a look at the sign and goes oh TC I'm like oh I get it now but he goes oh dude my first five minutes like don't judge any of that yeah that's just me getting him on my side yeah just working yeah cuz and then I got him from me and then I can do whatever I want little tools things to get going technique savers you ever ever saver start off joke doesn't go let me go real quick yeah you always gonna have those get out of jail free passes yeah you only got one or two of them and then it's like well now it's just gonna be a full bomb yeah it could easily be a full bomb but one of the most satisfying sets you can ever have it's like you start bombing and then you pull yourself out yeah when the crowd doesn't like you and then they slowly start to like you yeah that for whatever reason just turns them yeah you know you you said something I think is so true that this is a great time for real comedy yeah yeah it's great comedy is dangerous again oh it's so much fun people hear something like oh oh it's back into these little basement rooms everyone's attacking it all the time it's so great you know if people get mad at you for saying something like harsh and you walked with that fuck you know cause you know like you've made some Catholic joke and they're all like butthurt because they're Catholic yeah you know you got them can you know it's okay cuz they're only they're angry and everyone else is laughing like crazy yeah now the scale of that is just way larger yeah there's stuff and go out and just like get a bunch of people angry because the people that are cool enough till I actually like the stuff it feels way more dangerous and fun you know we should do with this podcast with Tom and Bert we should do like buds training bring in buckets of ice and just have vodka all over the table Oh see if they'll be okay yeah see if they tap they ring the bell yeah I could see Bert doing that would you talk Burton the ring in the Bell special every time we smoke cigars we got high we smoke cigars laced with formaldehyde yeah was that called Sherm wait did you hear about that lady this has nothing to do with that what she just got convicted today of murder she walked into the wrong apartment no cop right yup she thought this guy was in her apartment she shot him and killed him she said let me see your hands yeah anybody from his point of view is like what the fuck are you let me see your hands yeah and she shot him I didn't hear that part but I just knowed she shot him and murdered him mmm accidentally she thought he was in her place yeah she yeah it's a that's like I heard her like crawling in the Sun yeah and it was like damn but it's just like I don't know why do you keep going to shoot it don't shoot right the guy run at you yeah it's like oh like when do you shoot someone if you find them is the training wrong why unarmed people are getting shot it's not really it's not like that right it's just like I mean you got it wrong at very least you got it wrong well I've said this many times and I think the vast majority of interactions that people have a police or their positive there's no problem yeah and that's why you don't hear about them but you hear about one every now and again but that's just because there's 300 million people and if you could you count up all those one every now and again as it seems like this is fuckin just yeah assault on unarmed people Tories who listen to over over statistics what's just it's people that suck at being a cop especially girls no no offense ladies but you're physically weaker right yeah so you could get that gun taken from you someone's in your house you live by yourself maybe and you see this guy in your house and you're so terrified because like it's like a monster yeah like a big man yeah like a monster to a woman yeah and then at the same time that dude is in his apartment now that's dead so that's also not great oh it's terrible but like you're not supposed to just shoot people yeah you're supposed to shoot into her eyes yeah if she really thought that she was that's why I don't understand how it's murder like what well it's what's the accident isn't manslaughter like accidental shooting I understand any of that how's it not manslaughter yeah you know I just was following the story a little bit I remember some facts from a few weeks ago that there were a lot of there are at least three or four things in place here that like made it not seem like an accident like a really like the door for instance the door in those apartments I was reading like it shuts automatically so she I think she said it was like unlocked or it was kind of open and everyone that sort of knows about that apartment is like that's not possible this door shut out mapping behind you you would have had to open the door she open the door didn't shut all the way I don't know I think they had a relationship maybe two or something like that what's remembering the facts so listen you can't just say that let's start googling I heard the guy she shot was new Supreme Court justice Kavanagh oh and he denied it that dick after a while it's like no more dick for you yeah I think it's a great time to be a stand-up I really do think it's dangerous again you know people alike it's like you hear something when you are one of those people just go to shows you hear something you're just like as an audience member you're just like well so the woke outrage has totally worn off and has the opposite effect like with Dave Chappelle like you know you can just skip Dave Chappelle's new special oh must be awesome I love the rest about the internet all coming together just to respond other people goes cool whoosh I check out those people Thanks exactly Thanks / - yeah you know but but Chappelle special you know the whole thing was rotten to me you know they only allowed five different woke reviewers to take that yeah they gave it a 0% and then they released to the public we all loved it cuz everybody was mad like your job is to tell us what we'd like and you failed at that job well their job is to review things and their ideology that they're forced to exist in is woke ideology anyone who's worrying working as a journalist like there's really same thing the Christians did when they used to review stuff for like Christian content remember that oh yeah when they were rated based on how many kissing scenes are there how many curses are there yeah it's like you don't take you don't have to see those reviews those are like a separate people's reviews well somebody wrote something about it that I actually retweeted today see if you can find out about the the connection between theology the the resemblances between woke ideology and theology they're they're so similar same yes it's about compliance we watch it doing it our way yes our way our way put your hat on you know your special underwear on it's Tom it's so fucking border so dumb I hate even talking about it just like we're just writing jokes and doing fucking good things but whenever someone who's woke says something that's ridiculous it makes for great comedy Richard David yes I darken is coming on the podcast soon too excited to talk to him the righteous in the woke why evangelists and social justice warriors well click on that so I can get with the actual why evangelist is social justice warriors trigger me in the same way it's the same like you got to do it my way shit it's the right way it really is yeah well it's about compliance people love compliance they love getting other people to fall in line yeah and they get scared when people are just out there doing whatever the fuck they want to do and that that's that's with everything man that's with their diet that's with the way they behave this is the clothes they wear people get mad they get mad if you wear your hat backwards like I asked my my friend who's now a rabbi I asked him for help with a thing I'm doing in my hour and should look it up just factually I wanna make sure I get it exactly right right and he's like no I'm not gonna look that up for you just so you can make fun of it like what that's not your job your jobs to tell me yeah like I'm a Jew asking and it goes now I'm not gonna be part of this mockery I'm like you haven't even seen it you haven't seen it Wow someone help you I know but it's like fucking hard to find somebody who knows it knows it I don't have any people left mine that part of my life he really won't help ya oh my fuckin shut up all you religious people all exactly save every religion it's fucking real and then what you want in terms of like not being embarrassed yeah it's hilarious they would have something that you don't want you mocking just let me information you can't hold it for me right like imagine if there was something like that would stand up like no I'm not gonna tell you how we write jokes you're just gonna mock it how do you get up an open mic tonight I'm not telling you just a dog I mean I've got a market but it's gonna be in a fun way how do you go from being an opening act to be in the middle to be in a headliner I'm not gonna tell you I could tell you they're gonna mock it anything you can't mock is bullshit that I was so mad I was like get fucked he was like come on don't use that language you know I'm a rabbi like eat my shit all you really just fucks are exactly the fucking same Nazi for help as a Jew but how how are you still a Jew this is what something that's always struggled there are troubled people that are non-religious Jews are the rare people that can also be atheists yeah it's kind of like you're not stand-up is rare and they are form that it needs other people to exist it would use rare because you can see bit cultural and racial Jew yeah a religious Jew but it's a racial jube it you could be born in Europe or you could be born in Israel you can be born anywhere and be a racial Jew but yet you are not religious at all at all but Jewish is a religion yeah Judaism is a religion both yes yeah I talked about this is my new way I do yeah yeah that true stuff is a lot of like it's all just stand up but it's a lot of like stuff you've always wanted to know yeah well you remember back when used to tell me those stories and I'm like how are you not talking about this stuff on stage I wasn't good enough yet yeah or I was too close to it but so good that you waited to know I'm really good at stand-up and I couldn't like really delve into all the absurdities yeah really go into it in a way and know how to like ease out and like so Jews don't feel attacked and then it's gotta be a rabbi out there that'll give you the fucking I got a fine one if had robbers come to the shows and some of them have corrected me on stuff and like oh interesting thank you I want to get it right find those guys yeah yeah I gotta find him your friends lame he's lame fucking he's always also trying to get me to come back he's always demeaning me like oh yeah the fold I don't mind it in a nice way but not like up you're wasting your life cover up your bald spot with a nice yarmulke yeah exact height get you a sweet one for all the ladies like you're f conservative friends who don't even understand your life they like what they insult you on you're like no that's a good thing yeah yeah freedom yeah when they're like you came up drunk at 5:00 a.m. on a weekday yeah right isn't that awesome it was great I got a I got a ride I'm responsible I remember a blog you wrote a long time ago and you wrote like people you come at home and somebody like leaving and then like I think the line was if you could smell my finger will blow your mind gets super self-righteous about their choices but people like to feel like if they're getting up early and you're coming home as they're getting up that somehow they're doing better than you yeah that's not true I've had a most fucking amazing night ever yeah pussy what do you been doing watching Golden Girls sleeping he's a comic like you can't tell like like mark Normand came in here with the clothes that he was wearing the night before he came in here all night and then he slept till noon and made his way overslept to look 11:00 or suit made his way over here with a suit on that's great I love it I love to fuck it yeah man that's that's us that's our that's our religion yeah if I have a religion its comedy yeah yeah for sure if somebody tells me something I was like will they joking yeah well you know that's my thing now is whenever I hear a comic my instinct right now is wonder can you believe they said this ridiculous thing even though it's not on my side of things I believe you know I start to get angry and then I stop and go wait a minute let's look at it under the lens of their comedian right on something and sometimes they're serious but a lot of times like oh you this is a joke there's a tongue-in-cheek like exaggeration on purpose or yeah or you try something and it doesn't work you know don't hold someone to what they're saying what is you know like this is it goes back to this Shane thing right let Shane Gillis thing leave him alone he was just trying to be funny he was trying to talk shit and be funny and you miss and people like it's just racist mic mmm yeah but sometimes racism is funny if you if you go if you say it in a way why don't you call it jokes about race relations yes jokes about race relations which is something like can't we talk about that yeah isn't that one of those big taboo things each touch on you can't you tell what races can you openly mock with no white yeah right Indian I guess it's going away Indian and Chinese was a an Asian I mean yeah you used to be able to I remember yeah he's going away right now had a joke about Pakistan yeah Pakistan was about to go to war with India and he was like what are they fighting over who smells the worst and he did this all the time and this is like you know early 2000s but if he did that joke now people would be fucking mad yours but that's what makes it more fun too they're getting so mad and while this dude was from Texas he'd never been to India or Pakistan right it's like no idea if they smelled bad that's like it's very harmful no it's not you ever see a picture of like or a real racist somewhere you know I got real raised yeah and you're like oh I think you remember what they just were mad about some other guy in like comedy being racist and you're like guys that's not even close like this guy made a joke and that guys here's how you know who is a racist when you accuse them of racism and they don't deny it they're like yeah fuck them that's the racist person not wouldn't they be like no no no I didn't really mean that that's how you know they're not really feeling that way but if you make a joke about murder are you a murderer really secret yeah you are really I think so wow that's there's certain things right you're allowed to joke you could even you could basically you could joke definitely joke about fucking animals mm-hmm right nobody thinks you're really into bestiality well what I think is all this stuff about like you can't joke about race or gender but he makes child murder stuff like all the better mmm like it's a grand time for that that used to be too harsh when I start comedy is right up to Columbine and that was like no you're gonna ruin the room but now it's back really yeah child murder yeah yeah yeah school shooting shit you didn't joke about school shootings problem yeah yeah if you do it well if you do it well but if you don't it's still like a Jesus Church I got mad at a lot of people over that louis c.k thing i got mad at a lot of people yeah not because what he said was great you know what Louie said what you just because you pushed some fat kid into the way irrelevant irrelevant they're relevant whether it's good or bad it was let me tell you something if he was left alone with that bit he would turn that bit into a great bit he would have figured it out yet had not done comedy for almost a year yeah this is one of his first sets back and he was trying to turn this into comedy and he could have turned that into comedy the people are like it's not even funny it's like okay but if it was just about not funny because I think I'm not gonna say whether it was or wasn't I thought it was funny actually but it's irrelevant because like if I make an unfunny joke about traffic no one's coming after me you know it's clearly not about whether it's wrong or not has got nothing to do with it well it's whether or not you should be able to make light of something terrible and you can't let somebody not fail that direction there be a fill in all directions you try to find the line well I understand regular people not understanding that I really do but I don't understand comic comic I mean I'd understand comics not understanding the process of creating material like you are disingenuous you did know I can't understand that if if you are if like say someone like it's like a Jim Gaffigan type comic that's never offensive I'm just like kind of you know family-friendly you could anybody can go see African he's hilarious but you could take your grandma out of C or with Network well if he did a joke about a school shooting you'd be like whoa Jim but even then I would still say he's trying to find an angle yeah let him do it what do you mean let him figure out the angle the people don't laugh that's it's almost on the wrong we talked to calf again after that you be like how do they did they go for it he'd be like not really Wow you're gonna try it again cuz maybe but maybe you'll pull it back I've had a bunch of bits like that rose like I gotta bail on this bit yeah where it's like you try it and try it try it just doesn't work but that's the process so now if I'm a young comic if I say can I even come close to the line because if I go over it that's what you do when you're kind of blindly walking towards a line if you go over it in that direction you're fucked yeah you might really be fucked forever so I'm not gonna come close to the line that's not good it's not good finding it takes that and puts it in quotes and just right takes it out of the context takes it out of context and then writes it down yeah context to the tone of voice oh sure yeah and all the things you've said before that right yeah I hate it I hate it but it's a good time that guy's really funny yeah stand up yeah it's it's a great time for standing up I mean look the fucking store sold out every night I know some people like it's the unist and I was like what are you talking about this place when they're not going to see any specific person they're just going to see stand-up in general those are mobbed the stand in New York mob the seller mom I get on at 1:30 of the seller sometimes 1:30 a.m. on a fucking Wednesday and people like is anybody there a mic yet so there's no room dude I was reading an article when I talked about Hannah Gatsby and the death of stand-up comedy I was reading it in my limo on the way to a sold-out arena look dude I go I guess there's not gonna be anyone there I have a special on Netflix I guess it's all terrible huh I guess there's no comedy anymore yeah all you gotta do is shut your fucking phone and nothing that shit exists for the most part here are their yeah there's some bad shit about somebody made a joke and unfair level of punishment but generally it's just like shut your phones just people being angry yeah that's what the internet is anyway it's a it's a really easy way for people to complain dude I loved it I was waiting for it you see that video I made for so bombed October yes okay so I was waiting for because I knew overcome people like this hilarious when I put my friends all the points aren't the right this we had to do more points for this so let's punch it waiting for it and then I finally saw it was like this is very responsible you should be ashamed of yourself people have real problems there it is and now it's just a question of what percentage of people have that reaction and what percentage don't yeah so there's only one guy no one's gonna listen if it was ten guys or if there's one guy that has a big Twitter following now everybody's like feels like they should be mad you ever see one of those anger things where you don't quite get it you know like sometimes you're like I see the other side I think it's too far but I see the other side and then sometimes you're like I don't even understand why this is even a topic you ever see those mm-hmm you know the e rages where it's like yeah really oh yeah it's some of them you just don't even see and that's a light week maybe yeah Duncan told me that half the anti Star Wars tweets for Russian BOTS I think maybe they're trying to shove shit under the radar that's what I've heard like yeah whatever so you just have people in the crowd big BOTS go I think that was terrible like in a real like animated that was your real life brawl between two people two groups and you could just go into one and be like you called you a faggot right I mean everybody turns around and gets it going again right right these things don't seem real a lot of you take the wrong side I'm like I don't think you really care if I showed somebody whatever that first one was for that further for that guy for sharing that funny comic if I showed it the back table cell but what do you think of this so one of those whoa comics who said or people who were like I think it's too far if I chose in that video if they really didn't like they would go with that so go look at it there we go that's dumb and that would be the end of it right that would be it but they have an opportunity to feel like you gotta say something up and let everybody know that they're on the team that deserves virtue you don't think the guy's taken enough abuse at some point you got to see the damages internet shit does to people and it's like you're gonna pile on it's covered he's been its it is punished I'm hard I like recognizing who's gonna always fold SNL will fold and well comics 2's know it's an organization with a bunch of advertisers and apparently that was the big deal they had a page of the advertiser but my thing is this kid the network's just call each other netflix and FX and CBS and Hulu and Amazon and I'll call each other just have a meeting that people who run it and say we got a release a statement and the statement should go no matter what somebody said in the past we feel like for starting from here on in we don't even know what the rage is gonna be about we feel like we shouldn't be responsible to be judges and juries on that we feel like we've gotten it wrong too many times and if you guys don't want to watch that's up to you but you got to take it up with the performer the artist whatever and if they all just release that statement together people just wouldn't go to them they're never gonna do that then why that make it like it ain't us you guys cuz I forgot to take it up to the comic advertisers use it as an opportunity for them to merge virtue signal and get more people to buy their product they'll say we do not support this idea that hate speech is something to be casually dismissed there but they won't because they're saying it's not even about anything in particular it's about we're not getting involved in this but somebody did on the other side or what you're gonna define it as we've been through this with rap in the fucking 80s it's just we're not getting involved I get it if for a month we're not touching anything it just takes all the pressure off you you don't think if Amazon and Netflix fucking talked about let's just all put it out together and then what do you want to be the network is no no we're gonna actually like boycott our comics if they actually do say something and a separate platform or do you want to be the network going yep we also agree comics do whatever you want you're not here it's not like you're saying something to somebody in the hallway of SNL you're saying something separately for the fucking 6,000 followers you have we sign up for that shit right they're never gonna do it why cuz too much outrage you but then that takes the heat off you that you have to deal with it from now on too dangerous right now Ari be perfect he's perfect that's why you don't run a business ap but they all should just do it they're never gonna do it what is that wristband Yvan Oh Music Festival oh yeah I got it I got to get tickets for next year and once I know what's I do I'll cut it off yeah you've got to get tickets for next year yeah once you do you'll cut it off there that helped you get tickets yeah dude it's all about the mindset dude I gotta tell you about well 50 years old what are you doing with this fucker no I'm waiting good luck hey I went to this nightclub in Germany in Berlin it was fucking so fuck dude I've been having fog going around places yeah yeah yeah what was it okay it's fucking bats they do shit on another level there I'm not any EDM and stuff but like it was great as soon as you walk in it's like okay first of all you can't even get in oh my god okay the first thing you see when you get in is just a bunch of people in leather worn out it goes from Friday night midnight and so like Monday about noon well you need to stay in and do hella drugs and just dance for like techno and like house music on different floors will die in there they must they must they must go too hard and have heart attacks yeah but everyone yeah they must yeah but when you're down there it's on the third level where there's no and just people just coming down I went in like a day and a half so it was like Sunday when I went so people are just like out of it sweaty girls with like tutus and like whatever there's a coat-check place where somebody said somebody check their GIMP one time well yeah yeah like you can take it for me yeah okay the very first thing I saw I go in it's overwhelming me and my promoter were there we're like this is fucking too much and we're like are let's get beers and I saw this is a great dude the way to get is to wear all black or wear leather or just be with gay people gay people just get in and they make sure it's like a good time for everybody and uh they make you put a sticker over your phone no pictures they'll throw you the fuck out do whatever drugs you want anyway as soon as I see it there's a guy at the end of the bar just getting jerked off as he's ordering by a guy or a girl by a guy from the top by a guy yeah yeah and he's fucking the beer out of it on drugs I still try to get some dudes other hand is just gone inside his asshole yeah a full like cuz it didn't make sense the choices yeah I think I mean I don't know something it might have an opers it might have been I don't know what was doing at the inside I might have been open or closed like a puppet yeah and then it's just debauchery you just get drugs in the bathroom and dance and dance and oh yeah full you see full like blowjobs going on Wow it's like anything goes people are out with 30 dicks dicks out just fucking jumping and dancing if you gave everybody drugs that's what they would do oh my gosh yeah good times it was the best you just walk around and you go to the bathroom somebody read she was looking for like anything what we trying to get ecstasy probably right Molly you know something like that somebody eventually gave me one I was like I got enough for my promoter got to and he was like no no I'm going home I'm only staying till like 3:00 I got my kids like soccer game tomorrow and I was like alright so I'll throw this out then I'll just throw out the exercises are fucking relax so he took something that we just start dancing man it was so fun the music is nothing I got like the best DJs in the world like go down there and just let me show off yeah just like do sense yeah it's kind of like the Comedy Store kind of like the Comedy Store it's like the best comics in the world do what 15 bucks nothing to do with the money they're trying to show off Wow oh god it was so fucking fun they just have this like nightclub culture they'll even have like rockabilly bars there and then people are dancing on the back do you remember when the early days the internet you would get shit porn from Germany uh-huh it was always from Germany they go they go whatever you're into just go for it why Germany like do you think after World War two they just went crazy no I think not after World War two I think after the Berlin Wall fell I think it's all reaction to that shit really yeah because they're not really in Berlin at least they don't really think about the Holocaust anymore they're thinking about that east-west mmm that's their most recent massive restorable you know and that was what was that the eighties yeah yeah that was during the Reagan administration wasn't mr. Berbatov tear down that wall didn't I know I think I know somebody who had a piece of the wall I had one you could buy it at Spencer's and stuff yeah poster of a guy with this like that Oh dick root oh just like a little bit you know yeah it's like hanging out with a cowboy hat mmm you know Abercrombie and Fitch you know that store Ambercrombie and ponch yeah you know you go there they spray you with some fucking toxic chemicals yeah you know that so the whole place is filled with perfume it's really strange that used to be a place where you would go and buy like legit outdoor gear if you were going fly-fishing see if you and I were gonna go down the fucking River in Montana I become a good fit to us yes that's what it used to be Wow pieces sound like kayaks and shit yeah it was like flannels by the time I was and now it's now it's just like DJ Pierre but it's all these weird hermaphrodite looking people like everyone is everyone is like a sexual or weirdly thin it's a strange you know gender-neutral you know the girls are they all look like they're 14 The Crying Game yeah all the crime yeah nobody knows The Crying Game is anymore oh one of the first transgender things we'd ever experienced yeah culturally The Crying Game that sign across the street from the store on the Hyatt that one's another like a gender neutral Asian lady without like a slightly less gender-neutral Asian lady where is that it's on the store the one with the parking lot faces you know there right now there's a sign there right now what is it it's just these two two asian models yeah but they look like what the fuck are you a boy or girl yeah but that's in now it's in if people can't tell if you're a boy or girl yeah it's nice material so it's mysterious but why is that in more people into that I don't know look what they are but it's wood they're into it for advertising right but are the into it like how many people like what is the market for like people being gender neutral looking who's like hey man you going out tonight yeah and I try to meet somebody what are you trying to meet someone who I can't tell what the fuck I just don't want to know I don't want to know I'm doing anal and I don't want to know when I pull their pants down I don't know what the fuck to expect while you're looking for a boy or a girl who cares Wow I don't care I don't care if you're gay or straight or trans or what fuck Everlast just signed their first ever transgender boxer it's a trans female-to-male boxer and my first thought was this guy's gonna get lit up he goes and fights actual men oh it was female-to-male yeah well hope they're all amateurs I guess maybe dude we saw it skank fest naked rose-petal say this is it that's a female-to-male really yep look at the shoulders that was Andy Dick's head like a perfect track teams to a mixed gender races yeah really races disaster tweeted about it yeah it's a disaster roids yeah well the men blew by the women like it apart that's how it works kids gender shit know who you know transgender athletes you know suffers women that's that's always women when you when you're trying to like make everything diverse let's diversify and include everyone no you're not including everyone you're including men to compete as women that's what you're doing because the women competing is men like that every last boxer and I haven't sparred in forever I'll knock that dude the fuck out there's just no way this is a difference there's a giant difference though guys never gonna beat Deontay Wilder he's never gonna beat a real Boozer remember Andy Kaufman was full-on challenging women wrestlers he was going as hard as he could amazing he was going as hard as it could there's a lot of women jujitsu people that'll fuck you up though mm-hmm but that's a different animal you're not punching things I mean there's a lot of female boxers it'll fuck like Claressa Shields will fuck you up you know there's there's a few Ann Woolf she'll fuck a lot of men up but it's not normal you're not gonna fuck a normal man up who weighs the same weight as them just that it is not it's just not fair it's not fair and women suffer with this transgender athlete thing what do you think they're gonna suffer until I figure it out or what they well the Olympic the weightlifting committee has already figured it out powerlifting committee they've already banned transgender women they've banned all yeah the whatever the organization and power lifters is but they they've put the fucking kibosh on it because all these trans women or fucking men are breaking all these world records Gurdurr how weird they're crushing these records it's flunk is like we want to be like okay I want understand your plight but at the same time you can just kind of see it from our point of view you are setting world records all the time it doesn't make any sense it's just this weird City you know what it is it's where the rubber hits the road when it comes to this whole trans activism thing like this is what it we're really like when gender dysphoria becomes a real issue when that when is that one physical competition and physical altercations if a trans woman beats the shit out of a regular woman in a bar is it a girl beating up a girl in a bar let's let's be honest it's not yeah it's a male it's a biological male beating up a female that's what it is that is what it is and there was a study recently released about trans athletes and their physical performance after you know one year of transitioning and how much the males have lost versus how much the females have gained female to male gained very little male to female lost very little really yeah very little it's like a very small decrease in their their overall strength after a year of transitioning Oh looks small like below 15% Sal rageous these it's women it's biological women getting fucked over by people who want to be a woman that's what it is and everyone who wants to be oh we're diverse and we're inclusive and you know we're progressive and what if you went from woman to man could you then fight against the women no if you went from women - man you fight against men and you know what can't you in this new world could you fight back in the book because you like if I'm born a woman no I'm a man yeah can you wear that where should I fight you have to fight man no yes what I'm saying under in your world in my world yeah where they do they can't fight if I trans people compete against for the trans people and I'm just saying - like how about we get the races separate as well these black guys should fight blacks and these whites or white White's we need a chance we need someone to move a porn up your fighting we don't get that I would definitely watch a white fighting League I've been telling I told Dana white I was like if you really want your people into the Ultimate Fighter you gotta do an Ultimate Fighter race I'd have four teams Mexicans or any Latinos blacks whites and the Asians and then have them fight against each other have fort captains each of that it would be so much fun all amateurs be a real issue it'd be so fun people get so angry but they don't sign up for it well it's really weird when they do like Brazil versus the US yeah they've done those I know that we went to what it was great right but it was Brazil like Brazilians Brazilians are you know fighter like that yeah race Dana a better race I believe they did Ultimate Fighter Brazil versus us all Brazilian team all US team but the thing about I'm on Team White's I'm on the flats Jewish what are you Jewish you know that sure why Jews oh we could just be the guys who wear the suits and right outside the premises hate the Jews that's one of the things get mad at favorite goes crazy they always had yeah Wanda lace Wanderlei Silva versus Chael Sonnen yeah that's right no I want a full race this is a good start for sure hold on put that back up Jamie yeah make that so I could read the whole thing maybe a little smaller make it thank you so it's at that yeah the coaches I think he might have coached team yeah I don't know about that that's it that's just Vandelay versus Chael I don't know if it's specifically Brazilians versus Americans maybe I'm wrong you can do it all the fighters who sign up for it they know it's a joke I think it should be we're more at odds with each other than ever why not capitalize on that I think you should be white racists versus angry black guys yeah that would be fun yeah you could have cowboy Cerrone I don't know what is a cowboy Cowboys you could have only like half and half people coaching each side okay like only yeah mixed race the only mixed race people yeah yeah no that okay let's we're tweaking it we're tweaking your night here somebody says out loud I realized that maybe that won't work mmm you should be coached by your race well it's weird when you go to other countries right cuz did you see what happened you can make it friendly to you could be like if this if the Spaniards win one you could be like now you guys I'm gonna show you something about our we're gonna all go to this this restaurant and I'm gonna show you what you know horchata it tastes like and whatever I thought you're gonna say go to the bullfights sure well that's yeah yeah if that's part of their culture satellites at ladies of weird like bullfights are a largely offensive thing that still romantically received by a good portion of the world like if you think about what a bullfight is like a qualified the matador that is that it's not thought of as an offensive thing but it's hugely offensive what they're doing I want to go I went to Barcelona I look but they don't really have any Barcelona they have a Madrid yeah that's what I've heard but they don't really have it there but because it's like inhumane but like I would still want to go I just watch the guy get gored really on yeah you got fucking killed you get killed by the bull that's being with the cockfights I've been to cock fights yeah I had a gardener it used to slip back and forth back from Mexico to the United States and what eventually went back to moved there have your students this is the border I was looking at this one day there's no order oh yeah right by Tia Juana and there's and there's bullring right on the edge here like that's the walls right Tijuana that's right I mean it's basically San Diego oh wow that's crazy swim at an already active but it's right there I bet it's active well let's google it I tried looking around one day and they don't have Google well I mean I couldn't find like an event there they have concerts and shit in this things don't know maybe maybe they use it is not just a book is that but is it just a spot me too it was a bullring that seems like I mean take a peek at what it is you can see it looks like it for you yeah it looks exactly like that I want to go to what hey I want to find out one what is in Spain and go to one it's probably really sad Joe where do you want to go if you go anywhere it's like no not you hmm Jamie you two do you have ever have countries just like pulling pulling at you I think Africa Africa yeah me too I would like to go in Safari like a legit safari out there in a car yeah you know I wanted to go to the Congo but every time I talked to Justin ran he's got some new fucking disease he's got some horrible parasite that's eating away at him right now not great he said malaria three times that guy's a saint you know is a fight for the fur guy he's he's uh he's a Bellator heavyweight is over there making wells for the pygmies oh yeah yeah we contribute this this podcast and through the sponsor called the cash app every time someone signs up

they're building he's going down there all the time to build wells and last time we came back with some fuckin terrible parasite and the doctors are trying to figure it out it's like some jungle shit he's in the Congo he's literally in the jungle you know I was catching these weird things I had this guy dr. Peter Hotez on he's a specialist in tropical diseases and told me literally everyone who lives in a tropical jungle environment has some parasites Wow everybody shouldn't be there you just you just live with parasites you're gonna have worms and fight this thing in Laos where you sleep up in trees like if they're called like the Gibbon experience or something I didn't do it but I talked to people who did and then you just hiked all the way through the jungle and sleep way way up in these tree tree houses monkeys all around you and shit and like every day you have to take off your shoes and burn off the leeches because of non dangerous leeches but they're all on you you gotta burn them off yeah do you have to set like a match or cigar and like fucking touch it it's like woah yeah but parasites yeah so gross they get like someone died recently some guy was swimming in some lake I think in Florida and he got some bro or maybe Texas got some brain-eating parasite that went into his fucking noggin and just wanna eat in his head like it happens bad dude I want you to do it episode of skeptic think of my podcast where we just talk about things that'll kill you you've been talking about that shit for 20 years different things that kill you last time yeah would be about that yeah let's do that I'll be back in November we'll do that so I just got back from elk hunting you know yeah I was it was awesome my friend John was twenty yards away from a mountain line they were both stalking the same elk and you know he's moving so slowly such a great hunter that the mountain lion didn't know he was there so he's creeping up on this elk and he looks over and 20 yards is 60 feet can you shoot the mountain lion no you have to have a tag which means you have to have it's a limited draw hunt if you want to hunt for mountain lions it takes like 13 years to get a tag it's very difficult and you in the state of Utah so he's he's creeping up on this bull and he realizes like big-ass mountain lion was like 20 yards away from him so he jumped up near and screamed them out my fucking took off what the hell - also took off also took off come on everybody scattered yeah he was trying to figure out what to do yeah what should well you have to be careful because if you get too close it might decide to you these animals if you're inside the area where they don't think they can get away they'll they'll turn to fight and that's when you're fucked most the time it's just gonna just run away to fight another day like especially mountain lions they operate on stealth their whole idea is sneaking up on people yeah things dude I was I was in so I would I do as soon as I go from car from city to city sometimes I'll do an add-on show you know on a Wednesday or Sunday sure and I'll get a car and I'll Drive I like driving around the country but so I was doing in Tampa driving across I know maybe up as my parents first but anytime I see a swath of green I'll just pull over and like hike you know and this would yeah sure let's say I'm thinking them well anywhere but in between Miami and Tampa is just a big swath of green so I started hiking but they have this big fence around everything and I open it up and start hiking and they talked about like sabers or whatever Panthers Panthers yeah they go like those Panther attacks are rare we strongly advise you not to be out alone Panther attacks do happen and I was just like I don't know hiked that bad today it's a mountain lion system yeah yeah it's like a slightly different gene pool but I don't know when they're sneaking up on you I don't know any of the tricks I have a no part of that yeah well you you be you definitely be fucked yeah but there's other things that can kill you in Florida a forest filled with stuff that can kill you snakes and shit yeah I like the fucking travel on those I like walk getting out of my car just randomly and some like the nobody's out in a weekday right nobody's notes up yeah but if you found a meth lab back in the woods what is this four years old no human has been attacked by a Florida panther in state history Wildlife officials say oh then I would def have done it it's that true pulling the fact is where this is from that seems interesting oh yeah that guy might just been saying because he loves Paris maybe yeah leave him alone get out there pussy ha ha ha yeah people get attacked by mountain lions though and it's basically the same animal but I think the Florida panther is a really small population there's a very small population of them I got so scared when I'm walking alone to the woods and I'm like shaking my keys and nef squirrel makes me fucking my heart beat so fast mmm whenever I hear anything much Kerry gun then you feel empowered yeah fuckin assault rifle sight start cracking off rounds oh yeah an attack yeah that's world this is America you saw I'm a fucking man it's coming at me I'm a human being with a gun yeah the woods will make you realize what a bitch you are man yeah I'm frightened of everything and you no one's gonna hear your screams then you start thinking like how am I gonna get out of here if a snake does bite me like a rattlesnake like how far do I have to hike by myself out you have some endurance athletes some famous endurance athlete just got bit by a rattlesnake he's in the middle of some like long trek oh shit that's that singer well is there mike posner he got bit too oh and I got to yeah mike posner he got bit a con us what was he doing he's walking across the country and like walk across Colorado that was the story but I feel like someone else got bit too someone on the net to get somewhere I feel like I gotta get like medevacked out for a couple weeks or something no that's rich rebuilds that's a guy who looks like him it does it's a very interesting guy he has a YouTube channel and he bought a Tesla that was junked mm-hmm and then bought another Tesla and with the parts that it needed like two junked Tesla's and pieced it together and made his own Tesla that's cool like for a significant discount and that's cool yeah it's really cool but this Tesla people don't like him because they don't like the fact that he's doing that and so he can't get a shit fixed at a regular Tesla do is it because they're blackballed them basically yeah so he opened up a place called the electrified garage he's got his own Tesla unauthorized I love that gorilla shit well he's a great he's great too because he's just a real techie nerdy sort of very very informed guys for in a car guy too so he just like well this doesn't make any fucking sense like how how can I do this and so like okay he bought one that had been overrun with water so all the electrical system was all fucked up but the body was good and he got another one that was in a car accident but the electoral system was good so he took that and put it in there well pieced it all together and now he has a working Tesla self fucking Hamby yeah very clever fella he also was one of the first guys I ever met that had one of those disease it's called a rat rod as this new shit he made that yeah okay so he got a fully electrified old-school hot rod Ford Model A Wow uh-huh he's a smart dude motorcycle engine in it smart dude I love those guys that are like find their passion yeah it really likes doing that yeah I figured out a way to make money out of it yeah but he's also just an interesting guy that thing about his YouTube videos it's like his perspective on things is just interesting likes like okay how do I fix this fucking thing yeah yeah let's figure it out but the way to figure it out was he had to buy another one that was junk but then he had to get a key because like Tesla won't give you a key for one of their cars like if you have a broken Ford right you go hey I fixed this Mustang but I need a key for it can you guys you know make me a key dealership and make you key right like oh yeah yeah we'll replace the cylinders yeah because cares what you do with it yeah we want what we want Ford is different right if you have a Mustang and you have like a 1965 Mustang that you rebuilt yourself they'd be like oh great that's cool that's cool yeah Tesla's like what are you doing zone or throws get away yeah it's going to explode you don't know how to work with batteries fucking bullshit what are you done to my rabbi threads just give it to me just give me the informations do what I want with the key fuck yeah so he had to have it hacked so you can get the updates too cuz Tesla update won't do updates for you uh-huh other block and I'm so he had to get a hacker to hack into his system so that he could get the updates justice should impeach this guy they should get rid of them yeah it's they didn't want everybody following their rules Ari Shaffir Jew in Chicago this November Chicago and San Jose what are you doing you're doing comedy I'm doing stand-up comedy I'm doing a great new hour stand-up comedy and now if you're filming soon I'm filming soon filming trying to figuring out if it should figure out where don't had this special pretty lockdown pretty locked out I did have a Orthodox friend come Orthodox Frank come to see it to be like point out like things that were wrong factually and he got like one and a half I'm so my guy so I got to change that was like a last yeah after to make sure everything no just something somewhere something's headed a lot of these sit I was like dude I had like a three-minute chunk that was murdering about Noah's forty children yeah and then I went back to my Shiva and Jerusalem to my seminar and I was learning that stuff and it was like he had like did not have forty children it was like two sons and a daughter fuck so I don't like scrap if like I honestly four and a half minute murdered chunk about Noah's wise pussy shit yeah but whatever that's all part of it but hold that something else yeah right right I'm gonna actually look up are there any other Jewish historical figures that I have had forty children or you doesn't even have to be Jewish historical thing everybody track to someone else some other asshole yeah maybe a little miss muffet sat out of the woods with the shoe the shoe lady curds and whey yeah yeah yeah right what's that shoe the Brothers Grimm shoe one album recently it's so over the top it's no raisi how fucking barato a it is oh yeah oh my god he's a good look at you sweetheart it's just like oh my god on an album with albums like mattered right no record well you've heard when the laughter died right yeah that's the greatest album a lot of you say that cuz it's terrible it's just like this is what stand-up really is well he put no no no he had no material he decided to make an album with zero material to shopping ups to just pop in at Dangerfield's in New York City record it with Rick Rubin and have no fucking idea what he was going to talk in a malarial either no wow and this was when he was selling a lonely what a great follow-up to the one of the biggest albums of all time dude dice is a unique cat he doesn't get enough credit for being as unique as he is he's a unique guy like just dad alone like people talk about ego and this nut do you know how healthy your ego has to be to release a 2-cd fucking release to CDs it was - you couldn't fit it all on one yeah David laughter died it was a 2-cd thing of peoplein yeah Bob Walken I remember this guy yelled at him you're about as funny as a glass of milk that's the great thing I said again reevaluate every single time yeah oh my gosh oh my god he didn't give a fuck didn't care at all he used to this thing at the store just to entertain the door guys who were friendly with them who'd do this thing where he could see how long he'd go without saying anything of note so like and we'd be in the back dying goes so I get up first he would like walk over to the mic and like tap it with the cigarettes and then like put it down test just like not saying anything real right right eventually we start like alright turn it up and then eventually we go so I was at the thing you know with the guy comes over and he fucking talks you know how it is and then it's like you got to decide you know nothing real and we're dying in the back as he's just milking a fucking naan and then you know the weather's out so of course there's that and then you got a you got to think about everything you know I'm saying right so it's just that and then finally goes into a bit yeah it would just such how to piss them off sometimes it was great I would love to have talked to him when he was releasing that that CD the day the laughter died like what is on your mind here yeah would you why'd you decide to do this you know because it was clear he wasn't trying to kill no he's trying to dispel I think he was really trying to show what a popin said is really like I don't think so really think so no because a lot of times pop in sets you're trying to get laughs he was trying to get laughs though he just wasn't using his best ammunition it wasn't using any it's like playing Duke Nukem but only using knife no no it's like paint punch oh yeah right right right right yeah yeah in the death left and right still trying but not no one had a punch I got a listen to that album again did he had no material it's he was just fucking around like it seemed like everything he was saying he was inventing on the spot I need to ask him if that's the case I'm pretty sure it is because it seemed like it was all invented on the spot I got a record player finally and I started like getting some comedy albums for anime I walk around and I'll just look some Missouri dollar bill cosby's our fire sale you get like you can see estate sales of cosby stuff where people discover them dollar dollar child dollar would you have him on your podcast bill cosby yeah yeah for sure if he gets out of the pokey I'd want to know what it is like in prison I want to talk to him about like an upstanding news story oh yeah that story yeah I made pretty sure I want to hear from people like that do you think you know my biggest I don't know you'd have to ask him ahead of time you don't want to trap him or anything but like my biggest regret the one get I wanted to get for skeptic thank from my podcast is Fred Phelps who died before I go I really want to just ask him the guy who ran the Westboro Baptist Church I wanted to ask him in a legit way like what are you looking for do you think these methods will get there not make fun of him not argue with them just like what are you into well did you ever see Louis the ruse documentary on him no it's amazing really really good yeah as I was just uh just talking to Louie about some new thing he's got coming out now and it made me sort of revisit it Meghan Phelps who was his granddaughter she's a little crazier no no well he's on the pot she was on the podcast she's but she's when I got out she said want to got the other daughter that runs it no no no Megan is Megan's like remarkably kind and nice she got out knowing because the internet like knowing people online and meeting them and they sort of poured it out the hypocrisy and all the kind of doing this and all the different things and then she realized like oh my god I'm in a cult yeah yeah I'm in a christian-based cult yeah a lot of people also don't understand what your upbringing gives you you cut that join me crazy that's how I do it 50-year old man dude I took July off of all day off my internet and everything yeah I just took it off and I got so bored that I shaved bald it in my head I saw that yeah I was just so bored look thanks but I did it for the same reason I leave this on my girlfriend hates it I was trying to shave my head with the back of you know the back of a beard above a UH of a trimmer yeah so the back is just for their sideburns right but I was trying to shave all my head that's like 40 minutes I was back to like there and I was like fuck this I'll get it I'll go by real like you know a real beard trimmer the next day and I saw my girlfriend she was like hey what no come on no and I was like oh no I'm not keeping it now I kept it for a month or now I only checked because somebody died in the comedy scene and I didn't want to be this funeral like that but it was great dude i bronzed it it was so much fun I got it once I got a tan you couldn't really tell you tanned the the stripe yeah Oh interesting yeah so it was just full just a bald cut it was a lot of fun how come bronzing is okay but black face isn't acting like a tanner person yeah what you're acting like you're Brazilian yeah right yeah it shouldn't be allowed you're acting like you're from Ecuador or something like you're a jungle person I have a new theory about cultural appropriation on here okay so you know how to respect every person's culture right you have to yeah okay and if a part of that culture kill you is wrong like I say about the Chinese pushing on subway I had like two specials ago about Chinese people if they try to get on an elevator before you get off that's always a Chinese person that's almost always a Chinese person hmm not Asian Chinese but that part of their culture you don't respect right no you don't respect everything so fine white culture is appropriating other cultures that's what we do best that's what Elvis did that's what we crush it at Mexican food hot dogs it's all appropriating other people's cups that's what we do so you have to respect that in our culture which is taking on your culture like it yes like it cuz this whole country is a melting pot it's a melting pot that we are with this country it's a fondue place that's right you got to allow us to fondue your culture you can still use your culture right but we also can use it why can't you respect America's culture exactly our culture says be respected now you get it and that's why I'm running for president in 2020 for you can't handle me yet he's Ben Gleib gonna be your vice president vice president my Minister of Affairs I think Trump is getting a peach is he getting impeached Jaime you ever see was like I don't even know what you guys are talking about him I don't trust the media worth shit anytime they say something like I love maybe boy who cried wolf yeah every single thing you're like guys you've just riled me up for nothing over and over again I don't know what any of the truth is all these people like what about this person said this like I've never even heard that guy what about the steel dossier what about Ukraine I don't know what about Joe Biden what about when he did what about this week yeah there's some fuckin shitty tweets we already got that it's already on the books no one's fighting that anymore - stop it stop everything cancel everyone oh shut up all you just shut up seem quite mad I get so angry about it it's such a fucking annoying place now the Internet make sure you get the right cigar out of that ashtray because I go those are Mike Tyson weed oh really there's fat boys right there that's Mike Tyson weed joint damn yeah I smoked one of those a long time ago today so hits yesterday wasn't dude in the Simpson podcast I didn't know what I was talking about half the time Virgil's cool oh he's great got to see him the Troubadour a good place that's my that was my line of like what is a good rock club a big-sized rock club in LA yeah apparently it seats like 500 people but it doesn't really cuz you're all standing yeah you got to be up on the top level - you can be there yeah I love that place I suppose they're called the fuck once there was less they were great and there was their farewell show they gave up they were done yeah but I'm like that sucks so bad they were really good really yeah I bought an album how about a cement that couldn't get anywhere you know how it it's like just like stand up when you have a name called fuck yeah I mean you went for it there were Melo mousse - huh fuck music with a music - fuck I may be I doubt it's even on there it could be but they're done do you like to fuck to music it seems annoying the I don't if it's still on it's like I fucked the music but not like you know the idea that quagmire E idea of like putting something wrong - fuck - yeah Sade I want butter silence mmm right over here the sheets move I like jackhammers set a pace and that gives you a pace to go on like it's a treble with one of those things for piano yeah no I mean if you're gonna listen to music while you're fuckin I guess do it when I was young I think though I think that was like a thing you put on candles play some music thank you lose your virginity - what what yeah what song music I think mine was Mazzy Star I don't know certain people like they were great Tracy Chapman whatever having a Tracy Chapman I know she got enough car that was going too fast and boom professional stand-up comedian they had to make a decision tonight or living died this way they were riding run in their car speed so fast it felt I was drunk dude you gotta go to Egypt yeah you would really like it I do want to do that who would like it how dangerous is it over there not very at all but there's a sense of danger for sure especially in those touristy parts the problem is like we talked about one of those Torcy cities in Italy where it's like it's too much you know I mean what's tourism is taking over town too much it's like no longer Venice okay yeah and you like wanna be there but really what you want to be is there 25 years ago well Venice apparently they changed the laws and allowed these gigantic cruise ships to pull into Venice but while we're there yeah a cruise ship hit a dock and apparently there two accidents in the last month and they're trying to reevaluate but they're addicted to the money of all these tourists dude you ain't seen nothing like it man when we were there like it's kind of calm and then all sudden a cruise ship pulls up and then 20 minutes later father of people just just ruining the place ruining any vibe of the place leave around one of those gondolas and it's like a fucking traffic jam of gondolas behind this mic this is not what weird this is not what anybody signed up for is that one hitting oh my god is this envelop and they're all like starting to walk slowly another one a lot faster oh my god guys come on the middle get out of there okay no so what happens if they just can't back up quick enough and all these old people on a fucking ship or trying to like do this ramming into the fucking dark they're gonna crush that boat oh Jesus Christ it's just nailing that other bow my god is this just a moron who doesn't know how to drive or is there some sort of tactical brave too much vermouth you got a little bit crazy with the Chianti yeah hey move out of the way already I want a glass of red wine oh right why'd you just say that you know you can you want it that would be really great right now awesome red wine nice no I'd like to know I was on the border the Austrian Italy border we hiked for on the border for like six or eight days I've gone to Italy the last four summers in a row yeah it's fucking great oh so what I was gonna tell you is the other places you kind of go which is I go away you know which is it has more Italian feel is like the problem with Egypt is all those places the stuff you want to see is in the touristy spots cuz people are going to like here I'll see him like if you know the Colosseum is just surround ya by people but if you go early enough to the pyramids you're pretty good a couple of hawkers will bother you but really you're good yeah yeah I read this blog tell me how to do it right up being there first thing and you just have your run of the place I think I'm gonna get self tanner so I fit in smart smart appropriate yeah you can wear a turban how come you can do that how come you can go full tan you can get to sit but at a certain point in time you get to a point where you're doing blackface yeah you're doing blackface and we talked about that when it's too much Brendan Schaub had a bit weird about that with the line what's the color wheel bodybuilders by others they do self tanner but then they leave their face out now deliver fits out of the self tanner yeah that looks strange looks like a Photoshop fucking crazy so their face is white and their body is black that's a Photoshop oh my god black face but they hear not black body but you used to have if they have chocolate body they have chocolate body but they can't have chocolate face I always thought that black face was the thing when you're doing like soft shoe and like you have like around like sarah silverman did yeah but like you're making fun of the black face yes but like but like the black face wasn't when you were little and somebody would go full costume of something like if they were going as the Hulk they would go green everywhere you can do and some people just go green nose like why don't you commit right and then if you're doing a mr. t you go full-on duty yeah you can be black while you went for it but he'll challenge but that back then that wasn't offensive so it wasn't that was like not blackface that was just black makeup right what happened I think what's dummies find the line they don't really know how to put into play it's not like a dr. Cornel West who says I'm very interesting it's just some idiot on Twitter and they go well I think that's like the thing that they said yeah matter you they were going after white girls wearing hoop earrings yeah they were saying the white girls wearing hoop earrings that hoop earrings are black and latina which is hilarious because no they're not they're actually invented in Sumer the oldest known hoop earrings were in Mesopotamia you Alex they had they saw this article on the bottom made they've made it in somebody's dining hall of a college and Scott got really mad because it's Vietnamese and how you even make it you doing her in a baguette with this and somebody's like yeah a baguette you think that's Vietnamese the baguette you got it from fucking friends seventy years ago you idiot when they were there yeah I mean Italians stole spaghetti yeah it's like whatever I enjoy your shit I'm just gonna use it yeah that's what I'm saying bro it's fucking good food good music yeah that's one of the good things about America right we steal somebody on a daily shows megaphone and Mia had this thing and Burroughs and Berle and uh I saw at a charity shop thrift store this beautiful Asian design like Chinese designed velvet shirt button-down shirt with this beautiful like inlay and stuff and I was wearing it and she like well that might be you know kind of cultural appropriation I'm like why it's just pretty and I thought was pretty and good-looking and she goes about intent my guess so my intent was I think it's good-looking so why you still talking about it's like mom maybe and the Mai Tai's we're talking four or five like Chinese people walk by like Chinese tourists and they're like stop like oh hey and they pointed like yeah yeah we like it and it was a gassy fine yes stupid shut up everybody shut up well you know they asked Japanese people about what it was the name who was it that would rest up like a Geisha mm-hmm was it Katy Perry she got in trouble for dressing up like a Geisha and people are mad the Chinese people were very are the Japanese people rather were very happy this shows people showed the show the respect for our culture and they enjoy our culture if people dressed up like Jews like Hasidic Jews I really put myself in the place I'm like I I think that would be hilarious and fun to for make sure I don't think and I don't think the city of Jews would give a fuck one way or the other right they might accidentally talk to you now well what if you're doing an activity that requires you to dress in a traditional garb like in Thailand when you have those fucking elephant pants on every tourist backpacker do that yeah yeah those are so you can ride elephants yeah Myanmar they make you put on this like makeup stuff so it stop you can get burned oh look it's a sunscreen makeup yeah yeah you're allowed to do that but I mean it helps you you need your operations in that more they don't they think it's funny no I guess it's not one answer they're really they're not really concerned with that all these things by the way these these like funny words like that cultural appropriation and you know dead naming Elmo those are a lot the san francisco's exports to the world you know is it off from San Francisco they invent all those things and export it but those are all things that like only exist and get people angry in a in an opulent society when you can afford to be angry about tiny things like that it's a sign of like we're all doing great meanwhile that city is the most overrun city in the country when it comes to drug abuse and when it comes to use folks yeah not like in the streets yeah but you're doing you shooting up in front of people's houses that's abuse dude I see those people in the work that bent-over tweakers bent-over look like a fucking human question mark and I know they look awful but I know they're having a blast oh for sure it just looks wrong they are fucking loving they're in another place while they're in that other place to just shit their pants yeah when they come back it's any problem but they're having a great time they're not they're not in pain where do you think all this social justice outrage goes do you think it's it dies off what people realize how ridiculous it is and it becomes like bell-bottom jeans did I think it's all caused by the internet by these echo chambers you live in yeah and these algorithms that should want you being angry yeah I think it's making everybody angry about it's the same fervor as the blue dress gold dress it's on one of these things now and it's the same fervor as like this was too dirty before it's like was it's too race-related this is too misogynist whatever it's just like people turn on each other on a level of like why you guys would sit next to each other at a ball game and have a good time everybody's pretty fucking nice to each other most people most people want to get that fucking Edward out of my way I mean you just never see those people anymore right so it's like are we just looking for someone to attack so in the Bible in the Torah there's this med rush this is like fable of so got to choose to choose this what they taught us in yeshiva to choose the Jews it's unfair to have us as a chosen people right it's unfair to the other cultures so there's this fable that says God tried every other culture let them live their entire existence and then they died out they killed each other off never got to the Messiah age and then died out so one time he picked the Christians one time he picked the Chinese one time he picked the fucking Norwegians one time you pick the Germans as his like this is my race right and every time it didn't work out and one time in one of these things and they said maybe that's where the dinosaurs are he gave them the world for a while and it didn't work yeah but yeah it's like yeah you guys are kind of reaching you could just say whatever but they're trying to explain it away because I got no explanation for dinosaurs but anyway well they said it used to be where crops just grew and animals were just abundant and you know one had to toil and so the mankind would toil and then it didn't have to everything just grew so they would think that maybe this would be easier to be nicer there's this guy who has his theory on like since computers are gonna come up we're not going to need like 40 hours of work week anymore probably 20 and his theory I forget his name is that with those other 20 hours we'll read more we'll do crazy things but I don't think it is because in this fable of Judaism when man didn't have the toil they just went to war they just started murdering each other mmm because you need conflict so in great times are wearing right now where everybody's doing well an iPhone cost a lot of money and almost nobody hat doesn't have one right we're doing great we're in an opulent society racism is down to super low levels but you need someone to attack so even when you're in a bubble of LA or New York and almost everybody's 95 percent on your side you look I need to attack somebody because everything's too easy so it's a sign of how great we are I think that's accurate I think that's definitely what's going on and they don't there's not real problems like go war real real like hard hard crime and the violence in the streets and so we're looking for things to be upset at I also think there's a lot of people that have access to their phone whether at work and I think their board is fuck and I think there's a urology up and there's a lot of wasted time if you were an employer and you're paying someone to do stuff by the hour I guarantee you most of their time spent listening to podcasts watching YouTube videos and talking shit on Twitter getting what's making an angry angry it's all those things used to be so good do that July I was off computer completely didn't do anything had a house phone no texting no nothing didn't look at a computer how'd you feel if help I mean obviously it was like harder I had to write down all my flights and stuff ahead of time so you can take care of it you know I felt really free I bored as shit you know I would do that shaving my head cuz I was just bored a weekend but like really free of it all I'm just kind of like smiley and happy and everyone I just wasn't seeing the negativity wasn't like right coming in but now I'm using it and I feel it coming back why don't you just avoid reading comments I mean is it as possible it's tough in the board moments of life right where I'm sitting on the toilet or whatever like the ideas board moment things can't just read stuff right that's right there and I have five minutes to fill these are checking out social media yeah something like that or let's get Google news feeds I just start reading our articles - that's most of what I do with my phone read articles read articles and watch videos and the videos that I'm watching they're almost always videos on like science or space well there's that - where I'm looking at espn.com or something like that but it just feels like wasted time sometimes it's wasted time sometimes it is sometimes it but you but I've also decided to take shits without my phone sometimes and then I sit there I'm thinking and you think so the sauna you go to the sauna the steam room right and it's just like boom boom boom and then you realize like why am I not entering into that more where my brain is going boom boom boom that's why the tank is amazing you need to use the tank you use a sensory deprivation tank you can't bring anything in there you're fucking floating in water so nothing in the area you're telling me I could yeah exactly and you're thinking and it's just explodes so that's what I was getting a lot more of yeah and I started getting bored I started looking at my act a lot more and writing everything out like how many personal bits or a veneer how many like historical bits and how many everything really looking at because you're bored just pour yourself into it right instead of this wasted hours yeah well I know you didn't doing that and I go to people's feed and see them constantly arguing with people I don't engage in that anymore yeah I'm engaged and engaged in any of it zero zero arguing with people on Twitter zero arguing people on Instagram I post things and I get the fuck out of what is this program that lets you like shut off after an hour I love that it's like a thing that you use for you kids you can but you could use it for yourself - its screen time and someone else will put built into your phone so you can't snooze it out you're like done no it's done that's great yeah that's great cuz even when you're not using it by there you're like I don't want to later some messages and you can still make that cell phone that's that's what you need and you have access to your camera if you need to enter in social media if
