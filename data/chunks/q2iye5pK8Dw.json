the gyro can experience um is there anything in this episode or this issue that deals with a very controversial issue of antidepressants and their effect on the human mind yeah I saw people asking about about that so you know antipsychotics here's one thing that I'll say about or SSRIs are not anti ii yeah no sorry not SSRIs I don't have I don't have a good informed opinion on antidepressant depress I just don't know enough about it I wouldn't I wouldn't know how to comment on that intelligently I will say that you know antipsychotics which are a sort of you know an extreme thing right there's all kinds of you know incredible research being done you know but we're still it's still very early days nor understanding of what drugs do to the brain and what happens here and there and so you know antipsychotics there's there was a statistically significant group of people you know I think God I'm gonna miss represent this but no baby I was talking to University professor who had done this study about she was a clinical psychologist who had done a study about people taking antipsychotics and a certain number of the patients were so transformed by this new generation of antipsychotics that they just that they voluntarily went off them to go back to the hallucinations that they'd had before it's not a lot of people I don't want to misrepresent the number but it was a statistically significant group of people which means that there are people whose RIA who's for whatever reason their reaction is I would rather so in what one of the cases that she described was a man a homeless man who believed that he was being pursued by the Russians you know and was living in stark terror in this kind of cold war nightmare every waking moment and he was homelessness orth you know but just utter a ruined guy he goes and he gets begins to get this antipsychotic medication and these and and it turns off not just your hallucinations but it also maintains your bit of reason and function you know it can be very helpful sometimes mm-hmm if it works and I'd like to point out that's not always true but he was so destabilized by discovering that nobody wanted him the Russians didn't want him nobody wanted I'm he's just a now he's just a bum dude and he was thought he was bummed out because he wasn't special anymore right he was the star of his own action movie for so long you know and and more guy and he voluntarily went back to being to living that life you know why he took the blue pill and then but it was and then wished he hadn't well I would like to see what he saw before I made any sort of a judgment on him because who knows he might have been living in an awesome world like a Winnie the Pooh rise so does Neil and totally you know just neon colors everywhere and fucking Russian agents hiding behind two-dimensional trees driving a convertible I mean who knows what he actually saw there was this conversation on the board recently where I brought up the thing about a if you had a thousand monkeys on typewriters eventually they would write the works of Shakespeare given an infinite number of time or amount of time I think that's worth shit but it is true because an infinite number of time yeah because if you had like it let's just take out the monkeys and say you have one computer program did you imagine that a monkey really did write like Romeo and Juliet you just left this monkey and a fucking room a typewriter and most of it was dog shit mostly why why but one day that monkey just got it right and his little fucking eyes rolled in the back of his head like a slot machine he starts typing I didn't even notice they just can't even write at the end of Midsummer Night's Dream Joe but not know I mean the question is you know like say you you're randomly selecting characters like each character is randomly selected and you do this for an infinite string of characters then not only would you get the entire works of Shakespeare but you would get an infinite number of times you would get it backwards an infinite number of times you would get every chapter in every order an infinite number of times you would get everything that's ever been written in every single order that you could ever think to put it in an infinite number of times I matched what infinite that monkeys well my Woody's on a typewriter word I would use chimps yeah yeah they wouldn't hurt their little fingers monkeys yeah yeah man that's that's a word in it yeah it even that isn't doesn't even be to describing that depth that word is a real problem word we don't we really that doesn't register with me when I say infinite I'm like a safe space it's like it goes until I can think about it and then it keeps going I mean even just like when you see those videos of like they sent a probe like an artificial probe like to show you what it looks like when they leave Earth and then it sees the moon and it sees the other outer planets and then it sees you know the galaxy from a distance and it keeps going and going that doesn't work it doesn't get in there doesn't get in there I mean that they're so fucking far away I mean you have to start thinking about the speed of light like the fact that the Sun is like eight light minutes away Mars is like thirty light minutes away Pluto is like eighteen hours away in terms of lights well dr. Greer is gonna let us know goodness how big the universe is when he reveals what the aliens have been telling him Garth Brooks is slowly becoming some classics though like you know hey you have classic rock I got friends in low places could be a class is that your son why it's weird you say that cuz I was at the Capitol Records building a while ago just got a friend to work there and they have this these plaques on the wall of like every album that is sold ten million copies right which is not that many so you go the Capitol Records there were like four Beatles records Dark Side of the Moon and just a wall of Garth Brooks but you don't realize how many fucking albums this girl he had like six albums that sold ten like you wonder why you don't hear from anymore cuz he's got some more fuckin money than in music he's doing Vegas now I think he started I think on Hertz in Vegas like but just with an acoustic guitar I think really like it just him with a guitar yeah listen he's a weird fuck but he's undeniably talented oh yeah can't sell that many record not have something going on I got friends in low places is a great fucking song if you got a buzz on and that song comes on and you don't get happy you're a cunt well if you're that that's a little harsh but I agree but know where I'm from if you're if you're drinking and till he doesn't put that on the jukebox cannot take that so of course you can't you're from Ohio you've probably heard it every day your life exactly where your alarm bus every day remember when he did that weird thing Garth Brooks did where he's put on a wig and pretend to be a different dude he was Chris Chris Gaines God that was the weirdest thing the fuck was that bow when I see those plaques on the wall at Capitol Records I'm like no wonder he did that he was just like yeah look at that come on man who what who let you do that card Brooks and he grew a little flavor savor a little flavor savor under the lower lip and he went total emo weirdo like brooding that looks like he was in an argument with his label he's like look you fuckers I could sell albums doing anything I'll fuck I want yeah change my name put a goat in and that's what he thought yeah that he really did believe that I think that wasn't it was that his last album boy that's a shitty way to go out if that's his last that was like this look at those pictures of them all with the hair just perfectly that's fine if we don't know it's a fucking wig man you can't just wear a wig okay that's ridiculous that looks but remember for a while and SNL that was like the go-to joke while I was on her scheming Weekend Update with every joke fucking silly he is the idea that he thought that he could pretend to be someone different a different personality I'm not the happy country guy anymore even though it's the same guy inside my heart we don't Chris gains I'm Moody as fuck okay I'm all dressed in black and will flavor savor I even died that and my hair it's all thick and heavy even though you know I'm going bald don't think about that don't think about the wig man think about the persona I'm trying to sell a persona I got this down it's goddamn character you're gonna love my new CD it's crisp gains is moody as fuck that's what it's called I want you to concentrate I want you to concentrate on the shitty music this honey look too of me but one heart my who am you who do we become women together and like who wrote these shitty songs Chris gains are great
