hello freak bitches what's nature man nature's just so creepy and it's which ways of adjusting to life my friend Andreas Antonopoulos my friend the Bitcoin expert explained this to me last weekend in Vegas ducks have three footlong dicks that curl and twist because the the female vaginas have adapted to fight off rape duck rape yeah so they have these pussies that are this fucking labyrinth twisty turny elaborative pussies and they can choose to let sperm in or not let sperm in with their gigantic labyrinth pussies and these 3 foot long duck dicks when you see a duck's dick you like huh that is not real look at that ducks dick that's drawing that's a drawing but there's actual photograph that's an actual photograph of a duck dick what in the fuck that's like a person with like a 15-foot long dick yeah ducks are tiny man works for dick like a person with a three-foot dick is a monster yeah but a duck with a three-foot long dick it's totally standard that's a dick that's a limp once real that's a guy's a little little dick he gets shamed by the other ducks poor guy yeah I mean duck dicks are ridiculous they're it's a fucking ridiculous animal what I knew I knew that ducks engaged in rape oh that's all they do he's dealing with a gang up on one look out look how the the female's vagina has sort of adapted to deal with the male raping you know created these bizarre pathways in their pussies yeah no Marty monsters he's he's interesting I know you've been a big fan of him and I've always enjoyed watching that guy I mean I can't fight like that guy but to watch some of his techniques and the way you use angles and footwork and how he lures you in and his clench game is uh it's nasty it's nasty you know I wonder and maybe you could give some insight on this like you used to fight it 155 and now you got a cut to get down to 145 you're a pretty big guy but the Mighty Mouse is not a big guy and I always wonder like could guy like could a light heavyweight or a middleweight even could they possibly even fight like him or is that a gravity thing like is part of what's going on with him the fact that he's so light like he can move faster he's got like more options as far as like what he can do some people are blessed with better integrated in their body such as like a neutral spine a lot of people have like lumbar problems and neutral spine you ever watch Mayweather you don't ever see him lean and he's just always in constantly good posture and good position and just like in wrestling if you're in good position more likely you're gonna win the fight Mighty Mouse he just has that type of movement and integrates his whole body where his body moves as one it doesn't work against him there's not like a lot of rattle and his body safe he throws a kick he doesn't land awkward he doesn't know it goes he goes right back to a neutral base and he's able to laterally move and constantly have his body working for him so I think him naturally he just has that type of gifts and benefits of his body he's able to integrate his body to work as one therefore you don't waste a lot of energy he has really fluid movement look at a guy like Anderson Silva he's able to beat people just by keeping his range in just his movement of his body he doesn't he doesn't swing like a mark on or me where you know like I'll throw a lot of powers and normally I miss you know I'm just trying to trying to reach them but them guys they just use fluid movement and that's I think some people are just blessed to have that integrated in their body in a good neutral spine in a good solid base and that's why they're able to connect on their shots a lot more it's competing disconnected like a say like a short circuit if there's like a small like little detail like this cord right here say it's like it's like broken and you're not getting like the full amount of energy as where if you have a solid base and a good good spine you know how to integrate your body to use as one there's gonna be a lot more of a sturdier connection and more flow and fluid movement I mean it was it was a it was tough doing the talk and then whenever I got into Congo they told me I had the flu in London the doctors there and that's what I feel like here - there can be tropical medical medicine specialists here and they're probably really great but I I would trust a doctor that's lived in the climate the tropical climate around malaria that's seen it that knows all the symptoms one knows to look for it because no one gets it over here yeah and so whenever I got into Congo I flew from yeah from work to Congo and whenever I landed instead of going straight to the forest they took me to like a airstrip at a kind of hospital in the middle of nowhere so I landed one straight to the hospital and then right there they're like you don't have the flu you have malaria and I'm like but i-i've been I've been in the States I just fought and then I've uh known in Europe like there's no no malaria really there but it was because it's still living inside me there's like I think there's three strands women live in your body for three years five years I think the others like 30 to life or something y-yeah and so so it just comes back yeah it can like when your body's really rundown when you're really tired immune systems low like training for a fight yeah like training for a fight or right after the fight right after fight went to London spoke then I went to Congo so but right after the fight so you recovering from malaria you go through your six-week fight camp you have your fight you run down and then after the fight you got malaria again yes now those sickness I've had it no three times oh my okay so at least confirm twice the third time they're like yeah you have it for sure but they with malaria you have to get the test the blood test while you have a certain degree temperature like fever whenever it's cycling out of your liver I'm coming out they have to draw the blood at that exact time to get it and so that's why it's misdiagnosed four times in the Congo and what a sneaky fucking disease yeah it's nuts it's crazy because though they'll hide in your liver and then they send them out in your bloodstream wake up like a platoon they go and wreak havoc and then they retreat right back to the liver really yeah they live in your living yeah that's where they're hiding away for three or five or thirty years oh my god and what is there any solution is there anything they could do um I don't think so and I had a couple of things that happened where you know I started trying to take the anti malaria meds but I start getting it slowly medicine I've ever really reacted to where get nauseous start driving I've heard it's awful yeah even uh even though I'm pasty white and I get real Sun sensitive I know another medicine called mythic one which is a think it's developed in Switzerland or Sweden supposed to be an awesome new malaria medicine it's actually the one thing my body kind of responds to but um but it's actually really dangerous because uh I've seen people that are there for aid work and different stuff and do they have to they have to retreat if they're there with kids and stuff they've moved there to the country they're taken off because um because kiddos or even adults have mental breaks that they can't come back from like you can have psychotic episodes for I think they said like if it lasts longer than a week it's probably gonna last like three months if you last longer than three months it's probably the last forever Wow so this is from the medication yeah it's just the medication and it gives you terrible terrible nightmares I almost went to Tanzania this summer was gonna go on safari and too many people scare the shit out of me with malaria talk yeah I was gonna take my whole family and I'm like look I'll take some millet malaria medication and feel like shit I'm not giving it to my six-year-old yeah it's not happening that would be I'm not doing yeah but that's a real concern right Tanzania has malaria as well right yeah they do it's it because it's more of a that arid climate where it's they have less there it's not so tropical there I've been to teasing a couple times and Sansa Bari I mean it's just um I'm it wasn't there but I was saw it and it was uh I don't know I mean it's it's a crazy crazy place because you go from Congo where they have all these tropical diseases and you go I don't know same continent you just go over a little bit and there's all these other kinds of parasites like in Congo there you have very little of uh I believe they're called jiggers with a J and chickpeas very careful when you say that word yeah well but jiggers with a J that's wrong yeah well but they they're these crazy parasites that burrow in your feet Oh God in especially kids and elderly in well honestly I think one reason with poverty the kids don't get shoes until they can work and buy them and the elderly if they're not able to work and provide for themselves and you know it's harder for them to to get shoes and stuff but also it's just where they live because on the sandy or it's either sandy or the clay ish or silty soil that's real red and Uganda man it just wreaks havoc on those kids to where they're having to have people come in every week to different villages sit there with safety pins and all sorts of these little hooks that they dig into the people's feet and oh god dude it's it's painful whenever I've seen people getting it done literally putting their and I've had one in my foot and it kind of came and gone it's not that bad when it's just one but whenever your whole foot or your whole heel or all the you know the balls of your feet are just covered in I mean I'm talking 20 30 40 50 of these parasites and they're just brutal so every step you see them when they're walking they're grimacing when you're taking it out there screaming god damn Africa
