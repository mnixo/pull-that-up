just hiking and walking around and we got we woke up and we were making our breakfast and we look up on a ridge and there's this big-ass there's this September so it's like late you know it's like they were getting ready to hibernate and he's walking down the ridge and as we're packing up and you know you up the ridge is actually where we were cleaning our dishes and doing all this stuff and now we're back at camp we're breaking down to hike out and we see this thing go walking down and just dumbasses we're so lucky we didn't get eaten the guy we we pack up and we just start walking in the same direction that the bear was going really he's not gonna be going he probably he's beaten us there so we're walking through these these reeds these like bamboo kind of little reeds but they were only like six feet high and there's like eight of us maybe six of us and we're walking with our packs on and just here and you see the reeds separating slowly they like it's not coming fast just
