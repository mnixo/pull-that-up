the Joe Rogan experience so um so I got it injected and that was um first of all look like he got like run over by a semi-truck for like two days it was like all black and blue or the injection yeah yeah I got infected it could have gotten infected cancer I've had MRSA and I would not wish MRSA on your dick how'd you get Marissa a triathlon I got it this was that though at the Wildflower triathlon like coming back my flight got delayed and I was covered in all these because like an off-road triathlon and I had all these scrapes and wounds and I think I think my layover was in Vegas I don't remember where but I had to check into a hotel if I got delayed and I slept in this hotel room that I swear like there must have been something on the bed because within a few days like it was all you know it gets all nasty and cakey and then it was eating a hole I wrote a whole blog post about this on my website and as you can see yeah pull up the hole in the back of my leg is nasty I'm just just search for like Ben Greenfield staff and you'll see the pictures but it was eating a hole in the back of my leg and my kids roll now once a week and I buy on I get the the defense soap from on it and as soon as they as soon as they come back in the door I have them go into the shower upstairs a defense so yeah yeah a bunch of different wipes and stuff for people that train in a place it doesn't have a shower mm-hmm yeah you gotta be careful thieves essential oil like it's not gonna like it's a whole bunch of companies make this version of essential oil thieves it's like clove and right it's named after thieves who apparently never yeah clove cinnamon eucalyptus which is really good for staff and Roseman it's actually named that there's like this story of like these four thieves that apparently traveled around the world and they would rob homes and and and they never got sick like that's basically the story I'm sure this was this was some board table at a multi-level marketing essential oils company somebody came up with this story or it could be true I don't know but the UM yeah the the stem cells under the dick that wasn't interesting well but it did I think from what I can tell looking in the mirror it got bigger pretty sure how much so half inch I like maybe that much like enough to tell and my erections got bigger and my orgasms got a lot better for how long they they're still like that well people don't take what they have right in front of them seriously enough it's like the wasting time thing they don't do the arithmetic you know and they'd also don't understand they devalue what they have right in front of them like another another client I worked with was having a hard time putting his kid to bed at night and so we did the arithmetic it's like well I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes a night trying to get him to go to bed okay so let's analyze that all right so what does that mean what means that both of you end the day upset that's not so good because why would you want that it means that you're spending 45 minutes fighting when you could spend twenty minutes doing something positive like reading to him say means that you don't get to spend that time with your wife so she's not very happy with you plus you're annoyed because you don't see her Plus do you blame it on the kid because he's the proximal cause it's like that's pretty damn ugly and then and then let's do the arithmetic it's like seven days a week 45 minutes a day let's call that five hours 20 hours a week 240 hours in a year six you're spending a month and a half of work weeks fighting with your four-year-old son I think you're gonna like him you don't like anyone you spend a month and a half a year fighting with it's a bad idea fix it it's important get him to bed make it peaceful you do it like these things that repeat every single day that's a motif in this book to your life isn't margaritas on a beach in in Jamaica that happens now and then those are exceptions your life is how your wife greets you at the door when you come home every day because that's like 10 minutes a day your life is how you treat each other over the breakfast table because that's an hour and a half or an hour every single day you get those mundane things right those things you do every day you've concentrated on them and you make them pristine it's like you've got 80% of your life put together these little things that are right in front of us they're not little that's the first thing they are not little and they're hard to set right and if you set them right it has a rippling effect and fast to way faster than people think but people are sending me messages bloods on your hands and this now I'm like if you went out and had unprotected butt sex after listening to the Joe Rogan experience you deserve what's coming yeah okay if you listen to me and you're like that's it Peter Duesberg right send it in Rex but is going you can't demonize conversations and I don't know enough about the subject but I listen to that guy's take on it and it's fuel for thought you know I don't think he's right I don't but I've talked to a lot of people that I don't think are right I think I've talked to some crazy fucking people on the show and I think we've got to be able to have conversations you have to well I mean we might agree on 60% of things maybe 50 maybe it's somewhere between 40 and 70 I don't know it doesn't matter it should be okay it should be totally fine and that's the thing we do a you know change my mind segments most time people it's pretty amicable and then you just get someone who comes up and wants to commit assault right at wrigley puffs and it's like I think a big skill we've kind of had to learn this because not Gager knows when we first had guests if it was if it was a guest who I disagreed with I was like listen I will not edit you it will not be taken out of context but I would sit down for three hours with them because they would be like don't cut me off don't coming up and you realize just repeating themselves come on so finding the balance of seeing there are a lot of people out there now who are open to hearing these points before open to hearing these ideas being able to identify them and then being able to identify the people who are so bought in they won't even listen you need to make an example of them for the people you can convince right and understanding the two different kinds of people the tree Glee puffs versus you know I don't know Jordan Pederson you probably never saw himself was even political at all until he came out and said something that would seem to be so benign and caused an uproar I think being able to identify those two it's not so much just about left and right who can hear who won't and how to handle them right and why why can't you hear can you not hear because it interferes with your ideology or can you not hear because it's what they're saying is illogical like which one is it is it are you honestly listening to what they're saying and can you give factual refute can you give some sort of a factual review of this or is it just it just doesn't jive with your you the world you you have some rock-solid view of the world that you're not you're not willing to look at in my perspectives so I had to make a decision because the colorful kids didn't get no pussy they just weren't into pussy they would talk about girls and they maybe had a crush on the girl in the 430 class but they never asked her to come to any of the events my other buddies were into pussy so eventually I cut the karate fucking geeks out and I started hanging out the little druggies and you make your transition and from those developmental ages like I tried to hide my drug use I tried to hide it especially a marijuana use the two or three years it was just bad a lot Wow then once I became a freshman I didn't start basketball my freshman year I decided to let's venture out into this acid thing let's venture into this mescaline thing mmm it was a different name it was mescaline but it really wasn't mescaline Joe Rogan it was a little Tod it would know wasn't even pay out it was a little thing the same shoes me yeah yeah but mescal is what they sell you in the south they supposedly put in tequila something this is Sal right yeah this is something that two little fucking white kids made in a pill it was rat poison with something else and something else and it was very tiny it was maybe a little size of this that's it and they came in aluminum foil even smaller than that even smaller than that way smaller that little thing that that's it you paid $80 for it and you got a hundred of those and you started hooking for three dollars apiece and that would fuck you up for six hours were the two hour haze in between and how a buffer I want to come down and I did that for three or four months then they introduced me to THC crystal which is snorting they'd sold it as what we do is we get a bunch of stems and seeds from the reef we put it in a pot and we boil that pot and whatever separates from the stems and the seeds that goes to the sides we scraped that off and that's what you snort in your nose oh my god so I was I was I had like a personal karate rule but I was always just smoke it and do the mescaline but I was never gonna put nothin in my nose oh you had a rule like a drug addict put something there no that way that's it like that that's a complete different range I'll never shoot heroin ever was the best variety man as a karate man i carotid morals yeah I was just straight away with the reefer and then I finally ended up snoring that fucking euro a biscuit because that's what it was it was angel dust they just angel dust air like every Sunday me and my friend Carlos Perez would buy a six-pack of Michelob you only like Michelob is the good friend tonight is kind of special to appeal with the beer will pour must say something more yeah yeah call it tonight as long brown brown no we would drink lowbrow [Applause]
