stoned listening to some punk get and then and get really stoned it mixes with some alcohol you know there's like all these tests that you have to do and then you get graded on each one like okay you can get stoned with everyone except women you know you we put you with three women and you totally just started combing their hair and then you started hitting them so you know yeah it should be some some evaluation no time to be by who the government the government's gonna be able to step in tell you get the Boy Scouts or something to make the regulation the internet which you should have to

somewhere yeah you know so she was openly testing me right so I okay let's roll one up then right so we roll one up and just like I told her not to do she takes a fucking huge hit like trying to show off you know you know the super exaggerated imma let me prove how big of a stoner I am hit right wrong move wrong fuck if she starts coughing up blogs this shit head spinnin and like in within five to ten minutes she was like what did you guys put in this weed I've never felt this before what did you buy she was nice I never smoked nothing like this I be smokin I'm Lexie I told you look I said we

get your friend and take her home she can't handle her shit Oh have you ever felt that though at all have you ever smoked something where you like this shit was laced this was like embalming fluid okay yes I have a story like that but I didn't freak out like that um it was we had just filmed this video for Latin lingo off of our first album and I hadn't smoked all day my homie that lived in Long Beach you know he was like yeah come up bro were fucking blazin right now you know and it was about 10 11 o'clock whatever so I head all the way out to Long Beach and he hands me a bowl it's a circle the guy's fucking room is just smoked out oh my go came I fucker though it's not gonna take long to get high here so he gives me this three foot long you know one of those graphics ones remember the gold graphics acrylics yeah with the like the tin bottom and shit so you give me one of those I take a hit I'm feeling cool right it goes around the circle comes back to me boom I hit another one third comes back a third time so after the third time I'm like feeling extra high and I've like that's usually nothing to me I was like what the fuck why am I feeling I'm like starting to feel closed in it claustrophobic I'm like fuck I'm like fucking out of here could you open the window bro fucking dying I can't breathe right then I do why are you freaking out I said oh no man I'm high right now he must be the hash we put on the bottom of the bowl yeah exactly I didn't know there was hash on the bottom of the bowl but I was freaking out at first because I'm like man I've smoked this weed before why am I so trippin off with three fucking bowls I had to leave like all right guys I gotta go that Ash is a very odd high yeah I definitely wasn't super cousin the marijuana yeah nobody went out of their way to tell me till after I took all three bowls you know like a champ cuz I was a bong hitting motherfucker back then and man Jew dude after like 15 minutes I was just like and I'm feeling crispy it's going on this usually is just a warm-up you know I took a cookie once on a plane and it was up every now and then you get a cookie that just blows yeah yeah and mine and I took it before I got on board and so I figure I always time it for like an hour and 20 minutes that's usually what it takes right yeah yeah before you're just not moving yes wherever you are is where you stay I got on board got in just in time but the plane takes off I strap in I pull back click click on the seat right and just go into orbit eyes closed I'm watching like neon cartoons fuck in front of my eyeballs and I'm literally seeing hallucination yeah and I'm feeling my body flying through the air going thousand miles an hour I'm like super hyper aware that I'm in this metal tube hurling through the sky fuckin brain yeah in my chair while this is going on I'm going fuck this is crazy and I'm hallucinating at the same time and saying crazy things damn guys you'll take cookies and you'll be convinced it's over oh yeah this is it look I can't survive this the cookies are misleading the cookies are misleading it's so cute yeah they taste so fucking good you like and then they don't hit you right away sir like maybe I gotta eat it and then before you know it you're like 3n and fucking toasted beyond belief I know I've said this a hundred times in the podcast before but I just have to say it in the interest of that somebody might not know this if you eat it it's a totally different life than I because if your brain your body produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolite it's by by eating it it gets processed by your liver and it's like four to five times more psychoactive than NHC yeah so that's the real issue with its and this is not no one educates anybody about this yeah you know see just you just think it's oh this is strong it's not just strong it's something you've never experience yeah if you do too much you'll freak out it's a psychedelic yeah yeah yeah sure if you say you have enough of it for sure you could definitely have one of those freak outs we like I wanted to end I wanted to end yeah the thing is you cannot make it in you got to ride it all the way the fuck out dude my friend Eddie Bravo had one where he was crying and thinking about his grandmother and going through some crazy shit about this he had created some character like it was like a white guy who wanted to be a black rapper so bad he put black makeup on literally putting black face on and he was saying that he had vitiligo that it's you know he's just trying to even his skin but and he but he got so high from eating his brownie that he was so sorry that he made it and he was like man people gonna misunderstand they're gonna hate me they're gonna think I'm making fun of black people what did I do like he was terrified it was like he had gone to the grips of sanity yeah and then in the morning you know he was fine yeah he's totally yeah back down to earth that shit fucking paranoid yeah when when you get super fucking high like that off of you know and edible I mean you get you know either you have a great time you know what I mean and and and you you know you relish it it's right yes this was the fucking perfect perfect amount to have or you're that guy like you know like I said I wanted to add right now but you can't you have to ride it out you have to run out to write it out and just always remember to breathe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're a fucking human beings
