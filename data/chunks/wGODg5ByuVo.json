powerful job there we go four three two hello Eve entrance what's going on my friend not much my man is that shirt what is it a moon smiley face yeah graffitiing moon uh-huh you know me and my smiley faces yeah people would graffiti the moon they get okay right that's probably the first things gonna have to worry about these virgin flights people leaving some shit that you could see from Earth you know yeah dude so much to talk about someone's going on yeah there's a lot going on the world of MMA in the world of duck Jitsu yeah your world MMA even boxing a lot of a lot of shit going on a boxing looks like we're gonna get beyond Deontay Wilder on Monday he's gonna be in here oh yeah yeah he's uh he's saying that did you see the video on his uh Instagram he shows that it's more than yeah it is it's fact you need to place the clock soon as Tyson Fury goes down and then it's more than ten seconds before he gets back up the only problem with that is I mean it's human error right you can't you can't start immediately right you know there's always that little that little space of time there's supposed to be a guy on the sideline though that starts the game right yeah yep and then he picks it up with five four right yeah but the rep problems referees you know when they're in the heat of the battle the fucking adrenaline their seconds it's not like they have a stopwatch in their hand they hit it every time a guy goes down which why don't they have Paul it's too much to remember we just talked about the heat of the moment boom click is that too much to remember I mean think about all the shit Tyson Fury has to remember that's all in steak right yeah I mean that fight I wanted of course I'm rooting for Wilder cuz I like i like big knockouts you know what I mean yeah and um he looked good in the first two rounds and he just looked like he abandoned the the gameplan and he was just looking for the knockout after that well he's got a problem the problem is he can knock anybody the fuck out that's a problem anybody except that guy except Tyson theory it seems like he almost knocked him out like he knocked him out yeah if it wasn't I mean he definitely made did ten he was definitely down for ten but here's the thing if the referee instead of saying eight said seven instead of saying six said five would have gotten up quicker I think you probably would have cuz he's waiting for eight nine and then he's standing up because he's trying to give himself he's an old vet he's trying to give himself as much recovery time as he can I don't know when I watch what I watch him getting up I look at that that replay and you see his head like his head comes up like he's trying to get up and he can't and then he just like stands up like a zombie I I think that's a gypsy shit-scared well I did not expect him to get up I was celebrating while they were celebrating - the thing was like when he went down I want oh shit I can't believe he knocked him out in the 12th like that and it was the left hook going down that was the craziest was so insane and he walked off gonna walk off it was a walk-off knockout he was dancing and he was pointing to his woman in the audience and she was saying I love you and he was like the whole thing was a celebratory moment and then the look on his face when you realize that Tyson Fury got not what what yeah you know you know what that is remember remember the 80s and 90s um the Friday the 13th movie yeah when you kill Jason yeah and then you turn around it's like oh shit there's your eyes hey what a full sit-up that's what that was how does Wilder punch so hard as a man who studied martial arts his whole life like there's some dudes right don't you think yeah just they have some freaky explosive power but it's crazy how much he's good he's only 212 pounds that's the crazy thing it's like he's very small for a heavyweight like a lot of these guys 250 remember oh my god named Mike Tyson oh yeah he was so like in the 215th right he was like 215 yeah yeah nomally stuck in a truck I don't I don't know I mean I didn't have that kind of power my knockouts were from like stuff you didn't see ya know and quickness but like a guy like Jeremy Stephens looks like that you know Melvin Gillard has that kind of you know it's it's I don't how do you develop I don't know if you could develop that I think that's a natural thing yeah Rumble Johnson type yes yeah yes I think you can develop that I don't think so I think you can accentuate it I think the guy hits hard with better technique and hit harder I think it's a bone structure thing I mean it's like if you look at Deonte he's kind of built like a gigantic Tommy Hearns yeah you know yeah just widen the shoulders and its back just a fucking bundle of likes my soaps yeah it's just it's like those are those thick-ass ropes that they use for for boats you know what I mean when they more ships that's like the muscles in the back just just jack back that's where all the power comes from I guess you should let him body shot you fuck all that fuck all that dude yeah that dudes a scary dude man yeah it's harder than anybody I think in recent memory like what his one-shot power it's ridiculous uh what do you think I mean I think Tyson was a better boxer yeah pure a boxer too so but like I would love to see like big power punches like they need to make a boxing game where they have all the and I'm guess they might have I don't know but they need to have one where they have like all the power punchers and do like power punch of the point of it right well you know what I feel like that's a it was a perfect boxing match because you have enticing fury first of all you have this guy that overcame depression and suicidal thoughts and you know drug addiction and alcoholism and he was just obesity yeah he was living in a world of depression he was just drinking constantly and doing coke and fucking his life up and then loses more than a hundred pounds cleans himself up gets in there against the scariest guy in the heavyweight division and puts on a boxing clinic however he still gets clipped he still gets clipped not once but twice hard and dropped hard especially in the 12th round so it's like for a person who loves watching fights it's such a perfect fight because you've got first of all they're both great guys like like both guys like you if you're a fan of like exceptional human beings both guys are great guys yeah like the more I see Deontay Wilder interact with his family talk about talk about the way he approaches fighting the more I appreciate what he's doing you know and then Tyson Fury how do you not love the guy in the way they exchanged like pleasantries after the fight was over and Tyson was telling me loved him and he kissed his fucking fist I mean it's like he'll is a great all-around a great feeling after even knows a draw I was like I felt good about it that was Rocky one it was rocky one that's about what it was rocky one right it was Rocky one sort of right but it wasn't Slugger that one you know I mean what it was was just great but nobody won nobody won yeah yeah yeah it was a great great boxing match that's what it was it was like it had all the good elements it was the best heavyweight fight I've seen in a long time I mean mm that might have been better than then Holyfield Tyson that's hard to say I know Holyfield was like the good guy coming in against the bad guy like there was so much to that fight and then with Tyson like you thought he was invincible and then Holyfield just eating his shots and slowly beaten him down and then eventually stops him I don't know he gets ear bitten was a bite no that was a second one right yeah second fight yeah yeah that was a it was uh it was one of the best I'll tell you what though man Anthony Joshua versus Klitschko was one of the best in a long time before that yeah you know they're gonna go that fella into a fight someone's gonna someone's gonna trick that fella into a fight I want to see those that that three-way makes you know yeah I think Josh would better stay the fuck away from Wilder if I had it if I was in his corner I was ever like you dude you get hit sometimes he don't want to get it anytime he's trying to avoid him I mean he's got his head movement going now yeah just fucking bobbin and Weavin it's like the dudes like that the consequences of getting clipped are so great it's so it's so interesting when someone has that kind of power the consequences are just so great they're different than anybody else because you never stop watching you never stop watching that fight with with with Tyson Fury I mean we saw the gap getting bigger in the points but then the ninth round hit yeah then he dropped him and it's like yeah see he could still do it and you're watching watch and then the 12th round he hit him and then you know if you're a wild a fan like me you're jumping up and you you're celebrating you you know your victory and then fucking zombie gets up I'm so impressed not only did he get up he won the remaining part to the round he's done Wilder had him back off like that can't well I guess it could but it doesn't really happen in MMA where somebody just gets destroyed or dominated I guess an MMA would be like a bad beating in one round and then the next round you come out and it's like fresh because when he dropped him and when he get when when fury got up and he looked at him you know he was a little bit broken he's probably like alright I'm gonna take this motherfucker out right and then Fury put it on him a little bit yeah and that probably not broke his spirit but I probably made him kind of shrink up a little bit he got lit I mean he definitely got stung he got cracked yeah and you see him like his eyes rolled back he backed off a little bit and then he grabbed ahold of Tyson I'm like whoa he got wrong look both guys are incredible good conditioning to firfer for heavyweights I mean yeah to take shots that late and because that that's a lot about conditioning when you get tired you you you know your brains ready to shut off yeah and to be that big I mean six foot nine 256 pounds and still have that kind of conditioning you know and Wilder to carry that knockout power in the 12th after being frustrated and just within a lot for the out fucking rounds that exhaust yeah the punches you missed that take so much off of you yeah don't take so much yeah yeah it was just great all around it was just great was the best but what's the best boxing fight you can remember watching in your lifetime live not not in person but just watching it as it happens wow that's a good question I think Julio Cesar Chavez versus Meldrick Taylor I a lot of people say that I didn't watch that one life cuz Taylor was so good yeah he was so fast and he was winning up until the 12th round and Chavez just kept the pressure kept the pressure kept the pressure kept the pressure and then eventually crack crack he had some of the big right hand the 12 run you see Meldrick is just beating down the downside of that fight yeah his Meldrick Taylor was never the same again yeah that was one beating that just he crossed over beyond the pale yeah I went to the dark lands it's just not good after that fight so what what do you think if was the Richard Steele is the wrath I think it was so steel doesn't start that fight in in the those last seconds and Meldrick Taylor wins on the cards then then what happens is their rematch and does he look the same as he like was he the same guy after that I think if he wins the match he's done he's done no matter what yeah remember when Terry Norris knocked around after that yeah he just did not look like he could take a punch anymore that fight was so brutal if you watch that fight against Chavez's just constantly raking his body and clip them but Meldrick was just so fast and so skillful like his movement his speed but Chavez was just relentless it was a great fight it was a great fight I watched it after the fact but there's a few of those fights where you know that that was the one where the guy's never gonna be the same again yeah you you you felt that way at watching it no I felt that way afterwards okay I mean watching it you go like what a great fight but then afterwards you realize like oh that was it that was the fight I kind of felt that way honestly for MMA I felt that way about Rory after the Roy robbie fight right any thought wonderboy mmm-hmm and I was like yeah he doesn't look the same well I think he's having real problems with his nose you know his nose has been shattered a bunch of times and he just can't take a shot at it anymore it just starts bleeding really bad but I think physically the way he moves and his ability to take punches is still exactly the same like you saw him in the lima fire you know he looks good still yeah he does he fucked up taking that Mousasi fight though yeah that sauce is too big too too big I thought the same thing too you know exactly I mean they have a lot of similar skill sets and then the bigger guy Mousasi might be a little better too striking yes definitely better with a striking his grounds no joke either yeah musashi is just so good man he's so good that like if I was in his corner ability look I get that you wanted to super fine I Cathy wanna do a challenge this guy's quite a bit bigger than you and really really fucking good like Mousasi might be the best 185 er in the world I think so it's not he's not easy there he's with Whittaker he's with ul he's there there's the mix of him I really really like I have a whole lot of confidence in Whittaker mmm quietly he just kind of rose up to the top and I think people still sleep on him I think so too but I gotta say that I was surprised at the decision in the Yoel Romero fight the second one yeah I was like I think Romero won that fight yeah or if not won it was so close it had to be a draw it was so fucking close but I think Romero did way more damage and Romero her see he heard him a couple - the thing about like the wilder fight like someone said to me like oh the scorecards are all fucked up Tyson Fury should one maybe yes maybe I see what you're saying if you're looking at in terms of like that but as a person who knows what a fight is Wilder clearly won the fight if it was a fight yeah right who's getting fucked up right in the schoolyard rival one that he won right and this is the Yoel Romero Whitaker thing who won the fight Whitakers getting you know just he got hit with bombs by Yoel yeah well hit him with some fucking haymakers and Whitaker survived but when it could never put you well in that same sort of situation well you well was staggering around like really badly hurt me look Whitaker is a champ I mean the the the skills the heart the courage all those things I mean he's got everything he's a champ but I felt like the damage done I hate the 10-point muscles yes fuck specialty famine me hate it I mean so stupid doesn't make any sense I got five minute rounds you were using ten points like why cuz it was already there exactly that's that's the big thing for me because I mean we got aspects of jujitsu yet aspects of wrestling we got aspects of striking boxing and kickboxing right and we're using a rule set from boxing yeah only one set of weapons yeah that's it like how do how does that how does that quantify the takedowns and the grappling exchange it's right it's I don't know I disagree I remember there were they had all these different systems they were trying to work and I feel like at one point I think Doc Rivers maybe Hamilton Hamilton sorry yeah doc Hamilton is an excellent system there's a half-point sister right yeah which was better was better than what we're using now the pride system was better yeah the pride system at Veterans Judge the fight as a whole and the last part of the fight is more important than the first Friday night right because that kind of tells you the path that we're going on schoolyard was that top was on top of the teachers get there who's beating the dude down the teachers get there nobody cares if you like throwing leg kicks and boxing the guy up for 15 minutes and then the teachers come right when the guy gets on top of you and punch in your face and I want the decision no no no no no the teachers pulled that guy off you yeah and then you get ready bad rematches in school they're fucking hard to swallow you got it you gotta have balls how's that rematch in school yeah yeah no money all glory yeah this has got a beer there's got to be a rematch for this fight it's got to be the biggest heavyweight fight of all time I mean it's gonna be gigantic and I'm happy for Wilder because I'm Wilder is finally a star I mean fret forever we wanted an American heavyweight champion yep Klitschko had it forever now we haven't not only an American heavyweight champion but we had an American everybody ampion that knocks everybody the fuck out knocks everybody the fuck out super exciting great guy for some reason he didn't catch like it's weird like who catches who gets famous it's weird but then when you look at the post-fight interviews and um Tyson Fury you know God bless me god bless you god bless america I mean he got a lot of people on his side he's not American he's a good guy yeah yeah I'm in here he's great I mean he's a real character he's the real deal both of them are I mean I'm fucking so excited about the rematch when you think that happens it's got to be a long time he got here with some bones thousand Tyson's camp up like do we got to take some time oh yeah summary I know you feel great and you're riding this hunting how about the guy donates all his money to charity there's that incredible it was ridiculously incredible timing million dollars ten million dollars just don't it is he gonna do that in the rematch no no the rematch is 100 on that Floyd Mayweather money right the rematch could be the biggest heavyweight title fight ever yeah yeah it's I mean it's bigger than right now especially with the world the way the world is it's bigger than totally filled Tyson it's bigger than both yeah I feel it's bigger than Holyfield Tyson I think we're right there at least yeah right there it's hard to say because Tyson was such a cultural phenomenon like there was no one like him when we were kids and when Tyson would fight it would just be like a watching of public executions and people would like wonder should I pay for this should I get this pay-per-view how long is it gonna last have a bunch of people over popcorn and shit and last 15 seconds what do you think what do you think the benefit of while they're having Tyson come into his next camp is Tyson me I mean he's a student well he knows boxing well is he doing that I don't know but what would the benefit be look the benefit would be great Mike Tyson knows a lot about boxing I mean he doesn't just know a lot about how he boxed the history but he he knows so much I mean that was like one of the big things one of the big stories about his childhood was him watching Jim Jacobs old reel-to-reel films that watched Oklahoma he'd watch all those old school films Joe Lewis and shit and Jack Dempsey you know he like pattern a lot of his style of watching those old-timers Archie Moore and yeah I mean I think he could definitely help him I think but the style of someone who could help Wilder would would be someone who is going to incorporate more movement and and more like switch up like don't always throw bomb yes you know who I would bring in Falls Wilder Andre Ward Andre Ward and Virgil Hill yeah have those guys tighten up what he does I think I earned rewards one of the smartest guys in boxing how how is he as an instructor as a teacher he's too fucking smart to not be good at it right and he's too smart he knows too much about boxing like he's one of my favorite analysts when he talks about fights like the way he breaks things down yes you know and and he's a guy who really does find weaknesses and exploit them it's not just pushing buttons and throwing haymakers like if you look at his rematch with Kovalev like he figured that fucking guy out like he got hurt by him early in the first fight but then won the remainder of the fight and then won the decision a little bit controversial but then said I know how to beat this motherfucker and then came back and second fight stopped him yeah yeah Andre Ward is and Virgil Hill that's old school old school yeah yeah that's that would be a good fit but there's a lot of good fits in boxing you know yeah boxing is an interesting things that they've had this long history of trial and error that that MMA hasn't had you know like you see you see this you know you got lineage that goes back to the 60s and 70s and like yeah lineage goes back wave yeah yeah I mean really Pat sure I mean in terms of like active trainers oh yeah active gyms you know I mean these guys have been around forever they've been putting champions into rings for decades there's a lot of those guys out there I think about I think about that too with like with Tyson I mean like if Kosta mater didn't die when he did would Tyson's career have been different probably would've that it probably would have been different I mean I think Kevin Rooney did his best to try to keep that teaching going but I think sometimes that mentor is the glue that keeps you together yeah that's what I'm talking yeah the other stuff that guy meant so much to Tyson because custom auto essentially gave him this new lease on life he thought he was gonna be a loser and his life is gonna be hell and then instead he's the heavyweight champion of the world the youngest ever you know yeah but then yeah but you know what Teddy Atlas had a very very interesting take on Tyson he just felt like Tyson never developed the skills to overcome adversity so as long as he was dominating everyone he was great but as soon as it started coming back in him he would never recover from that you know we call that name and me the yeah or a front-runner yeah yeah there's a lot of guys like that right yeah and good on top yes they're good hammer not such a good nail yeah yeah you've got to be able to take them both yeah yeah when you say hammer and nail it reminds me of like there was something I was thinking when we talking about Rory and Robbie like what it takes how much pain you have to be in to be a fighter to be a fine of Rory's caliber and then just sit down and concede yeah coz like it hurts that much I think his face was shattered and I think his nose was like broken into eight or nine pieces or some shit like that it's just it was just mush and I just don't think he physically could go on anymore like I've had I've had I've had breaks and training out of it breaks in and fights broke my jaw once training I was like oh that hurts and then I got hit again it's like yeah I can't do this then um just was it a clean snap no it's just uh there's a hairline but my kid hurt like I couldn't chew I was crying the next day I didn't know it was broken until the next day but um and then when I fought Ludwig I'm banging I thought I was on top he was on his back he fell as a punch upwards hits me right in the eyeball and I'm busting my orbital yeah you're talking about this the last time you were here yeah that is crazy when he hit me though I was like that hurts I put my head down for a second then I was like I gotta top this guy had to top this guy so I'm just trying to you know institute a jujitsu game and um he's escaping all the time but the pain it was like it wasn't like I want out for Rory to sit down and concede like I I could only imagine cuz I've been in pain in a fight like excruciating pain is like I I just got to figure this out and move on but he was just like no that's enough and it's Rory we know how tough he is he's also he's crazy like this is a dude who you know he's like you just kind of expect him to have bodies did you see him when he was on the podcast no I didn't see that he's not like you would think he is he's a great guy he is he's like very like warm and friendly he's awesome i sat on him sat with sat next to him on the bus a bunch of different times when we were just riding to the arena we've had a bunch of conversations I love him but what you see his his demeanor or his persona when he when he's you know in front of the camera he just seems very serious yeah very serious and good killer like like he is he's not done either I mean yeah I think the Mousasi fight was a bad idea but I still think he's one of the best welterweights on the planet one is your scent yeah I mean he can come I mean he'd come back to the UFC and and threatened tyrant oh yeah I think so I mean he be tiring the first time but that's a different tyrunt tyrunt with Duke Rufus is a different time yeah and I think you know he's just he knows more now he's a champion now he successfully defended his title several times he's much better - he's um he still slows later in the fight but like it's drastically different than it used to be and once what I would like to see how a tyrant is more use of all of his skills later on and not just looking to land that big right hand because like tyrant can do everything tyrant can do everything but there are those times when you see him start to really depend on that right hand and only look for that and he's like he's like right hand right hand right hand right hand right the thing about that right hand though is it works you have something like Wilders right hand or like tyrant white hand you have something that can you have a right hand that could put anybody out I mean this is I brought up dust up before but think about it he fought Darren till and he fought wonderboy twice those are two two guys that are arguably the best strikers in the 170-pound division fuck both of them up on their feet I mean both fights wonderboy was on queer Street and then in the till fight the only punch landed at all was by tyranny he crack still drops until Neverland touched him with a glove drops him beats the shit out of him and then chokes him I think that was one of the best performances from tyrant ie look really good in that fight really he looked almost like disdainful - like you know you motherfuckers can't believe you guys got him the fed betting favorite yes like what what is that shit it's like beats cowboy Cerrone a guy was supposed to be fighting 155 pounds was tough as shit but one big fight and all of a sudden you guys having a betting favorite yeah this is preposterous what some respect on my name yeah well he's uh he's a polarizing figure for some reason I don't know why it said maybe it's one of those things where guys have to catch you know like maybe it's like if Tyron like had a GSP fight like if GSP comes out of retirement fights attire interent smashes GSP then maybe people go I wonder like what Muhammad Ali was like because I wasn't I wasn't there like everybody loves him now yeah but did they love him when he was when he was you know running his mouth and like I'm sure people did I'm sure that he had um his you know like the Conor McGregor fans you know because he was that good but I wonder if there was a big contingent of people that were like yeah no um we hate that Muhammad Ali guy well he was really that good but then he wasn't see what happened was we got really crazy with Ali was they made him take three years right off for fighting and during that three years he was supposed to be fighting in Vietnam he's like fuck you I'm not going to Vietnam so they stripped him his title and then he doesn't train I mean when he came back did you ever see his comeback fine nope he came back against Jerry quarry and I'm telling you Jan he looked like he had no muscle like you look at him from the old days like look when he fought Cleveland big Katt Williams I mean he was just a Greek god but then you see him when he's coming back and he's fighting quarry three years out of the ring probably barely trained at all his body just looks lower and smoother he just didn't look the same like physically see if he could find that I mean and Jerry quarry was just a super tough guy just would walk forward and eat a bunch of shots but you look you look at his body like it doesn't look the same see look at look at his back he doesn't mean he obviously went through a full camp right it ready for that but he doesn't look like the Muhammad Ali of old and then when he's fighting he doesn't move like the Muhammad Ali of old those three years took a toll on him like look at his body it just doesn't look the same yeah yeah he looks a little smaller yeah smaller because he hasn't been training so he lost probably lost a lot of muscle just look smoother and just doesn't look as quick yeah or as good and he's fighting a guy that has no business in the ring with him you know he's fighting a guy that I mean and he's a Jerry quarry is a sad story when it comes to brain damage too like the end of his career the end of his life rather was horrible I mean he had fought so many times against big punchers and was known for being able to take a punch and then also I think coming up I think it was his brothers his brother also had like a real problem with brain damage I think they did a lot of real hard sparring together and a lot of hearts barn in the gym and the end of his life was awful I read an article about what it was like at the end for him and it was similar to what the end was like for ollie it's um I don't know I always when someone says something it makes me think of something else and you talk about Corey and his brother made me think of Joe lausanne and Dan Lewis on fighting in the yard when they would have those barbecues yes the shit out of each other like legit beat the fuck out of each other yeah I don't know if I could do that to my family they had a different kind of French that's so funny it's crazy those videos of Joe on top of them punching them in the head from behind like whoa Joe yeah exactly that's what I'm thinking it's like that's not a stranger yeah well you know that's some of the toughest guys grew up with brothers and then they all right here beating the shit out of each other yes this is what I figured out the thing is though this is Massachusetts man Massachusetts is a fucking hard-ass place in there fighting I mean they're full blast kicks and punches and then their entire family is watching me and they're they're having a real legit MMA fight yeah I mean look at that that's what a bunch of psychos they got little girls watching and shit and they're on the grass and he's beating the shit out of his brother and he's better too okay what kind of psycho family are the low fuckin car the old family sitting there Oh shit they put a soundtrack on it oh that's hilarious awesome yeah let's not watch this I like both these guys you gotta my triangle Oh about Tyra no like I don't mean look when when Ali was the whole thing about him refusing to fight in the draft like people hated him yeah there was a lot of people that hated him a lot of people that consider themselves Patriots that thought but before we have to realize Ike now pretty much everybody thinks the Vietnam War was a terrible idea right the Gulf of Tonkin incident which got everybody into Vietnam was a false flag it was all bullshit we shouldn't have been there in the first place who knows what the real reason for being in Vietnam was but a lot of people thinking how to do with heroin and money and all kinds of the crazy shit right so when ally said I'm not fighting in that war back then though back then people thought he was a coward right back then people thought he was a traitor and he was aligned with Malcolm X he changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali and everybody was worried about the Black Panthers and the black Muslims and you know it was like there was a lot of hate towards him I'm sure and so then when he came back and he was not the same guy anymore I'm sure people loved it they were happy they were happy when Joe Frazier beat them people are happy yeah he's people yeah that's that's a human nature people pick sides like you pick sides when wild and knockdown fury yeah yeah we pick sides I don't you mean you don't know those guys right no play and he'll like I'm also not gonna hate on him I mean that's the thing I'm not hating on fury I wasn't like fuck fury no oh you were also a successful professional fighter you're not just a regular hater yeah you're just a dude why I'm a special kind of hated girl you're a successful former fighter fought many different organizations like for you to be rooting on somebody it seemed feels different to me it's okay okay I have glad I got the stamp of approval if he just doesn't feel like where I get it you like a style I mean who doesn't like knockouts right who the fuck doesn't like knockouts everybody loved him man like Jeremy Stephens is a guy I love to watch fight right um like when I was fighting him that's a different story but like watching him fight yes I want to see that every time but then when I'm fighting him I want you to root for me yeah he had a terrifying style still has a terrifying style he's just do or die if Jeremy connects he's over he fucks Ville and he carries that power deep deep into a fight yeah I know I'm Way with young he fought RTA yes yeah that uppercut that was uh that was a highlight reel uppercut for a long time you see the smart fight are da Mousa Mon I saw the end of it too you know the last round fuck loose ones dangerous I was I was I was at Bellator I was at Bellator with um with chilling and and Bamba you see Schilling fighting look great right you look great man he looks like he looks like a completely different guy we were in the dressing room warming up he's warming up and he's hitting mitts and my first thought was yeah he looks like he's ready to defend some takedowns sitting low it's more comfortable yeah he's different dude he's very different he's putting he's got to that point where you it's not it's not uncomfortable to wrestle like he didn't know what to do for a long time and I've been gone for a while I came back and he was he was out there with cowboy and Mickey and jafari veneer and those guys really helped him and I'm rolling with him and I'm like oh this is a different character yeah you know I'm like this is not gonna be easy I better get my I better tap him now while I can you know well he's a world-class kickboxer so in when it comes to the stand-up game he's gonna have an advantage over almost everybody as long as he can defend takedowns and as long as he fights smart you know if he doesn't fight recklessly which is you know he has in the past that that Japanese fellow that knocked him out twice yes what's a class man kikuno what's it known that's no that's not his name I'm happenes names they all sound the same the guy's a beast oh that guy hits fucking hard Joe his heart Joe does his hockey kado sake cod oh yeah that guy is a beast oh that guy fought him MMA and then fought him kickboxing I mean that's a widow what a beast that guy is and it's not really a kickboxer as much as he isn't that right a fighter but Joe is Joe's turn it into an MMA fighter you saw eyes hit for sure so I'm spoiling some dude everything and on top you like secured top position held it ground-and-pound was kind of real strikers real strikers have horrific ground yeah cuz they just can generate so much more power from the top this is terrifying you know yeah now that he knows how to how to control his hips when he's on the ground yes just a different story I want to see um I want to see where he goes now he's like it's weird cuz now he's like a prospect at a different way yeah yeah well he just needed to fix that one piece of his game and he fixed that one piece of his game the grappling and the takedown dances I want to see Joe get to the point where he's on he's completely comfortable on the ground he's he's close to it but like and two or three years down the road him and style bender alright stop Anders a special kind of dude yeah yes he's especially can't do that Derek Brunson fight showed it it's like this is a special kind of dude I like that kid who he's easy yeah he's fun to watch man he's slick yeah he's slick he's fighting Anderson next I don't like that Franzen yeah yeah I'm I don't like these fights where like I didn't like y'all year in BJ right I don't I don't like these fights where like these guys we've done so much for the game are kind of getting fed to the Wolves in there in their twilight but every now and then you get a Shogun tyson pedro fight which the fucking old lion roars again right you see that fight i missed all the UFC faces weekend cuz of Bellator in the boxing match Shogun could return from adversity - I heard harden that fight you got staggered and fucked up Tyson poured it on but couldn't keep it up and then Shogun got him to the ground smashed him up a bit got him standing up hit him with a big right hand at the end of the fight dropped him and then beat the fuck out of him on the grounds like it was it was for me when I saw that fight announced Tyson paid over struggles like damn Shogun's got another hard fight it's hard watching Shogun get knocked out that's the time so you know that's but he won and he won in a big way and he won in a war it was a war he still fuck he's still a fuckin badass how is Shogun still so goddamn aggressive - like he's not slowed down it was like real frantic and aggressive and it was awesome that's that's this thing inside you right you can't get rid of that well some dudes they lose a bit of it when they take too much punishment there they lose some of the ferocity or some of the enthusiasm or whatever the fuck it is but I was one of the things I was watching that fight I was like goddamn Shogun's ferocious still ferocious just everything about it like alright when he got had to do to hurt he was fucking pouring it on but he was pointed on in a demonic way yeah like a monster like he was like he was enjoying it like he was Shogun yeah like the Shogun of old man yeah this is it yeah this is it I mean he fought really well to like his ground game was real solid his ground-and-pound was real solid but it was also like his his the exchanges he would be when he find openings he was frantic and like a very real aggressive yeah it was it was an awesome fight man yeah man I had a fight past this yeah it was a fs1 thing I don't know when do they put those fs1 fights on fight past I think it's like a month is that what it is I think go go further ahead of this because this is this is a long period where Tyson was trying to secure Kimura you don't you don't go overseas right not anymore so I know those would cripple me man those fucking those overseas things there's where you drop the right hand yeah they would rekt me for a week and a half afterwards I'd be exhausted if like fucking Brazil or fly to Australia is the worst that's what I was gonna say I was like Brazil isn't that just like North South pretty much it is but it's still 16 hours on a plane really yeah yeah you got to fly to Miami and then you got to fly 10 more hours to Rio it's 10 hours from Miami to Rio now yeah South America's on that's a whole nother country I loved being there I hated getting there I hated going home I hate it how it felt afterwards man and I'm just too busy it says to me it's too costly for me financially to take that much time off and it's also it's just too hard for me physically you know so if they compensated you for the time it's don't physically that's all fuck you money Jim but you know the other problem is man this fucking TV and watching it on fight pass or doing fight companions you know yeah those fight companions are the shit ya know those are fine we did I do that one with you and Jo yeah Laurie yeah yeah we got do another one what definitely do it for you see yes yeah let's pick one you got it you know what what are you gonna be for New Year's I'm gonna be on vacation oh okay well it's gonna say man if you're here do a do a fight do a fight companion for the right cell phone for pfl yeah so tell me about pfl so you are you're doing commentary for the PFF commentary in the telestrator and who else is doing it with you Randy and box Randy and boss what a combination right what a fuckin combination when I got that call and they were like yeah and the team is gonna be you or any and boss I'm like wait you just put my name in the same sentence that those dudes is like as equals and it's like for me like I get I get like some fight some fight fans maybe thinking yeah that makes sense but like for me I'm like these are guys I looked up to you know and now you're talking I get that I get to hang out with them and you know we're having a drink at the bar that's pretty amazing but listen dude you're a really good commentator thank you you're really good analyst too I loved watching you in the Fox decks desk I loved the way you break down things you know one of the cool things about that desk is you'll have like a Michael Bisping or your half tire in or you know Kenny Florian whoever it is everyone's got their own idea of how to fight and what what what's important and what they think is gonna be a problem in right like that's such a great move to have these X Fighters and continue to you know 10 Cormier is always doing it continue to have them you know explaining from their own experience yeah yeah that's um that was the first thing for me because I didn't I was like I don't know what I'm doing you know I have no idea what it is that I'm doing but it's just talking about fights and it's it's so much fun to be doing it with with guys that are on that same level likely cuz you know you're at home you probably do it when you're at home and you're not doing a fight compan you watching fight so maybe some friends around they ask you things about fights and you're like not to explain it to people who don't understand but when you're having a conversation with somebody who knows what's going on and then you can especially when you come to a point where you disagree yeah because you have strong you have strong opinions why and you have strong arguments as to why you're right and why the other guy is wrong and I don't know I like I love those moments man I love having those things especially being able to do that with guys who know what they're talking about how it makes it so much more fun when you're doing it with guys who know what they're talking about what's one of the cool things about fight companion is that we're except when Brian Cowen starts talking just kidding just kidding Brian just kidding but when you do it like everybody's got their own opinion of how something could go down or how what what's gonna be a problem a lot of times you agree you know like that like the till tyron woodley fight well it tells a chance to stand up right that's it and you know if I was tired and I'd take them to the ground I mean the tire is a far better wrestler far much much more experience but like there's some fights we like man like here's one this weekend Brian Ortega max Holloway yeah oh fuck no son that's gonna go like I've bounced that one around my head at people people have come up to me on the street like hey man who's gonna win this fight this weekend especially Hawaiians yeah Hawaiians are super excited for max Holloway to win again I mean he's the new BJ Penn right and it may be a different level max hallways a motherfucker that's that's one of those fights yeah it's very hard to pick I was that even that like it's pretty even how to be I mean what's here the Vegas odds are oh by the way I love the fact that you can actually gamble on fights now online like it's Li it's legal basically right yeah kind of do it right if you a fight would you mind yourself depending on the state you're - yeah too much pressure I wouldn't want to think about it unless I knew unless the guy was a fucking asshole and he like I'm gonna go smash this - just know very close they're both - - 105 - 125 which would be all the way as the favorite flight favorite that make sense yeah that makes sense that should be how it is slight favorite cuz he's the champion and you know what's interesting what holloway said and he goes he goes it's kind of weird when he goes it's kind of weird when the the the new thing is older than the current thing because it's like I'm younger man I'm the fucking champ I beat although I beat all these dudes I'm younger and yet this guy is the new thing coming up to challenge me it's like motherfucker I'm the younger fighter it's kind of funny yeah yeah I mean we haven't seen we haven't seen something like like Ortega a little bit you know I'm in the featherweight division guy submitting like only submissions off - like though the one with the cup yeah you know yeah I think that was beautiful like he readjusted on that guillotine - that's that's probably the hardest submission to readjust mm-hmm you know one hand hanging on readjusting and then still sinking it in against cups one it's not like it's not like Brandon bishop or whoever it's Cubs one Sonata yeah that's like that's crazy man well he's a direct lineage right he's real Gracie jiu-jitsu he is Henner and here on you know he's come he comes from Horry on that school I mean this is where Brian Ortega comes from he's direct from those mats yeah and his technique is like razor blade it's so sharp it's so sharp and precise and so honed and just through drills and a constant emphasis on proper leverage and position I mean they're sticklers to that old style of jiu-jitsu like and some people there's an unfortunate word that people like to use that sometimes pisses people off like Vinny Magalhaes use this to describe Minotauro and he didn't mean in a negative way but he meant the basics he's like his jujitsu is very basic he and people go fucking my just use basic yeah but the basic is like the best the fundamentals but these there's guys that have those basics like Roger Gracie his jujitsu is he's mostly the basics he's not doing any crazy dela Hiva shit or any you've never seen before like that oh yeah he's not doing anything we never saw it before yeah it's strict you know guard pass smashing on top triangle mount arm triangle armbar everything he does is classic jujitsu but it's just so perfect everything that leverage and the weight and the the emphasis on you know certain positions over others it's all like basic classic Jiu Jitsu and that's Brian Ortega yeah his jiu-jitsu was just so rock solid fundamentals you know he's all about fundamentals though even his box he's not I don't believe he's as good a boxer as max but he's fundamentally sound strong and direct with his box I mean he knocked out Frankie he knocked out Frankie he submitted Meccano who I think is one of the Dark Horse's yeah that division yeah an autumn or Cano is a fucking beast man Mike good Mike Brown has nothing but praise for him man he's like that kid is legit he's gonna challenge for that title I believe that I believe that and he's super like respectful and intelligent and like everything about him I like I love his his approach the way he fights and in that fight Holloway our excuse me Ortega made him shoot because he was beating him standing up and he shot and Ortega like thank you take that guillotine it's just a death grip he's just got a vise just clamps down on your fucking life yeah gotta put you to sleep there's no room there's no room you're going to sleep or you're going to tap and he's a big kid he's not my size he's big he's a big he's big max is big to their max is huge max was 185 when they told him about the the khabib nurmagomedov fight the the horrible thing about that fight was that he lost all that weight really rapidly for no reason and then they wound up pulling him out of the fight yeah the commission was like fuck this you can't fight and a lot of us at the time were like why is the Commission telling the champion whether or not he can make weight let him try to make weight get the fuck out of there you don't know what you're doing but then you find out after that that like when he was preparing for the fight with Ortega and he was experiencing these weird concussion-like symptoms symptoms but they said he didn't have a concussion and then people say no this is weight loss this is rapid weight cutting his body is responding to the fact that he just went through this and now I was trying to do it again and his body's rejecting it so this is a bunch of theories there's not they're not giving us a whole lot of information about exactly what's wrong with him medically or what was wrong whether they know it or not I don't know all right but even Ortega has been saying all week like what the fuck was wrong with him why how come they're not telling us like what if it happens again like or take has got to be thinking right now here we are today it's Wednesday tomorrow's Thursday the weigh-ins Friday he only got a couple of days like we don't know whether or not this is even actually gonna happen right like right what if he gets down to Thursday and Friday and he's in the the middle of the weight cut he starts blacking out or he starts experiencing those symptoms again they pull him out of the card Boyka knows on standby you know I did not know that yeah he's on standby for this fight that yeah see and then then it becomes an interim title it must it has to it can't be they're not gonna strip him but then what happens I mean a guy like max that I don't know it's it's one of those situations where it's like if that happens multiple times like what do you have to do Kim can you continue to how much longer can you continue to fight at that weight I don't think he can continue to fight it that way very much longer because I think he severely compromises himself getting down to 45 but he's been able to do it because he's a champion but and I think if you do have a relook at George Lockhart in your corner a guy that gets you to do it scientifically and they rehydrate yourself scientifically it can be done and you can pull it off in 24 hours later you can fight at a very high level but is that the way to go I mean the kidneys start breaking down your body starts getting beat up I mean your organs don't want to get dried out like that yeah your brain doesn't want to get dried out like that your muscles don't want to get dried out like that there's just no way you perform at your best when you're just at death's door 24 hours ago and now here you're fighting again yeah I mean Frankie you know when he was fighting a lightweight you know that kind of kind of shows you that you can be the smaller guy and do well but it's weird because like now Frankie said a bar yeah and now guys reach that bar so Frank you had to change weight classes mm-hmm you know that's it's a weird thing and everybody's gonna mean it's the fight game you always you try to get the best out of yourself and you try to get the biggest advantage that you can so the weight cuts gonna always be an issue unless the weight classes are changed and or weigh-ins become same day well Josh Thompson just said recently mmm that he thinks that the UFC is getting rid of the 125 pound division they're gonna put on a 165-pound division which i think is very interesting if they do do a 165 I would like them to switch 170 to 175 yeah I think that would be wise I don't think it's wise to have a 65 and a 75 but I do think it's 65 and a 75 is great right yeah I agree I 10 pounds 10 pounds is good yeah that's great I think across the board I think we had every 10 pounds of weight class I mean a lot of people don't like the boxing thing there's so many champions and so many weight classes but who fucking cares who cares who cares that there's a welterweight and a super welterweight right cares that it's only 7 pounds difference it's more fights well it's more fights it's more champions it's more champion vs. champion yeah I mean don't you want to see that I want to see that I want is yeah I want to see the best and the best yeah no I mean we're getting we're getting some of the best of the best right now you get the number let's say Kevin Lee all right Kevin Lee could be 165 pound champion yes but and probably that's his weight class to me really approached Ruggles to make 155 he's a big fella he's a big dude but then I can't do it anymore but like Tyron wrestled on 165 right imagine if he was still that age you know and he could fight at 165 yeah that tyrant can make 65 I bet tyrant can make 65 I think he can make 65 I definitely think he could fight at 75 and be at his best and I think he could also fight at 85 I think tyrant has legitimate potential to be a three division champion he should start he should start rallying for it for that 65 pound weight class nobody listens to me anymore man if they listen to me Melvin Manhoef would have been in the UFC back in 2002 hey yeah they listen to me sometimes I think they listen to me with Ben Askren I'm lying on record and I must say I'm a big reason why Ben Askren got in the UFC I i brokered a meeting between him and dana white okay dude I put it together I called Dana I said look he's a good guy man he's talking shit but everybody talks shit like come on I'm like the guy's undefeated and he's like he was like when ambien wants to go to sleep it takes Ben Aspen I'm like it's fighting see the thing about fighting is it's not a matter of what is like that what's exciting to watch for a person like you a person like me who's like sitting about how is this gonna play out yeah Wow what's gonna work what's gonna work what works yeah I get that yeah I want to see what works when I see a guy like Ben Askren I want to see what works well always have three to one favored over robbie lawler holy shit that's crazy it's add another fight to this card listen man you can't sleep on Robbie fuckin law will don't sleep on Robbie Lawler that's crazy that's crazy three two one 31 is horrible dude Robbie Lawler can wrestler yes there's been shot in people's lights out since the fucking early 2000s it's a fucking very I would think I mean I'll take the Robbie Lawler bet especially in 3 2 1 yeah hundred to make three hundred for a few if law it's two plus two thirty so you'd win oh oh he's a three to one so you'd have to win a bet three to win one on a spring break yeah yeah I take that bet it's a good bet but I'd like aspirins chances because I think that wrestling's just on another level yeah that's the fight here's the fight 165 khabib Ben Askren I guess Bank it makes 65 100% he can make 65 hundred percent 100% he wants to make 65 because he's good friends with tyrant and he's like I'll be the 65 pound champ Tyrone be the 70 or 75 whatever they decide to go with that's that's the fight man khabib versus Ben Askren cuz I'm telling you man Ben Askren they just put his face on the on the camera the other day while he was in the crowd and the audience went crazy you don't even fought in UFC and they love him yeah fight real fight fans until you know who he is now I know who he is now it's like he's been building momentum the hardcore fans absolutely are excited that finally this unde he did phenom of a wrestler is fighting in the UFC yeah I I would yeah I would pay money to watch him fuck yeah for sure a lot of money I'll fly to Russia for that fight you think that's where they have it fuck I don't know man I'm gonna fly to Russia you know I'm gonna commentate that fight yeah and I'm gonna soon as I get to my hotel room I'm gonna have one of them things it checks for bugs hidden cameras right the whole house is a fucking bug yeah man I think that's a that's that's a fight that I'm very very excited about because like right now khabib the the number one fight for khabib I believe is Tony Ferguson I think that's a big fight giant fight I'm really excited about that I like that I heard I heard rumors and I was spoken at Dustin of that hole Tony and could be Dustin and Conor yes fight each other I heard that too but here's the cynical part of me I know that Nate Diaz was supposed to be fighting Dustin but Dustin had to pull out with a hip injury so I'm like okay well how bad is his hip injury and when is that gonna heal up you know and is it gonna heal up or is it gonna like be a reoccurring thing and them saying that Dustin is gonna step in and he's gonna fight Conor that is a good fight but does that make Nate Diaz go what and does that make need Nate Diaz come back to the bargaining table and then they have like because that's the big-money fight yeah big money if I was a promoter I'm not a promoter if I was a promoter I'd be like Nate what we gonna do you gotta get weed we gotta girls what do you want a new bike girl deliver we got a new bike like for real like if you wanted to make money and that's what I presume they all want to do them the reason why they want to have Brock Lesnar fight DC is because they want to make a shit ton of money right now Nate mother fucking Diaz you want to make money you call Nate mother fucking Diaz go party with them become his good friend lighten them up give him what he wants give him a lot of money that's a good fight you mean it we saw it twice you know it's not just a good fight it's a gigantic like fan friendly and spectacle of an experience Nate Diaz doesn't take any bullshit you can't trash talk him it doesn't work the deal exactly doesn't work it works the opposite way it works the opposite way like when Connor should talk Nate Nate was like fuck you like what like it didn't work I ain't gonna lie my one of my favorite Nate fights with him and him and cowboy oh that was great fun hey he got in Cowboys head he did there was a good lesson for cowboy those an important fight for him in terms like the path of his career yeah yeah he grew some from that yeah but that that third round Nate standing there flipping in the bird how good did cowboy look against Mike Perry holy shit it's a new cowboy you know he looked different man looked different just everything looks smooth and just like a goddamn execution I heard rumors of that too I heard rumors a cowboy in Connor that's a fight that I would make yeah I would make that fight it's sad to fight that's how fucking exciting fight and that's also a big sell you could sell the shit out of that fight that's a big fight oh but but Connor or excuse me Cowboys not been fighting at 55 you know it's been doing majority of his fights that's another yeah how many fights he fought till he's fought Marvin all those are all 70s you know they're all 70 fights yeah Perry yeah they're only those three Oh was it another Leon oh yeah yeah Leon Edwards yeah so that's um those are all 70s yeah I don't think he's fought 55 in quite a while now can you still make it though it's not a big 70 you know yeah it's probably he was talking about going back to 55 yeah and you know and if they do have a 65 pound weight class it just there's a lot of great fights in 65 yeah boy ain't Kevin Lee dude anybody in Kevin Lee yeah Kevin leads a beast man he's something special yeah I think Kevin Lee is one of those dudes you don't see him five or six months then he gets in there and you got a whole different animal in front of you you got a guy with new skills new momentum new experience he's just in that he's 25 right now you know he's in that peak prime learning growing confidence at part of his career you know where he's just he's just a monster right now I don't know man those those guys are so much bigger than than the guys from my day I know with a 55 yeah Kevin's like walks around 190 pounds yeah big guy I'm retired I'm retired I'm no longer in this I don't worry about my weight as much and I stand next to these guys and they're still bigger than me yeah it's like how is that why is that we know what's the craziest DC yeah stand next to DC's for like five ten yeah five ten and look you could be a middleweight you could be a middleweight picks up heavyweights tosses him around slams dudes you know I mean when you see him with Derrick Lewis you like tarik has no business being in there with this dude and Derrick is a legit 265 murderer knockout puncher from hell and no business being there we see no but then you saw that guy on win dc's training partner at that affliction another section at the Tito Chuck fight Oh what Tom Lawlor oh I didn't see that fight oh yeah he's like five six really yeah five six 205 was you 85 or 204 205 really yeah five-six yeah who is he um I forget his first name Wynn is his last name he fought Tom Waller he Tracy straight trans DC D she's like yeah this guy takes me down why um yeah he's a good wrestler but it was funny cuz he sprawled on Tom Lawlor but he's on his feet like he's standing but he spa tall all's on his knees like on his knees up right Wow and his kids sprawl I guess yeah I guess I'm holdin him just get sprawled on his head yeah but he can he can box too he's little little it looks a little awkward he looks like a guy you're in a Walmart parking lot you talk shit to him cuz he's little yeah fuck you up do you remember Dwight Muhammad car we know he used to be Dwight Braxton he was the light heavyweight champion way back the day and then he fought Evander Holyfield as a cruiserweight and Khali was 195 he was 5/7 he was just a tank of a man and he would come at you like this he would get even lower he was a tough tough guy man just and real thick like you didn't see many dudes that were that thick back then and he was where his trunks way up high so you had like this much body to hit and it was all just Jack it's like the strike zone yeah yeah he's making it smaller he's one of the first big tests for Evander Holyfield yeah Dwight Muhammad Cowie from Camden New Jersey Camden buzzsaw that feels like I feel like that that I've heard of that but I don't remember anything I feel fine Holyfield vs col week how we you spell with a q you talked about you talked about that you aw I I think let me spell cow we said it q aw I yeah I finally I get to his Darrin win how do you have a Q would know to you different language yeah what is that - aw ours rule Wow yeah what Q always has a you write in English yeah yeah doesn't it start with a Q see if you get into that yeah see this is he would fight real low it was just a tank of a dude yeah and he was like all like bobbing and weaving and always ducking punches and this is a van der Holyfield fresh out of the Olympics he had had a few boxing matches but wasn't you know wasn't he wasn't the Evander Holyfield that we think of when he won the heavyweight title right and this is also before he started training with Mac ISIL stone and Mackie shields don't put a lot of muscle on him made him a lot bigger he was a 195-pound er back then it was like so much thinner is yeah but see like this is the style of Kali that bobbin and Weavin style see how Evander's having a hard time hitting them but yes you move your head protect your body when you're LA and he was giving you all forehead and it was a big old ball for it too so he's just like he's like coming at you all for at first just a real skillful old-school boxer though and them stem socks old-school stripes stripes on the calf pulled a out all the way up I still love watch these old boxing matches this is something I really missed men that boxing used to be on TV Wide World of Sports you know very showing actually a limit incre like the best of limiting co2 last night on espn2 like it when he fights on ESPN yeah you know yes he's doing some serious world championship fights ESPN has really stepped up and especially now that HBO has gotten out of the game it's I mean it's in a precarious situation I don't know why HBO decided to get out of the boxing game it's kind of crazy to me yeah but after all those years of covering the greatest fights ever HBO decided just pull out yeah I know the guy that started that oh not started but the guy who was like the pay-per-view model creator Marc Taffet he'd be left and I don't know if if that had something to do with it I'd imagine it has to be a profitability thing they think that's the only thing that make sense yeah it has to be that they're just what they were losing money I mean you guys think the production is huge right you got all these cameras and all this thing and they're they're live they got to get the trucks and production trucks it's probably live sports is probably an extremely expensive thing to pull off you know yeah yeah it makes sense but they were the best at it Lampley and Kellerman I mean fucking commentary Roy Jones jr. doing commentary with him sometimes Andre Ward you know they had some of the the best fights ever the best team ever like way John jr. loved Roy Jones days off try to get him in here too you know because do you know what's happening with him that uh Michael B Jordans talking about he could box Roy Jones I love your reaction yes hilarious yes that's funny I love I love a cocky like robust young man who's delusional yeah you gotta add that caveat I mean he's a fucking beast if you look at his body right right Michael Jordan is just just jacked full six-pack built like a Greek god but son stop it it creates a movie it's a movie man oh you felt good hitting those pads I know you look good look at them Roy Jones jr. will light you up like a Christmas tree in time where does Rodman in this corner I don't think that sounds wrong he's jacked for sure it looks good but listen terrible disaster check out my segue like if he thinks he's that tough you can fight in pfl for me and aha so what is the deal with pfl in the million dollar thing like what is it for each individual weight class yeah yeah so on New Year's Eve there's a there's a ten million dollar prize pool all the winners the six winners of their championship fights get a million dollars so three fights four million dollars because of the playoffs fights right the playoffs are cool too though because once you make the playoff if you lose in the quarters it's guaranteed 50 you lose in the semis that's a hundred and then the finals are the winner gets a million the loser 200 still good still good money right um I'm happy to see how good Vinny's doing Vinny Magalhaes a beast he's a completely different guy he is you know he always had the the some of the best jujitsu you're ever going to see in MMA pe yeah but then his striking wasn't up to par but now it is his striking was good I mean he won two fights because of his striking one with strikes and one by setting it up with his striking you know um Vinny he's he's really working out he says he says he claims to be training four times a day for this and he looked that way he didn't get out of the first round like each fight got longer and the longest fight was like 2 minutes 33 seconds or something like that his jujitsu is on level yeah Danny my glasses one just forget about MMA he's one of the best in his weight class on the planet Earth in jiu-jitsu I mean he's a monster do you ever see when he flying armbar paid upon oh no dude dude will you fly an armbar a world champ and like paid upon Oh I mean Vinny just they tie up and Vinny just throws his 200 and fucking 20 pound body up in the air and snatches his arm out of nowhere flip him flips him over on his back and paid upon Oh tap down he was like fuck fin he's a ninja he's a bad motherfucker yeah that's all I think that that is this fight that I'm the second flight that I'm looking to the most for the finals then that Ray Cooper the third dude he's another one five seven yeah haymakers vicious why did they make Jake Shields fight that dude again just how it played out that's crazy the number eight seed right smash bug by Ray and then he's got to fight him again yeah and it's like he didn't have much time in between this to improve right and five months not even five months for me was like let me see the first one happened in like chulai and the second was October July August September 3 months yeah how crazy is it that Jake fought his dad Jake fought his dad 14 years ago yeah and then and when they were scheduled to fight the first time Jake is the favorite because we know Jake Jake Shields is we don't know who Ray Cooper the third is we don't know state champion wrestler mm-hmm hey it's like a truck he's just a tank of a man and when you see him in there he doesn't look as small as it like when I stand next to him and talk to him it's like his short stocky guy yeah but then when he's in there against Jake Shields he don't know that persona that attitude that personality he's coming forward and Jake's backing up and it makes him look bigger than he is well he's only 5 7 but jesus fucking christ he hit so hard yeah he's terrifying and he's got crisp technique like it's not just like throwing wide looping fucking ridiculous punches Ricardo Mayorga or some shit that it ring they hit you you're fucked no he's thrown everything with great technique he's a monster I mean he he's he's been my biggest favorite this this season like just watching well he's unquestionably world-class and so is Vinnie and that's one of the more interesting things about today's climate I feel like with Bellator with the PFL for absolutely with 1fc you have world-class fighters in many organizations it's not just the UFC and these guys can all come over and compete in Minas essentially at the top of the heap right now and basically you got Lance Palmer yeah these guys in almost every organization that I feel like I can compete with the best in the world in any organization it's pretty it's getting pretty even now much more so than it was four or five years ago yeah it's weird though because all of these things happen in the past we had pride we had Strikeforce you know the WEC and then those things got absorbed yeah right and then all the best guys ended up in the UFC and it's like well all the best guys are here now and like now these other organizations one was still around and one was always not a threat but always always had quality quality fighters you know now we know that the one there's some some really legit guys over at one then we got a scream coming over you know now the PFL starting up like guys like Vinnie is his career like he's a different guy now yeah like what if I can compete with anybody at 205 exactly you know like it's a very different story for a lot of guys but now what happens when when these guys in the UFC the number a thank heavyweight in the UFC sees a guy make a million dollars it's like I would and he's and he's thinking about fuck that guy up I love it it's good it's good for everybody yeah competition is great for the sport it's great for the athletes it's great for the organizations because the organizations whether they like it or not it's gonna make them pick up their game yes gonna make them step up some people don't like to pick up the game Joe some people like to be caught they just like to be comfortable that it's not life that it's not that it's not man I got I got there is something I wanted to show you that um that reminded me of why I need to pick up my game I was looking through my my phone a couple months ago and I have this video of my dad I'm gonna show it to you down but I'm just gonna go straight to the end because that's the coolest part do you want to send it to Jamie yeah I can do that oh can you airdrop it to him I can airdrop I see young Jamie's MBP yeah that's that's it BAM there we go Jamie what are you gonna call yourself when you hit 50 that's right I named you it's true good point but you got to go through you gotta go forward some through some of it but yeah like like just reminded of like some of the things in my life I've been kind of what are we gonna say what is this so my dad my dad dance limbo right my dad was the baddest nimble dancer on the planet really um and he did some crazy crazy stuff you might need to try to get it didn't Oh probably when I closed my phone okay um there we go waiting for Jamie to grab it I'll leave it open um no my dad used to dance Nimbo and Limbo's when you go onto the stick yes yes and um he I don't want it I don't want to ruin it right but he was the best jokes from like 88 like the year before he died Wow yeah so like I don't know it just reminds me of some of the thing and and do my family any time I did something that I thought was cool they would just be like yeah like so way your dad your dad would do that game it's like it was like fuck like I could never get out of his shadow but this is your dad that's my dad oh shit wait fire yeah damn how the fuck is he doing that that is insane dude that's insane yeah he did this for like tons but you did it for my keys everybody wanted to see him do this he did it in front of my deli he did it in front of the Queen you know he's gonna go under it there yeah but it gets better than this hole why do you eat they taught him how the fuck is he doing that you don't kind of core strength that takes yeah he's blowing fire but this right here now this is where it gets ridiculous this is like I see this and I'm like yeah that's my dad right he's gonna go what so this is on fire folks and this this thing is I'm not bullshitting and he's got two flaming pizzas in his hands and he's like that that might be what 13 14 inches off the ground and he's going under it that's insane and he's spitting fire while he's doing it holy shit you weren't joking no my dad was a badass that's crazy how crazy is looking at this old VHS footage right digitized it's not that long ago man no and that's a different world and that that kind of thing my dad couldn't I mean I was always with I used to love being with him you know he's like my best friend i remember i was telling my son this story about him so i had this this thing with my kid and i'm recording this conversation me my son and i'm like what would you do if you go back in time he's like what i was like if you had a time machine go anywhere where would you go he's like I don't know the 1900s and I'm like I grew up in a nightie night old Miss story I was like you know my mom I was little my dad used to I used to bring me on stage to do that I was like four five years old no I was like four years old and he'd pick me up and carry me under under the bar right and one time you brings me on stage she's like this is my son and he presents me in the spotlights on me and I'm like shy and I'm like oh and he was kind of disappointed you know he's really disappointed me that day and then um a couple weeks later I was with him again he's like I was like Daddy can he bring back on stage and he brings me on stage and I'm he's about to pick me up and I'm like walk away can I go back to my seat and he loved it he loved it you know and I told my son that story my dad was like he people afterwards we walked through the hotel to go back and he has me on his shoulders and he's just so prized like you see my boy and he's like you know I told my son about that my son was like this is like 40 minutes later in the conversation and my son is like that if I had a time machine I would go back and hang out with you and your dad Wow and I was like that was like that was like the best moment of my life well yeah because he didn't get to meet him but it's one of those things man and and just just thinking about that kind of thing kind of makes it inspires me to like to like want to do things where we're you know kids like this is what my dad did that for me and he made me excited about things and now I want to do stuff where something where where I can give something to kids and um nice what you're doing with your book that's what I'm doing with that and like my thing is mixed martial arts right so this thing this this is the first book the Talent Quest and um so it's about these characters these these you write all this so here's the thing the concept and the characters came with me I've I have a good friend she's a she's a psychologist and she's in Australia she wrote this story out and then we have this girl that does the the illustration she's uh naari em she fights she fight someone she's fighting this weekend all right so like it's all it's all about mixed martial arts in the psychology of it and working on all these different things but we're gonna put this whole program together that that's all about teaching kids like discipline self respect you know self resilience all these things with these stories together with these characters and it's a whole lot of fun I have a book for you and I I want I want you to to enjoy it with with you know with your little ones I will do that thank you man that's awesome so is this available for sale where could you forget it so you can get it on Amazon and Amazon Katyn was at KDP I have enough to read the thing in my phone but it's um it will be available we were gonna release it on the 15th of December and you can get it by eBook and you can also get it a printed copy like this so let me know when it comes out it's the 15th of December 15th of December remind me and I'll tweet it man that'll be soon though when this pfl thing comes out when when is this it's on New Year's and what is on NBC NBC Sports so what channel was that look what is NBC Sports on Direct TV that's one of them weird ones yeah you gotta find it yeah you wanna watch the Olympics right is that what it's on NBC Sports I'm gonna watch curling they're gonna do MMA they're talking about do whatever man in the Olympics yeah I've heard about that it's right next to like fs1 it's right it's FS 1 2 to 19 NBC's SN is to 20s another great that Channel what is NBC's plans for this for this is this like this is obviously they spend a lot of money because they're given a million-dollar prize to three different guys yeah well the PFL is its own organization you know so it's a it's a partnership with NBC so the PFL puts the money up for the fighters and NBC does have doesn't you know there's an influx of money coming in from NBC but the PFL is in control of all of that so I don't know what NBC's plans are you know but the PFL has big plans they they have a contract with NBC that I believe the contract is up this year but of course they're gonna renegotiate you know they're gonna work things out and this is the only MMA product that nBC has it remains hot right now so I don't believe NBC wants it wants to let the PFL go it's the the thing that seems to be the bottleneck with other organizations is the name it's like you know the UFC is like the NFL right so I got this it's the biggest name UFC has ever made of - a lot of people - a lot of people yeah and then you hear about the PFL you what's what's that mean what's Bellator mean like 1 FC what does I mean it doesn't mean anything it's like it's hard to get I think Bellator is making some ground you know because they've been doing plenty of television events and paramount Network is a big Network a lot of people get a chance to see it they've had good ratings but it still hasn't caught fire right there the thing with the PFL yeah the name professional fighters League you know like you hear pfl you don't know what that means you're professional fighters li you have an idea what's going on but on its good name it's a great name um and it's the name is is representative of what it is you know it's a league we have a regular season so you fight in the regular season you score a certain amount of points you score points by getting finishes you score points we're getting finishes in the first round you know you win the fight that's three points you got to finish in the first that's three edition points second round two points third round one point and then at the end of the regular season the top eight seeds get into the playoffs and you fight by your seed so that's why Jake had to fight fight ray Cooper again mmm this Jake kind of edged in to that eight spot and Ray Cooper was the number one like the finish in the third rounds worth less than the finish in the first that don't make any sense to me yeah it's um because it's a little tougher to finish in the third yeah not only that it's a finish finishes a finish yeah I I agree but I don't like sometimes it takes a while to finish you guys like look here's a perfect example say you're fighting a guy like Josh Thompson you know back in the day like this is a tough fight right these are two world-class fighters versus you fighting Henry Smith from fucking Albuquerque that nobody knows right it's different if you finish that guy in the first round like yeah you've got to finish in the first round but did you get a finish over a world-class guy if you've gotta finish over a world-class guy in the third that's worth more I mean it's depending upon who you're fighting and what what style that how resilient they are how difficult they are to beat but then it gets becomes more subjective when you're talking about the difficulty and matching up styles and then you're starting to bring the odds into it from like like I guess it wouldn't be betting odds but similar to betting on yeah you know so it's one of those things where there is no perfect way but you take what you have and do the best of what you can I get it but a point the difference is in two points like you get three points for the first round but one point if finish the third yes all that finishes a finish man you told bonus points for finish as well as yours is a finish I I made that argument we we had that conversation is it's like but then again then what do you do how do you get bonus what do you get bonus points for here's a perfect example how dare you how dare you try to diminish Yair Rodriguez last second yeah hey oh of the Korean Zombie yeah no it's a bull he shouldn't get all the points for that yeah that was crazy he literally knocked the guy with one second to go with a no-look elbow pack I mean that's at all the points give him all the points that's the JIT like yeah yeah you get you get so many points for finish whether it be for a second the third round but initiative points where this is I agree um because the one the one difference that we have is is in a draw like both guys get one point I feel that if if you or if it goes to a decision maybe you should get points you know maybe we should get a point for for surviving but the winner gets more and then if you get finished you get so no points but the finisher gets all the points well it's it's definitely squirrelly like the idea behind it squirrely I get what they're doing i I buy them I buy the fact that you got to get points because it's kind of like kind of like college wrestling you know um you get team points yeah you get points for a pin you get four for the pin you get three I'm sorry you get five for the pin you get no you get six whippin them so you get five for the major decision you know you get three for the decision it's it's weird but and it may be tweaked next year there may be some too hard for people to remember all that shit that's the thing so we're constantly talking about it on air you know as the fights going on yeah and people listen or drunk they like what what is the point they can't do the math what yeah but it's it's it's super cool because it changes sometimes guys attitudes when they were in there they changes what they do on how they respond in the fight you know um say the fight there was a fight with Kyle Allen Carmike Kyle right both of these guys needed to finish to get into the playoffs either one of those guys get to finish they get into the playoffs Josh Kopelman sitting at home hoping that nobody gets to finish the fight starts and boom mic Kyle rocks kayo island car and it's like it looks like he's gonna get a first-round finish make it into the playoffs Kyle Allen car starts coming back he gets on top in the second round he looks like he's gonna get the finish and make it to the playoffs these guys go to the third both guys a gas now nobody finishes Josh Copeland jumps off his chair at home and he's in the playoffs now and now he's in the finals like he was the eighth seed he beat the number one and then he beat the number five seed bide kale now he's in the and I was in the finals and he has a chance to make a million dollars number AC is going in interesting okay that you just made a good argument for it mmm I'm not sure if I buy it though you buy it Joe you buy it why don't they revamp the scoring system I would not be surprised if this offseason we we do some some some brainstorming and change a few things but I don't know if a whole lot is gonna be changed you know I think some few things will be changed the next season's gonna be even better you know and to a man I've heard I've heard virtually every high level guy every UFC level guy that I've spoken to they said to me are they gonna be able to pay that million dollars when they see that million dollars is real yeah then I want to see the reaction to that that's gonna change everything once people get that million dollar check yeah you know once you see someone you know you see Vinny Magalhaes driving around a Ferrari in a Rolls Royce let that fuck look at that motherfucker I kicked his ass yeah in that Rolls Royce I know yeah you can see Ryan Bader sitting around going what the fuck he's gonna be mad Ryan Beit is another guy who's transformed right yeah he's like a legit heavyweight contender now he looks fucking good man the way beat Mitrione like Jesus Christ Amit ryeowon is improved yeah she owns improved a lot knocked out phaidor I mean come on that's a I mean that's a feather in your cap for the rest of your life shoot I I sat next to failure and that's a feather it might have right I was gonna go to watch the fade or faders fighting Ryan Bader in LA they're fighting at the Forum but there's uh there's a UFC that night I can't go I wanted to go see fate or fight live yeah I never seen him fight live and I felt like that was a great fight him versus Bader that's a great fight to see live I've never I've never seen him fight live either I have a picture of me fader and Tim crater like he'll like just Tim was fighting and fado was giving me some advice on odd and what to tell Tim what was he saying he was just you just he's got to stay low and keep him away because he's fight in jail right but this is before jail is Jail right it's like he's his wrestler like and somebody's translating it too but um he's talking to me is talking to me talking to him someone comes along translate he's like he's gotta stay low and keep him outside keep him outside the guy translating sounds like this he said he says he said fado say he keep him outside and stay low but just just having a conversation with that dude and sitting next to him and he's not that big of a guy he was not that big of a guy serious another guy who probably could be a middle way yeah fado is awesome though I mean if you see some of the middle weights that are in the UFC like yo L yo L was in your chair sitting right there and it looked like somebody dropped a giant iron sculpture of a superhero and put it it didn't even look like he doesn't look like a human he's so big dude he's like 220 plus just jacked everything neck shoulders back just jacked you're like that is a heavyweight yeah you know if you sit him next to fate or he looks bigger yeah way bigger than fate or how yet he fights at 185 but he's also so jacked and ripped and he's like my age like but he's he's not like he like you could be my agent be ripped like I am if I take off my shirt but I want to embarrass you right don't so please go thank you but but like the way he is he's ripped like a 25 year old he's ripped like a body build yeah yeah right he's a freak of all freaks yeah like he like you see his body in the ring and you go first of all how did he make weight that's what I always think like when even when he steps on the scale like back before we had the early weigh-ins we had the weigh-ins at the actual time at four o'clock he would step on the scale and make weight like how is that 185 pounds it doesn't even make sense he looks like he's 200 pounds easy Plus that that same thing happened in the match with um Conor and Floyd when Connor was getting on the scale yeah um Mayweather's maybe this promoter was like he's not gonna make the weight he's not gonna make the weight but I don't know this there's some guys who you know especially MMA guys are bigger than boxers you know you know so it's one of those things like yo L has that down he's he is huge but that dehydration hits really why he sucks Lockhart talked about it yeah look at the size of that disease that guy's like 42 years old so pink he's so jacked and unparalleled wrestling skills - oh shit you over Merrill versus David branches booked what does that click on that shit that might not be this is could be older it might be new though I'll click on that shit what do we got what is this you've seen on Fox oh yeah so that never happened right that never happened I don't remember it had no that didn't happen hmm typed in real elvers fader when there's a picture of them matching up yeah that whole 34 185-pound division is kind of crazy because they're promising if style Bender fights Anderson they're saying to Anderson if you win you get a title shot and everybody else in Division is like what what yeah like do you think that that's like some trickery to get Anderson to fight style bender I that's exactly what I think it is that's exactly what I think it I um does it they offer style bender a title shot if he beats Anderson Dan hook neighs I don't believe so and that dad hooker Dan hooker posted that on it on his on his Instagram and I I just like I like hooker and I just had to say something I was just like look we know that style and my thought was we know when style bender wins this fight because I really believe style was gonna win that fight when he wins this fight he's not gonna get that title shot and I for me as a former fighter and knowing who Anderson is and what he's done for the sport and for the UFC I'm just like I feel like that's that's that's that's so disrespectful she asked me that's my opinion it's an opinion it's mine and I stand by it that that you know we want to make this young guy a star and we're gonna we're gonna sacrifice you to the wolf to get that done but Anderson still feels like you can compete at the highest loved man we all go to feel like we compete if you put enough money in front of me I will I will fuck a beam up right right you put something in front of me that I really want right I'm like that's the thing they give you a goal I give you a time period to train and prepare for it yeah Anderson's what 43 now yeah so so that's that's the realm of possibilities the same age as uol or close to it yes you know these forty girls at least yeah he's the boys might be 41 I mean it's not the problem with and I mean and then Anderson we started failing drug tests like okay so he's probably struggling it's trying to get that edge you know trying to trying to recover in training so he's taking a bunch of weird supplements yeah some of them were tainted and I bet you if you go back to just go back to what you used to do go back to what it was you did when you became the Anderson silver that everybody loves you know before before he got to the point where like before the Forrest Griffin fight mm-hmm because I believe that's when it started to climb for him yeah he still looked good and he still still performed well but he got away from from the fundamentals you know I mean that Forrest Griffin fight he was able to take Forrest out without the fundamentals moving his head doing doing these weird things popping back the fundamentals at what's strong a stay in the game for sure that fundamental the Forrest Griffin fight is an interesting example too though because forest had been ko twice in training for that fight like he had no business being in there they really and he just couldn't take shot which is another thing I want to talk to you about Tito Chuck yeah as a guy who's retired who had an awesome career and you're watching that and he's seen a guy come back at 50 and get stopped like that what does what did that do for you you kind of knew that chai well I felt like Chuck shouldn't be taking that fight right Tito's been competing Tito's still in there yeah and then when they stepped in as soon as they touched up it's like yeah Chuck shouldn't be in here he looked that's the first time he looked that much smaller than Tito he didn't look the same sizes you know he didn't look comfortable he didn't look as coordinated like Chuck was always little quirky and awkward in his movement but he didn't even look like Chuck Liddell right he looked like a shell of Chuck Liddell and it's nice to see him hitting the pads like recent video of him hitting the pounds no did it look terrible yeah he said he was just warming up like he talked to Brian Shaw I always look bad when I'm warming up but like it's not just that look it looked like his balance was off wait I get that I would see if I would have saw that beforehand I still wouldn't put a whole lot of stock in that because like I remember being a lock on before fot Hermes Franck of the first time in the UFC and Nick Diaz was in my locker room and niggas hitting pads and he's about to fight Robbie and he's hitting pads and he's like yeah I'm gonna knock this motherfucker out yeah and I'm like not hit nosepads like he didn't look like he didn't look sharp he didn't look like Eddie power and anyone out there knocked Robbie out well he probably was just warming up though right like sometimes some guys warming up they'll just they're just trying to get their body yeah they're not really trying to look like a fighter right not trying to look like sharp like they're gonna be inside the inside the cage and yeah I mean so shocked one to see if you can find that Chuck Liddell hidden pads it's different it's different because it's like it his balance looks off his coordination looks off it just doesn't look it doesn't look good you know it just there's a you know here it is right here take a look at this watch this yeah yeah looks like it has no pop yeah yeah I mean it's crazy to watch right it just looks like Lucy how he throws that kick and and leans back afterwards it just looks ah there's a real issue with someone who's had that many chaos even K out that many times like your your brains been scrambled that many times like what is how was the connection between your muscles in your mind English bones nor nor logic yeah it makes you uncomfortable right yeah it does like I mean and that's Chuck yeah I mean one of greatest of all time yeah I don't know I I don't I know at 49 also you know 50 that's that's there's a point ya know I almost feel like I would do it again for for certain oh I'm not trying to be a world champion I'm not trying to get to khabib or Dustin and those guys you know um but like Jo Lausanne Diego Sanchez somebody that's like from the same era yeah at least a part of the era that I was in somebody like that you know somebody who I have respect for and it like it's it's going to be fun and something but like I'm not and I guess that's what Tito and Chuck is but it also Chuck you beat him twice yeah you know what he's be him twice by knockout but I think he just felt like he always had Tito's number but this is the problem is like Tito wins now yeah right like the guy who he never wanted to win now wins yeah the guy who wouldn't fight him when he was the champ now and now is the winner like when it all said and done Tito que Odom and he Kayode him more soundly than Chuck ever ko Tito because when Chuck ko Tito he basically beat him down and then Tito covered up but he was conscious right like right Chuck put Chuck out he put him out and you know I mean it was a good shot for sure but it just seems like you're dealing with a guy who's whose brains are you know it's just he's been scrambled too many times yeah yeah prizes they made that fight I am surprised at the Commission that the fight happened yes if that's what you mean yeah I'm not surprised that that Oscar De La Hoya Tito Ortiz came together and said let's get Chuck to fight right you know I'm not surprised about that at all do you know that they said there was only like 25,000 pay per view but that's what I heard that kind of sucks that's crazy horrible that's so low that must have cost everybody money like I have my Instagram followers what's a hard sell and the undercard wasn't so good either it wasn't like there was a lot of like big names on the undercard that's gonna draw people in where they're gonna go well it's gonna be great fights no matter what no yeah though the undercard was not that great no no you know you you saw the whole show no yeah that's right you didn't you didn't know they're twins but the UM the undercard was not great um and then the tio Chuck fight I mean Tito looks like the the much better strike a much more accomplished striker in that fight and like Tito Ortiz knocked out knocked out Chuck Liddell is that that's like a phrase I never thought I would hear and it'd be real but isn't it also the case of not just Kido remaining active and staying competitive it's exactly what it is it's that too but it's also Tito skills got better yeah they definitely got better Jason Pearl is an awesome instructor I mean he's a fantastic boxing coach and he really tightened up Tito's hands and all his techniques over over the course of the years they were together and the last time tetouan Chuck fought iPhone's hadn't been invented yeah think of that yeah you know no iPhones people use in sidekicks remember those there were those things I remember that flip up the keyboard at Tiki and everybody thought they were slick yeah this was the last time they fought it's a different and myspace was the thing is a different world man it's just it's just sad to see it go down like that where I mean it would be one thing if it was a good fight if like Tito looked like Chuck chuckles like Tito because Tito looked good yeah Chuck did not look good right they both look good and they put on their best fight and then T don't wanna up winning good for him but it wasn't that it was one guy was a just a shell shell of himself so what kind of fight fatigue oh or a rematch for Tito would make sense to that you think would sell is there is there one Tito versus chair we'll sell a little bit I mean he's been calling chill out saying I want to kick your ass but I think that was probably for the pay-per-view numbers came in and then they're like Oscars like feels like now he's probably got 15 voicemails on Oscars phone Oscar and call him back Oscar's just sitting there go fuck Tito Ortiz willing to postpone retirement to kick Chael Sonnen ass again ya see but the thing is he's gonna try to do that with Oscar and Golden Boy and that's gonna sell thirteen thousand pay-per-view buys nobody's gonna buy that well I mean if check if jail gets heard on the marketing somebody will buy it look if they could figure out a real competitive fight for Tito against someone who's got a big name I don't know who that big name would be but he could still sell some did you see the did you see there was somebody posted these I think cannot El Dorado posted these two videos of Tito where it was like somebody was asking him how does he feel about this fight with Chuck and he's like I'm much better fighting I was twelve years ago a much better fighter I'm bigger I'm stronger I'm younger she gets a little flustered yeah said he wanted to outlive his kids - look - that's the worst thing yeah right you also say you also say he also said the guy's like so who's making the money off of the pay-per-view is it just you is it all the fighters on the card or is it just you and Chuck and he's saying yeah it's me myself and Chuck we're gonna make the money off of the pay-per-view you know he just gets flooded he showers through these things yeah well you know it's not a stalkers business that's fighters business yeah it's weird you know you're asked asked to be several things and when a guy like Connor comes along or a guy like Colby Covington house the other thing I want to talk about they're talking about Colby not fighting tyrant for the title now and then Uman leapfrogging over Colby who's the interim champ didn't they stripped Colby did they strip him I believe he could be stripped maybe this ain't yeah yeah maybe they did strip him which is also weird which is weird because like that should have been tyrants first fight back from that Dixon I shoulder surgery yeah you know that's what the interim is for right yeah I mean that's if it's not then what's an interim for unless that if they stripped him there's the only reason why I could see saying you smart but also that's another thing where I think it's probably negotiation tactics it's like the the Nate Diaz Dustin Poirier thing yeah I remember looking this up and someone was trying to correct me last time I did it was supposed to be which I don't know if it actually happened when that fight happened with tyre and until when that fight happened he was supposed to be stripped but he's on this website he's still listed as the interim Chan well it's a good move to keep him the interim champ if they decide to fight because then a champ versus champ you know if they do decide to make that fight I feel like on paper at least financially it's a good fight because uh like Kobe talks so much shit it's like it's worth you know it's worth putting together just for that because people don't know whose money is very much but it was spawns a nightmare for anybody he is the biggest I believe biggest threat to Tyron right now solid wrestling's all exciting conditioning everything super strong yeah and just has been on a tear and has gotten better with every fight it's been proven has gone through the trial by fire inside the Octagon exactly like Colby has Colby has the wrestling submission awareness at least his offensive submissions aren't the best but he can finish you and his striking is competent but he has no power he's not going to hurt Tyra in term titleholder huh okay how's it yeah so they didn't strip him they decided to keep him but who knows they might have just not see that guy Kevin McDonald he was one of my students really yeah wow that's great he's great ruff yeah he's a good ref the the Kobe thing is interesting you know it's like his fight again - San Jose like anybody thought he wasn't for real like you see that fight yeah shit dos Anjos his conditioning is incredible I mean that is that is one of the big things about that dude this is conditioning it's off the charts he doesn't get tightenin he does not get tired he's a fucking animal yeah so that's what the thing that makes that fight interesting with the time can he push tyrant but can he survive that's the thing yeah that's the big thing see dos Anjos is more of a volume striker at 170 he's not gonna knock those bigger guys out but tiring to knock out anybody so it says this is a I want to see that fight and the thing with with Colby like the last time I trained with him it's been about a year but at that point he was hard to miss you know for me I know I'm a striker but I'm Tyron like Tyrone's got good Chris boxing but he hit so hard so hard so fast along he's so fast like his straight right hand is just remember when he fought um Carlos Condit he hit him with a lead right hand and I was just like whoa did somebody like remove some friends from that from reality he crossed over so fast like his distance like he closed the distance so quick he's explosive he's so fast I don't I don't know I Tyron is a real champion you know I mean he's a real champion and not getting the credit that he deserves for a long time that ball is him but he's in a handful of the greatest Walter words of all time now in my opinion you got Matthews who's a legend and got of course George st. Pierre Robbie Lawler and then Tyron who knocked out Robbie Lawler I mean in my opinion he's right up there and it's as these wins pile up he'd make more of a case of him being the best Walter Wade ever yeah Tyron with that being said he's beaten a lot of the guys in the division but he needs like you said earlier he needs a fight like a GSP yeah he needs some something where somebody else is established because with him coming in and taking out Robbie and all these other young guys they they're proven amongst themselves and monks each other but a lot of like you said nobody knows come on lucemon yeah all right and Huisman he's he's a threat he's to everybody everybody you know he's been wanting he's been won Colby he's been wanting down until he wants he wants everybody cuz he wants a shot at the belt yeah and um I believe for real he's the biggest biggest threat to tyre but um Tyron could win that fight also can win it convincingly and then it means nothing to the to the world who Chiron wants to respect what he's done as the champion yeah in that case that's one of the reasons why I think the fight with Colby makes the most sense I think it would be the most controversial highest-profile cuz Kobe will talk mad shit time when I get really angry and if he beats him and smashes then it steps up him and puts him in and then in the meantime I mean till is not gonna fight it 170 anymore tills moved up to 185 okay so like but you still have a plethora of killers in the welterweight division I mean you can make a lot of matchups but the Kobe fight the Colby fight also could help tire and get over to because Kobe's gonna talk I'll talk a lot of shit and some of its disrespectful of people people know people like to see those guys get stopped it's true and I'm true so that's that's that maybe that's watching that's like to see those guys get stopped not just get beat so tired and win that fight for the most part he has to stop Colby you know you know because Kobe's not gonna quit and in the fourth round he's he's gonna step on the gas yeah yeah time can't keep up then it's gonna be a problem be Bevers I got David Goggins here - nice Maximus oh wow anything else before we get out of here the only other thing was the ketone meals like those things are awesome maybe they want to make an an elk meal and they wanted to want to talk to you about about about it we'll talk about that afterwards for sure their office so what is that company what is it keto ketone bodies bodies the ketone meals um and you can look them up online keto meals you're working with them yes they they've been sponsoring me and send me good stuff to my house beautiful we'll talk Eve Edwards thank you sir always a pleasure PFL New Year's Eve New Year's Eve energy source check us out bye everybody [Music]
