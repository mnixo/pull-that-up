the number one sex toy for men clean it don't forget to wash it out don't forget to wash it so this is what's going on folks we're sitting around waiting for graham hancock to get here he was doing some sort of a seminar in Orange County and so that's like at least an hour away so Duncan and I instead of just sitting here staring at each other decided to stare at each other online so that is the that's the the basic motivation for this podcast yep I ended up getting out here is crazy man I ended up in some my GPS took me in a bad direction this time you're out in the middle of nowhere man I ended up in a place that was like the surface of the Moon I don't know where the fuck it was spooky it was spooky like I could have gone off a cliff and no one would have found me for a week you'd be fine dude don't worry about it now you're tweaking stop you're tweaking some tweaking bro are you scared of nature tariff no I'm not scared of nature but I am scared at night when I'm when you're going around like winding curves through meth country I'm not exactly like exactly comfortable of those curly lives out there there's a lot of people live out there yeah but my window race you like to be away from each other I like space well how do people assume that but is a strange thing why people assume that when someone wants to be away that they want they want some space between you and there's something creepy about him bothering out there fucking cooking math and yes you're automatically so why is that cabin by itself with that chimney blowing smoke what the fuck are they cooking in there yeah you know you don't look at it and go look at that guy's out there just do it by himself chopping wood no you assume automatically there's some creepy thing is going on he's by himself when traditionally the creepy people are the ones who live underneath you and your apartment there's a real creep someone's are masturbating to footsteps better oh yes there was a documentary you know that a VBS TV yes I wouldn't call a documentary I guess I'd call it an episode where they went and they went and visited this guy who lives in like northern eastern Alaska he lives like way the fuck up there they have to drop him off supplies and he lives in this little tiny Shack and he's like one of the few people that's allowed to live there and he's been there for like 20 years this dude never even saw 9/11 he never saw the towers go down well I had like heard that something had happened he's so removed from everything he's got like a little generator sometimes he powers up a TV but and he's got movies that they watch but dude this guy's living in the woods in a tiny one-room house with his wife who looks like some sort of an Eskimo you know let's have a woman and they're fucking happy a shit up there he says that hunting and gathering is like what keeps you happy and that's what what keeps him happy he's out there shooting caribou and following them I mean his fucking dude loves it he loves living up there it sounds great he had a shoot a bear on one of the episodes because the bear and came too close to his house and the bear bears killed her dogs and shit so it's the middle of the night they're running after this guy with a camera and he's running through the woods with a fucking shotgun and boom boom he just blowing holes into this fucking bear and chasing it down while they're all chasing after him with cameras in the middle of the night in the woods in Alaska dude it's gnarly it's it's it's it's amazing footage - it's it's such an interesting insight to someone who would choose to live that life you know which seems too horrifying to us but to him like our life was just fucking mundane there's nothing to it you just can't get excited I don't think it's horrifying I think it sounds on me I mean there's something about being self-sufficient that seems like it would feel so incredible be completely off the grid and know that if if everything fell apart your life would barely shift at all yeah that's interesting right but that's like is that like instincts to not join the system I mean is that what that is is that some sort of a resistance of the hive you know that would feel good to not need all these people you know isn't that ridiculous because the reason why everything is so awesome the reason why society in general so awesome because millions of people contributed to make this one colossal thing that relies on millions of people but it but because all these other people are involved it's fucking awesome it's amazing it's got some terrible parts about it too but the idea itself and what can be accomplished with it it's fucking amazing so why do we want to not need that why do we want what do we want the keep the option open to be a cunt so you just fucking fuck off who's gonna go live off carabao in the middle of nowhere well that's it that's like the argument you know like people have that argument against monks like when someone goes and becomes a monk it's the same argument it's like what are you doing you're ignoring all of society to go and do and be a monk isn't it better to be in the world than it is to go and isolate yourself how if you do go and isolate yourself for you so what what ever you learn you're still it's not applicable to people in the world but some monks I don't think they give a shit you know some people they just don't care they're they're not concerned with the society they don't it doesn't make any difference to them whether they're contributing or not like who cares yeah thought in my head about monks you know like like what kind of a loser just wears a fucking orange robe and never beats off it just hides a chance all that right like dude you're missing out on muscle cars blow jobs great movies weed he's you know you're missing out on killer restaurants you miss it down on shit-talking in the monks like you're missing out on astral projection you can't send your spirit to the higher dimensional planes to communicate with the supreme gods your third eye is sealed shut you have no idea about the what it feels like to be completely in tune vibrating with a harmony universe you're just you're just humping so you're just leg humping down there in the city while I'm floating around through the eternal paradise it comes outside of time and space and they're like a pure transcendent bliss do you think there's a monk who could talk that good shit if there's a model I talk like that and say things like that that guy should like be doing tours you know it would recruit monks like left and right you could change the world if a guy could speak that way about being a monk yeah well they they I think what theoretically what may happen is that as you evolve and begin to like open your chakras up and this is purely theoretical but I think that you begin to extinguish the desire to even to tour you extinguish the desired odo to duty to perform you don't want to do that anymore you're just kind of in another place altogether right you've zoomed out it's like Google Maps you've zoomed so far out thank you you see you're saying that the more you would go down the road of meditations unless you would want to do stand-up comedy are you saying is that what you mean by tour yeah well no yeah I mean like this show like the exhibitionism you know like the the four you were saying as somebody who talked like that she should tour and talk to people oh I'm saying someone who talks like that you know and it's all a it's a theoretical idea but the you know the assumption when someone becomes a renunciate I think is that they're they're not they're not experiencing happiness when it may be the thing that they're experiencing is a million times better than what they were experiencing in the world well I know for a fact that I have achieved at least bizarre states of consciousness just from yoga I I remember one time I was in New York and I was real nervous I'd do the Howard Stern Show the next day his first time I ever did it know when I was genuinely nervous and I couldn't sleep so I was in my hotel room reading off of this ancient yoga book and doing these poses I did yoga for like an hour and a half and at the end of it I felt fucking great I mean I didn't just feel great I felt hi I felt friendly my body was like I felt tingles like a glowing tingle I mean I did this intense yoga routine for an hour and a half and when it was over my body had just stretched everything out released all the tension opened up all the the whatever the fuck it is you want to call it chakras you want to call it senses yeah you know your your your your your whatever your ability to tune in to what's around it was all it was just crank to ten I was like wow if this was a drug this feeling like an intense yoga workout you know you it can feel very much like a real mild pot you know yeah whoo like nothing nothing that's gonna make you fucking Drive shitty or can't forget your keys but something that's gonna make you just a little just a wow I feel a little better all right I feel a little more relaxed I feel a little sensitive I feel good yeah well that's a you know that can put that's I felt that too from yoga and I felt that from chanting and I felt that from any kind of ritualistic thing that has you know spiritual undertones to it which I think Yoga does you got deep into chanting right didn't you you got at one point in time you were you know you you you like you can chant out that fucking crazy I got deep into it what does nothing you you busted out on the pot that thing is it that's a Hari Krishna prayer that's a prayer that you read before you say before you're going to read the Bhagavad Gita and it means I read Christos read the Bhagavad Gita oh yeah it's a primary text that in the srimad-bhagavatam whoa but the the yeah you say that prayer and they have a bunch of other texts too I mean they're really that's how they spend most of their time and studying the Vedas so they're know almost nothing about the hard Christians all I know that when when I was a kid people made fun of the Hari Krishna it was like a stock joke you know oh sure oh and in movies to an airplane and so many movies they get made fun of because they would go and hang out at the airports and they're these guys in saffron robes with shaved heads right so it was like I try to sell books right yeah they tried they tried to sell books and so there's a lot of reasons that they did get made fun of and it was like from for me what happened to me was well there's also a bunch of legal cases too right weren't there like real cult-like scenarios with men oh yes it's organized religion man and in its hardcore organized religion that recommends you know renouncing the world like it doesn't tiptoe around the fact like it's hardcore into the idea that the the way to live if you really want to be happy is to let go of all the things of the world and start chanting the Hari Krishna maha-mantra and that the but it's very important to realize that that mantra is not owned by ISKCON which is the Hari Krishna's that's like the Catholic Church for this sect of Hinduism which is known as bhakti-yoga so there's a lot of different schools of thought in it and it's a very deep philosophy that has its roots and the idea that there is um that God the everything comes from God and so the word Krishna means translates into the reservoir of all pleasure so it's the ideas like all pleasure all opulence all happiness everything Springs from some source like the Big Bang accept the spiritual Big Bang and this is a they believe that this is an intelligent force in the universe that has specific qualities and so people are kind of born with this case of amnesia where they've forgotten that this even exists and so they begin to become attracted to these qualities and different things so people are attracted to beauty people are attracted to intelligence people are attracted to wealth people are attracted to strength but they say that these are just the sort of the what people are seeing as the qualities of the Supreme Being reflected through the material universe and that's what people are attracted to and so by the specific process of bhakti-yoga you begin to turn your your senses back towards the original source of all this stuff through this very very strict discipline of chanting not eating meat they recommend the the monks that wear the robes it's called the four regulative principles so you don't eat meat you don't use any intoxicants no sex and no gambling you wake up at 4:00 every morning 4:30 every morning you chant I think 16 rounds of this mantra hari krishna krishna krishna krishna how they got I got it all mounted on Rama Rahman Agati and you study and you won't live in a temple and that's how you spend your life and that's like and you're still in the Bhagavad Gita you're studying the Veda it's the bhagavad-gita and srimad-bhagavatam and all these other religious texts and you get deep deep deep into it to the point where you complete I mean they they recommend in as I recall their it's like you're fit even you're faint your family is just your is your karma your Fanta like your attachment to your family it's just your karma it's like let go of all those attachments surrender to this higher force and then you'll experience transcendent happiness and the ultimate goal in life is to try to connect with God that's the only reason to be alive and if you're not engaged in that activity then you're miserable then you're not really experiencing the type of happiness that and even if you think you're experiencing happiness it's nothing compared to what you can obtain from living like a spiritual life and chanting this mantra and what happened to me but this is what you not saying this is your opinion you're saying this is what no that's what you know it's a summary of it it's not my opinion but like what happened to me you're saying it like almost like in the first person like oh yeah I mean yeah I'm just explaining it I mean I'm knowing I don't really believe that the right no I mean I'm a comedian I always like just smoking in front of House of Blues drunk I'm not I'm not like right good have you ever considered that maybe that would be a path that you would you would get so interested in and because you are interested in all those principles you are interested in well yeah I'll tell your consciousness and truth have you ever thought about doing something like joining the model well what happened was when I got into the heart when I got into the heart Christian so what happened to me was um because you know you haven't if you have an experience you've had an experience there's no way around it you if you have an experience you have to accept that the experience happened and you have to tell the truth about the experience one way or the other so for me to not talk about the you know that part of my life or to pretend that I did wasn't I I had a conversion experience where I was in this temple on John ostomy which is the they call the appearance date of Krishna it's like Christmas basically and what I was what it just happened before that is I someone had gotten me really high like really stoned so I was sitting in the temple and they're like ringing bells and they have these like deities that they worship and they're pouring this I believe they pour like milk on the deities and it's like there's just it's all your senses are being overwhelmed they're burning incense they've got like flowers everywhere so the whole place just Garland's of flowers so it's just the smell of flowers and incense and monks you know like big guys with the shaved heads and the necklaces that they wear and like bells ringing so your senses are completely overcome and I've never had this experience before or since but I was looking at these symbols and all of a sudden the symbols it felt like I was seeing past the symbols into something deeper than what those symbols were the symbols were just a human's attempt to try to embody this greater thing that exists in the universe and and all of a sudden I felt the only way I can explain it is it felt like I was sound so crazy felt like I was on a spaceship I thought oh this is like an event this is what an advanced intelligence is like this felt it felt like I was looking at something that was a I'm smarter than I was and that it was being somehow tuned into and this ritual that if you were outside the ritual it would just look like a lot of pomp and maybe some brainwash people you know going through the motions of something but in them inside of it it felt like this incredible blast of super intelligence and that happened to me and like it changed me for mine for the rest of my life I'll be changed because of that like I'll never be the same after that what do you think it was do you think it was a combination of anxiety because all these people are there and do you do what you said you were high yes were you high marijuana je t'adore smoke good smoked it what do you think it was what do you mean what do you attribute just I mean that's a pretty crazy experience you're talking about well I mean what I think that I what I what was the yeah it's the chant I mean if you chant the thing about Hari Krishna's you don't have to be a hearty Krishna to chant Hari Krishna and that's that's the thing that they always said the the thing that Prabhupada the founder of the alright Krishna said is just chanted you have nothing to lose chanted what the fuck does it do is you you're saying a specific singing synchronized series of sounds yes chant has an effect that actually puts you in a psychedelic state oh yeah absolutely that's why are they that's why all the hippies loved it man I mean wow yeah totally you it's no think of yoga Yoga is a you know specific movements that you do that if you do these movements you go into them like what you said this mild psychedelic state well that's just one form of you know that's hatha yoga or whatever a particular type of yoga you were doing but in the same way the these mantras that they have induce a very specific experience that if you do it enough you will it'll light the only way to explain it is it will your mood will lighten you will the heaviness you know that heaviness man I mean I there's a heaviness that people get that I get and if I'm deeply in this state that it's what I consider like the road State you know what I mean where I'm likely to scream in a car cutting me off or something like if you chant Hari Krishna or any of the others a lot of other mantras out there then and you do it regularly just for a week then you will experience a change in your consciousness early how is that how are you attributing that what what what what could possibly be mean from a scientific sample we'll see let's look at the scientific let's look at a scientist might say I think a scientist would say well it's a placebo effect you know you can you could decide to chant any mantra you could make anything up you could chant rum dee-do dee-do dee-do if you wanted to and do that enough times if you believe it's gonna the intention creates the change that's the that would be the scientific explanation of it at the the religious explanation of it is that what you're doing is create your tuning yourself in to a specific you're tuning your neurology and when you're chanting you're addressing the language center of your brain you're focusing in on this specific pattern how'd a coach not a Christian occurred Snickers no how do you got I got it all on it on my Rama Rama had a yachty and you do it how you do it honey Krishna Hari Krishna Krishna Krishna I gotta thought you would do it this is how I'd share so if I'm alone by myself and Channing I chant fast so it's like well what Brahm das had talked about this and said that it's like kind of the way you Chan is just an indication of the way you where you are in life you know like so if I'm more relaxed the Channing will slow down but because of because of like because it's just the way I am like I end up chanting fast and I'll try to slow myself down but it just ends up going fast again but if you look at I mean I just was watching a video of Provo fighting and he chants relatively fast so it creates this sound like here listen honey it creates this weird trippy sound especially when you're if you're just do it do like you're for real intentions how did your son he gives Snickers Snickers nothing I do at home when it on my mom moaning Eddie Eddie good son he gives niggas niggas none I got at home I'm gonna get a kitchen I get niggas niggas Nona Getty put it on well now I'm gonna get it cuz she's nothing if something is something it's nothing I hated on when I don't um I'm gonna get eat occasion I get something get something it's Nona Getty put it on occasion I guess that's awesome that's the chant now but what's cool about it is you if you listen to the chant it has the OL minute but if you're gonna go Snickers nicotiana go dome rum rum and some people will just chant the home or some people will just chant wrong that's another chant ROM ROM all of these are no matter what you think and I know I are gonna think I'm a you know a New Age freak or whatever but I'm not I'm just telling the truth it's helped me immensely in my life I don't think anyone should do anything more than like what they're comfortable with but if you're having a bad trip if you're freaking out in your life and you're but if you especially if you're having a shitty trip and you start chanting Hari Krishna you will feel better in every time man if you can remember how it goes just looking at Blitzkrieg daddy oh yeah and talking to the Lucky Charms guy on top of the world I'm not gonna remember that fish tank is 90 degrees down when I just did home when I get super bank and getting the tank I um yeah because you've when you're in the tank you know first of all it's mine is very tall like seven feet tall and there's a sound when your ears are underwater that's really bizarre man when you make a body noise [Laughter] and that'll be my all my breaths every breath is just that home and it's echoing so as I'm taking in my inhale I'm still hearing the exhale echo and then home and I can I get I get deep yeah I go deep into crazy train town crazy train cat woods yeah the woods of the universe well well that's the that sound is considered the original sound vibration of the universe that's the sound that all things emerge from that's like the basic primordial sound was a big bang do you think it went home or taking went Bob fucking boom bah bah what a shitty theory that is the Big Bang is the shittiest Theory ever and I'm not a scientist and I'm clearly I'm retarded but and I know that there's some evidence supposedly that some big explosion happened 14 billion years but that they have no idea why everything was smaller than the head of a pin what are you talking about so wait a minute everything was smaller than the head of it but why was it small that we don't know we don't know but we do believe there was an infant point where the whole universe was falling on the head of a pin I know why it's the weirdest fucking conversation ever that's like someone said it best it might have been McKenna I think Terence Mckenna said it's as if they're asking you just believe in magic only once right they've recently figured out a way to get subatomic particles to move faster than light so that's what they believe they've accomplished now so that brings it was just really a week ago that scientists were saying time travel is impossible because the speed of light cannot be surpassed all right then like a couple weeks later these guys say they got subatomic particles to move faster and like time travels open again so that's the implication yeah time share was the big implication because once they figure out how to actually a minute it would require demesne amount of power but just think about it what powers your cell phone today and what was like to have those you know Apollo 11 computers when they filled entire room and they weren't nearly as powerful as your cell phone right and your cell phone it's not even plugged in anything it's in your fucking pocket - can you explain what that it I know it Thanks maybe you can because I don't understand it they will blast it - neutrinos or something and the neutrinos were they reached where they were supposed to reach a few milliseconds before they should have reached it or something that's a huge question so let's let's look it up on Google because I'm not the person to answer this and also I don't think they've totally confirmed it yet oh I think a lot of people are still saying that there's a high likelihood for some kind of error and the experiment of course and well everybody's gonna say that anyway when something's that crazy yeah no you know when someone says uh I figured out time-traveling bitch did you figure out Luisito papers you didn't figure out time trust me a paper bitch yeah I was thinking about time travel if there really was a time traveler then they could follow somebody by walking in front of them wow that's uh yeah cuz you would know where they were going already so you could walk in front of them on what everybody has to have like a really fucking detailed list of all the shit that's already gone down you'd have to see it you'd have to send a time probe back first to like watch them and watch the whole world observe whoever you want to run out of time you die you die of old age no if you want it you can sit you could like it you know if you wanted to observe like Thomas Jefferson or something right which would be incredible yeah right to get real videos of the founding fathers who would you go to if you had if you had a just an open ticket back in time clearly the first person I visit is Jesus no hold on Jesus or Buddha Jesus or Buddha that's a tough choice I think I died no is the first human I want to visit the first human I guess the first human you would want to see cavemen on the field yeah I think that if I mean if I had to a bunch of chances that's the first thing I'd like to see then I move up to Buddha and then um I don't know alright here's a here's what is the research clearly shows that when a total of 15,000 beams of neutrinos were fired the tiny particles traveled the seven hundred thirty kilometer two point four three millisecond trip roughly 60 nanoseconds faster than light wow that's fast is that that's that's just--that's period that's not they think so that's it yeah it's a by saying that this is Sauron that's putting this out so that's it so who knows CERN is folksy erm look it up it's the people that are responsible for the Large Hadron Collider which is the the craziest scientific experiment ever that's going on right now I believe it's in Switzerland right yeah I'm sweet underground fuck incredible gigantic particle collider that is supposed to uncover this thing called the Higgs boson particle which they call or excuse me Posen people correct medicine my apologies bosun the god particle yeah but now they're saying there's 95 percent sure that doesn't exist yeah fuck too bad you know you imagine that they built this gigantic fucking billion dollars when they obviously finding out a bunch of other shit oh yeah I'll take time traveler or some stupid particle well who knows what that particle means they did create that cork gluon plasma shit that's I believe it's one sugar cube is like four hundred billion pounds or something fucking crazy but that's what it weighs they created some incredibly negligible amount you know some tiny thank goodness yeah don't want a lot of that shit laying around imagine if they made like a marble sized chunk of it just drop through the earth just shot right like water and core like water the earth would just be like a big droplet of water I wonder how much weight it would take for that to happen like it for sure if you had a bowling ball full of this quark-gluon cosmic shit yeah that shit would just go right through the right to the earth a bowling ball would have to be some insane amount of weight yeah it would be yeah I don't know what the way it would be at someone should know I don't know if I'm wrapping your head around something there's that dense think about like a fat person you look at like think about fat James from the Condor store no fat James Lovelock James a great guy calls himself fat James Fox yeah office it's it's his nickname it's fat James who calls you hey it's Fat James yeah um that you think about him as a human easy not a tall fellow but he's fairly heavy and you look into wow that's a that's a lot of weight right there that's a model now think about if he was a quark-gluon plasma you know I'm saying I mean yeah even wrap your head around that yeah sugar cube is Sheriff 14 billion or 400 billion fucking pounds per over-the-hill yeah whatever insane I mean when you say 40 billion and 400 billion I mean I know that it's there's a big difference in those two numbers but to me none of them even register I'm just mad at noises with my mouth I don't write 40 billion means or 400 billion means that to me is like it's too abstract it's too big I'm not assimilating that you know but to think about that James made out of this stuff you can't even like how is that even possible that there could be two types of matter that are both some they're so far different from each other that they could be the same size and one of them would be literally the weight of the fucking earth probably not that much yeah it's it's insane to think about that and it's insane to think that these people are down there tinkering around under Switzerland trying to make this shit that's creepy well they make a little tiny amounts of it you know they've got a great sense of humor about it they dress up like the half-life dudes and they've like tape half pictures of them pretending to be the characters in half-life yeah because we don't know the the video game half-life was all about scientists cracking a hole in the universe and aliens come over fuck everybody up awesome game what an awesome game that is but dude I like to think about one thing I like to think about is the Large Hadron Collider accident like what it would look like and like the way I see it it goes like this you're on the internet you look on wherever you go CNN and it says fire at Large Hadron Collider that's the first thing you see oh my god that sucks no it doesn't we there was an explosion underground that's it then like five minutes later it's like this fire is spreading like no fire we've ever seen before like the fires you sir were all of a sudden just racing through Switzerland no one understands what's spreading that fast and I'm like what the fuck and then the next thing you think is what's that you're just gone because this fucking energy beam is shot around the planet in like a millisecond just wiped everything out that's that now I know I've eaten too much pot because inevitably my mind will start going to the large house not getting getting nervous about the Large Hadron Collider have you eaten two inch pots today no you're okay totally fine you're totally fun how much does that cook you take just a crumb I didn't even open oh yeah I took a crumb good move yeah I'm not I've even fucked up so many times yeah you know I'm a hundred percent for marijuana legalization but I think you should at least have to read a book or watch a documentary before you even those cookies yes you don't know what the fuck you're getting it I could eat a cookie it's just a cookie it's no big deal man I'm gonna eat the whole cookie those cookies are crippling sometimes sometimes cuz you don't know what how many there's no standard dose like when you get a cookie and it says 2x what the fuck does that mean you know two doses two doses for who-who X is three X's I don't know what this fucking you're using a porn system for this shit you're using the form rating system dude I had a 1 a 1 bite of a very small cookie this cookie was only like the size of us not even just slightly larger than a quarter yeah it was a small cookie I took a little bite out of it I said let's just be careful I'll take a little bite out of it an hour later I literally went whole body was tailing I want to just lie down a carpet and make like carpet angels I was it screamed I mean roaring roaring through the tunnels of reality clinging to the earth as it spins a thousand miles an hour I was gone all I could think of is what the fuck would happen if I took that whole cookie I couldn't even keep my eyes what would happen I was like this I was like cuddling with myself on the couch I was past it yeah meanwhile the phone rang and I picked up the phone hello I was talking to a buddy line yeah what's up dude no everything's cool all right yeah yeah no I'm just getting some writing done all right man I'll talk to you bye click oh yeah back into it I could talk on the phone like I could I could be okay I was functioning yeah but I was thinking what if I took that whole fucking cookie yeah that's funny though that thing you just said about how that part of your mind the part of your mind that like clicks back in then like no matter how deep the psychedelic experience is there is a party-line puts a flashlight in your eyes yeah dude we're cool what's our yeah everything's fine sir yeah it's very strange how your mind can do that no matter how far out you get it's very it's a it's a curiosity like there's a story about that Ron Goss talks about this lady call them because she was on orange sunshine which was apparently back in the 60s it was like that ultimate LSD it was like this legendary acid and she called him and said you know I've I have you know I've gone I've took too much orange sunshine I'm going completely insane I don't know what to do and he's like okay well can you put the person on you thought that they should call me and pick up the phone and dialed it because that's how I want to talk to you right now cuz it's like her she was logical enough to not a dial a phone and call and talk she was making logical decisions she had just decided to allow herself to be the crazy person for a second you know there's always that's that's what I'm saying is it's like there's always the observer there's always the part of yourself that's watching you go into whatever are the experiences that you're going into whether it's a psychedelic experience whether it's a traumatic life experience there's always the part of you that's just kind of watching it just depends on who you want to identify with at any given moment you know so you know when you get angles so easier said than done though when you're talking about someone going on bad trip because when you go on a bad trip you could feel utterly helpless right the the crazy thing about psychedelics is that you have to you have to release yourself to them you must submit in order to take in the experience correctly you've got to submit or you gotta take doses where you have no choice yes you know and those are that's better [Laughter] yeah I know it yeah that was as honest as you could have been yes that's a better thing because when you have to surrender that involves like this choice to die it's like but still the bad trips occur and the reason why the bad trips occurs because you're fighting it right a bad trips can occur for a lot of different reasons yeah it so quite often it's ego death you're desperately trying to keep yourself from blinking out of existence yeah you've your ego kicks in and does the exact same thing that happens when someone's dying I used to but me so it makes sense to you then that you know you would be feeling like you're going crazy you'd be terrifying oh no sure isn't it the reason the real problem that there's no one to guide people on these experiences know like really seasoned professionals that measure the dose in a clinical setting and like you know like could you imagine how much help people could get from that sort of an environment dude you've helped me I've talked to you on the phone I'm way to I and you've inevitably made me feel better just from like talking to you because I'll calling out if I'm freaking yeah I don't remember this specific time but I know that I've called you and just started talking about some terrible idea I have about it like imminent war or something like some awful thing I'm getting paranoid about and you're really gonna be like that's not gonna happen you're fine that's everything's fine and it just takes that it's just one confident person be like dude everything's gonna be really great you don't have to worry about anything and you'll feel better so yeah you're right there needs to be these people especially that's not even someone you know who knows what they're doing that's just a friend you just called up a friend and it seemed normal yeah but if you were getting dosed up by a professional yeah and I was because I think look like I said I do think that everything should be legal I mean I think there's horrible consequences to make crack and heroin illegal and if you want to keep those illegal um you know I'm not gonna fight you I'm not gonna fight my math I'm not gonna fight I don't think it should be easy to get math and I think you the people who make math for sure you should fucking put them in a cage yeah some asshole let's get someone addicted some horrible fucking chemical that's from cold syrup and shit and just completely fucks your world up but when it comes to other stuff when it comes to like mushrooms or ayahuasca or all you these these things have to be released to the public totally they have to sure if they don't get released to the public society suffers yeah society is more lost society is less introspective society is more prone to patterns yeah it's like closing a library it's a type of library you're not like letting people into not just a library but perhaps a source of inspiration of knowledge of wisdom it might even be another fucking life form you know somebody corrected me on Twitter the other day about something about we were talking about mushrooms being plants and it was like actually mushrooms not a plan it's a fungus it's a totally different lights life source isn't it its own Kingdom it's its own Kingdom and not only that they're closer to animals and they are the plants right and you know when when you talk about giant super organisms the whole Pacific Northwest apparently there's some giant mushroom colony and the Pacific Northwest that's all considered you know it's under the its mycelium or whatever the fuck it is it's considered one large organism and it's one of the biggest organisms on the on the planet it's like a fucking sperm whale of mushrooms I think it's bigger than a sperm I mean I think it's like it's like isn't it miles or something and something crazy like that but yeah it is a life form and McKenna had this rap about mushrooms that not only did he think that mushrooms were the catalyst for humans evolving from lower primates but he also thought that mushrooms came from another planet because the because the fact that spores could survive in a vacuum and the structure of yeah what is it 5p there's like it's called a fox for Loxy and and dimethyl truth right and he said something about the phosphorus in it more positions yeah the only one like it on the planet right there's nothing like that mushroom on the planet and yet it mimics human neural chemistry I mean if and and dimethyltryptamine is produced in the human body and and it's in the blood-brain barrier and they think it's responsible for dreams and all that shit and this stuff has it in it I mean it is that is part of what it is and if it really did come from another planet imagine if you know all of our ideas about intelligent life are based on the ability to manipulate carbon to build ability to manipulate carbon matter but what if a mushroom is a life-form that has evolved so far that it doesn't need a form anymore it doesn't need to move and the way it gets you is you eat it and you can't kill it it fucking fly through space on an asteroid right it gets knocked off a one pant planet and travels four billion light-years to another one and lands there you know in it starts up a new fucking colony of mushrooms and they grow and they grow where people are they don't grow in the middle of nowhere then I define they're on grass lawns yeah how long's where people always are yeah they're always around people man right there's people there's mushrooms that's a weird thing that's a weird thing the idea that it's a life form a life form from another planet that came in on an asteroid and that that's how it's the theory of panspermia that that that's how life is seated throughout the universe what's the word pence period at school yeah the idea is that the universe is seeded by asteroid impacts hitting planets and knocking off you know amino acids and the building blocks of life and in somehow or another some sort of a chemical reaction with another planet and also comets carrying water and the water comes and in life is and it's you know and it goes from one planet to the other and that's the idea is we're seeded by asteroids yeah that I mean that idea I've heard I've heard McKenna's idea in it and when you're tripping it definitely does seem like you are getting some kind of transmission from something you're getting not even a transmission to me to me when I'm really gone it feels like I'm in something alright I'm a part of it you know like I'm it's not a transmission I'm in this I'm up my whatever your consciousness truly is outside of cells and fingernails whenever your your your inner consciousness is this thing took me to another place and so the physical body that I exist and move around and literally didn't exist and I was inside this other place it's an experience that's not like it's not like a transmission you know it's almost like more like a chemical gateway feeling and you know we talked about this before the podcast that it could just be your sense it's fucking with you when you're whacked out on drugs it's already it could be that your senses everybody senses work the same way take this whacked-out drug and everybody gets a reaction the same way but I don't think it is um and even if it is it's more fun to think that it's not there's no evidence to prove oh yes facts I let's stick with it because it's more empowering it's more fascinating I like to believe in magic you know I don't to believe in too much magic but I like to believe that mushrooms are magic I like to believe that DMT is magic I like to believe with the weed it's magic I really believe weed is magic it sounds stupid but listen I'm talking about it in a silly utilitarian way in a way that's functional and easy to use without delving too deeply into what the wheat is when I smoke weed all the sudden I get ideas I smoke weed and also not have ideas right what is that if that's not magic I don't know what the fuck is all the things come to you from the burning of a plant you burn a plant you take in its essence West yeah introspective thoughts start worrying about your own behavior studying yourself looking at the world differently thinking about Aloud's no strange clouds are man they're just floating above us there's moisture in them all right where's that coming from that will you're whacked out man killing your brain cells man yes your brain cells dying that's the first time your brain cells are dying as you start having brilliant thoughts you remember that this is your brain on drugs like with the egg in a glove at any point time to get high and debate that guy the war on drugs vo guy no-nonsense guy ya see this is your brain this you're bringing out Bill Hicks had a great bit about well every comic at the time had a great yeah about that Bill Hicks had a particularly brilliant one about that but how preposterous it was you know remember those commercials that came on after 9/11 where a guy was a no-nonsense guy in a steak house with a suit on eating salad and his friend was like the silly man and his friend were like man you can't tell me that you know if I smoke pot I'm supporting terrorism yes I can he's eating eating the lettuce you know why cuz it's true that's a dry shot like the no-nonsense man with a suit on I'm eating a salad I'll tell you right now mister the drugs that you support terrorism they're selling marijuana fuck man they're the most retarded there's no logic to them they appeal to the weakest of emotions the desire to be this fat douchebag eat mistakes out there you know so you know with a suit on and a ruttin I'm a no-nonsense man was Bob's always working that's right a disciplined businessman because it's truly nonsense you know what's fucking true you know else is a no-nonsense man that fucking pig in New York who maced those women he netted did you see that shit that fucking beefy piece of shit there's like these two apparently out there there's these two distinctions and the police there are what they're calling the white collar police and the blue collar police the guys in the blue suits are apparently just being police and they're cool but they're these violent kind of like thug pigs out there who have been like grabbing people who aren't doing anything and I saw the video of the girls getting mace did you see that video yeah it looks like does the girl try to pull down the barrier and then he just maces or Azote happen hi oh no no I watched it a bunch of times and I didn't see her do that and if she did do that even then I don't think you can we can't mace but he didn't just miss her amazed it amazed amazed it amazed a bunch of them for no reason and then he's kind of like skittered off he did like it you came in did it and then tried to sneak away they got a picture of the son of a bitch it's on you can look it what's the name of that thing it's Occupy Wall Street is that what it's called on that site Occupy Wall Street org I think there's a picture of the guy they got a picture of them and they're trying to find them because they've got lawyers who are volunteering to help the people get out of jail and help the people who are like they've already arrested 100 people and what are they doing they're protesting what see that's they're protesting the idea they're protesting the the fact that 1% of the people on the planet control the resources and they're going to Wall Street because that's a that seems to be like the locus of all this like greed there's great video there's video of like these really like rich people sitting out on a balcony drinking champagne and toasting the protesters all these like super Richie Rich is out there just watching them like they're like fucking with them yeah kind of really yeah you know like their novelty it's like look oh look at the protesters this is what I keep hearing I keep hearing that no one's covering this in the mainstream news I keep hearing that but then I'm looking at Bloomberg comm it's on there it's on business inside they just I think they've started covering it yeah they have to yeah those people are starting to get arrested yeah that's it is that what it is but I don't know the real number of people that that are out there right now III would love to know that this is fascinating this is a new movement yep and it's happening right now I mean if you're if you're in New York you could go down there right now bring them a sandwich because they got to be hungry man a lot of these kids they don't look like they don't they've been out there for eight days nearly a hundred people have been arrested for protesting in and around Wall Street during what some are calling the Arab Spring of the United States outraged oh wow that's scary these Arab countries outraged over the way that the political and financial worlds and managed protesters calling themselves the 99% have gathered to share their grievances with the top 1% of America and demand change well I don't understand why it's illegal to protest I thought protesting was always legal is it you're you have to get a permit to protest and not these people don't have permits as though it is I think that they said they did get her I don't know I'm sure I wouldn't be surprised if there was like they didn't have a permit seems gross that you should need to get permission to protest it seems like there should be some sort of a right but I don't know if you should be able to do it on someone's property like if you're blocking them fucking traffic yeah that should Senoia I mean yeah but it does seem to go counter to the idea of a protest which is like can I have your permission to protest you're just supposed to protest yeah I mean look it's something I you know I support them they're doing something you know they're out there beating the drum they're letting everybody know where we are pissed off yeah but to say it it's like that it's like an Arab Spring the United States that's fascinating well people are see I mean it's like people this whole thing of like 1% of the fucking population having all the shit it's like at some point that that can't work anymore like if you're on another let's imagine were on an island and one there's like 10 people on the island and one person on the island has control of all the bananas it's like you got to share the bananas man it got us you got to pass the bananas around I don't care you got them right and the ideas that you look at the end of the day you're using up the earth's resources if you're especially if you're talking like some big gigantic corporation you're dancing up a gigantic chunk of the earth's resources which you know really an all fairness should be distributed equally everyone all the people on the planet yeah we just don't have the technology yet to do it and and also a lot of the people who this the resources would get distributed to are fucking idiots so that is a real problem because a lot of people are not had the quizzes that our education system is crapped so people have been being like brought up through a really crappy education system not all the schools are terrible but a lot of them that these kids they have way too many kids are you gonna teach a classroom of 60 fucking kids many of them in like who are living in poverty and their parents or drug addicts how are you gonna do that you'd have to be Superman to pull that off so it's like that you're dealing with like people who haven't been educated and people who are hopeless and so the real question is let's imagine that all the 1% that these people are protesting suddenly like more like you know what we're gonna distribute our wealth how do you do that like how would you even do it anyway like what's the how do you how do you solve the problem I don't know but they're saying we have to do something that's what I'm saying they're right you know they're right the system is completely fucked up it doesn't work it's not it doesn't make sense that you you like the whole idea of the financial system you know the whole idea of when you start talking about banks and economics and know manipulating things again and then things get so weird when you talk about like interest rates and they can't talk about taxes and you talk about the distribution of the money where does the tax when they're going or yeah when you break all these numbers down then you realize that these numbers only represent numbers you know they don't represent a fucking bag of gold somewhere nope they don't represent anything of like real value it's like numbers so then when someone has you know fucking 18 billion dollars or something crazy yeah and then you you you examine them and you go what did you do well I move numbers I move numbers around and I made billions of dollars moving all these numbers and buying and selling numbers and agreeing and and and Graham Hancock share cool powerful all right folks that's the end of this one and we'll be right back in about 15 minutes cuz he's gonna eat some food but thank you and sorry we'll be back
