Tony Montana yeah yeah that guy who played it was that guy's name who played Escobar in narc and narcos he's an Italian actor yes I got mad that he wasn't he yeah great fine Colombian speak Spanish when he took that role Oh Portuguese Portuguese so close though yeah I mean like alien friends who could speak a little bit of peakins BAM you can pick up on say thanks but I feel like Italian is closer to Spanish definitely closer than Portuguese is it cuz I took both your house I don't think Latin language it isn't real yeah but sure it's definitely like if someone gets like going in Portuguese oh yes man you don't have they done notes they have the fucking thing Portuguese is beautiful they have a such a song to it so I guess things I always listen to guys talk Wow Laura yeah

going around that plane they're like what you guys think Russians do shit they just the Mormons yeah yeah yeah well there's a Mormon cup there's a couple of Mormon colonies that left America in the 1800s when they made polygamy illegal and including by the way homeboy from fucking Massachusetts the guy running for president what the fuck's his name I do it's on the tip of my tongue was a brilliant guy but could never be president because he was born in Mexico Mitt Romney's family's from Mexico because they're part of the original clan that left the clan of Mormons that wanted a fuck eighty wives and so they moved across the border and they developed these colonies and so they they they literally have armed guards to stop them from the cartel plays the in the cartel just assassinated these women and children fuck man nine people just gunned him down yeah the guy Popeye from that show one of the worse he's still out and does tours of the Cathedral all those places and he will put a gun to your head a loaded gun first let you take a picture oh he killed Jesus so many people oh my so many people died in a gun selfie with that guy oh he's a celebrity that I when I was in Australia I was fucking wasted and I came out of some bar I was with my my tour manager really up bodies at Hells Angel guy I'm fucking stumbling out of a bar and this guy comes up with a gun and he goes hey Burt can you take a picture holding a gun to my head and I was like yeah I just took a picture with holding a gun to his head my 20 minutes like what the fuck are you doing I was like oh

they're here see what happened with the cartel in Mexico where they had El Chapo's son they had him arrested and then the fucking cartel got in a shootout with Mexico that was this year yeah yeah and they released him yeah yeah yeah at some point you gotta be like this isn't worth it yeah well what was really crazy you know I've got this guy Edie Calderon has been on my podcast before he's coming on again he's he's one of the guys that works with the Mexican military to deal with situations that are caused by the cartel yeah and he said that there was a situation with Trump because Trump was saying that they were gonna treat the Mexican cartel like a terrorist organization and they were gonna literally because those Mormons got killed yeah and they were gonna start like literally a military operation to go after the cartel so this is at least on the Tagus on the table at least on the table and they were talked out of it by the Mexican government I wonder what what type of firepower they actually have they must have tanks that's I'm saying like like people think yeah people think like well they definitely have some big guns and I bet they have shit that you billion it's like yes billions billions hundreds of billions of dollars yeah who knows how much money them yeah I mean imagine if you're like the the middleman between the cartel and you know whatever Saudi arms dealer and you just like we can't sell you stuff and they're like here's fucking 16 billion dollars how crazy is Sean Penn I was just thinking that Han went down there to write an article for Rolling Stones what went and met with El Chapo and he's one of the reasons why I'll chop I got caught man the reason they'll chop ago oh yeah bro wouldn't be the reason he got caught because they followed him as he went with the actress El Chapo loved this Mexican actress and he was like I want to meet her so gonna be panning around with El Chapo I want that shit so bad I wouldn't love to meet like Kim

my shit until I get this to the studio because of these goddamn bidets yeah those the toilet seats with the laser but oh my god it's amazing it's amazing warm water squirting up your butthole you mean you gotta know I'm slipping I've you ordered it to I have it I just have a stall yeah I'm just I've used jurors yeah yeah someone have it at home and then I'm home for like 10 days and then you go on the road you're like a monster fucking mom smear and shit you're not even cleaning and no the when I got my Brazilian wax I remember the first time I thought it was like my asses were class you for clapping yeah you the first person ever say because no one's ever can relate to that and I've always said man my farts were so fucking loud that's cuz your other friends or grown-ups lost species hey do you let the water on the bidet go into your asshole sometimes I have to shit and then it goes out you didn't like almost like flush it out if I have a shit that's kind of halfway stuck I'm gonna take a shit and then I said I cleaning I'm like I think there's more up there and so I'll just really concentrate that jet right in my butthole right yikes it's like there was a castaway there's like some hidden shit that was trying to hang out in there yep and then it just makes I love that it breaks the o-ring yeah take a like I think a sloppy shit you're like oh and then you let it run a full cycle sign then you wipe and there's something still there when I wipe sometimes I pipe it with hair and this the width of the smear is so disgusting there's a shower oh yeah well straight to shower shit showers of you should shower go with know wiping know what you're fine because it's too much I don't want shit in the floor and you're not cleaning it good though you know what on the floor yeah shit bacteria on your floors tell me story once about how he had to take a shit so he took a shit in the in the bathtub and then he had to smoosh it with his foot to get it go down the drain and all wouldn't go down it doesn't apply the toilet he used to leave logs in detention come look at this and he used to in there no no his when he was really big it could be pushed him from front all the way back there so his yeah it's would leave they would lit they would land on the beach in front of the water they didn't land on the water so they never really flushed palm I guess so you just see them he send me photos taxis texting like a fucking ninth grader yeah yeah pictures everything dude my shits in Columbia from all the just the greasy oily bond way lows and teacher on it was the consist for so many times a day and it was this consistent just probably helps myself sir like it was like if you fed a puppy too many treats bro am I put when Marcia was a puppy the one thing that happens to some dogs is when they're babies that try to eat their shit and so he was shitting and trying to eat it at the same time so he'd spin around a circle and try to bite it as it was coming out of the hole while he was trying to eat it right out yeah right out of his ass that Joey told me one time that he was about shitting in the shower he's like yeah it's great I did all the time I was like fucking shit in the shower he's like yeah cuz the man amazing if it's like a log I just shit and then I just toss it to the toilet he said those practices he ever doing that piece of paper you go yeah can you miss of missing that he said that I go use did you stop that's so fucking revolting did you say he goes I had to my wife saw me do it one time I'm living in the bathtub I farted once in the bin this in the shower and I shit all over the place I was in that shower for like a half an hour and then I squirt shampoo left and then I came back in just to get a fresh smell of it yeah cuz you know you don't you know all factory senses are weird because they don't detect smell they detect changes in smell that's right that's why people in Pennsylvania who lived near those cattle ranches it'll smell it they don't smell shit anymore right see you got like my parents used to live in wilkes-barre Pennsylvania nice to go to dry drive to visit them from the city oh my god is a stretch that you drive it's all just cattle ranch is just horrible fucking smell I'll be there on the pretty boy tour it smells like what to be happy there it smells like death and shit because two things that are happening there slaughterhouses and fucking and and cow shit yeah so you just get this look that methane stuff that they talk about like being a contributor to greenhouse gases that's fucking legit 100% and apparently you can they can do something about that if they just add a certain amount of sea weed to a cow's diet this is my mind so smell is it's the change in smell that you notice it's not the smell right that's why people stink don't notice these things that's also why when you smoke a joint you don't notice it but everybody else around you they come oh my god you guys are high as fuck they go room why smell weed what any people can live at any of you homes no peace bronze curry it's not bad food tonight I love Indian food first time I ever had I never had Indian food when I was in Russia we got lap dances from these strippers and they had all eaten Indian food I'd never I'd never smell curry before so I'd only grow up in Florida we didn't have an Indian restaurants and I lived in Tallahassee and had the smell was so disgusting I was like these are the most disgusting smelling women I've ever been with cut to like probably 15 years later I'm having dinner with my wife first time I ever had Indian food and they bring it out while we walk in the restaurant and I go blows my mind it's just the change in smell but you know when you fart yeah right senses are designed to detect changes you're not your body your brain sends a signal to you that to be ready moment and that's why it doesn't affect you as much as someone else's know you something about your right this fucking is blowing my mind right yeah that's why people that smell don't know they smell well there's also a thing about your farts that smell good to you because if there's something in your body it's like there's something in your brain triggers like that you're having a relief it's like there's a buildup and then you smell the smells like ah because it signifies the relief that you know that feeling means a fart so when you're in your car and you fart and then you start wafting the smell up to you like oh not bad in a pillow and take it to the face you never fart in your bed and your wife is in the bathroom you're like oh my god I got a pillow out hey do me a favor that person check out I know what I do is I do more theatrical stuff do things like I'll do like leg kicks as I fart or I'll pull my leg back like I'm changed my diaper composition she doesn't like it at all she doesn't like it at all my mom today farted for like like your mom did when you caught her in the kitchen the yams look to you look you need to take her to a doctor oh I'm telling you today today she broke it easily and I go watch you fucking tell me so I can record it she was give me 150 thousand dollars let's see this let's see this oh yeah Go Go good for the beginning hold a hope before you play were you just randomly filming her you want honey was coming were you no no here's what's happened I I said something about I go yeah you think you have one and she didn't she thought we were just like bantering you think you have one fart yeah yeah and I and like as I saw her just turn and I go oh I think she might and you know the beauty of these things I was like pull it out and I just hit the camera from the lock screen and then she didn't know let me hear this this is the look on her face when she turns around she sees that camera player she's smiling right there she's smiling anymore oh and I made merch don't say oh my god she's the Argentinian she's Peruvian that's Alaric that's what

Catherine Bach did not have an ask and I heard when I heard baby got back and this is how white I am I was like we do you like big act like it was so foreign to me I was like fuck who the fuck likes that well that just shows you how segregated this country is because people would in that when that song came out people black people like people like that well yeah history look everything else stayed the same what girls like girls like guys with big muscles guys were tall six-packs yeah it's all the same yeah but what it would she would say a guy who's like 6 foot 3 with a big chest big arms six-pack and a big hog she's asleep listen we're not talking about your wives we're talking about a girl who has no emotional connection to someone if you asked her yeah it's a trap paper what's effect Ryan Reynolds right right that's what you'd say Jason Momoa some some comedy dude it's the same it was that way in the 70s it's that way now yeah the thing that changed with men is asses yes no was it asses I saw an ass going into Petco yesterday that was fucking insane and I was like I never would have been into that as a kid will you show me here Jamie says Jane Fonda brought it up in the

Crabtree who's a girl Jen Selter is that the girls who got the most insane fucking ass on Instagram but I know he talking about she's one of them but there's there's no one girl anymore there's so many there's a sim plants though yeah that's that's a mess it looks weird to be education girls getting cancer from that implants no good do you hunt do you remember on MTV that had a show called true true life and there's a guy that got calf implants do you remember that by a chance I remember I remember that remember that from True Life and I was like what a fucking like didn't you always like I have someone who's never had all those muscles I would always seek like those guys and be like I'd rather not have it then do with this bird like oh I saw that as such a pathetic thing to do have a foreign body yeah sticking inside of you this the the problem with that is the same thing that happens to some women when they get breast implants that yes answer girls are getting that in their ass now yeah there's there's new instances of ass cancer that are directly caused by these ass implants the ass implants I mean that is obviously probably the more important statistic that I think that I don't think they look good get ass crazy imagine can you ask cancer because you're too lazy to do squats so don't you find that like a it is this but if you don't you find it like almost more permissible forgivable in a way to say like this woman's getting breast implants you go like okay yeah but like if a guy's like oh I got PEC implants yeah fucking push dude I know a dude who had PEC implants he hit a bunch of stuff done I know and I know what I did when I saw him what something that I never do we pat him on the chest and I didn't know he had it surgery the day before and I was like good to see he was like like basically and that's the only reason he no one wants to confess that I think a guy that I know killed himself oh really yeah he was getting a bunch of plastic surgery I'm just killing himself this guy should really up tommy gun oh my god dude it's gross what Tommy Morrison went off the deep end like this after he died he potty yeah hiv-positive he's doing all kinds of crazy drugs and he got PEC implants and they were preposterous Jayma no you're on this look at that look at that oh that's him after we want to fight HIV positive with PEC implants that looks horrible yeah but this is even worse pictures but look at the picture of him when he didn't have him right there right yeah those are PEC implants that's when he didn't have him that's when he fought George Foreman he was fucking jacked when he was young I mean he looked fantastic he punched her Foreman yeah when that fight no um yes he did he beat George Foreman Merkin people he won a decision from over George Foreman which is a substantial victory he's like he's like the chicken of boxing but comic ya know he beat some good guys hey brother yes he did he beat razor Roddick you stopped him dropped him with a big left hook Tom Martin had a nasty left hook he just couldn't win the big fight and he got destroyed by Ray Mercer after rocky look at that picture him after you got arrested see that picture right right next to your cursor above that above that chain right there that's that's him on the right hand side hiv-positive all fucked up oh my god yeah did he ever get it he looked like he was a dog I think he died of AIDS but that was oh my god he was falling apart his life was over I mean he was just 44 yeah yeah he died really young Wow and that was him at 44 he looks like a seven year old man he died at 44 yeah yeah he was not doing good man and he got addicted to all kinds of drugs and was just you know his health fell apart there's not good I wish someone would do a documentary on chicken he got I mean Tommy Morrison got famous for he was a good boxer like a really good boxer and then he got famous from that Rocky movie and then his whole life fell apart he was good in that movie have you remember we were high school in that movies out and we were standing up in the aisles like going come on rock it was a good fucking movie was a good good box it was good actor there's always a thing though right of like if a white boxer is decent great white hope kind of factors Russians yes vadoma Klitschko helped the title forever no one give a fuck right he's not American well they're an American and also they had a kind of a boring style but that's him in the movie but in real life he was a very good boxer up until the time that he did that Rahman but I think was I think pussy was just like they were putting pussy in slingshots and just shoot them yeah I mean he was a handsome guy he was a movie star and people thought that he was gonna be the next heavyweight champion the world and did you ever see the Ray Mercer fight Oh cue that up cuz it's one of the most brutal knockouts just queue up Ray Mercer Kos Tommy Morrison well it is fucking horrible I mean it is one of the worst because he gets tangled in the ropes he keeps head no I was watching with my friend Kevin we were at a bar and we were watching it and just go to the part where he gets ko to the end it's fucking rough man he gets a lot sits he gets before that before that way before that he gets yeah so he gets yeah there it is before just go right before this so Ray Mercer he started getting tired and Ray Mercer catches him in the corner and he unloads on him and Tommy Morrison's arms get tangled in the ropes we can't go down like look at this see he's tangled in the row fuck bro I mean it was one of the worst Kos I ever remember seeing look at that I mean Ray Mercer was a murderer he was an Olympic gold medalist to have late stop referee was scared to get in there and bring Mercer was back then like no-one's cheering why man over a bunch of the one who fought that white M Omega yeah Tim Sylvia I owed him with one punch and that was a rough one too because they were supposed to have a boxing match and Tim Sylvia kicked his leg yeah they both agreed those MMA but we're not gonna kick this is why the Commission wouldn't allow it to be a boxing match because Ray Mercer was a world champion Olympic gold medals and Tim Sylvia did not have a fight or did not have a boxing fight but he was you know a very high level and then a fighter so they just buddy was past his prime so they decided to have they called it an MMA fight Ray Mercer was I think a general agreement I think Ray Mercer was 46 at a time he sees a gentleman's agreement look at the look at his face like come on man like that watch him setting this up bang and then it gets on top of it goes this whole fight takes a few seconds look at this that is a hammer of a punch that's a slow fall and you know it was already way past Tim Sylvia's prime Tim Sylvia when he was young it was a fucking animal he's the one that led his army of broken yes I'm a woman fighting I want to get Frank Mir broke his arm is fine you want to and it was one you could just kind of move up until people like sat in the front you just love just sit there you don't have a baseball game and then uh Tim silver was there and Tate was there with me and he said hi to him and he was wearing his belt and it might my first ever fight he would he had a championship belt and I was like later today it was like are they supposed to like wear their belts out and he goes no he just does that Tim so he wore them everywhere just wears his belt as his belt hey he look man you're the heavyweight champ of the world you do whatever the fuck you want you want to bring that thing everywhere good bring it everywhere that would be an interesting book Ari was to hear maybe you and like the group that you know Joe's experience with MMA has been so different but I would love to hear in an outsider's view as an insider on the growth of MMA how it was but then UFC yeah cuz you you were going to you guys were going to fights oh yeah early days there was a member was it was barbaric you saw some early flights right oh yeah how many fights you think you've been to 30 50 easy he's gonna fights in other countries uh-huh Australia Brazil fucking everywhere everywhere we started there was there was the the weigh-ins was just the fight camps was just the people who were with the fighters like 10 fans yeah I would do that I would announce the weigh-ins there was no one there there's no one I went to away and did fucking ten twelve thousand people went to oh yeah I forget which one I've changed yeah yeah I was like what a change gradual 2005 is really when everything shifted wait if I if we go to that McGregor fight can I go see like oh fuck yo and see everything man come with me yeah I've never been I feel like someone said you know a lot about MMA I go I know a lot of names I know like I know I know everything it seems like never been whatever are there fun that's crazy even one you should take an edible yeah yeah do this six hours yeah yeah six hours hey yeah well this is the best one this is Ari and Duncan making out because they knew the cameras on and watch this Bing here we go and I went one not knowing what to expect at all it's not being there definitely is an experience it's not slightly different my favorite part always is when they play the top now who song but in between the prelims and them and away in the end it's like oh my god yeah yeah yeah they play thing is about a fight is is that like a fight is inherently you know exciting but the energy of those arenas oh yeah exit Mena the one in Toronto where was 55,000 were you at that one the craziest ones I ever went to was Rio and Columbus Columbus is like Tim Sylvia fought Captain America Oh II fought Randy that's yeah no one thought Randy would win and then he won rain it was rock time early in the round yeah yeah it's with the energy oh yeah you go I can't go cuz I'll be in Hawaii wahoo Maui and Kauai great yeah that's where the Blue Note yeah that's a great club you know I Blue Note is there any idea man I'll go back and do that you're in a wife where's blue nose in Hawaii I mean I don't know it's

every year from aspirin aspirin yeah 150 people died this legend gained momentum after 2002 work oh that's what it acts yeah this statistic is often been contrasted with a number of shark caused

gone look at this it's hitting on the face look at he still hangs in there look at this part look at this feeling he's got woo right yes I've had that coming off stage before but I can't be like that it can use also 47 and still able to do this which is incredible because so you guys I want to think that for high level athletics like this that is competing against 22 year old yeah that's about as high as you get Jake he knows like halfway through this like oh this is on the this is on the pace right now for perfection you got to see this 24/7 because he talks about he talked about getting out and line up and going like sometimes the way of just don't show up you can't change that right and then sometimes you go fuck it I gotta roll the dice this is looks like a shit wave and it may be I'm a fuck me over but I'm gonna this is obviously they're my words but and then he's like I'm gonna do it and then on this thing he pulls out like a fucking 9 on a wave and then everyone's like what the fuck he still got it but it's really crazy man that wave I saw that cut just watch that thing and Andrew Schultz is a big surfer and he else is a server hard core bro he went in New York he had long beach people stuff in Long Beach and he moved out to LA to go to school up in Santa Barbara to go surfing that was his goals like I'll surf every day and then he got out there was like fuck this I don't give me Kelly Slater like gets the perfect 10 and all his competition is like 22 year old guys and they're like you're a legend now you're legend he's like you should see the fucking three girls I fucked this morning all right man nice to meet you but like he still is doing crazy shit right like he he's fucking bangin models oh brother uh-huh no he's got a check he's got a check beautiful check well yeah I mean you seen Kelly Slater with hair have you ever seen Kelly's head with air is he more handsome bro pull up a picture of fucking little young like that fuck boy in a good way you know like he was before the podcast he's not gonna enjoy are you shitting me this is movie star looks that's the problem look at that fuckin picture it's amazing when you're that handsome that you get anything done yeah that's a problem with really really good-looking guys they're slaying so much oh he was in Baywatch he was at least I might be that handsome bastard with Pamela Anderson back when she was Pamela Anderson Kapow before she was fuckin Julian Assange and an embassy somewhere you think they were boning well I'm sure once you see how a lot fuck'em oh she did and she's you ever see her on the view just laying down the fuckin truth to those ladies and they treated her like a model and she was like no no I've actually researched a bunch of information I like to talk about it was pretty fucking cool well the view they should do a fantasy campus you could fuck the view is this but they talk about like serious shit and people take them seriously take them real seriously yeah but there's two more and they're cackling over each other and yelling to each other and telling each other to calm down here's the thing is though they're not even friends that's what's weird about that show that'll never work it's work doesn't really I mean the conversations are gross and then a big fight that was like a big one but they always do it they have like the blonde lady who's a Republican I mean how many times the football players what Elizabeth Hasselhoff but I was thinking about the other one McCain McCain girl Megan McCain now that's the new one that's me always have the blonde there will be I always have liked it before it was Whoopi it was Whoopi always there that Barbara Walters was there the Rosie O'Donnell Rosie O'Donnell was there for a long time she would abound Sherri Shepherd funny to think of what goes in to producing the view and like what it what it is right it's people talking but but I'm saying you think of like the production the people that make up the the grips the sound people or the producers taken notes that and then like you're doing the same like this is the same thing you know I mean like the conversation is happening but without all the nonsense yeah we all yes yeah that's the difference between TV and this well I bet that show would be better if you just left them it was definitely would be there's no commercial it also be more popular probably let's put it there is it it's been on for a long what do you think like he gets on an average day I think more than like sitcoms like a couple million views no more I think it's like all these housewives at home with nothing to do with a dumb boy 5 million viewers probably I'm get 5 million viewers I said 20 let's do this fuck it yes this is not 20 let's flip it the other way okay how about this could you add from what they have their business model that would increase would would be would better your show I know one I know one they could put makeup on my head so it won't be so shiny oh you know the viewers you do you find it or no last month they averaged about 2.6 million so I guess that's a purse show her show the difference is that how many people are fans and how many people just flip with your channel there's nothing else so on yeah I see I've seen episodes of you I've watched a bet you have I definitely have like when normals are important or Donald Trump that was the best episode of normal or says is the right at one point says I've never had consensual sex with a woman no he just got tripped up in his word to news on this apology tour and he was like it was it was right as that said this is the stage his it's right as his Netflix show is about to air and he gets in big trouble he because he's on stir no no no no loss started over he he defends Lois first okay and then and then and lows rose and then he goes on Stern and when he's Stern and when he's on sorry instead of saying like like you'd have to be retarded it's a likely to laugh at this or to think this he'd be like you'd have to have down syndrome thank you saying like that's better because I think down syndrome is okay to say but routed is bad cuz it's night so he's like he says in a bunch nor and they're about to launch the show so of course like you know everybody involved is like panicking like leader you have a new show launching you got it you got it so he goes on the view and he's like yeah it's like yeah and he is I'm like you can see you can mute this and watch this he is eating mints like as he had popping them in his mouth and he's like bad about that consensual sex with a girl consensual sex with the girl egos why would I and they're like I think you're miss being norm you see you see him on your on date he's like he's like this so I feel real bad about that he's fuckin wild man I was just talking to Adam about this do you remember the time you came we can't tell the full story cuz I think I normally comforted with it do you remember the time right before the election where you had a vape pen that was really strong and norm came back yes no what did he say it was it was the funniest fucked up he was not ready for this yeah well guys like that don't smoke weed a lot they just do it occasionally I think they remember what weed is right this way that they're fucking with today is a different animal yes it's two in the pen so innocuous it's just vaporizing English yeah but it was it was hash oil in Japan it was fucking it was nuclear God I smoked with him one time in a parking lot in Irvine right before I was with Ryan Sickler Ryan always has good weed Arum and we met norm and we were about to go in and he smoked dude he's like such a comfortable comic like with any like you know he doesn't need like handing some time alone to get my mind right before this yeah they were in the parking lot he takes a fucking monster hit of strong wheat and he starts coughing like coughing enough to make like you know like a tear come really cool and then we walk into the Irvine improv and they're announcing him he just walks onstage and he just starts talking about the soda he's drinking and killing with it like just off the top of his head just totally not look comfortable he's one of the funniest guys ever hit stand-up changed the way I did this next special though this next special was like bit like because I love those guys that grow you know that when you see them it's not they're not doing they're like there's nothing wrong with it but they're doing the exact same type of stuff they did in the last one they're just changing the names a little bit and I looked at I called Stanhope maybe one of the most mind-bending days of Stan's they just when you said that smell thing or use your brain goes baby what the fuck I called Stanhope one day it was like hey what you doing he was like drinking a vodka grape suit trying to grape grape juice grapefruit juice trying to write a knock-knock joke I was like what here's again I'm thinking of funny scoops you know try and write a knock-knock joke we gotta be as funny as those guys right I was like yeah and he goes so we could write one couldn't we here's the guy let me tell you what I got he's like reads a couple knock-knock jokes and I was like yeah why the fuck aren't we fucking with the format and then norm I seen norman norm has the best joke I'm gonna tell you the joke is that great it's the best is he still doing it no no norm there's this this for me was like this was like why aren't we going why don't we why aren't we sometimes taking a step back to take a step forward right norm has a joke he goes I got a neighbor see the neighbor and I said hey neighbor what do you do for a living neighbor says Nora I'm a professor of logic down at the university there's science and norm says what's that he goes well norm it's hard for me explain it's easier to me just show you what I do norm do you have a dog house and I'm goes I do I'm you know something you must have a dog logically he does I do have a dog and he goes all right and if you were dog logic i can assume you must have a child you have a child norm he goes I do have a child his one of you have a child logically I can assume you must be married to a woman are you married to a woman Norman he goes I am his norm then logically I could assume you're a straight white male and normal is wow that's amazing so the next day norms down on the bus stop having a cigarette sees another one of his neighbors neighbors because norm do you meet the new neighbor he goes yeah I did here's what's he do for a living because he's a professor of logic to the university of science here's what is that he was well it's hard for me to explain there's much easier for me giggles yeah he goes yeah norm goes hati up a doghouse he goes no and he goes well you must be a faggot why what like like we're joke it's a joke why are we like we're all funny like why can't because that's a problematic word and it's banned great Joe it's a great job but like though that old joke writing we all stepped away from but like what if we could tether ourselves to it at a bit and what we're doing now Norman does that Marc Norman Norman does but like stand-up going I'm right knock-knock jokes just for like a writing exercise mhm where you go what if you what if you just wrote like a banger knock-knock joke or like this special I wrote something like that what are your specials coming out I I can't say it yep I know interesting I wonder don't waste your time how does that hurt promoting it ahead of time but you just still promoted ahead of time I would say I think actually no I think they actually do request a Netflix that you don't say it's the time yes okay with me souped-up for they asked me they want to be the ones that tell ya yeah that comes with pets paying a lot of money I'm going big for this special meaning why Tommy knows I got big plans videos no no no I'm gonna do something different you're saying something you can't say yes hurtin people's feelings at home I think I think that's about comedy is like it's why I've that's why I've always liked like I like guys to go against grain but like burr I feel like burr every time does something different like challenges himself with an act out or something he does you know he does he always says that he was like figure out what you do bad and then just owe me yeah I didn't do like the like the back-and-forth conversation style but I'm to work on that in this special and then he'll duty in that special it was so good I know you're talking about so I talked to her about this - it's the one with the with this when he adopts the two sons yeah it's one of the best I watch that on my treadmill and my drinking wine in my man cave and I went on the treadmill yeah oh this is part of the routine it's called asking Joe get into it safe to hire a productive trainer down one with Joe have you thought about hiring a trainer no that one joke is fucking that it's last special no no so it's like three sessions ago I think I think not enough people challenge themselves get outside the box I think in our in our business you right right Burt do you sit down and write a little bit that means no no no because what happens Joe is that it becomes I don't watch it becomes it becomes too much for you to remember on stage so what I do is alright bullet points of what of things that pop for me but to sit and longhand right it becomes too much information I don't remember it I've been I've done it a bunch your brain doesn't even work like that no I I get to like a presentation on when I do that - yeah I start over cite it as I wrote it instead of just like just saying do you have any bits that feel like that are so word specific they feel like you're reciting not a bad way yeah it's just like sometimes especially when I get off the road for a while and then I try doing at a club yeah I got a Comedy Store or the stand or something and then I like start doing I'm like oh I'm reciting this yeah instead of like talking to an audience of 40 or 50 yeah it feels really small crowd will make you talk to the more time you spend in preparation and this is something that I didn't start doing till about two years ago actually preparing for shows like going over notes and one of the things that I have in the Ryder my contract I write index cards I got that from Kevin James really yeah I have Kevin James's Rider and your white one yeah white wine I took that you also have like all white couches and white flowers and your M&Ms racist now limos no I think that was love I think the white oh that was like an old yeah like a JLo thing Tommy David says a white limo has to pick me up and that's what a black fella watching oh that was no city Griffin oh really no no I think we're a are not the same people there is I actually worked a club once where they were like there was a somebody here who requested a white and here's the thing it wasn't like a white limo there like a white Yukon like it had to be a specific specific model Wow vehicle and they did not pick it up and that person chose to wait at the airport I know that's all I heard was Tommy Davidson is a story I heard that like that I can't notice people were like I put these crazy things of my writers to make sure they're reading it but that's the only thing they put in their writer is that thing so it's like yeah you're not putting in for that you want that thing you want that thing just say it yeah yeah well that's in the marvelous mrs. Mazal like that you got to put things in your writer or people don't take you seriously that's interesting but I don't I don't think I mean I don't know anybody who's legit that has wacky things in there right no when they asked you guys like you want a writer a writer yeah and they're like I remember most people I was like if you're a performer you work a venue you have the option to like basically make requests things you want in your green room so that you feel happy and comfortable to perform but at first like make sure it's some water I guess here too or I can just go to the front and get Buffalo Trace whiskey Cabernet meat tray fruit meat tray is key I got throat cote gummy bears gummy bears I have a meeting cheese plate a veggie plate water both flat and still coffee tea and that's you know what all I have standard it's pretty standard I mean it's insane when you when you when you see like usually what usage musicians can ya really drive it up pal has already in his dressing room that's kind of cool doc dress I'll tell you what we'll find fucking red light yeah fuck the lighting the lighting fucking makes a difference man yeah like shitty like over office light

was trying to get my head get ready for a big show and these squawking fucking hot chicks yeah I was like I just sit in the stairwell to fucking collect my thoughts remember that story I told you about sitting next to a ring-card girl one time on a flight home mm-hmm know that I was at I this is fucking I don't know how many years ago I did a gig with you and then I had a I had a different flight and one of the ring-card girls was sitting across the aisle from me and she just went water water water that's right I remember this and then the flight attendant came up and they're like are you saying something she was like water they're like would you like some water she was like yeah and then they're like okay like she didn't press a button or say excuse me she just said water Oh God until somebody was like oh I guess you want water Wow really yeah yeah I'm so hungover you can't say can I please have some water how many times she be in the green room with a bunch of people that don't understand what you're going through you know one time we did a show we did this fucking end of the world show at the door no no no that was the end of the world that was the 2016 1 for the election we did one for 2012 with Stanhope and Diaz and honey honey we did it at The Wiltern right mm-hmm and for whatever reason the agents all decided it was a party in my fucking greener a free

you like who oh yeah and you're like oh yeah are you insane well I'm I had a guy bring his family know his family his family hears they this sounds crazy to say opening for you yes I just random no and it sounds crazy if you're listening or whatever and you're like what you talking about well like when you get to the venue and you're gonna do a show for most people they want it like a pretty relaxed vibe pre-show you know you're gonna you're gonna perform you you don't you definitely don't want like like a strain I mean if it's if there's a stranger at most you're gonna be like hello and then nice to meet you and then they're gonna leave because understand you're about to do a thing right you just you want to relax he's not you don't necessarily like have to meditate you're just like I just want a relaxed atmosphere right like most performance you got your head straight you're ready to go perform this guy had kids no he had kids in the fucking creative people it was him his wife two small children and and then like the polluters a new comic he was new newer yeah and the promoter came by and was like he has it good when I was like it's cool to know we're doing fucking daycare

if is it okay I bring my family not feel bad if I know somebody and they're in there and I'm headlining and openers in there I'm like it's dirty room too because you're also performing but like I don't want my friends in there imposing on the opener of cooed you know if I was if I was opening for you I would never find out the balls ring be like oh yeah my friend fucking sissy Eve wants the same hey no way dude our local comic who's not on the show comes by to hang out it's like bro do all this host show dude yeah I wrote off a dude that I was friends with for a while for this lap when I shot the special Cleveland who was like wasn't wanted to just come hang out backstage and I was like well no it's kind of like I don't know really a guest list it's kind of a closed set because in between shows I'm getting notes from people that is a huge night it's a huge fucking night and I just was like and he sent me a nasty fucking email about me being a liar about 9:00 I'm at guestlist and I was like all right bro I guess I'll never speak to you again this is when you're filming yeah I wait he was on the show with you no no he was on the show he just was in town you want to come hang out he sent you a nasty email saying you're a liar look because you did never you said you didn't have a guest list cuz he wanted to come backstage and hang out yeah he wanted to come to shows and I was like hey man I its I'm in a different spot like I've got the people that have been with me understand that you were doing special that's not why you're a lawyer Zia comics yeah I was I was just like I was like it really fucked me up so I was like and then and then all the sudden you're fighting with some on the day or special I was like you know what fuck this man like I've done them that it's like fuck you for putting me in a position of am i special to have to fight yeah yeah yeah you should you should cry or to try to like how you trying to mentally distract me yeah you do dude it's uh yeah it's fuck don't get me into it because it'll spin me out but like a man I'm your I'm your friend I'll never I'll never put you in a situation that where I go like yo Joe can you get my buddy on I never do that when people come and go cookie emojos I just write them off that's why my brain works I go if I'm your friend I'm only a friend I'm never gonna ask it of you like the worst is when you're doing a weekend at a club and some guy asked to a guess at just give me a shot hey man you mind if I do a guess at what wouldn't have you ever done that did you ever do that when you're coming up did you ever go to a national how opposite of that because I feel so I mean I'm just I do not want to feel like I was ever I actually went to a show one time and was asked if I wanted to do a guest spot and I was like that's inappropriate for me just felt rude being there right right versus people that aren't entitled and I know this from I know this from knowing Tom as long as I've known him and re as well none of us are the kind of guys that were like next step what's the next step in this business to get forward and I step on to get to the next level I was always like I want to find my group and I want to be safe I want to I want to do what I do and have them be like amen that was not good or this was good as friends so that I knew that what I was doing as an art form was safe I never was like dude get me on your fucking thing get me on your thing it's so many of those guys out here there are so many those guys and there's also people that get upset that you don't use them to open when you use other people that they think are their equal to open do you ever get that but it's like yeah I mean I'm friends with them are like what the way like not like not getting your shit together to open a big like if I was if I was like had the balls to ask you to open one of your shows that's I would come to it at least feeling like my 20 is so goddamn tight oh yeah so that like when you do it was a good decision right I will be way more nervous opening as a younger comic opening up for you then you would be like I would be like yeah I old and of course I have a passing DA not asking Tom I was open for Pauly in Baltimore and I was home for like Thanksgiving something and the week after that in DC Dom was there and I was saw the lineup was like no I'm never gonna ask him I can't and then Eleanor told him later like afterwards yeah Laurie was there he was gonna ask you but he was felt embarrassed because I should ask they told him yeah it was like you're imposing polite who think that day shoutout I gotta give a shout out to Mike Birbiglia when I one time I was in town shooting something in Tampa for a trip flipper travel channel and my boobs at the Tampa improv we're of a sushi next door and I was like I'm gonna stick my head in and just say like hi or whatever you know cuz I was a big fan I think Birbiglia to this day is one of the best storytellers or tellers without a fucking doubt I don't know very good I honestly don't know if I would have the balls to be doing what I'm doing right now Birbiglia hadn't been the first guy to tell a long story yeah he really wasn't the first one of the first on weed and up stage - yeah and he was to write a blog and his blog became really popular might what was it what was it my it was he would read it on Bob and Tom who's fucking here yeah yeah I said I rolled into the Tampa Improv them drunk I'm fucking full my she and I stick my head in the waiting room and I go amen Bert Kreischer just know I like how you're trying to be complimentary and I could I remember the look on his face was so deer in headlights and he was like and I was like just big fan where I'm in town I'm shooting my TV show I just want to come in and say hi and he was like alright and then is like signing for minute he goes are you asking for a guest set and I went oh no no and he was like oh thank god no problem is I've given guys against it and then they go on and they cover a topic that you cover that is true that's a problem you don't know what they're doing you have no idea what their sin is you know it's a real fuck thing is though if somebody opens for you and then you're like you have something like that and then they you're opening for you and then you're like you see that I'm doing this right you know that I'm doing this yeah you're gonna have had guys continue to aversion right now Oh guys do it on purpose yeah like they try to step on your material yeah and they're opening for you always afraid to they're gonna be like if they do something other than you do it like hey I didn't take this from you just so you know yes the tellers in the show if I already had my thing planned yeah yeah well it's just some guys will try to kill so that you bomb you know like the local guys yeah yes that's always an issue if you go to a place and these fucking guys have never seen you before and like Tom Segura yeah watch this motherfucker yeah you know and they'll you know for focus on the food do these fans are my fans they just gotta see me and then they'll be following me they'll do a lot of local shit that's one thing they do a lot of if they drive up that luggage that you know that whack is fuck immediately like if they they lean you into it hard it's one thing to make like a one or two comments but if they're if it's if they do like six minutes I lived in Boston well you were act but you're starting out yeah yes it was so sad when I go on the road people like know if I could find a time machine I would go back to Boston in the late 80s and I'd have Joe Rogan open for me uh-huh and I would just take him with me and be like so a would tell me what you think about aliens book just started about this to know somebody for a long time and then look up shit like 20 year old you don't mean like yeah I can watch clips of you if you like myself and I got weird so weirdest part about being friends with you is I was a fan of yours before I was friends with you when you and Brian were doing that Joe show and I was like fucking so into that I was into this podcast before I ever got on the podcast and so like to know you like I remember telling you one time about you at jenna jameson you're like I've never been to a person I was like fucking pretty certain I saw it like I've never met her and yeah I was like no I'm pretty sure there's a video out there of you guys at a party and you were like I'm pretty sure and I was like fine I watched it like you know your memory sucks say I'd never met jenna jameson you by the way hang on if there is an astute person Gebbie well if you will hear it on the podcast that I didn't know her no no no no this is way before she started dating Tito Ortiz this is like a long time ago I remember you and jenna jameson at a party in Phoenix I remember a party and yeah with her husband oh yeah her husband she's explaining how to eat pussy yeah okay I'm not crazy just ruining the story probably I wish Birbiglia was here to save me he's giving a version of the story that doesn't make sense but yeah it is crazy to know of people's past like lives I'll tell you what I would love a fucking documentary about is the store like his they're doing this shit fine just doing it and he's doing it real slow which makes you give real hope that it's gonna be good he's taking like two years to do it by the way I'm in that documentary I wish I didn't say it out loud let's make another car try some that Dan Akroyd does oh yeah is there more ice there by chance but I'm curious always to know about like the store when I wasn't there dude it was the best in the early aughts but people say it was the worst I heard okay for stand-up shows sure it was the worst for its entire purpose energy wise it sounds horrible no Dom says it the best he goes there was this young group of okay I know it is the employee section so I don't know other people who are like 10 12 year college has the employees it was like we ran the place it was so much fun I just saw it as a foreign place we would go sneak in the back to see like the mainstream no no we're fucking in the back Aykroyd any alcohol that I didn't pour in my bring with me personally I just drank some of that man there's something in there it's just Dan Aykroyd's we opened that schism in like OB curio like history of like I want to know like where I went up and then town certain personalities why certain personalities didn't get closer when I thought they should have like in knowing them as adults they should be closer does that make sense closer to what like I don't know like closer friends you mean I would love to know like the camps and like who were in the different camps and look there was no camaraderie back then there was some camaraderie with like door guys there was there was a lot of like the the problem was there was this leftover shit from guys who were all struggling to get sitcoms they were all struggling to be the host of a talk show desk Tomic juice soda yeah it was good Joe you're right it was good when there was a level of acceptance that the place was a failure and that we were just in it for jokes yes and then we were like we're not gonna get anything cuz Bobby Lee was like the most successful guy because he was on MADtv but the thing that was going on that was weird was that the guys that were at the higher level there was a few that were left over there seeing Kinison take off and they had seen David Letterman take off and they were still there yeah there was there were there was a few of those guys that were left behind they were very bitter and they did not like young guys they there was a different thing like today when young guys are coming out for young girls anybody who's funny at the store gets love you know whether it's a doorman or someone who works the booth there's no like there's no anyone know what's down it's not like you're mad so I'm not now is the internet changed at all because we all have a platform to help now whereas before it was like the only way you got successful was through television television was the goal and if Tommy got a TV show you were like fuck that could have been my show and so there was this like backstabby weird fucking competition back then there now it's different now if you gotta go now everybody helps everybody that place different Santino suddenly from like no podcast to a successful podcast yeah now everybody's like oh that's another platform I can go on when someone gets a Netflix special or something everybody gets happy and everybody gets pumped and then they also see like hey if you can come bust your ass and you're good and you work hard you can get one to go into yeah it's not it's not like he used to be man it was weird man when I was when I first got that I came out here 94 I came out of with a sitcom already had a sitcom so when I came out here I came out here to do a sitcom and what was more important to me than anything was being a paid regular at the store that's what I give a fuck about the sitcom was just I felt like it's gonna get canceled eventually I'm just gonna make some money while I can and this is way more money than I ever thought it could ever make yeah and but I'm gonna do comedy you know and so then I would be hanging around the store but there was there was no friends it was weird and like who was there when you when you first went to the store who's there Mencia was there he was there he was just startled and Ralphie what's that then about Ralph no no Stanhope was never there Ralph he wasn't really Schubert was there Schubert was there before me Schubert was there you know he was like Mitchell arriver back in the fucking day did you know that in the past at the Magic Castle you know yeah Jimmy Schubert he's a really good magician yeah Wow yeah no kidding yeah Wow I didn't know that yeah super super once I was the door guy and um his parents were there in Philadelphia or something like that yeah yeah and I was like hey dude nervous in your pant because I my parents see me like once ever and I was getting nervous new parents see it goes no no they see me budget at times I don't care but he goes where midsi's here you know that's tough and I've been inside of her yeah I used to bang messy when he was a young fellow he was you serious yeah that's how you got spots yep she was straight up like if you want to get up you got to get it up yeah that was back in the day okay to do that yeah no one had a problem with it it's not like a Harvey Weinstein type deal yeah shit yeah yeah but like back then it was like there was it's a few big guys who stopped in like Martin Lawrence would stop in there was a few busy cool poetry guy he never got to talk to him he's friendly with me now but back then I would go on after him just each yeah you remember him like when it went as the host of Def Jam dude he was fuckin to me oh man when I got passes he remember that joke should I light another cigar oh we got you done close to done no I got to relight this one but you can let another one okay I just remember I remember this this thing started a recession like a complement to him but I mean it sincerely cuz I would be if I was obsessed I would go in our basement to watch Def Jam no you know and because I got caught watch that in the living room yeah watch that in the basement and he was so funny and just engaging you know like they're soaked so charismatic that I would look forward to the interstitials like to him coming back just to introduce the next person because that's how funny he was he was on top of the world yeah he was he really was and I was a young comic who was not very good and I used to have to go on after him what time we were free whenever someone was good I would be on after him anybody who crushed whether it was dice that's when you know anybody who was good with Martin Lawrence I would go on after Martin Lawrence oh you go onstage with a leather jumpsuit on how did how did you draw you know I've never any of this I've never asked you how did you get past what was your showcase like this is why I got past there was a guy named the Todd do you remember the time the Todd went crazy the Todd went crazy but for he went crazy help me out he told me do this for other people when I was first starting out mitts he thought it was okay but I could work as a non-paid regular and I was you know freaking was 26 and so I was doing sets at the store after the show so the show would go on to like whatever one o'clock in the morning and I was there every fucking night and I did that for six months and then I mean I had no friends no anybody here yeah I didn't know anybody here so I just knew a guy I would just go up I would go up after the show's over I knew that I could get a spot at one o'clock in the morning if I wait what's happen I don't remember I remember I would go on always around around 180 ELCA and there was very few people in the crowd but she gave me a showcase I did the showcase she goes you could be a non-paid regular so it's like good so I can do sets after the show so I'd go and I'd sit around and I would wait and I'd watch I didn't have a life back then okay I had the sitcom that I was doing during the day and then at night time had no friends I just moved here so I just hang around the store and I was really disappointed because the store was Mecca to me man back when I lived in Boston I was like I heard about the college store that's where Kennison was and we were all like one day we're gonna go to the comic store in LA and I went there and there was his bowed axe man he's fucking Kasota Casino acts they were terrible everyone there was so many bad comics that had missed the wave right they were there was a wave in the 1980s where basically anybody could be a comic you just had a talk like a comedian I mean I'm looking at my cat and I'm like what is this Wild Kingdom in my living room and it was a fucking shuck and jive in non non perspective having guys yeah and a few of them lingered and so those are the ones that were at the store so the wave of Kennin see I'm here in 94 right Kinnison was huge in 88 you gotta realize that's only six years so kinnison's huge in 88 and then he dies in 92 right and somewhere around then I'm living in New York where he died and then I'm in LA two years later in the fucking place is a ghost town I'm telling it was like do you think it's odd because he does it was a big part of he was like big go away well I kept hearing about all these celebrities that would come to the comic store to see Kinison and I was like wow you see Kennison that's crazy that came to see em like all these fucking rock stars and Keith Richards and fucking movie stars and Belushi and all these guys would come to the comedy store that shit was gone by the time I got there so by the time I got there with this you know the comedy sir has gone through he's in the past he's like peaks and valleys and I got there in a valley but I stayed I was there for like six months and this guy that Todd was there right and Dick Todd that's the Todd right there that guy I hope that guy a lot hard he's fine he's gone now anyway the Todd had like a severe mental episode where he literally something went wrong like some sort of a disease something went wrong mentally and he lost his mind before he blasts his mind he sat down next to Mitzi so when Mitzi try me for my second showcase I went up and I did my set I had a good set but the Todd was laughing hard he sat down next to me he's like admits he's like he's funny and Todd was like that guy's fucking funny he's fucking funny and I was cool with him he was very friendly I saw you doing late-night spots before he saw me banging it out and then he came to me offstage goes i sat down next to Mitzi and I laughed really hard because I came offstage and Mitzi goes your past you're gonna be a pain regular call in the morning get some sets I was like holy shit I'm a fucking paid regular the store not granted I'm gonna television show at the time right I think she was terrible his baseball show called hardball it was terrible and it could have been good too I watched that watch the guys who wrote The Simpsons wrote it they wrote on married with children really good writers and Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran they're really funny really talented really smart guys and Fox's fucking brutalize their show brutalized it and they brought in all the hacks and they chopped it up so I was in Hell doing this terrible sitcom means making good money though but we're relevant we're reliving oak woods Apartments yeah that's like the pilot place we'll see I think by then I might have gotten an apartment in North Hollywood Hartman in North Hollywood a few months in because I figured it was gonna stick around for a while and then you know she gave me the thing and then Todd pulled me aside he goes hey he goes i sat down next to me and I laughed really hard and he goes and that's that's how you get someone past and he goes one day you're gonna do that for people too I'm like okay you did it for Chris McCoy dude I fucking host did it for Chris McCoy cuz this terrible comedian was supposed to do the hosting gig who's supposed to host open mic night yeah and I found out Maguire was gonna do his showcase Mitch he thought I was funny to put this terrible comedian up and have him host I mean he was impossibly bad I like how you're intentionally not yes I'm not saying it's not good so I thank you drying over no you definitely don't so um so all right I called up and this is when I was on news radio yeah I called up and I said hey I go fuck this I go I'm gonna host open mic night so I came down and hosted open mic night just for McGuire no I did that for a bunch of people sat down next to Mitzi while people were showcasing funny people and just laugh just laugh hard clap and it would influence their it influences everybody but having a good room makes everybody even I've seen a billion shows it's still if somebody's doing well I can't see through or not doing well I'm like that guy's pretty sure I did that for Diaz oh yeah I did it for so many people that was look man I was so thankful and then one day I didn't see him for a long time but don't see yeah I don't see him for a long he went by that odd yeah the Todd the Todd he was gone for he's - open for Paul he was one of paulie's buddies any relation do you think - the Charlie's Angel name of fucking what's his name's character in that Todd Lema shit says that's his name there it is yeah that's an old line up for 1986 yeah article from a BuzzFeed about the let me see Schubert the long green ants do sets with her in New York I'll be Ludington will steer Kravitz I knew him - Marc Maron look at 8:07 was brett ratner that's the Bruckner no no Mary sure maybe it might have been no Erin Merryn was there for a short time then he went to network and you know he went to Bob cest with the Comrie Storybrook Jerusalem syndrome about being there then when he came back he was all shell-shocked 94 said Robert Downey jr. that's on this is it son confirmed oh okay so in 87 when Marin was there I met him right after that in 88 whereas he moved to Boston so he was doing sets in Boston Marin was Marin gave me like one of the nicest pieces of advice or in compliments that anybody ever gave me the best Bitcoin didn't say that Oh what wait what was the other oppressed I need to keep going that was funny you know he said you can do this man you're really original you you got a great voice you used to hang out at that when when I was an employee every once in a while you would hang out just watch the employee section and I didn't realize it it makes me think now it's important for like just that it was a paid regular and a guy on a sitcom that were just like sit and watch us and was like cool I don't like comedy man and I like supporting comedians I've always liked supporting too because from my martial arts background like camaraderie and like the whole team and helping everybody like having a good group or I always knew the value in that it's very important to have a good community know can you watch comedy online like on Instagram that's good yeah watch i watch good clips a lot with it the Todd thing no back to that because so what happened was one day I got there and I hadn't seen him for a long time I forget how long but it was a long time and he was hanging out in the front patio but he was weird he was just really weird and I I don't remember who told me they said yeah he lost his mind and something happened I think he maybe even had an operation like something was really wrong and he was just hanging around like almost like trying to run he stopped doing comedy entirely trying to remember yeah try and remember what it was like Eleanor said he'd do this thing where he used to this thing to fuck with the bartenders we would like to take a glass and like like look at him I'm gonna chuck it in the garbage and then but he didn't remember that he had had a camaraderie with the bartender he would just remembered that he had done that so we would kind of like go up and so like take a glass and like put it in the garbage and some new part it was like who is this what's he doing yeah he's it was reluck it was real weird man and it was the first time I'd ever seen anybody like be fine and then be gone and I didn't know I didn't understand what happened that guy man he did me a giant solid giant solid I'll never forget that and it influenced me too to make sure that I pass that on who are the guys who did you guys like favors not even like I'm doing you a favor but like things like that like he said like you know but Todd did or like you know just like helped you or you're like oh that was a big house just guys treating you like you became like a human torero was a big one Burt what no Burt Joe oh yeah yeah it took me on the road Russell Peters yeah Tom you brought me to uh Indy I did yeah right you said it's a break-even week I mean she won't pay for a flight but he'll make enough money to pay for your flight and then you got booked there yeah yeah that was big show obviously you know take me on the road and shit Shane Moore was big for us Moore's really big for us it's it stinks that it turned out the way it did but he was he was really big and like you know I always say you learn a lot from feeling a lot from people both sides of the fence good and bad yeah like I learned a lot about what I didn't want to do because I'd watch J Jase so amazingly talented I know I'd watch him get in his way sometimes and I'd be like God man I don't want to do that and Tom and I would talk privately like about like going like just a weirdest fucking things he was it he would man he was so talented he was a fun hang he's a fine Hank jay-z jay-z funny and he was really funny man and he was so they still at me see yeah you could give that guy a premise you could give him a premise like just the silliest thing and he could improv it on stage definitely on a stroke about 20 months ago huh probably [Laughter] yeah no no no Jay was a big I can't I can't where I make yes it's obviously yeah and I don't speak anymore yeah it was great in that fuckin McGuire movie are you guys capable of of like pushing the bad parts out yet yeah seeing the good parts yes the first time that's why I'm talking about it like I don't mind I'll speak but top but but we both had negative experiences that's why we're not friends with them anymore but it was a lot of good things that's a reason I met Thomas how'd he find you guys he found Tom through his assistant charlie yep and when I met when I met you it was at a show yeah opening I was the best it was I was the MC he was the middle Bert was the middle and J was the headliner yeah and immediately within like fucking five seconds Tom I bonded like within five fucking seconds I remember he walked in and then he goes forward State game was on Tom wasn't for a state game and Tom's like oh come on J is like the fuck is this and I go oh you watching for stakes I went there Tom's like yeah he's like you got money on it and Tom's like yeah I got a hundred bucks on it he's like you're making fucking 50 bucks tonight as a host what kind of fucking idiot you walked out and I was like look Tom I go hey welcome to the I've I so nerded out that he went to FSU that was like he went to FSU he's like yeah I went there for like 15 years what and then I go when and then he tells me the I go oh you you guys want a national championship went over there and I was like hey so was like I just mentioned like a player I don't know whatever I was like with Derrick Brooks there he was like oh I don't know I don't know anything player no no what you don't fucking know I think this is what made you laugh when I Derrick Brooks was a big player of Florida State write him and work done when I was in my senior college I went to the gas station then they had a single cassette single of Brooks and Dunn and I went oh wow our two biggest players released a single got thora this has got to be good right I'm a big fan of hip hop so I bought the single of Brooks & Dunn not realizing it's a country western band they they weren't big yet and I put it in and it was country music and I went so Derrick Brooks have worked on made a country album that's interesting oh my and I listened to the whole fucking thing it was like I was like one song I was like this is not bad I'm a fan of the guys I'm a fan yeah I'm in I'm in and I think I told you that you're like Brooks & Dunn not work Brooklyn and unit to college yeah yeah did you go did I go yeah he was gorgeous back then you dropped out yeah you went all the way through and then some kinda all the way I had to take prison classes and in New York what's I mean so is before the internet so you would if you didn't finish GED you would you had to send in to the state of Florida and say I want to finish college and they give you the books that they give you the prisoners send them to me in New York I just had to read the books of my peers yeah like it's no like if you want to get a college course in prison they send you the books and you just do the work basically you what just fill it out just basically I got the books and I got the tests and I just had to fill out the test do you ever wonder like if you were in prison like how much shit you'd get done you'd get like really fit you like I do I was a good fun all day sit-ups I would lift so many bricks yes you're like me they're like we weren't even thinking about that but now that you brought it up seemed like we can yeah you seem pretty soft yeah they probably want to rape a hard guy just for like you know so it's a real ignominy and knocked on the yeah a good win you know if you rape like a gang leader ya know turn them rape I was like a super tweak at twink it's like anti Harris yeah yeah yeah yeah but get like Tim Sylvia in there Mercer raped em cilia giant feather in his cap die or feather so to speak yeah the show to speak let's talk to about Tom behind his back okay when you first met Tom how quickly did you like him instantly why well we was funny we were at the celebrity theater we were doing the maxim tour it was John Heffron Charlie Murphy and me and every town that we went to there would be a new guy that would open a local guy or in Toms case guy from LA that was somehow or another they assigned the victims yes sir picked him to do it fuckin he was really funny he's really funny and he and I got along like that I met him when you said like it was India's or Duncan that week it was Tom Segura after that show and it was like okay and then he was there and I was like hey it was like 40 seconds uncomfortable and it's like he was like yeah I was gonna say about like here's what's real important about comics recognizing that the doorman and the opening acts and the middle acts will one day be your peers they are your peers on that door that's the store that's a story this direct there's no other Club like that was a direct line from brand brand new employee to massive theater sellout where it's like those came from there yeah Bobby Lee was a door guy yep I was at when I'm not that level but like we're a door guy when I met you yeah but like there were other guys who were like straight from there too so it's like it's not like you wouldn't be a dick to them but like they're going to be you and the guys who were our big we're like I was that yes yes well it's like there's a camaraderie in the in the game we're all trying to write up a good dick joke yeah it's and yeah well I'll support each other well fucking weirdos you know like this is so rare weirdo there's not that many of us man you know there's a small amount of human beings on the planet earth that make a living telling jokes I mean worldwide I did see a picture of Tom on one of your specials early on and he was so fat you were so patty sure that fat shamed me he was fatter than me so much fatter than yeah he just lost some weight he goes I think I'm fitted in here now it wasn't that it's that when you're fat and other people get fat like it doesn't mean that you're not fat it's like they are 240 at the time where are you 240 I was 240 when I started trying to lose weight tom was always not accurate with those numb I think you can pick up one where are you right now are you up or down since the last pockets way down way down you still come way down in mine have a scale no Jojo I will never see where I'm at after Colombia - at my my my special I shot I was 220 when I shot it was really yeah how'd you do that I'm so fat in it you see it I'm so fat yeah dude yeah the funny thing is when we started sober October it was this whole thing like can you not drink for a minute and and that was that was the first time that five years ago or whatever save your life yeah we were like dude maybe you were just drifting with the conversation I guess I knew it I got so into a were trying to say that I said that I didn't know Jenna James someone find that clip when you when Jamie pulled this started yeah do you remember where you were at the end of September yeah you were lost a bunch of weight at the big at the end of September be giving away any idea yeah you just lost a bunch of weight really yeah beforehand I was strong into October yeah I got down to - 2006 can you be down at 205 at the end of October that's okay it's nothing man how did you not make 205 you could have got that but I stopped I stopped caring I was like I can't I know I can't have that brain so where I'm I needed to work on material and I was like I'm gonna be me I'm gonna work out on my fun like you looked as good as John Pinette like of six months of $40 thank you thank you the fact that Tom's weight is not brought up at all leave Thomas fabulet bird and has been for many months I wish you had seen the boxes I'd given you a presence in Toms foot is so much smaller than your account what do you mean he's five eight tops right five five eight five five eight and a half yeah yes I don't mind that because people are always pleasantly surprised when they made me they go eight Tom actually is fatter than you and I go no 710 no it's not that Joe's got 11 okay or he's got 12 I what's annoying when you you get an 11 in some shoes and it's too small Chuck Taylors it sucks yeah man there'd like a half a size too small tom happy we're not out let's not change the subject big you know tom how much do I weigh yeah I feel like you've lost some weight since in the beginning of October that's probably true we have a scale we're not know that Jamie pull it up get that scale Jamie caller let's go home no no scale I'd like to see how much I weigh after Columbia and then if you guys want away as well that's okay Joe would you be manner like the way yourself hey I'm about 205 right now I have to predict my way predict I I'm gonna be honest with you though yeah I honestly have not been on a scale in a long time me so I'm you're saying it'll be one every morning I said I gonna stop eating carbs so I guess I got I got down to 194 at one point in time Jamie you killed you all you did get under obese and you also got under obese no no no I think I was still obese I think it was not well yeah but not obese right what do you think you weigh Burt 235 you think you weigh that now I would I would I would right there baby we're going in but definitely we're definitely not what you are man it's just a number what do you give a fuck because he's gonna take those oh I will get totally fucking nude and pitch up hey wait say that Tim you're gonna see the obvious and smash up a b.o.b Lacey obviously in Spanish oh yeah Oh Beale what are you doing we'll take you but don't take a piss don't don't pull you don't piss on the ground you can put your pants on so I'm definitely not getting on the scale underwear on why are you scared of scales Bert because Jo it's not like this hasn't defined the last four years of my life online but yeah very well right now you look great yeah thanks guys I'd rather people think I look like I know a nice target weight is 175 to 180 mmm okay target weight that's like loose skin yeah that's weird remember an R in a six-pack oh yeah all right had a full six-pack look at that he's got a little bit of a six-pack there a skinny no he's got abs it's not just a skinny what do you got zero it's on carpet or a big money big money 180 it's what you call six 180 point six mm-hmm and that is with socks on yeah it's the carpet I don't trust carpet on these scales okay man you don't have to get on it that's after two weeks in Colombia with nothing but fried food I'm okay with that chicha rolling today for lunch but dita paisa one thing that I did realize when you did sober October when the we did the fitness challenge is that if you just went whole hog you're crazy you'd be a beast I ate nearly a whole hog today no but I mean if you like worked out really hard you'd have a good body here's the thing that I learned in sober October and and then Tom kept having to say this to me over and over again is that what makes rere is not going for hog like like if you go for hog it's it's not re you get a turns in like and the same with me like what I get obsessed with weight and it it starts to beat the thing that defines you is the thing that defines you take this slow is no it's not even that crazy it's true and you'll know it's true is I'm gonna wait till the fourth quarter and then the fourth quarter you'll do it insane there's no way you're gonna be like I'm a study for this shit yeah you're not gonna prepare those things when you say things like times you said split you think when you got down you knew you didn't what do you think thematically all of a sudden you would get really flexible but what's your confidence he goes in with it we're thinking like I've never done a split my life I know they're hard to do and I can't you do it even though I know he's a bullshitter every part of me it was like wow Burke into a split with nothing he ran four miles in his life and then he fuck it did a marathon the next five or six on the treadmill which is like one in real life that is true yeah I think it is a marathon you will say I can do that to anything okay I'll say I can do that to anything you're definitely not get on it but don't you feel that way about what I can do anything No yeah yeah but you can do anything no but do you think it's great test scores this is actually what the finds the to it you'll keep going I think the same the same fire burns for both of us right so what do you think of like you can do anything right you go no I can't I need to work hard to have another stroke no no you go harder yeah you go I'm gonna I can't shoot a bow and arrow a perfect shot I want to learn that I want to bust my ass I want to do that I'm the opposite way where I go just give me a shot let me try this right here Lister you can surf that is your guy's personality difference is very different I'm very objective about what I can and can't do I'm gonna get good at things you have to you have to really look at what you're good and not good at and then work really hard at getting good at things otherwise you're just bullshitting yourself and or that gets you hurt if you're a fighter look at you really hurt yeah but that's it's it's it actually is really interesting to think about your background is what informs that of and you just expressed and his experience is that saying that sometimes works out like that's why he keeps studying college moonstone discovered me all of a sudden I got a career he's the guy who will say right but it worked you will be somebody's will smith discovers me commander what the fuck yeah say I want to run a marathon I do it and then I go and then I said Misha heard me the day I ran the marathon I was like I think I can actually do anything wait didn't you say something did you say something about kicking field goals 35 easily with no worry thank you Scott Norwood mister 35 yarder and they lined up and they said everybody in Washington stadium it's kind of like trying to 35 yarder and people did it people didn't do it I can easily I wonder how far you can actually cook a football if you've never kicked a football 35 you have what they call explosivity so you could kick it a lot for it that's what Pat McAfee phrase you could get a lot farther than I could I've never kicked anything luckily kick things my whole life that's why I'm wondering like how far I could kick a football man if I could get straight to cuz I could roundhouse kick shit pretty fucking hard that's interesting actually that's actually I bet the whip take five tries to learn how to kick it straight and then once you did that the power go motherfucker now the thing about a field goal isn't necessarily the kicking it's the mindset but it's a jubilant no no can you roll into the moment under pressure and perform but that's in the game that's what a field goal is right win a game you got guys running impact in the practice like let's say someone's holding it for you right or it's on one of those like T's like propped up and you're just going through the execution of kicking a field goal hold on that's not a field goal this was not a feeling so what they're doing to college kids now is saying you want a scholarship one shot 51 yards can you make this you get a scholar you practice for it no no but I'm saying not doing that or a hundred second lining up a guy going one shot fifty-one you are Julia it's happening 5060 thousand dollars here like hey I'll give it to you James told a please kick that ball once there was what will your trying to get those guys on the scale what let's go okay no no no no let's get this field goal thing out first that's up so they are doing that for kids to get a scholarship because they're thinking fuck we need you under pressure moment no bigger moment than you when they've done this for real a hundred percent I saw it online I was like shut the fuck up kit made it kit made a field goal any guys Oh actually numbers why would yeah there you go yards is really far that's like that yeah that's a legit but telling you it's not a fucking chip in no it's doing to get a scholarship there they do it and say you want your fucking scholarship hit a field goal I definitely saw it online it's I know it's a real thing but my point is you know can you moment yet by the way he's a master of looking hey Siri look up 51 even there for real planet 51 planets there's a guy that in Nevada they gave a scholarship after he hit the game-winning he was already on the team there was a guy we should still was like I said this podcast was live and I believe all that's true but yeah what if this was a here's a video of it coach off her scholarship if kicker hits 53-yard field but just this is the one who's there no offering him was caught scholarship if he can do it take the one that's how about walk-on kicker and offer he couldn't refuse but that's not a student right give this guy shot everyone's around watch this what swatches here we go huh boom and he gets this fucking scholarship kind of what I said off by 200 yards no I'll give it to you thank you or that is it's actually harder than what you said I feel go kid just got a scholarship yeah that's amazing but share it's a lot of money so here's the thing though they're not doing that they did that they're not doing that for anybody who can kick a 54 I'll give up the Joe yeah okay it's like you just phrased it but you were right they did do it yeah no way let's go hey I got to see what your I was trying to say it's earlier I gotta piss alright I remember doing a podcast and then wait Joe I did a podcast with you at the end of September beginning of October and you looked like a fucking junkie like on the streets that's a pot-house you go to fat cows podcast yeah dude at the end of October he looked

way to get hurt let's do that no it's you could get really fucked up let's get really hurt no I'm up for I'm up for I'm always up my weight loss challenge so the reason what what happened me with 205 not that I would have gotten there I'm not gonna say I could have gotten there during so October you have what is it I become obsessive compulsive about it and I can't focus almost you have to do just connect but you got a special it's like all hands on I got nothing on the books other than the birdie World Tour what what Burty Burt water what is that start soon January 30th in Vermont Burlington first time there how do you take it to this go to Bert Bert Bert comp thanks Joe I can chose added forget shows that it mmm I keep I could get into a weight loss challenge really do you think you get shredded do you get like down like 205 thank you and I wish like I wish I had weighed myself I wish I'd weighed myself at other times I've got an idea during so I've got an idea fabric where my special February 7th and 8th I will at the end of that special start gaining weight first wonder pass me for real for real one of these six damn look how slim you are when I met my wife damn you get those fucking well she signed on for a raw deal yeah it's got a Penny's back I will gain weight Nissan Segura have you ever seen Tom's jawline he looks like fucking magnum p.i when he was skinny 7th grade bro I'm telling you right now a very very attractive man I believe you fine scan it you tell me where can we find that pig you know you know where you can find that actually pouty lips look at you his I'm I've got a scar on a play like that re come on master yeah good yeah who's that guy in the left pretend to be you look at that what is that fucking good is that fucking eyes it's a fake you get your t-shirt how great is that how great is that title for now what is it shirt no idea that title is great I remember that CD throw like in the early 2000 right 2010 oh shit yeah eyes a good-looking Tom right there that's the one I fell in love with yeah but sweetie no I remember exactly when that was when was that that wasn't Russell Peters show temple on your chin are you cheek 2009 so the thing about weight loss is if you guys just do the weight loss thing and just get down and wait for a day or a couple days that doesn't help anybody it doesn't know what it what if you could keep it off that's the health that's your keep it off what what is your thing what keeps you eating like what is your what's your you're vice for me its pasta its carbs when I when I eat a lot of carbs it's just like fuck I can't help myself sometimes yeah I would say it's probably carb related like I like rice red pasta hot pasta yeah yeah I love it sure I mean I'm not a crazy sugar like sweet to you I'm a glutton to I fucking I eat and I'm stuffed and I just keep eating I don't really do that as much anymore I used I used to do that all that I used to think that's how meals were completed like every meal but that's like I would say at my worst but I don't think I really eat like that most of the time now mmm but I don't you know I'm not like weighing out everything as much as I should you know so you could just cut back your portions I could I do and you'd probably still be fine you probably wouldn't feel like you're denying yourself anything yeah I think so yeah yeah that's how I always feel I always feel like to like I'll get on a good meal plan and it's just about the discipline of sticking to it and then you know start doing it less are you wait you're doing now you're gonna eat goes on how much did you pee yeah you're I understand my problem with weight loss I don't understand yours you just boobs yeah my booze off you're not a booze thing right now so but it's more than foods that is it it's the things that booze invites into my life happy late-night food is rough but also the the empty calories of empty calories 7 Cal around you lost like fucking 30 pounds by not drinking yeah what is yours yeah it's food yeah so if you lost 30 pounds from not drinking you'd be 207 you're on 205 s door just knocking at it yeah but I don't know what like Tom because Tom does not look we've had dinner a bunch of times so he's like a gluttonous eater like he says that you have had dinner a bunch of times tonight I ate with Ralphie man and he would fucking do you would like jaw drop you on food it was crazy it was great he went to katana once and he ordered like like everything and then it was like oh that's great we're all good egos no no that's my order now you guys put it your order dude that's my it might the sushi or the Bert's sushi experience with Ralphie is my favorite story because of the thing is that Bert is like you're an opening act at the time that was opening for him and and Ralphie is inviting Bert and his wife and like Bert and you know Bert's or Leanne or Ralphie's wife they're they're all having dinner Ralphie's paying all the time like for meals for men they're in Hawaii no no no sorry Bahamas mamas yeah and then for like one the next night bursts like I'm gonna cover like a respectful thing you know you've bought all these dinners I'm taking you to dinner tonight and they go to sushi like Ralphie Ralphie started ordering and they're bringing boats out like the boats with all the sushi and you guys are jumping in and you don't realize it's all for him well it's he's just like he's ordering he's just ordering but and I know I'm paying for it but he's just ordering he's like I got this playa and I was like all right cool and he just kept ordering and ordering and I'm I'm eating and I'm drinking and then keep going I like you telling the story but it makes me laugh because Ralphie had treated you guys just like four meals and then you're just like a pill I shouldn't be I've been in this position before to where somebody is like you know you you want to be like you know what like I'm a fucking man and I mean you're you know I'm gonna by dinner now tonight's my night but you're not in a position to take this bill so like they bring the bill and it's a fucking four-figure bill this is an over a thousand dollar sushi experience and then you insist on paying and LeAnn LeAnn knows how much is it they go go fuck yourself that's how much it is and she goes you don't talk to me like that and I go go fuck yourself again they'll talk to me eat and Ravi goes our place should be just let me pay for a player I like and she goes why are you talking me like this and I'm looking at like a fucking fifteen hundred dollar bill twelve twelve hundred he was $1200 or $1500 i I didn't have the money in the bank account to pay for the tip and it's like that cuz I fucking I think my the the story always hits me is cuz I feel myself doing this thing I would do the same thing oh yeah no Rafi was so generous like he just was so generously you felt I don't I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you I want you to know that I'm your friend and I want to pay for things too mmm motherfucker yeah I was a bit what happened Ralph he goes Wow Leanne's irate at me storms off ravi goes our player we go win it back on blackjack took your thousand dollars out maybe two thousand dollars out of the bank machine go to roulette put on black hits red all I remember is we were the couple in the lobby fighting it's like your battery buddy you can't even like save for the hotel when Ralph you walk past me and it was not a drop in the bucket throughout from those two thousand dollars and he just saw me fight with Lana goes Oh miss LeAnn give him a break he tried his best he tried his best I see on the plane Playboy and then Ralph is on the plane you know so my whole part of the story that I remember the most Ralphie read a book on a flight from Miami to LA he read the whole fucking book I've never read a fucking book in five hours he was like a really like he read a book I remember sitting next to me read a book that's a crazy part of the story I remember no really he was out marry Jenna you were broke yeah we were broke man yeah that's Bert that's right I like to roll the dice yeah yeah it's working you don't become a comedian if you don't like rolling the dice man I don't think so gotta be crazy your comic you had a little crazy you have to be you have to be a little crazy and if you're not crazy I don't I don't I don't know if I want to know you meaning like you know speaking of books did you guys read anything so Bravo dude so many good books he didn't do any I didn't fucking read like five you didn't do it I did I did do that I started reading three books okay I went all audio I started reading and I'm gonna have time for this that's never gonna happen and then I said I'm gonna have to pay a fine 500 I realized immediately was like oh this is like this isn't just like okay and also refire two pages like that dynamo should read 200 know if like should have been 500 we should have had a penalty I should move the whole thing it's 500 pages if we had a penalty so I was thinking in my side some of the fucking time it was a lot you have to really commit to reading books I do really worked hard I think I'm the only one who did it you did it yeah you did it yeah my bosses weren't like I didn't make fuckin you know fuckin Khan's film

hate know how much I really hate them like that that was a good one I like what you said do stuff out of spite no yeah but it's like to let people know like this guy drugged me in front of my kids and I still forgive him you kids that's another part that matters I had to come to a moment I had a spiritual healer come to my house what they do here my energy I talked to Tom about it that's right um and she cleared the house our new house for all attender bad energy and then he said I see some darkness in you oh boy I told Joe about it I was dealing with darkness in my head about just OCD shit

said to someone I think I may have said some I say he's a great guy he's just a bad person and it's like it's like he thought he didn't he didn't and he was like you didn't mean to you never meant to hurt me at all and I was like oh and I talked to Joe and Tom about this ad nauseam but I was like I can't I can't man I'm not in a place to look for new fucking friends I got him he's like you know what I think that's beautiful about this we're here in 2019 in any other business if you drugged appeal and you did so publicly yeah that it was discussed publicly and yet you were on my podcast two weeks later we were howling about it yeah we got why we're smoking weed and just laughing about the fact that you drugged him it's hard cuz it was serious but was also super not serious we're having a good time we were having a good time talking about it and then we were also talking about how no one's kicked you out of the comedy community was never even a thought there's no not a second like where you're not getting booked anywhere not a second where you're you're ostracized it's like this is the last frontier for savages this is the last frontier for people that are doing wild crazy stupid shit and that is one of the wildest craziest stupidest fucking thing is you do is drug someone when they don't know your drug it's like a fucking it is the line stepping of all line stepping and we're like lines worked out Joey Diaz half funniest fucking take on it Joey Diaz called me up he listened to me this fucking Burton re thing he goes Ari's family he goes he's here he's not going

lying right not I'm not your soul I'm not no he's not also I smuggled some fruit in a felony we're gonna deep just say that I'm gonna deem yes don't tell anybody don't show the fruit okay that's a lie which is joking folks and the DEA agents or would it be mm oh shit agriculture yeah agriculture people if you tell me they're all in Spanish I'm gonna fucking jump over this play the whole music it's all in Spanish can you play this yeah how are you a Spanish all right can you translate my head wait man well I gotta pee gotta pee go ahead okay okay redraw Brent my dearest Brent fucking cunt ma'am very important miss Todd the important mass I miss dad a whole Quay can you just let him read what you wrote and translate it double-spaced he'd call misspelling her to see my like birdie boy world tour idea Brent what's in our friendship is important friendship is more important to know that tom is occupied with the fried pizza this is important to me as Thomas with deep fried pizza but deep fried pizza great it's more important to me than none fruit don't show it on camera that's a felony more important to me than Joe's obsession with killing animals killing animals animal porn beautiful animals to fuck you up with those horns just speak from the heart okay just just just say it you don't have to read it just tell him how you feel friendship is more important to me than anything even more important than it is important tom is deep fried pizza more important than top then joe is you know killing animals more important than know this is some of this is really mean don't do that just tell just put that down in it's telling me sorry well I wrote some funny stuff okay okay friendship is more important to me than like then Eliza I would not let your friends look at look at the face of Brody I wrote one for a living without you be worse than Tony Hinchcliffe living without the mural above his bed of him blowing Joe Rogan has Jeff Ross fucks him in the ass I don't think he has that he does have that I've seen in this department who painted it so you read this in Spanish and you pulled the plug I thought was coming up okay let me talk was gonna happen the point is all I wanted to do was I liked playing pranks I will end another said Joe is just speak from the heart I like playing pranks I like doing fun stuff and I thought the same thing I do with Luis Gomez where like he had this great announcement for for skank fest and was like I'm gonna ruin that and I'm gonna do it by like promoting it and I thought I'll give you what you love doing which is great content for your fans I know you're never gonna believe some podcasts but like never it was the best podcasts top 20 podcast of all time of any podcast yeah and I thought I'll give that to you I'll have a fun time with my friend I didn't know all the fallback was gonna happen I know your friends your two kids we're gonna come home and say you know I got raped that you got raped by already which I don't know why if you here's my or no why do you want if you have better stamina and strengthen me why they wouldn't think that you would rate me master kids aren't to ative maybe they saw something in you that I don't say fanciness or something but I don't know this is good read it go back to reading the point is this I wanted that fun I thought I have a prank that I'm like I'm gay I thought the prank first I'm gonna doe somebody in a podcast I'm gonna give him acid or Molly and I was like who can I do it too you know I thought of Luis Gomez first but I was like he's an unknown he's worthless and I might actually don't like him that much and then I guy and then I thought it has to be a good friend you can't do it to a like a semi friend it has to be someone who parties so it can't be these two faggots you know and then he made the fuckin the machine hmm I know the Machine so I was like I will do that with Burt that was my thought and I know people are telling you that I thought you were weak that's the furthest thing from the truth I thought you were fun but I if you forgiving me but I want to do this but like sometimes people do something and they just they have it in their head that it's gonna be okay and they don't understand how other people gonna perceive it and it's not it's not that they did it with bad intentions it's just that they fucked up and I didn't want I didn't think about like you having to fucking run interference with me against your wife it's like I'll tell you right now they're hard enough time cooking the biggest thing that that fucked me up about it yeah the biggest thing was was the amazing fruit it was that when it happened yeah I knew I was gonna have to take care of you like I knew that I knew that having a blog I knew that all the implications of what was about to trickle down and that was the one thing when I was like why why would you make my life more complicated and I told you on the phone and by the way no one said this other than me I said this to myself and I've said this to Joe a million times is that that moniker of like you think I'm weak so it's my biggest fucking thing of like people to go in my head and I would go I know Joe doesn't say that no Tom doesn't say that and I know you don't say that but in that moment I was like is he doing what these enemies do to me where he just thinks I was some fucking weak comic just rips a short advantage of your good nature right and that was and that was the thing and when you when I was on the phone with you I was in Connecticut I was with Shane in the car and I told you that you said oh my god I would never I would never think cuz I share that with you prior but I was sure of publicly now but shared both it with you privately your response I knew you didn't I knew that's why you didn't do that and I was like alright I can get past this which is a big thing for me to go I can get past this and then it took a little bit to just go still mad though no a certain point I thought it's just a reward like does Ari bring more to my life than that one stupid fucking moment right now and I said yeah he does you bring a lot to my life Ari you don't know that I don't share that maybe enough with you we bring up a lot to my life and and and of all you guys do I mean you guys this our friendship means a lot to means a lot more to me maybe that means to you guys so no I means a lot to me to men does this is this podcast that we do these regular podcasts we do so they're my favorite that's really fun yeah the chat thread dude I'll tell you fucking to text message it's fucking awesome great oh my god don't eat that it's illegal the agriculture is gonna come here they have a helicopter but yeah I'm and and I being another word both you like don't eat helicopter here so these guys were I don't know I have to share this both of these guys were very very valuable to me in that moment where I was super vulnerable both of them had a moment where it was fun and then a moment where they called me and they were concerned yeah when when you told me during the podcast I mean what happened to it all just wait like you didn't even want to talk about it until that's when I knew it was serious I still thought it was fun until it was like and then Tom's like what the fuck's wrong with you was like and I was like wait is this serious business if you were working in HR at the at a fucking Network and you guys went on the Christmas party and he drugged somebody that's the end of your fucking career man free drugs free drugs free drugs to someone yeah but yeah yeah yeah yeah I knew he was really upset about it too you know and yeah when you told me afterwards like oh he's really fucked up but I also wanted also wanted really badly for you guys make up yeah I spoke to everyone both of you yeah yeah yeah I Tom called me it was like hey I saw you I called you every day trying to like you call me every day yeah I really take my call and Tom is like hey I saw you called don't I just I just knew that it was wrong it was wrong for me to answer cuz I didn't know what to say to you and I was and I was I wasn't right in the head yet and I was like I was like I'm not I'm really angry but I'm not mad at like it mad at him does that make sense yes and I was like I feel victimized by no I'm not a victim I know that this is gonna be fine i call Whitney I talk to Whitney about it like how did she say you know calm please no no we were we were in agreement in the backseat my story's a felony I'm like you think that's the only felling ever committed hello hey put that down don't film it we were in the backstage at the Comedy Store or in the back bar and we saw David Spade and Whitney and I talked when I was on high O'Malley and I was you were having a great time I was having a blast like you thought David Spade there you're like oh I've got a great story for David Spade I've always been sexually attracted to him and this is my moment whenever David Spade I can't hear you say that now when I heard you say on the podcast I got mad at you I was like I was like it's so fucked up man it's so fucked up there's so many complex moments in this where you're right you're totally right David Spade was back there and me and you were back there and I was like I got drunk my Molly and then do you follow up on his show and it's like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and even the podcast I was like I was conflicting so I go this is super compelling content but you so mad at you for doing this but I see it now I see this is good this is the best podcast but I was like and in in retrospect I was like I can't I can't release it I don't want to be the guy that people come on my show and they go I'm gonna fuckin drug him in that no it's a one-time only thing but but I talked to Whitney and Whitney was like Whitney oddly enough said exactly what Joe said and said this is really it's not right man it's not right it's you shouldn't be drugging people in front of their kids she was like I'm sorry I didn't say that I didn't say that to you in the green in the thing I didn't know how you felt and that's how Jim felt that's also our Tom felt is like I didn't I didn't know how I felt so I brought all these energies of like I got drugged and then everything's on the table and everyone's like I got to figure out your fucking emotions and I hadn't figured them out yet I I got to be honestly the man you when you lean on friends and you come out of a place like that you go in a weird way I was like I feel a lot closer the four of us after that and I'm like I'm definitely I'm glad that's together you drugged us all together you brought us closer metaphorical weirdos and the funny part is I was like I was like he wanted to kill sub rocktober but now he's gotta do it for the rest of his fucking life because he didn't win we're always gonna do so Brecht oh no no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah every here Ari every how you drugged him in front of us rug me in front of my children what drug MDMA it's used likes a roofie fucked up his brain for like weeks yeah I'm still doing the deal with OCD shit I rolled it and I think you could do this you could chloroform him that would be if you can get that online doc you're drugging that would be that's a drug that would be oh no no don't do that I will say anyone at home doing MDMA is your friend is 5-htp I told Burt but he was not in a place where he's calm that has diverged to pee in it 5htp will equalize your mood and I meant to bring it with me and I didn't and I fucked up hard I pride myself on the dosing people the right way and I was like I was we were feeling like really good we were feeling really good I did feel really good during though it was a fun time you are next to Sarah watch a stunning sunset over Joey Diaz head as brothers only isn't more beautiful in on my death bed by 6 M seconds of memories through your life I hope I see Joey Diaz like Jesus crowd like Buddha just going listen cocksucker if you would add a stroke it would already happened but I didn't know you're freaking out you handled it like a profession option there captain no but you were like you handle like a pro but that's what drawing us downs they knock you over yeah hmm can't wait see so are we gonna do this next year yeah student should you worry Jeannie where do you want it let's do a mid-month like let's do a mid-year month and do a fun here's here's what I'm saying yes I agree with that that's way easier to do it I think you're like June or something like an on touring month yeah but sober October is what we've been calling that's gonna do that an October I'll do it in October again as well I don't mind we could do it any time you like doing gigs as much when you can't mother why I haven't smoked pot in 16 days why I've been in Columbia it's suck doing Europe without being able to just yeah there's always a reason why you won't do it but I'm saying I'll over Yankee playoffs games visiting love it you love what I love so October you love the month ILA's love having an excuse not to get drunk every fucking night let's stop right there are you really doing that every night getting drunk no not every night but on the road when especially you to Boston you show us today no you do this thing where you invite everybody to a bar afterwards you're wild I like that are wild you're the only one who goes out with your friend tom has a general disdain for fans where you won't touch them or look at the many things and beneath them but like actually little grass with them Bryce we used to do photos with everybody after shows when I first started do it shows you the ice house you would you were the most generous human being you'd sit in line guys like Joe want to talk to you one quick second about happiness how this Chicago theater I did Chicago theater 3700 people 40 was like line it up they were line up two levels yeah hours hours taking pictures of people but it got weird it got too weird and too many people just the podcast got to this weird strange space where people would come to me was like ten page letters and proposals of things that we needed to do together and they just wanted too much of you they just could and I just realized like I got a step away from that I'm not there I like to I like to name a bar give them do like to get fucked up you know so like you after the show want to get fucked up and party I said well it turns her back sober and hang out it's just not drink I'm saying I would have a lot more fun with this if we did in January but starts up I'll do it this january i don't you fuck we could do it in january we don't have to do sober october okay we could do jan you what's your Australia though that's fine we're doing this like in a couple days no no Jesus January would be a lot just New York my fucking Mickey Mantle brain was like come in unless if I could do it lose weight let's get January's world carnivore month that's one thing that I've thought about doing is date there's a lot of people that are just eating meat oh nothing but me yeah I think that once a month and I how'd you go didn't shit well at all for a month yeah yeah yeah yeah you didn't shit for a month I shit for the first like week or so and then like that once every like week after that it's not shit like when they came out for your color world carnivore they were dried out rotten inside of you like cadaver fucking cancer lungs I like that I will say we can do it January I'll have I'll personally have a lot more fun with it as a New Yorker October honestly probably the best drinking month of the year so it's extra hard for me but if we do in January it's great and if we have a real competition it would be even better the problem with real competition says I'm crazy but something you can actually do the thing I loved about what we did last month was that last October was that it was I felt very untethered from the group in competition wise so it was fun for me is fun okay let's plan it out the class I said we're doing separate thing that was the most starting February 8th I will be gaining weight and you guys will be losing weight first against me right yeah great I'll be dunk my special okay first one that passed me I'll weigh in every day so I'm gonna get down to 190 but you'll pass me first but in help you say wait what do you think you can get up to I've been up top I've been to 240 before Wow pull that picture up Jamie I remember I remember those in college oh no no you got fat I got I know I've been like 220 oh yeah I remember and he's eatin candy she's eating candy all day a lot of candy a lot of candy all right and then he just quit eatin candy and I was like that motherfuckers got a willpower that's one thing when we did this over October fitness challenge honestly like legitimately Ari was the only one I was worried about why cuz you're crazy does I remember I remembered you and you said when you lose I know you don't like to lose yeah you get very serious we play pool and even though I'm a better pool player than Ari I would give him the seven eight and nine we would gamble so we play 9-ball and I'd have to run all the balls and sink the nine to win but Ari could win if he sent the seven the eight or the nine such giant advantage is a huge difference in blue your play areas he would get very competitive and then I bought him a year jiu-jitsu once for Christmas or Hanukkah or whatever the fuck you celebrate and you know it's Hanukkah whatever a theist it's nonsense he's nonsense anyway so we were doing jiu-jitsu in here it got fucking very serious like we were rolling together like he's really trying well he's very competitive Ari's very good but like he's got a very strong mind and I was like this mother we're not doing anything we're like you have to get better at a physical skill or you know you have to do so it's it's it's very simple all you have to do is have willpower to stay at 80 percent of your max heart rate for a long time and that's all willpower that's really all it is or if you're smart enough to distract yourself like far we figured out how to watch movies that was a big game changer and the fucking thing on the strap yeah once you figured out how to watch movies while you're on the treadmill yeah it wasn't annoying to have to constantly be like that challenge part none of us expected that to tell all of us to go for it it was so first off each other it was so crazy when you got the flu and then you came back from the flu in round 13 fucking miles that's why this year yeah that's that's little competition cuz everybody's girlfriend or wives was like no no no yeah everybody up mad the whole family yeah plus I was just crazy man I was so into it I just like opened up that door I opened up that door that I didn't I hadn't opened up that door and fucking decades who do you think will pass me first and wait between the two of you me you think him too hmm yeah I always just become obsessive compulsive about it hmm it's uh it's not super fun but I'm cool with it if I know got nothing to do do it and how far you gonna get I mean hopefully one of them stuff how great would it be if we didn't lose anyway just past your 180 you have to gain 25 pounds just to get the birds target weight oh my god target weight - I want you to look at this someone if they go that way you're right Tom might have done something a little early that we'll talk about in a minute but this stacks of stakes I was in the bathroom what the fuck happened I don't know Jamie what Jamie what happened you motherfucker I thought you cunts I didn't do any what you saw the way and you walked in stock tailing it number Oh watch the video tomorrow this is bullshit he leaned on my shoulder wait how'd you notice my idea isn't well you got lucky October this year I remember now you're gonna say so I saw Tom weighing in and I went oh that's why I should weigh in he's weighing in you motherfuckers yeah I would never do something like that today I thought to myself I'd only cheat on my wife if I was with you on the road
