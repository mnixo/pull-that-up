hello freak bitches but it's just like those same people who'll be like you're like against women like I would never in a million years go out to a show and be like I'm just rooting for the men today like I don't think this way I'm not like I'm team man but you are on Team women like it's just it just seems to me that there's a lot of that going on you know what I mean a lot of that shit where it's like you kind of projected this thing that you see racism everywhere or you see sexism everywhere but all I really see is you fucking lecturing people based on race in their mind they're allowed to do it the same way Cain Velasquez allowed to have brown pride in his chest yeah kind of the same thing like you're you're disenfranchised or you're marginalized so you're allowed to stay even if you're not you playing that victim card as a woman and you're allowed to say I'm here to support my girl like I was talking about this on stage of the day I saw a bumper sticker on a car it said girls kick ass and I was like some of them yeah some of them are lazy slobs like what are you gonna line yourself with 150 million women just in this country alone that's ridiculous I'm saying if a guy had a bumper sticker I said boys kick ass he'd be like follow that guy and find out where he's been fucking these kids cuz you first of all you'd never say boys boys kick ass you put that in a your bumper stay with a fuck are you you pull him over let me see your license where do you live man what do you do for a living what's that bumper sticker about what the fuck do you mean by that yes and I don't need like I almost feel like an ass well sometimes when I preface everything with a disclaimer like and I'm not saying this I'm not but I just want to be clear I'm not saying there aren't exceptions to the rule but it's also kind of strange to me that like if you want to celebrate women why are you celebrating such a masculine quality like it's kind of like it's like look there are right players who are great basketball players right there are white Dirk Nowitzki was an amazing basketball player but if I just wrote somewhere like white people kick ass at basketball it's like well actually was it movie in general women don't kick ass in general and generally speaking that's a male thing to do right so I'm not saying there's not exceptions to that but you're like you're writing white people kick ass at basketball it's kind of misleading they don't have the same feelings about culture appropriation as some people do with fucking braids yeah yeah I get it what but it's the United States right we're sent over super-sensitive we've gotten very since you know what it is it all comes from the litigious culture that's that's absolutely the fact that you can get sued for anything anybody can sue you at any time that's just like that's American culture that's what you do it's like you know what you pissed off someone like enough you can sue them like and so there's a lot of like suing Saints had enough successful cases along the way that's part of it's like a fear-based operating system right so hauling people on shit yeah maybe they didn't even think was bad yeah it's a combination of like someone like it's a good service to be able to sue someone if you need it to however it's abused up the yin-yang and there's like professional lawyers they have billboards everywhere but do you think Katy Perry was worried about being sued no I'm saying that I'm saying that the sensitivity is she like like why why we're so what American culture is so like PC at this point because there's a it kind of goes hand in hand it's like a sense of well I don't know I'm at a loss over to stone but but I will say it's it having that litigious fear based kind of motivator or it causes people to want to correct things like to course-correct to to a form of something that works for everyone to avoid being sued to of I mean not me not directly not directly but that thought process yeah that monster yeah that mindset I think this cuz it's about like okay well how can we make this we have to include everybody on this which I believe in but absolutely but but I think it should be done out of a sense of empathy you know and not to say that that that you know people fighting for rights to have handicap parking like in the front of a building like that's it there's snake that's just a great idea but like I'm just saying that the what we what you were kind of referring to that sensitivity come comes from that where someone's like afraid of doing something wrong yeah and it just starts feeding back and feeding Matic feeding back and then you get people so fearful at any choice that they're making and who was it was at Roosevelt who tried to no it was Rob southerners weren't lazy just infected with hookworm story of the postbellum South as told by Paris holy shit yeah it makes your teeth fall out and it is where your brain god stereotypes are almost always the conclusion of lazy science they're just empirical generalizations that are stripped of their variances and encoded as fact into the collective consciousness of the general population they're the two buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh however sometimes a stereotype reveals a hidden truth that provides an origin to the myth the trope of the lazy southerner dates back to America's postbellum period following in the Civil War no one really knows where it came from but the image of lethargic filthy drawling farmer has pervaded art literature and popular culture until up until this very moment so one argument recently published by Rachel Neuer for PBS Nova Tex presents some compelling evidence for the theory that a hookworm epidemic was responsible for the rural stereotype holy shit JZ n√©stor the exhaustion and mental fogginess attends to inflict upon its victims historical evidence shows that the parasite ravaged the American South throughout the early 20th century as a result of poor sanitation and lack of public health programs among the poor thankfully by 1905 the parapsychologist that's a job I'm a joke apologist Charles says as we forty percent or more not sixty percent I was wrong of the southern population was infected with hookworms the parasite thrives in fecal matter and the combination of shoddy waste disposal in the rarity of shoes shoes no shoes allowed hookworm larvae to enter people's bodies through the webbing between their toes how far once they penetrated skin they travel through their hosts lungs and into their intestines where they survive on a diet of blood they suck out from the intestinal wall a female hookworm can lay up to ten thousand eggs in a single day which gives you an idea of how rampant a localized infestation can become in a very short time the laziness that is synonymous with hookworm hookworm infection is a synonym of iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss holy shit yeah getting bled out yes 40% of people were anemic and had blood loss the poor malnourished victims the parasite can cause stunted growth that's right children with hook worms were plagued with attention deficit disorders lower IQ and the infected often had strange food cravings for dirt clay paper and chalk how nuts is that southern states were the Nexus of warm friendly climate as the parasite loved the sandy soil that makes the route with the region's over at all in 1910 7.5 million southerners had hookworms oh my god how nuts is that that's insane insane yes the Rockefeller is who donated money to try to combat it but that's the Illuminati isn't he like maybe this is all scam everybody started 50 years for the worm to be eradicated from the South 1960 it was eradicated oh my god because of the sanitation issues look at that almost entirely freed from hookworms by 1985 yeah that was 20 20 years ago that's so recently it's completely insane yeah isn't it yeah it's never she's gonna grab my head and forced me to eat her pussy yeah great thought though isn't it being made to do it that's what my greatest being made to yeah sniff it you have someone do that I have it yeah it was all right not bad not that no
