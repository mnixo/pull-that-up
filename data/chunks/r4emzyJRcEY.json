to the fleshlight website enter in the code name Rogan and you get 15% off oh here we go good freaks Neal Brennan is in the house already at the party started [Music] and go no Bremen wah you film this too right yes it's on Ustream right now yeah thanks behind the door we used to do it on the couch where you see it a big view of all three of us at once but I saw that with Stanhope I think yeah it's not with somebody and it was it seemed seemed odd at best the couch is wicked uncomfortable it just wasn't good it wasn't good for talking you think that a couch would be like really comfortable to sit in but nothing can fuck with a good office chair yeah I think that office chairs figured out you know you can get in this sucker and you know it's it supports your back your arms have a good comfy place to rest it's way better to sit in office chairs office chair is now sponsored the show correct you should wait that's a flashlight I think I think movie theaters are fake figuring it out too now because they used to have like really good comfortable chairs where you could have like the thing that goes up where you put your drink in yes you can make it a couch the other day I went to a theater and they had torn out all those chairs and went back to the old style where you can't move the the the armrests anymore and I was like wondering why and then you think about it was a lot more comfortable though like the actual chair part so now I would think they're just designing what theater was that the Universal CityWalk they yeah that's probably they were dealing with too many douche bags doing stupid things to those cupholders yeah and I think by douche bags you mean Mexicans I was gonna say Mexicans but I'm glad you did instead there is no more if you want if you're from out of town you like you're from Illinois and no we don't have a lot of Mexicans out in Joliet this is what you need to do just for a fuckin goof take a trip come to Hollywood and the first thing I need you to do is go to a movie at City Walk I'm like a Friday night yeah and there's two things going on there's the movie and then there's the show where the young Mexican kids are yelling out at the stage trying to make each other laugh yeah which is funny it's annoying I mean again it prepared for it yeah if you've heard from people yell funny shit up I was with a girl once and she yelled out I've heard of people yell funny shit out too but I was with a girl and she yelled out at these guys that were talking while the movie was going on and she didn't tell me she was gonna do it either she just turned and and this is when I first moved to Hollywood to I was fuckin ultra paranoid I'd heard all these crazy things like when you're driving down the street if you guys will drive with their headlights off and when you flash them to let them know that the headlights are on well it's a gang initiation thing they have to find you and kill you that's because I was out here then 93 yeah that's like where get like NWA and all that shit yeah hot and it was it was scary it was I mean I don't know if it was all paranoia but it was like it felt different there's a lot of posers there's a lot of people that were really legit gangsters like I've read up there's a great book about the the Crips and the Bloods a history of gang banging in LA it's a fascinating book I'm sorry I forgot the title of why there was an HBO documentary - that was really good yeah but it's mean it's been going on since forever you know I mean just it is the way it is but when rap music and gangsta rap got really popular that was when like the whole country started to be aware of this and then people started acting like them yeah you know so anyway did the point is I'm in this movie theater so I'm with this girl she's nice girl she's misguided you know excuse me would you please shut up we're trying to watch this movie I'm like oh fuck which she misguided for saying that or for going of saying that both both clearly but clearly for going you know and immediately yeah yeah your responses yeah and I'm like I'm gonna die she had done a couple of things like this before she was like cutoff people and traffic and shit like if someone got in front of her she would like speed up go into the oncoming lane and cut them off yeah she was fucking crazy and maybe it's Chicago things she was from Chicago how long dated for like a year nice girl she was a nice girl other than that it was weird cuz most the time she was super friendly but when she felt like anybody was fucking with her she would get like really angry and and like go to ten like you said like right away you know what I think they need a movie theaters going back to that is that they needed I know that you're supposed to turn off your cell phones during movies like that but instead of if you see some guy ruining the movie that the worst thing is actually having a Gilo out - ah sure imagine being able to like text it we're going the text of projection as hey just so you know it's fucking quiet in here or yeah we're encouraging texting and completely I completely agree but it should be like only for emergencies you know like no you can't ensure that people go to emergency you know to use it only during emergency so you give people the option to text I mean look look at fucking YouTube comments that's what you gonna get in your text yeah you're gonna get those same retards they're just you know the worst yeah I don't care people text during a movie really don't care I care if they're near me mad I don't like a blue light as long as they're not right as long as it's not I'd way rather than text than talk yes I agree cuz I love to text so I guess I enjoy it and I don't want to I certainly don't an iPhone yeah I'm rocket and iPhone okay you don't fuck with droids look I fuck with a droid yeah I fuck with the HTC EVO 4G haja loggin they should be ashamed of themselves releasing a telephone with that crappy battery yeah shamed of themselves it's not bad the fact that it even went to market yet this iPhone is the best anything I've ever had that's a problem of all the four G's and androids all the four G's and and Android phones all have this usually have the worst battery life mostly because of the screen I would spend most of the day managing the better I had a dried for a day the Droid 2 with the slide-out keyboard for one day and I brought it back to him I was like you gotta be fucking kidding me the battery I played with it for 20 minutes out of the full battery and it had half a battery life and yeah 20 minutes yeah that's ridiculous and they're like oh you need to download you know come on fuck I do yeah you guys need to get your shit together yeah why can't they figure that shit out at all I don't know but I can't figure out how to shut people to fuck up in movies I mean look we can put a man on the moon now but try to get Mexicans to have funny shit keep Mexicans out of city wok the phone itself though is pretty good right mmm other than the battery of the iPhone no the HTC EVO no I was always nervous about it was like I worked for the phone like look I gotta get I should lick it off because I don't want my phone to act crazy like this is it was fine yeah we were always worried about the battery life constantly yeah I'm still a little bit worried about it that is a fucking terrible feeling when you're looking down and your shit says 10% battery life left and like you're out yeah oh yeah I'm Cinderella right now actually it's gonna try midnight and my phone's gonna turn into a turkey I was gonna go with the Back to the Future thing if like my hands disappearing but it was that when Marty McFly yeah yeah yeah it's like you have that picture when you time-traveling you always have to look at make sure you're not like destroying so you're you're an older guy Cinderella's more of a reference for you have daughters young guys we keep up with the hot movies like Back to the Future about 26 years ago yeah the guy does stand-up Biff from Back to the Future yeah does stand-up yeah I always see him at the comedy store you guys yeah real nice guy I've never seen him at the store oh yeah is he there I've seen him four times there what is his name I fuck I don't know but he yes he's real nice and actually there was I know how many people hate this but they had that this class there you know that talk comedy to people or and stuff like that and he actually was making an appearance to do like a speech was the last time I saw him there right no you were taking the class no I was just outspokenness you were teaching the class no I was just there hanging I don't have any problem with classes a lot of people do and they say that the people that are teaching the classes are losers and that's why the teaching the class is and they have nothing real to teach I think anything that lets people just try it and in some people like some sort of a structure and that is a structure the structure of a classroom you know you're curious you know you have a job you don't like Tommy the Tri open mic night it's calling class I'll just sign up for that and that's step yeah I think it just it's not like everyone that comes out of it's awful yeah it's not like they're they're good comedians that have come out of it sure I don't I can't remember any of them but like here's what I'll say that are they have the top 20 comedians of all time gone to comedy class no yeah it's not necessary no but it's not you know it's a start it's a start it's any sort of it's any sort of a jump start there's something about comedy man that's just very daunting the idea of getting up for the first time with all your own words and no one helping you some people like hold my hand hold my hand get me on the stage you know yeah that's all they need they need so it'll help yeah so go ahead and anyhow this we're sponsored by Neal Brennan and Joe Rogan its comedy club yeah we're gonna start one up next week you you start a comedy later in your life are you did you grab on to it quickly or were you always in the scene and I was always and that's how I know I've known old man Rogan here for uh nine eighty nine yeah he's still work I would work the door at the Boston comedy club for Barry Katz I made two hundred thirty-five dollars a week which did Barry take a cut so so yeah so I was always just around it and but I was I don't think that I I was more like shy and retiring and like you guys go ahead I kiddin I could never read I also I also judge my own desire for attention be like what a low impulse right I want attention from strangers and then you know and then at a certain point I was like I want to but also I was sick of other parts of show business telling me that I wasn't funny when I'm was positive I was way if I'd write a script and they'd be like yeah okay and then you'd go to Stanford we had this exact same tone of the conversation with Brian Posehn yesterday we were talking about writing and the idea of delivering stuff to people that aren't funny and they get to judge you on yeah it's funny and how hard it is to make a fuckin TV show it's yeah it's unbelievably hard to get past all these people that have a say you know yeah we'll post a nice top post name we both did two days on the Oscars this year did you oh yeah the Oscar telecast and cuz Jordan Rubin who's a funny dude and I've known him forever was like hey will you come judge sort of supervising so I was like alright Judd Apatow I was like getting Judds good graces do like two days me and post saying they we pitch stuff they use none of it and then I saw Judd like a week later I was like hey are you doin anything with that Oscar saying he's like I don't know they send me shit but um so I was like okay it's they use Judd to like get you get everybody else and then yeah and then it ended up being an atrocity the funniest part was I was just shitting on it on Twitter just going off on it like and do like being really funny and then it the telecast ends and it's like written by Neil Brown I was like you have to waste a year ago did you have to write the fake conversation so we try to come up a conversations completely most of them are wholly sort of patter yeah like I'm here we're here tonight like the the the guy well I should say literally I've never watched an award show ever I've been in development I've been in like the spike award shows a couple of those right I've never watched one everything's great I almost didn't do the Oscars thing because I hate award shows so much because I think they're awful yes yeah exactly they're just they just make everyone that's not their feel like shit yeah and they encourage losers to like you can dream and you can be here no you can't unless you have crazy talent you can't beat it I don't have any problem with that aspect of it my problem with it is first of all the idea of judging art is ridiculous yeah because it's so subjective and it's so inside and what you get is you get the the people that judge it have so much influence over what gets released because there's people that target those people with their work yes because they know that these type of movies get this type of well that's what's funny is having cast and and Ben is and it drives me crazy and I even say you know it's crazy I see it in podcasts well people will cast who like in movies they'll cast the person from the hot TV show so if there's a movie they're like you know we should get a guy from the wire right and it's like oh what a great idea yeah how do you think I remember what I was pitching when you pitch to direct a movie a directed movement called the goods that Piven was in Kalin I love him thank you very much it's funny people didn't see it but and so I remember I was pitch when you pitch to direct the movie you have to go like some casting ideas and for one of the casting ideas I was like you know it would be great in this part is Warren Beatty like that's a great idea how did you think of that it was like I watched the movies and I saw Warren baby like but that's an idea you know what I mean it's like it's a fucking sheet of paper and it's like he's good he's like a but the idea that they they go like we got to get the guy from the wire we gotta get the guy from the office like everyone from the office then they're the only people in comedy with value is like cuz they're the critically acclaimed show yeah that and then people can't even see straight where they're like Tina's a great Tina's Tina is really funny but they're like Tina's amazing all that Palin stuff that she wrote she didn't write it Seth wrote it Seth Meyers wrote it like but the idea that you can't it just becomes like did you someone said to me today did you see what trace of what Tina said about Tracy yeah it was fine like condemning Tracy Rob but these people just get such a markup which you've probably never gotten I would get it during Chappelle show it was like what's next for you what do you mean by a markup you get like I'm you get upgraded automatically like everything my ideas are better because of because of that just automatically yes I agree with you I agree with you about like the office and every corel movie has to be brilliant he's always hilarious that's why I like no-name actors like remember when we first saw it what 300 like like all these actors well yeah yeah like brand new do you hate that dude now yeah I know but you know fuck out of me now I'm sure he's a great guy I don't hate I'm just saying yeah every time I see him and some fucking stupid Jennifer Aniston movie yeah a goofy smirk of his Ellie's lips all fucked up get out of here Elliott too from super8 he's brand new kid never been been in a movie already can tell that kid's gonna be in movies now there's like a bunch of actors resume and well yeah it's funny like what they you do good work or personal work and then they'll go like I always used to say to Chappelle and most def after we do a sketch I'd be like fellas it was a great sketch Hollywood called and they want you to play cops like like Hollywood calls and then you're fuckin upgraded into some shit you didn't want the first place but you're so award shows and shit like II and Entertainment Tonight it's good for your career you should do it nobody but it yeah but it like trains you to it brainwash as you into thinking like that Hollywood is valuable and you just fuckin walk like a zombie tour I like where do I stand here now Hollywood pussy and that's when that's when the game changes that's when it does become valuable yeah you know when you go into a club and everybody goes fucking do you ever seen Chuck Liddell in a club yeah like months ago I saw you've seen Chuck Liddell in the club you and you see that level of Fame you know Chuck Liddell the MMA fighter yeah see that's what's funny is I would mean nothing to me like you could but you're not a young horse could be Chuck Liddell are you yes so do young whores go crazy how's it go because I wouldn't even think girls would know an MMA I know you're you're the exact opposite but I'm not I'm not for it against it I just am out of it a huge percentage of girls know who those guys are huge it's a big you're also in that world also like like my girlfriend doesn't know who any of these people are and either did the prior or the prior you like none of them did like yeah there is a point those are girls that are willing to fuck you broad we're talking about it's not mean the real trash there's not many girls Leschi and tired ease we're human flesh let's go ahead there's definitely a huge bigger percentage of male yeah yeah for sure yeah my point is the reason why these guys wants to get into movies and these get big and they start going to clubs and yes fucking we have a guy calling the winner's circle where it's just like everyone's you're in the winner's sir like literally you I it's like it's remember that Eddie Murphy sketch where they're like silly Negro when he dresses up like a white guy and and he he'd like the world turns around and he gets a bank loan and all that immediately because he's white and and the banker goes a black he had just turned down a black guy to go silly Negro anyway how much money I mean we gots and he just starts throwing money at any white Eddie that's what it's like to like be successful they like the old rules don't apply to you I remember going to shows with Chappelle and people and they and or Piven and they people literally don't they don't ask for tickets they don't it's like you do whatever you want walk right in do you can't this is so legit it's fine yeah come on you're good you're good that's a oh yeah you're good it's fascinating stuff yeah Vegas it's the craziest well yeah exactly I've been to Vegas with Pavin a couple times and it really is like one time the best me and Piven we were doing when we were doing the goods we went out for a fight for I think it was Ricky Hatton and Floyd Mayweather which was a hilarious fight mostly because all the Ricky Hatton fans like booed the national anthem it was like hilarious it's like movie funny like with it like doing villainous shit where they're booing the national and they brought like a kettledrum I mean was awesome so we we flew private which is also great and when you fly private you're like in a it's basically like going to a rental car place where they don't really say like you have to line up you just they just go what's your wing number and you go s J whatever they go yeah the planes out there so they're like yeah the planes out me and Piven are killing time just kind of fucking around and then we're like we should go into the plane we get on the plane Sly Stallone has been waiting for us yeah celestial one's been waiting for us so that they can it was like the Planet Hollywood jet we end up going flying to a fight in Vegas Planet Hollywood has a jet because they were like falling apart at one point I'm yeah they're like before they I don't know I and maybe they just turned out of the casinos maybe was flies jet yeah I don't know oh yeah no it was to go to the casino so the casino is sending you guys out for what for an event or sending it was it was getting sly and then they were like and get Piven was there an event or something it was a fight oh the fight so they were flying you in for the fight yeah I guess they were flying flying and oh wow we we hopped a ride so they've so I get upset at you know he was he was real cool about it he's a funny dude I met him once that's funny yeah he's very gay the thing that's great thing about him is he understands who he is to people yeah he doesn't I mean he'll go like hey I'm Rocky yeah instead of like hey that was a long time ago and like he understands like he knows what anecdotes people want to hear and shit like he seems very genuinely friendly to yes and happy yeah yeah fun yeah a really enjoyable go to and look guys he's gonna fly in a private jet deal with sly yeah 64 and fucking shredded this is yeah the cocoa butter does he smell like cocoa butter yeah he seems like he would smell like a cocoa bomb I wasn't sure car he doesn't not smell like cocoa butter all right I wouldn't rule it out okay he's what I call our canary in a coal mine we've never seen a 64 year old look like that before yeah who knows like his face looks like meat art like bacon for head it really is like his nose is made of like mutton well there's certainly something going on with his forehead there's been times when it was shiny and immobile which always disturbs the fuck out of me like well is that guy you think that's HGH that's good Botox right okay surgery and Botox what are you into these days what's your cocktail my cocktail yeah I go to I've described us on the podcast but so in brevity I go to a hormone replacement therapy stand what they do is they look at your hormone levels and they first of all they give you vitamin and adjust your nutrition that's the first step how often do every couple months I get blood work done and then go and have all my stuff checked and once you will they adjusted as much as they can with nutrition which can make a huge difference especially eating shitty food you'd be amazed at how much that lowers your testosterone lowest your human growth room oh really yeah shitty died its I'm be incredibly been so are you yeah and then once he adjusts you enough with nutrients then they give you very small levels of human growth hormone testosterone thyroid I have hypothyroidism so I was taking thyroid medication before this and all it does is it basically brings your hormone levels up to a healthy man of like 25 to 30 years old and as you get older you know your body just stops producing hormones it's it's really simple it's and it's preparing you for death basically and you can either choose to accept that and just let your body slowly kind of deteriorate or you can replace the hormones yeah that's I honestly want to do that see it is like it's it's it's a health move it affects so many aspects of our life any side of have there been yeah there is side affects your bones he's so good with a better lip some with the liver it's one of those steroids can give you liver but those are all world known this stuff is oral oral this the the deliver stuff is the stuff that your liver has to process because you're eating it for the most part one of the side effects is having a podcast go ahead yes that's number one well if you the side effects come from abuse the side effects of all performance-enhancing drugs come from abuse if steroids and performance-enhancing drugs were as dangerous as they said people would be dropping in the fucking streets right you know where are the bodies when you hear about these pro wrestlers dying it's not steroids that are killing them and these guys are on massive doses steroids it's pills for the most part unless it's suicide you know a lot of them they're dealing with concussions and all sorts other stuff and a lot of them get very depressed but the the abuse is what's really dangerous as long as you're going to a doctor and as long as you're eating really healthy and monitor your nutrients you got it you got to give your body the tools to repair itself it's so important you so many people don't eat any fucking vegetables they don't eat shit and this is why Brock Lesnar who was the UFC heavyweight champion he had this diverticulitis because of his bad diet he had a diet where he would only eat meat he would eat slight diverticulitis is it's in you have basically protein gets stuck in your gut and it starts creating abscesses and it can you know eat a hole through your fucking stomach and with him it got so bad that he almost died got hospitalized they thought they were gonna have to give him surgery on and then they decided they didn't but then because of all his training when he's training it starts to flare up again cuz once you have it apparently it can recur so they had to remove 12 inches of his fucking colon 12 inches of his colon this is all diet related you know in his case they used it for Stallone's face but this guy's diet was so it's fucked him up so bad and and some people are absolutely correct it's not always diet related doing someone II pointed this out that you can it can be a congenital thing but it wasn't in his case in his case it was he didn't he'd need fuckin vegetables he didn't eat broccoli he didn't need any fiber you gotta clean your system out so for me it's it does first of all it helps your immune system it keeps you from getting sick it helps you recover from things you know and when you're doing it correctly and properly with the right nutrients and very low levels everything is a very low level you can't get crazy with any end when you're doing it it helps you you feel better you have more energy you feel like you enjoy life more you're happier you know it's it's so simple it's like the reason why people are old and cranky is because they're tired as fuck okay their body stopped producing hormones and that's not good you may hate at all ethnic groups can't you just use a new membrane instead or something though what like it just seems to do it right no i but there is negative side effects to it right well look there's not enough people doing it for them to have real studies right are you constantly monitoring all this because I this is pretty hardcore today I would be like on Twitter every day no it's not look people have been substituting hormones forever I mean the thyroid medication has been around forever and people have been doing that forever there's not that much difference between substituting your thyroid hormones or substituting pituitary hormone you know what I've been doing is that it's deer antler spray you know that helps supposedly yeah yeah all right let's break boseley pumps up your HDH levels i and i find that if i just jog for even a couple miles you can get it you can order it online cuz it was a taste like I taste kind of delicious doesn't taste bad yeah because controversy whether or not it works a lot of football players use it but you know some people do believe that it does work maybe in small levels Wow but that's been actually I just find like when I exercise they can recover quicker really yeah you really feel a difference that much yeah it's funny cuz I stopped doing it for a while and then I was like why am i sore it was because I I mean at least empirically that was it it's you know it's right now it's at a stage where if there's a lot of experimental shit going on with hormone replacement therapy I mean obviously it wasn't around for our parents is this generation is the first generation it's sort of experimenting with things like that you and I really I'm on guard a bit we're on the edge bro I you I I said what do you what do you how do you fight what is it duty physically doing that you feel much better you feel healthy you recover better I mean I've always been a guy who exercise and I've always been in shape so I never really let myself get to a position where I ever got frail or got out of shape I sort of adjusted along the way as I realized that I was getting older and then I wasn't recovering as fast I was starting to get injured more and I started looking into it and so for the past like five six years I've been doing it great and you do it like I said as long as you're doing it with low levels and you're it expands yeah it doesn't it's not cheap is it getting less expensive no not really no as it scales out it's not I mean you can read some fucking shit from China that's known as and I wouldn't fuck around with that shit when I was my point was that what is basically is this low-level genetic engineering it's just a tip of it and what we're gonna see over the next decade is some shit that's gonna blow this completely the fucking what is your worst fear with this stuff with with taking this look your worst fear period is death you know but yeah I believe that if you're taking care of yourself and you're watching your your blood levels and your it's it's reasonably safe you know as long as you're doing it with a good doctor and you know what what the risks are and you know what the levels that you're taking are and you know you're crazy that's a lot of people get crazy and this is some things when you see like a guy who's a bodybuilder you see like some big giant guy always giant muscles there's only one way to get those fucking muscles okay I mean Martin work yeah you've got to take monstrous levels of shit where you've got to put your body into a state that's completely unnatural and that's when things start firing it's like having a computer and overclocking and hey man I got a seller on three hundred I'm gonna clock this bitch up to 475 I got these coolers yeah how long does that last those fucking things that go out you know it blows out and that's exactly the like the human body but if you're smart and just keep it within levels you know long as you keep it within healthy levels nothing hyper nothing crazy there's a lot of science behind it there's a lot of studies behind it that show and there's a lot of really intelligent doctors that do do it to themselves and one of them happens to be a very good friend of mine who has been in this business for a while and he you know he's very very well-versed on all the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy and in his point is always the best is like he's like okay here's what's gonna happen if you don't take it you're gonna get old right you're gonna die he goes you're probably gonna die you take it too but you're gonna enjoy that time or you're gonna enjoy that time or you can enjoy your body more yeah that's look I enjoy my body do you really I'm really internal lights down I get a huge kick out of my own human body what's your take on this Weiner character pulling his cock out and taking pictures here it is don't if you're a guy don't take a picture of your cock no because a girl doesn't really want to see it girls want to see like maybe they might want to see your ass like but more than anything they want to see like girls need their aesthetic so they need like lighting and fucking shadow you know what girls want to say they want to see that that muscle sure you know the name of the muscle where like it looks like your lower abdominal area like they want a rat yeah the ramp give them the ramp abs they want abs I want rip they don't want cock all right so that I would say don't do it don't ever just be like sorry baby I gotta go to sleep or whatever a friend of mine I'm sorry I've didn't to rub because a friend of mine it's married and he's a great guy and he doesn't cheat on his wife he's a comic and this girl sent him an email oh you're so hilarious blah blah blah blah blah well I would love to take you for a ride you know you know lol and so he emails back like hey that's very nice but I'm married Thanks and so then she starts saying oh well I totally understand and I think that's really awesome and you're married and you know and I I totally completely respect that and then well you're hilarious anyway send so then an email comes a minute later and it's her in her lingerie lol I totally fucked up and sent you this oh my god I'm so sorry that's sending this so then he like he sends it back well no no harm done then she sends him pictures of her fingers health so then it's like and then she's like come on I wanna see your big fat cock send me a picture a big fat cut at this point I'm like that's a dude okay that's a fucking dude there's a dude who's driving boss you've got you're getting trolled you just went Boston and fucking dude fucking quit he's got his cock in his hand probably a band the other end dude I'm like you you got you're getting trolled son there's a guy who's trying to get a photo of this comedians dick sure and that's what's going on here that's why not percent of time I send fake photos that's what I was gonna say I what I what you do is fellas if you really have to take a picture go get a Playgirl take a picture of a cock in the Playgirl send it and then with the caption mine is similar to this sender uh the blackest one you get yeah and say picture one like this but white and maybe not quite as not quite as big not quite as bandwidth better credit folks we'll be quiet in a movie my car will be quiet in a movie theater hmm so did you it you didn't enjoy the half-baked movie I didn't I didn't enjoy uh not really because you know where'd you get this Segway we well I wanted to bring that up I thought it's one of my favorite movies he didn't he didn't even enjoy it I didn't hear future direct it what did you know I didn't Roni and Chapelle wrote it and yeah it was just we were both like young and we didn't really understand like we should have rewritten it more we kind of got waylaid in term the whole process we just got waylaid like here's who's gonna be in it here's your starting now the here's a director and we didn't know - we didn't know what to stand - time move yeah like we didn't know like to say what fight to fight right and and so it just ended up being there's parts of it I liked but for the most part it just sort of like didn't end up the way I'd hoped or Dave David hoped I think well maybe you might not have got what you wanted but what you got was awesome totally yeah I mean it got demolished at the box office but having said that we open against Titanic yeah we opening Titanic Golden Eye and Good Will Hunting week 3 ask me this answer me yeah the fuck is still gonna see James Bond movies is there a more suspense less boring fucking series of movies where you have nothing invested in it I couldn't give a shit a new guy looks pretty badass like you would like the first or second new one with him really yeah at it I don't know it's pretty bad do you like the Bourne movies no really yeah one guy kicking everybody's ass like that I'm like shut up somebody grab that dude this is its to me it's it's like someone playing guitar in a movie and they don't really know how to play guitar right that shit drives me crazy I have a very hard time watching a movie where one guy is doing all this crazy kung-fu badass shit I'm like stop it stop it stop it it just drives me nuts this guy took on ten people know they would did would grab him that's not how people fight they don't Santa ran you like a retard Wagner wait yeah they fucking dive on you all at once somebody grabs your legs they kick you in the fucking head and then you're unconscious and then they rape them and kill you that's why you make short films you make very high actually films are 15 minutes long he's a guy who thinks he's a badass they break in the warehouse they fucking hold them down they shoot him in the face yeah that's the bro credit yeah and just learnt I lost a lot of money making these movie don't you because they're real people want is real I'll tell you what today you deliver them on the internet it's very cheap to film with the CGI that's available on your iMac you could pull it off what what you're the Joe Rogan action film fucking serious man which is simple I what was that move it what is it Final Cut Pro yeah just the tools and finally what you're talking about is those like those dude who the punch out videos what's his name - black dude who tried to Kimbo just talking about videos with maybe a giant yeah with like when you're in Iraq getting chased by a giant penis yeah like they chase Kimbo and then he punches him I've never been one for trying to come up with movie ideas very reason so um that was your first movie so yeah you did that and then and then I wrote a couple scripts in between there that didn't get made and that was I sold him but they didn't get made and then that was the period where I was like why am I it just was making me a little crazy that's when I started doing stand-up a little bit the but I remember when people if for an idea of how stupid show business is me and a buddy of mine used to were pitch in a movie in 99 2000 and they were like who do you want to be in it we were like Dave Chappelle Will Ferrell and they were like how about Tom Green and Orlando Jones well they were dead serious that's that like heat game that I was talking about it's like Rob green was hot from and as a county where you're like yeah I think Will Ferrell's way funnier than Tom Green like Tom Green's a stunt and they're like what are you talking about stunts they don't even understand what they're looking at but they just go there is a lot of commotion over here right we gotta get it yeah but they don't understand like yeah but to be it takes some other shit and then obviously will and Dave proved to be the the in the law the long money was on them but it was all for sure I think Tom Green if he's very misunderstood I think if you watch his uh that movie Freddy got fingered I think that's a good fuckin movie I think rock Chris Rock loves that movie it's fucking hilarious it's hilarious and crazy and that's it's really who he is I mean he's just as nutty dude I'm ya know getting a bit of an anarchist but you look at his show that show that he did on fuckin basic cable in Canada and then look at his show that he did on MTV I think he's fuckin hilarious he's a yeah no he is just absolutely not utilized correctly which is why he decided to do his own thing that web show but the web showed to me sort of became like The Tonight Show yeah he was trying to make it into something that he really liked not to swear and you know at one point he was he's Carson eing it out yeah it was like he was doing it was just different months gay legs down would have been the the way to go but why did you try to keep it like a big production it's like dude it's trying to do it like everybody else there was a desk and a tie-in right or a suit rather you know it was like that the whole thing was set up like imitating all these ones that were under the confines of broadcast television and other people's opinions and input and now here you have this thing where you have no confine no one's telling you what to do you can do whatever the fuck you want right you're just gonna imitate whatever yeah these old-school Steve Allen guys have done before you that seems silly to me yeah it seems silly to a lot of it's not what he is you know what he is that's funny is Freddy got fingered it's right fucking a dead moose on the side of the highway you know remember that stand up now I haven't yet but it's pretty good I heard I heard well he's doing well you know and it's it's always interesting when someone's you know 39 years old or whatever the fuck they are when we tried to do stand-up for the first time it's kind of weird when you and you're already famous yeah like Charlie Murphy yeah I went on that big Maxim tour with Charlie oh did you really yeah yeah we me him and John Heffron toured the country we did like 20 two gigs together yeah theatres and shit and you know Charlie fucking was 40-something years old yeah before he ever did stand-up comedy and he was famous as fuck before and also his brothers one of the best stand-ups of all time huge movies I mean as a little brother pressure yeah the pressure on him is fucking tremendous and through the roof and all of a sudden this guy goes from being on this TV show to a year into stand-up comedy not even I think nine months he's headlining yeah headlining and doing theaters he's got to do 50 minutes yeah it's fucking crazy yeah yeah ridiculous really hard to it's hard it's the worst way to do whatever it's like what I always said about Brock Lesnar fighting in the UFC you know when Brock Lesnar first started fighting the UFC he went immediately and fought the former champion in his first fight that he's fighting Heath Herring he's fighting he's fighting nothing but killers right away and I'm like you know yeah he can do that but you know what's the best way to do it the best way to do it is to come up through the fucking ranks of smaller shows get less money that's what I'm gonna be fucking people what when I was when when I started doing stand-up again like we were like you should go out and did it I'm just like I don't have the time yeah and I don't want to rip people off good for you now I've got the time and really rip some more people off I need money ya know I I need it so bad so you you weren't doing stand-up when you were one of the when you were the producer to the Chappelle show you weren't doing stand-up that I was jobs the co-creator co-creator and writer whatever you were the Grand Poobah of the show Grand Poobah the CRO Grand Poobah you weren't doing comedy at that time hmm a little by little it mean can when you have a TV show because I didn't know of you as common no I don't know when no one did people are barely starting to get on board now I remember when I did it the first time I did it was that we were just walking down the street we ran into Dave he had a moustache on okay he's like hey Joe you want to be on my TV show the lair show wasn't even didn't even exist and Bobcat Goldthwait was with him right yeah some like directed yeah it's like what i go i only have like a half an hour he's like okay just hold his box so we went out and wandered around and he gave okay yeah this ridiculous yeah Donkey Kong must've I totally forgot you're in there and then the second time I did it I did it with you yeah and we did the fear factor I was actually at the at the the bath the the one Danube the Bobcat one yeah I didn't remember seeing you though yeah but I remember but anyway my point was that I just knew you as Neil you know I didn't I didn't really know what your your yeah gig in life was you know I knew that you worked at the Boston comedy club and yeah and I would also like to note that you were always a really good dude when you didn't when I didn't have credits you're almost exactly you were exactly like you are now like you weren't like you're not you're not one of these like you come on oh you're not a star fucker you're not a credit fucker unless I struggle very hard to be the exact opposite well no but I that's what's I think that's where you live is a testament to in this shithole no no he just lived in the middle of nowhere yeah and by the way I'm too close to people if I could I mean I lived in I talked about this yesterday I lived in the mountains of Colorado for four months that's where I wanted to live last year till my dog got eaten by a mountain lion and my wife got pregnant and because my wife was pregnant by the mountain line the out the crazy week for the crimes trees I'm in denial it was Joe's worst week the mountain lions best week but my instinct is to live in the woods I mean that's where I really would like to live as far away from so I mean I'm not much on Hollywood yeah and then an opportunity to make money yeah and I'm sure you like doing stand-up I love to understand yeah but I love doing stand-up because you know it's not Hollywood man when I was in Vancouver this weekend that's I'm in Vancouver you know I'm saying there's nothing Hollywood about that yeah it's just me and a bunch of cool people in Vancouver and we're having a party and you know I'm telling jokes and everyone's laughing it's great time oh you did a shower you did stand-up and then I did well it did two night to stand up I did one at the VOC theatre it was fucking awesome first time I've ever done an encore never did an encore before I went back out on stage and then badnesses you stole a lot of jokes to do well not stole I don't blame their mind here's something I sir George Carlin do you want I don't let people know so I did I did that and then at the next line I did the comedy mix which was used to be Yuk Yuk's which is the shit it's Vancouver is a fucking um yeah I was up there for a while one time and I'm gonna go back because I'm starting to do now that I'm starting to go out and rip people off none of the club first of all what the club's pay is a slave wage like what comedy clubs pay to have someone come in for the weekend it's like what it's what it is is if you don't draw this is the bottom line it's if you're just coming in for the weekend that what the reality is that most clubs have a very hard time selling tickets for an unknown comic so what I have to do is they have to paper the room so they have to give away so they can't afford to give the comic that much money no I get that but they could they can certainly afford to give them more than they're giving I don't know I'm telling you man it's hard out there it's hard out there and you know comics need to realize that look with social networking and Twitter and Facebook and all that shit you can eventually build up your audience where you can ensure that hey I can ensure you that you're not gonna have to give away any tickets gonna sell this place out yeah and people have done that without even you know any television credits at all there's a bunch of guys who are doing really well just on the internet but you got to work at it you can't expect a club to just pick up the tab so when I don't expect anyone but but it's first of all there's plenty clubs just won't headline me cuz right because I haven't done enough TV I don't know what they don't know yet but they would on a weeknight ya know so what I'm doing is do I'm doing like music venue shit like that and getting most of the door yeah you know and and because I have like 63 thousand followers on Twitter which isn't a lot in the grants we use 64 by the end of the day I love that no I actually don't and you yeah we did well that's the name of the game is getting celebrities to tweet you and I know a lot of celebrities if you retweet me that it just goes up so I'm hoping that the people that follow me on Twitter will you know get into the spirit of like this kind of we're doing it off the grid and which is what I like about this I think they do too yeah and people will do stuff for free which i think is really cool like people will just I'll like I'll say like hey can someone make a picture of blob of this of like Osama Barack Obama with like a teardrop tattoo after the after the bin Laden thing and someone made it this girl Rachel made it like yeah 20 minutes that's all and a buddy of mine works in the White House was writer for Obama who I met at the Correspondents Dinner and he goes I showed it to everyone in the White House uh I go I go how high up did again he goes not as high as you want it to but it got a pretty wide line to Obama I know I yeah Obama is only 47 years I know you know oh sure sure let me ask you this do you think that they really killed Osama bin Laden dumped his body in the ocean the dumping the body thing I had a funny the the way they handled it was like the classic media manipulation the thing that got me was the thing to really go you know he used a woman as a human shield that was the first thing that they released so everyone got that motherfucker right cuz America didn't know how it was gonna play her net first they were saying he was armed yeah he was armed and he used a woman as a human they were like wait a minute women like and carts let's drop the armed yeah it's like a cartoon character he used a woman as a human shield and you picked her like a whore from Barney Miller well is apparently was it wasn't him that used a woman as a shield it was someone else yes but but originally that's what they said and people they know that the first story is his story people are gonna remember right rights and then they go oh by the way he didn't use a woman it's human I've been telling people in the audience it's like if I said to you like hey I'm gonna introduce you to my buddy Bobby he's a hate rate just a shit today at McDonald's and you think about that for an hour and a half and then I go by the way he didn't take a shit when you meet Bobby you're still gonna be picturing him taking a shit and that's it's more to me I think like people being accused of rape there's no way to UNAC use yeah rape everyone who gets accused of it is you have a black flag on you've got ever absolutely for because of one person's decision but I so I think what I think that the false part of bin Laden was just that it was a trumped he was a trumped up guy like right like he was a one-hit wonder 9/11 was his big hit and in the they just used the threat of him as an excuse to just get more power to the government there's a video on YouTube called the last word on Osama bin Laden that is so fucking enlightening as far as like how intertwined his family was with oh yeah with the Bush administration they built Mecca and all you guys watch the video it's called the last word on Osama bin Laden and it is so fascinating it's about 15 minutes long and it goes into depth about their their their families were doing business together forever and this guy gave them visas to leave they got him out of the country wouldn't was like al-qaeda was not the threat they claimed it was they like since 9/11 al Qaeda is killed I don't know 300 civilians and my point was more people have died at like Six Flags than that but yet there's like we got it in it's like dude they've killed it's not there's way bigger risk than that I'm all for like hunting them and and in law enforcement that the law enforcement part of it and but the war part is like it's they're a bunch of fucking there's more Crips than there are yeah members of our well not only that there on the other side of the planet and there's no way of disconnecting them and their history from the United States and the CIA there's not the Mujahideen were being trained by the United States government to fight against the Soviet Union I mean that's just a fact the whole jihad thing you know what jihad used to be would the original meaning of it and you know the Holy Scriptures was it was a war against your own personal vices that was like a real jihad but but we turned it into a war a holy war and we turned the the idea of suicide bombing was introduced by America I mean was our idea that we brought to them like you guys you know what's really got that so much but there's a documentary again on YouTube called the power of nightmares BBC thing yeah really and it linked like Christian evangelicals with extremist Islam and and how was both born in the 50s and sort of sprung out and Ayman al-zawahiri tried to he was part of the people that killed Anwar Sadat and he got they footage of him in 79 mmm in in the the leader bucket and he was in jail talking to TV but but yeah I mean yes is it an American I don't think it's a american-backed issue I think a lot of it had to do with with us just dumping Afghanistan after the Russians left I think that created a vacuum here comes the talent but it's also you know they realize how things really work once they start dealing with America I mean that's the the real cold hard situation of it what's really fascinating was there was a recent video that was released from someone leaked it from a Pentagon hearing where these guys are sitting around and it's a doctor or scientist explaining about the potential for developing vaccines to to attack certain areas of the brain that are creat that are related to religious fanaticism and they were showing like activity and different sectors of the brain I've come up with this vaccine that could literally attack those areas and nullify these ridiculous religious fanatic ideas I believe in my lifetime that will be a part of a brain like you will be able to set your brain to override negative impulses I think so I mean like I don't think it Scientology's about it is is it well yeah but I'm saying like that you'll be able to do with a pill or sort of implant or something where it's like it will override shitty impulse and then it'll be the decision do I want to override it or not well then this becomes what is shitty you know it's subject yeah absolutely hordes of barbaric no your land it's not shitty did so in the head with an axe yeah it's like what you gotta do yeah well you have to go through preferences the my next-door neighbor where I used to live was a nice guy and he was a Scientologist and I'm talking about the wolf no no a bit full no in Calabasas it was a nice guy but he was talking to me about this piece of property that he was looking to buy but he couldn't because his wife was going clear and so I go what does that what does that mean and well we're Scientologists and then he pauses and looks at me oh my god fuck you know okay well I want to be as accepting as possible he's a nice guy yeah I mean look my other neighbor was a Mormon and they were they were nice too I mean I had no problem with you and your wacky religious ideas as long as you're a good neighbor and also don't try to proselytize no I don't do whatever you want but don't try this absolutely don't try to sell me on and he never did and neither did the Mormon so they were all cool Mormons are very they don't really you know they're like Jews they don't want you to join you know so um so he starts telling me that his wife's gonna be clear and it's gonna cost $50,000 so I go $50,000 I go what is this entail he goes well you know basically the work is already done and what this is is sort of a confirmation in the ceremony to ensure that she is no longer affected by negative energy and negative influences and that what this does becoming clear protects you from all negative influences and stimulation it's actually been proven that ceremony and then big events and even the donation of the large sum of money to you know accentuate some sort of a situation like this can actually help the results so if this guy had this weird pseudo scientific way of looking at this fucking there's a really good article and then from The New Yorker like two and a half months ago about Paul Haggis who's a film director mm-hmm but there was a really long piece about cuz he left there yeah yeah they're going after him and it's it's really personal and it's one of those New Yorker articles it's just like whew this is long but it's so worth it I would recommend everyone read it the thing is it's like you know they become the people to lower-level people they become like soldiers yeah and they act out in the best interest of the church and it's not just about you know it's like a gang it's not just I mean all churches are managers I find that yeah any any any group of people that's like the Steelers fans absolutely they just go like this is for Roethlisberger meanwhile Roethlisberger what I would find that with Chappelle there'd be all these guys around them like hey Dave let me take care of this but if you're the person who it's being done on the in the name of flattering it is flattering but it's also it's a weird tribal instinct that goes back to the time where there was you know 50 of us and we had to stay alive and and stay in a group we have these weird group instincts you know yeah that's I actually wrote a essay that I think I'm gonna post later on today about please let us know and we'll tweet it I would love that guys would you do that for me about about the thing with Tracy Morgan saying that you know it's I'm all for like gay groups coming out against them because it is technically reprehensible I got a couple thoughts one of the thoughts is as comedians we're gonna say we have to talk a lot we're gonna say fucked up shit from time to time the same way Nike or Levi's has an outlet store for your regular shit we're gonna say some irregular shit every once in a while it's not fucking it's just gonna it's like the Don Imus thing he has to talk 25 hours a week he's nappy-headed nose is the only time that comes slipping out so my point with Tracy is I don't mind gagoosh coming out against him everybody else can shut the fuck up because every single person on earth has some racism sexism some homophobia some classes and some political big you know prejudices and and and mning out against Tracy it distanced themselves from them from from their own sort of darker impulses and it makes them seem like they're really doing something meanwhile you're not doing shit it's not it's like I said you know all the people that all the media outlets that came out came down on Michael Richards are black people better off today because of the fucking hammer no in fact they're worse off so if you want to help black people build a fucking school or a hospital and shut the fuck up I don't think I think the Tracy Morgan thing is different from the Michael Richards thing for two reasons one because I think Michael Richards was talking to a group of people who were heckling him and he was trying to insult them in the most dehumanizing way possible and was on coke and he was trying to be funny when he didn't deserve a thank-you was like oh yes pretty sure I don't know I'll prove me wrong okay fine just proof God you know he was at the comedy store before and by all accounts he was gagged out of his mind I don't know if it's true or not maybe I'm a salon during him or whatever but I don't think he's gonna go after me for this I think for this one he's gonna leave it alone you know but you want to revisit this may call you the n-word no it was less offensive and I think when you know if people want to get on him about that fucking magic word that's ridiculous when black people say to each other every fucking day of the week I think when I looked at I was like well he shouldn't have done that and that wasn't funny but my other my initial thought was it's not he doesn't deserve to be on stage he shouldn't be on stage on a fucking front well no yeah you can't control yourself to not if you're under if there's a chance that when you're getting heckled you're gonna yell that out he's not he's a voice exactly he's a famous guy and he's gonna go on after like al Madrigal or you know someone of that nature who's not a name who's gonna crush and you know Tom Segura and then your good luck good luck following those guys yeah and you're you're some fucking slapstick II guy you ever seen what he does no he used to go on stage and the economy started he had no material he would just fall down he would go on stage don't fold up all can't believe this has happened to me holes that prepared and he would slip again and fall on his back right this is my kind of comedy go on ridiculous I mean he would do it for like 15 20 minutes fall down all over the place I don't think what he said is anything I think what he said it's just him being weak but it would Tracy Morgan said was like whoa like you wanna if your son was dead you would stab that little nigger but I think that that's I think that what he's doing is just trying to be funny and I think he's probably ad-libbing which Tracy does for like most of his set if you've ever seen Tracy Morgan do stand-up well he'll start talking about eating pussy man and you could tell it seems that Liv it's generally not at little bit like yo a fucking midget in the mouth they're not like all that you so the IDS I'm a bitch I've lived yeah fine and I think a stabbing his son shit was part of that of all I'm sure that got a laugh and in the absence of stabbing your son for any reason is Bernie Mac called his nephew faggot where was the outrage call him a faggot with you is Jesus of comedy night 2000 faggot didn't mean as much back 3,000 faggot is Aeschylus yes where are people going back and going like and your Bernie Mac but it's like okay again I don't if you want to help gay people give money to to gay charities and and and and GLAAD and not going chastise and Tracy isn't helping gay people hardly at all it's helping them a little but it's the bare minimum I see absolute pyramid I think what people think it's not people think it's and people go it's better than nothing it's it's almost worse than nothing because at least nothing knows it's nothing you know where is this it's like I'm I'm look at me I'm chastising Tracy right I agree what you're saying in that when something like this happens the people that make a big deal about it and talk about it and make press conference yeah those are all cunts yeah that that is just a fact that's a fact in almost every situation the people that are you know a lot of comedians on Twitter were coming out against I never liked and it was just like silly few fucking pussies it's just not it's not a good point it's not yes well-thought-out you're taking a safe route yeah it doesn't take much like it's not much of a thought exercise to get where I got words they wouldn't you know right but to have an opinion about it I think it's an interesting subject of debate I think to have an opinion about it I think there's gonna be the non comics opinion and there's gonna be the people that are you know sort of a bit more sympathetic because you know they realize that comics a lot of times you won't know what the fuck you're saying before you're saying it you're saying it on an impulse and what you would say in front of me like if we were standing around if we were sitting in my office and you and I said what about if you had a gay son I need to like I'll stab that little nigger I would laugh and guess what if you said that in front of a different crowd you know one crowd would fucking laugh hilariously a 10 o'clock late-night show in Cleveland you know and well the only 50th as comedians we're supposed to have a shorter distance between our impulses and our words that's why that's part of what comedy is and then when it goes our when there's an irregular comment people gonna fuck this guy I'm gonna fuck it yeah it's like yo man you gotta let us be a little and I'm not sayin I'm I'm like I'm trying to set myself up to say some fucked up I just think if you're in the aggrieved group if you're leave if you're uh first of all if you're Tracy's son I would I would boycott Tracy or suck a dick and take Evan oh yeah look at that dad yeah things are you look I've know Tracy as long as I've known you and Tracy do you really think Tracy Morgan's gonna stab his son under any circumstance yeah first of all do you think Tracy knows where his son is actually heard a lot of those jokes were actually jokes we had come on nany Johnny today on the podcast and he said oh yeah I've heard those jokes before really so he's been saying that shit for a while and someone just had to stand up and complain about yeah huh that's people think that's a horrible writing Tracy I said no well no the things I said in my SMI unpublished essay is that people think that being the I said the louder someone says I don't have a racist bone in my body the less likely they are to have a black or Latin friend because I have a shitload of black friends and I'm racist and guess what my black friends have me as a friend and they're fucking racist and you're racist and you're homophobic and you're sexist and you're anti you know what I mean everybody's everything so one guy says something at like accidentally on a whim and everyone goes I am NOT okay stop this is not a whim this is his material okay this is it it's his material and now that's a different story well you know then someone needs to talk to him and tell him that shit's not funny because that's just it's just silly you know if you're if you're saying that every show funny if Tracy was saying some shit that wasn't getting a laugh he would stop saying any sure I'm positive sure he wouldn't just try to reverse positive he might rework it for like three nights but then you can't use the impulse thought though you know if it's his material and everything but but even if it is material if it wasn't working he'd stop doing it that clearly did not work the night he did it so now he's up yeah and the other thing I heard that was that he got in trouble recently in New York for doing something very similar and like it was like in a day or so no one knew about it anymore Jay but this one just happened to come out right this whole act is about being this wild crazy fuck yeah well it not we don't want you that crazy but fuck midgets in the blow hole or whatever the fuck is joke like he talks about fucking a woman in her inner voice box it's like but every but again people are fine with that yeah that's absolutely fine because the voice box people ironically enough don't have a voice standing know why people yeah so but once you say stabbing it then it's like hey hey no no one no one there you can't talk about that yeah you can't not you can make a joke about somehow you can make that funny but but just the idea that that somehow again gay groups absolutely should should boycott abut but all these other for to use your word cunts can concede a dick because it's like let them you don't first of all but your rate every it's all these fucking white why do you keep saying that why do you keep saying that everyone's racist it's tribal but what is racism I mean are you really racist or do you just recognize the fact that some people and some ethnic groups do fucked up shit because you're aware of the New York you that doesn't make you racist I don't recognize and you make assumptions based on appearance as human beings that's what you do I don't think that's racist well I don't like to say for the record black people think I think sometimes I don't know if you have a big black viewership but black people think that when they're not around white people are like so the niggers and did it it the amount of times that I've heard someone give a screed the way Mel Gibson did I've never heard anything like that like I've never white people are not like so alright they're gone now look can we talk about these darkies er and I've never heard any of that yeah I've never have so so I would like to the presumption he did somebody goes off he's still going off I had up yeah but so the idea that somehow it the white liberals would say that it is racist to be presumptive any prejudicial decisions well you know what that's that silliness because you should analyze you know if you if you know that 99% of all Chinese men stab people I see a Chinese guy you're like fuck I hope he's a one percenter right but again yes but but white liberals would say like he asked the guy go hey you're not a stab right oh no no right then you know that's not racist yes everyone will admit to this but you can't say it in any kind of public forum and I think that there is obviously a difference between what we're talking about and Tracy saying stabbing stabbing his gay is political correctness why is that shit still here is and why is why are the words more important than the intent still well that's what I said it's like you're black people wouldn't if you built a state-of-the-art Hospital in Harlem or in state-of-the-art school in Harlem you could call it nigger high and they'd be fine with it as long as there were great teachers there and fucking state-of-the-art equipment and fucking yes my son went to nigger high like they would really it would be really I promise it doesn't all right I'll say this for political correctness because I've seen it it came really - it came to full bloom in the early 90s I think it is good in terms of it like calling by people African Americans I think that it does in some ways it's largely symbolic it's almost entirely symbolic but there is a five to seven percent range in which I think it is ineffective it does function yeah it does make I mean homosexual is better than saying fuckin fag you know like there are words that are but is it boring gay more in no bling than others it's actually better than saying gay is african-american better than saying black I say black cuz I don't because african-american sounds like my friends are dignitary whereas it just dudes right I always find it as straight this is a strange word african-american I've been saying I've been saying nigger in my act and it's it's it's great go for it she's doing on black crowds I did talk with Sunday on Sunday I did great and I'm doing tripping on Tuesdays tonight I'm gonna go and I'm gonna be in the back of the room with one knee bent and one foot in the launching position like the starting block but my point isn't to run out you know hang out with white people I get called it all the time right you get all the time so hanging out with black guys they say it back and forth and you're not supposed to say it it's almost like when you're like you're grounded and your brother's outside in the yard like so so so the bit is about like I fucking I mean I said I would write it on Chappelle's Show I would you know I mean like I wasn't that an issue on a Chappelle show with Comedy Central you know I mean never I mean that was no I'd heard that you know you did yeah you know where you heard it where I'm from Dave's press junket so it's not true no well we were the golden geese of Comedy Central we were a license to print money for that so when Dave was saying that they were telling him to stop saying nigger that was bullshit absolutely Wow yeah holy Sh I mean again in my experience that was that was well I'm not gonna say here's the thing I say one thing about Dave and he known Oprah and fucking trash me so like I gotta be careful but but that wasn't my experience at all why would he go on open trash who's he trash sure he has yeah what happened guys had this what we he you know we're doing the show popular show you've been on a few times did wonders for your career and and then we were doing great and then we renewed our contracts which was extremely ugly County Central played divide and conquer' between us which I said they're gonna do this because they are gonna make they're gonna they have to pay you they don't want to have to pay me the only way they're gonna have to pay me as if you demand that they pay me so what they did is they poisoned me in within Dave's mind and how they do this with this I like it said one time at wrap-around said he couldn't do the show without me during a taping he said that and I said that too Comedy Central say hey Justin you know Dave said he couldn't do the show without me it said they called him and goes you know Neil says she can't do the show without and then he's like so it just becomes an ego thing away to me you guys didn't have the kind of relationship where he would call you up we did prior to that but once the negotiation started then it became like I can't talk to anybody you know really it was the WoW me let me be clear with us it was the worst period of my life I can't imagine a worse period and it's just because the stakes were so high yeah it was became it became an ego thing and it just became like no I can a trip i can''t lastly what the scene on the set was when we did the fear factor spoof and what it was was Neil was running everything and Dave was in character all day running around you know you know I'm Rick James bitch and and and I think that you're a joke but it was but you know I mean you had a huge part in that show I was the point co-creator of the show like it wasn't that's the thing is like but I think what happened was you know they made it seem like by Dave admitting that I was Lorne Michaels once said in reference to me and Dave comedians don't like it when when people realize they have help and I think and dave was the one who would say that I was Howie because it was fair because it was only fair he would have to say Neil makes a big contribution show because I did it was conversations with Kevin I said we said whatever but again I contributed I believe I held up my end of the bargain but it just became this thing of like they may I think I don't think they made I think part of it was in him anyway that he just resented the idea of being a team really yeah and where did you draw this conclusion from the Judah had a conversation with him about this is just yeah and what did he say we're not a fucking team whoa whoa closed after two years of the show and this is where teams we were a team when it when it was popular god damn that sucks yeah no I know that's the thing it's like look me and Dave are cool now and I don't think that that's uh I'd like to think that this was all circumstantial you don't I mean like in the circumstance he was just under a lot of pressure and and he felt like you know the crack what you're saying I don't you know the other thing that I will say is that is that in the when me and Dave read half-baked I knew that people in comedy would all think would think that he wrote all of it and people in show business would think that I wrote all of it because people in show business are predisposed to think that the black eye is a dummy I would say to people I swear to god I was in a meeting with a producer and he promised you he goes seriously how much of that script Dave right I prom and I was like oh half of it man have him and sure enough everyone in comedy thought Dave wrote it def Jeff Ross referred to me as Dave Chappelle's typist okay that's Jeff Roscoe yep let me needs the roastmaster general but that's a little bit beyond the pale that was it wasn't a rude especially the guy doesn't update his act very often himself the actor Jeff if any a writer to listening when I was younger I would have most certainly had a problem with working with a guy and then having to reveal the fact this guy was writing half of my material right again but the idea of half it's not there's so much work on the on doing a TV show it's just it's a lot I did a lot of work here's the other thing Dave did a fuckload work too and Dave is a Hall of Fame one-in-a-billion comedian I honestly though like 1/2 billion there's like eddie murphy him chris in terms of like you know iiii think he's very different than any murphy i think you know but I'm saying in terms of the decathlon of ability Dave can do stand-up he can write sketches he can think of characters he can write movies he can he's got a visual sense like he's got he's got the full portfolio yeah so so the idea that that you know he did like I don't want to come on here be like Dave the Dave Chappelle you know doesn't exist like that's not the truth the truth is well you're the guy that cracked under pressure it's alright it's not like I mean he sucks yeah one of the greatest comics yeah I I knew I so I knew early on in 97 that people were gonna give me too much credit or him too much credit so we had a deal we don't tell people who wrote what like cuz had a deal yeah sat down and can you have a deal I mean whose idea was that didn't hammer it out or anything but idea was that it was my idea because I knew that if if I if he'd heard that I said I wrote something he'd be pissed and if I heard that he wrote like if it just it doesn't serve the team when people asked who wrote that joke they don't if they don't have their but they don't have your best interest in hearts they basically saying they like they're going W to can i discount because this hurts my feelings I think it's a quality of this hurts my feelings so they want to find it so I want to find out who stinks honey that's interesting yeah like and and so I recognized that immediately and so so we so but having to do because you know that's the Matt stone Trey Parker yeah thing everybody we said Trey Parker writes everything Matt stone just it's rum drinks off yeah you heard that why well they say that because South Park's the greatest fuckin show that's ever exists yeah and it's the quote in a hearse painfully good yeah it hurts people warm peevish bat around because he hates money hates money I just want to give that god I can't take all I fucking hate this money so the idea that somehow he didn't he didn't like the idea the implication that that that white people would think that I was doing it all people would say shit like we'd be we were somewhere and and one of his agents came up was like the genius behind the man to me standing next to Dave now I know the agent is just trying to be a fucking agent and be like schmooze e right but it's like yo man don't say that shit first of all because it not true and secondly cuz it fucks it poisons our relationship you know hmm wow it's a lot of ego going on here uh there's a UH yeah yeah a lot of ego people get into show business for attention like you know for personal dissension it's some point though the idea is to steer it towards the work right to steer that energy into instead of it being personal tension the real satisfaction is creating something that's really good there's a lot of people still love it but that's the but the thing is if you're surrounded by people you know there was a there have been some studies where they where they said what is they they put people in a situation a bunch of volunteers in situation and they asked another group of volunteers what do you think these people will do and why and they they said they are going to do the negative thing because they're all dicks so they people did the thing people do volunteer here and they all did the negative thing and these people said yeah cuz they're dicks and then they put these people in it and they did the exact same thing not because they're ditz it's because as a human being in that situation you're gonna do the thing people don't know how they're gonna react in certain situations and most of the time it is circumstantial it's not characterological and that's the thing with this is I think if I if I had been Dave it's very easy for me to say I would have treated Neil differently but again you know or but I wasn't Dave circumstances exposed character though I mean that is the idea of character in the first place the idea of character is strong character is able to survive under adversity and right that's what it's all about and that's why when someone doesn't have your back when the shit hits the fan you lose respect for them because they're like well this person is enough character this person is not my friend you know this person is looking out for themselves and they're weak they're egotistical or whatever they have a flaw yeah he'll be helped bury me for this by the way really oh yeah this conversation absolutely really I mean I would bet my bet would so you're feeling bad right now that you said anything I don't feel bad I don't I mean I I actually don't feel like I've said anything bad and I think I've been sympathetic I mean but no one here the thing that was so disgusting about the whole thing was nobody asked me my side of things 60 minutes called and I wouldn't do an interview New York Times called I wouldn't do an interview well explain to everybody how it all went south so you guys were in negotiations you're about everybody heard the number 50 million that's what I keep hearing 50 million dollars is gonna make another season for 50 million dollar deal and then Dave goes to Africa right Wow what exactly went down well what happened was that there was the negotiation part the divide-and-conquer thing that I already talked about about them going you know Neil so then he would go light without he can't do without him said which would make sure felt like fuck Neil you're basically Comedy Central you're deputized to lowball him even I mean he never I don't think that was ever explicitly said but if they say like they came to him at one point like could you do the show without Neil and he and they poisoned me to him so much by that point that he was like yeah but it would take three people could you have decided to get together and form a partnership in the form of some sort of a corporation and say this corporation is what you are contracting to do this television show and the fee for the corporation will be X right but there was some yeah illegal thing so you don't have to worry about this ever again uh couldn't have been done that could have been done ahead of time but but I'm not we're not a fucking team keeps yeah shit from happening yeah so so so yes so at that point there was the Divine Congress thing and and and so all right yeah so that so our relationship was pretty much once my deal was closed you couldn't call him and go yo dude this is eventually I did eventually literally we're on the boat on the phone I'm crying and I think he may get out of my house right now Joe this is how whiz what a bitch I am it's Tracy Morgan would stab me right now so I cook a steak for you after this is over no crying Chappelle may have been crying he was definitely tearing up cuz on the phone yeah how do you know he's tearing up on the phone you can hopefully Skype we were on uh I guess and and it was basically like dude like what are you doin like an infant so finally it was I basically said like why are you doing this like what did I you did your deals closed but they made basically his deal was closed right a bunch of money and then my deal was open but they made it somehow seem to Dave like any point for me was a point against him and it wasn't the case but I think and so they were letting him know there's only a certain amount of it was no no they knew they weren't they never said like you're gonna get less money Emile gets more dave still was close it was just the idea that like they didn't want it was like they planted in Dave's sort of psyche that he didn't or maybe was already in there he he didn't want me getting too close in terms of compensation they made it about an ego thing like well how much does Neil love us is Neil worth you know so they were basically deputized to lowball me well typically showrunners get you know almost as much money as the stars of shows I mean you look in terms of like this yeah fucking guy with this Chuck Lorre guy yeah Charlie Sheen you know everybody's talking about Charlie Sheen making two million dollars in episode guess what that Chuck Lorre guy probably makes more chuck lorre would kill himself he was making two million oh yeah well Chuck Lorre has done a lot of big shows and it wasn't contingent and all that like right Dave brought me on right you know so I couldn't really go like fuck you and the other thing is I can't just go do the show with like I'm gonna get fucking Orlando Jones and do that like it's not and I nor did I want it that was the thing is the thing that about me and Dave was like I love the dude right you know I mean like I like adored the dude I love writing with him I love writing I love like I would work like fucking a crazy I worked I told my brother this the other day because I'd forgotten I worked one day there was a there was a period where I worked for 12 at least 12 hours a day for thirty five straight days to try to just to get the show done to get the show on the air he was working his ass off too but it was just the idea that somehow they just made it about like pitting us against me okay so thought there's an Asian game go crazy they pitted you against him you guys wound up fighting how did you never resolve it how did you never talk to each other you've resolved it but it was still this thing of like when push comes to shove you don't want to be on a fucking team you don't think I'm you think I'm fractionally worthwhile at the show it was just kind of a vote of like fine it was just this resentment of like that I was getting this this that I got some money what did you yeah well I don't understand that if if he thinks that you guys are a team and it didn't affect him wasn't god we're a team okay but he knows that you guys work together right to do the fucking show right oh it's you're basically saying that it was a completely an ego thing on his part that's what you're saying you're saying that he didn't feel like you were worth as much as him he didn't feel like you're working out like I said he's a one-in-a-billion guy like he's a he's a he doesn't but locate more money okay that that said he already had his money so he was already getting a certain amount of money right so what you're saying basically is completely different than anything anyone's ever heard in the news no kidding cuz no one's ever asked me god this is so crazy you know my point of view from all this time was great a show in my opinion greatest comedy show of all time Chappelle show yeah number one Verena greatest show of all time that fucking Clayton Bigsby character yeah that's the greatest sketch in all of television am I in that way racist trip self idea like he'd been he had it in the and brilliant bright I still remember writing the sketch it's a brilliant I've ever called yeah I won't say who wrote well so what I had heard was that there was all sorts of input from the network and they were saying him that they used to stop saying nigger and make it more friendly to commercials this is I I don't remember where I'd heard this or you might want to be second there was a lot of stories and that he because he left the show and then I think he had to figure out a way to make himself look like the victim but in my estimation he wasn't the victim Wow again no one wants to so again he's like he's an unbelievably charming guy hilarious he's everybody's friend like I get it he's he was my four he's still it we're still friendly like we're friend we weren't for like three four years but now we're friendly and no hangout when he when LA let me ask you this man why doesn't he do like fucking concerts and theaters and put out DVDs I mean everybody's so excited to see him do stand-up but like you know you never hear about it until like shows up I'm sure he'll show up at the stores show he showed up in Seattle and was doing chosen a park with a speaker he pulled out a microphone and a speaker and plugged it in yes doing shows like outdoors and I saw him like about a month and a half ago and it was just you know him on stage and he was kind of fucking it felt like he was fucking around he wasn't like doing bits but then I was told that no that's his new style where he just does a lot of audience interaction it's like evening with yeah and it was cool because you know we don't like really I mean again the guy can channel shit like he can just stand in there and he's he's riveting yeah I saw Dave do street performance in Montreal he did stand-up comedy on the street and what he would do was you know we were doing these shows at club soda and then after the show he goes downstairs and shit me he was like I don't know 19 or something like that and he goes downstairs and there's a group of people and so he just starts yelling gather round gather round there's no way yeah yeah that was that's when one of the peer we met yeah we were friends like I didn't run the show - he invited him on the podcast so yeah we could get him in here wait I think wait for him I think he'll be here any minute yeah dude hey it's Dave i disturbing uh I mean again all I've ever said about it it was very like behind the music how come he's not doing shows do you have any idea I don't know it's like it's not advertising his shows it's weird I mean he's selling out everywhere I mean he does shows every once in a while for like no no Jovi Dee's no you know I don't want to see it shakes you I have having a contract and having to beat someplace and I have a copy of Dave Chappelle when he got back from Africa he he did a set at a comedy club and I have a copy of that on mp3 and it's really weird did you make the copy net and I don't know but I like I bootleg staying home yeah ladies a month ago really cuz I that he does a bit about dr. Drew and I had to play it for someone so what's the head about dr. Drew just about B's a charlatan and he is yeah yes it's fine he's a whore yeah dr. Drew's computer I'm all completely anti dr. Drew now I mean he's a nice guy when I see him I'll say hi I'll be his friend but he started doing this stupid shit on a CNN show about pot having with severe withdrawal symptoms and that the the THC is and a higher content today which is physiologically a fucking ridiculous thing for a doctor to say because since it's not physically addictive just because there's more THC does not make it addictive you know it doesn't it doesn't all of a sudden change the properties of the fucking drug you know and anything where it's addictive at all it's psychologically addictive which by the way anything can be psychologically addictive you know it's like saying well we need to take away porn because porn psychologically addictive no more gambling because some people can't handle it fast food fatty foods no more cheeseburgers cuz some people get addicted to federal foods it's like fuck that that's that's nonsense to only like half the country gets addicted to fatty fish those are fucking idiots you know I'm not into nerf in the world and so his his proposition that marijuana you know should be is dangerous and illegal or should be illegal it's fucking completely ridiculous thing to say especially when he you know the pharmaceutical companies are producing shit that's a hundred thousand times worse and it's available everywhere right it's a stupid ridiculous thing for a doctor to say it's a terrible position for a doctor saying it's ignorant you know and the only reason why he's saying it is because he thinks that that's what the people who listen to him want to hear he's a whore that's that's whore behave ya know I used to love him on Loveline them I thought it was really informative and helpful and I just feel like it's at a certain point it's like dude you're just a you you want to be famous like everybody else exactly just without doing yeah he's working hard for fame so his fucking show is the most ridiculous thing that the idea that he's really helping those celebrities to get clean you know I mean come on man you got a fucking camera in their face it's the worst possible scenario for someone to try to clean yeah they give them attention in the end of their career when everything's fucking completely falling apart you're gonna give them attention and put a camera on them while they're weeping and shaking and piss in their pants just make it and they should make it like a whoever remains the sober the longest gets some kind of money yeah that's what should be right yeah yeah that's a good idea what is um what a Stanhope's bit what does he say about him do you mind I think I have my phone yeah yeah it's such a good bit it's like such an i it's it it was it's a crazy good bit so uh whatever I would take me forever for it but were you still involved when the Chapelle the Chappelle's Show had like that kind of rap yeah yeah yeah because I like the sketches yeah like so me Dave wrote the sketches together so there's this thing of like it was it was uh and again like I don't want people to think that I'm a dick or Dave's a dick I just it was a it was a it was a stressful situation you so you were involved this year the season that he was involved in which was like he was we wrote the sketches together right but he was not putting it on the air he was not involved in putting it on the air did he not want it on the air I think his perception in my my feeling about it was his perception of what was recorded no perception of what was relevant or what was what was it's what's rate when does Rachel become racist mm-hmm and just got sort of blurred and I don't think he could see the difference between so he thought some of the stuff was racist yeah Rachel and it was based on completely random random so what you basically saying is that the pressure of this show over two years was so intense and that so many things happened and there's so much going on that he kind of cracked a little which is what a lot of people thought when he moved to F I mean what is is I don't know again man I don't I don't presume to know what it's like to be a famous black comedian it like it because it the thing that black guys black comedians get that white people don't is you become a symbol you know what I mean like you become the elect you become the spokesman so people on news show start going like well I saw Dave Chappelle show that you can do it I saw that a thousand times where people it became this thing it became bigger than the intention mm-hmm where it's the intention was like this little this show that was almost just to make each other laugh and then it became this big thing it became like this bully pulpit and and so it became it was so much responsibility I think for David he actually it stopped being fun because it wasn't like it wasn't it was it was the idea of like he said on 60 minutes like dance like nobody's watching and then it became like dance like fucking way too many people are watching and and I think it got in his head about about is this responsible or is this which again as a white person you just don't have to worry about hmm no one's gonna go you know you're never gonna be the spokesman for white people ever do you hear me if you keep this up know like you just can't you'll never so that's the thing that as it I think is a as a black comedian it's just it's like Eddie Murphy the times I've spoken to him and hung out with him is still still seems upset by the fact that that he got like picketed you know by lying gay jokes yeah he's like man it fucking I'm just doing jokes and then next thing I know I got people outside picketing it's like oh yeah we obviously die said the same thing so it's not just racial but it's your perceptions that your your your your very influential and when you're on stage and you're saying a bunch of really negative shit about black people I mean Eddie Murphy said a lot of really mean shit about black people you know gay people yeah excuse me gay people so it wasn't it wasn't um it wasn't just you know he was doing jokes it was you know the the jokes were really nasty ya know I'm with you I like I don't like all that material but but but having you do that I just want to say that Eddie is an awesome dude yes yeah great guy with to talk to hilarious but uh but so the IR just jokes but they are just jokes I mean put it again if you're doing jokes in a club with 100 people it doesn't take on that mom mentality whereas when you're in fucking Nassau Coliseum you start to go oh wait this is almost too much yeah influence over people it's it's one thing when it's a club but when it becomes this big like what next we had Brian Pro Seine on yesterday and he was talking about the gathering of the Juggalos he's doing stand-up at the gathering the Juggalos and I thought about after he left I got baked and I was writing and I was thinking you know would be cool if we had some fucking crazy death squad meeting somewhere because I know Stanhope did some shit like that like you had these parties in the desert but it was really just like a loser festival yeah it became a bad idea but doing some one crazy event every year you know something like that but that's when things get dangerous when things get dangerous is when you have like a movement behind you yeah you have a logo yeah it's very not difficult to fucking keep your your interest pure it's also yeah it's hard to its mechanical wait what what what am i doing it becomes this corporation it just becomes like this like a corporation and fucking a lot of you meet with lawyers more than you meet with writers you know I mean like that's the thing part of it that's Oprah seem to have managed it fine do you do you have a huge issues with Oprah I like Oprah do you yeah I do I don't you don't let go no she had Dave on he's trashing me no one from her show calls me she doesn't ask for my side of things no one warns me no and and then she but she's this like great humanist well in her defense yeah I mean is she gonna have another show where you come on tell me or at least happen well how does she have any idea that you were gonna get trashed on the show she knows she had Dave on he had it in the can for weeks right but what are they gonna tell you that Dave trashed you you really think why would they email me some really yeah or if you're gonna have someone telling and retelling a story it's like have both people on I wouldn't expect that I would think you know here's the famous guy let's he was on Oprah Lana's he's got to take well you know we're friends right if he goes on Oprah I'm sure we'll say nice things and I'd like Oprah well that's what you think until two weeks later and if he doesn't know you know I'll write something online though I can't believe you said that and this is a reality douchebag and yeah yeah thanks to you by the way I don't I'm guessing I'm gonna have to blame you for it now on Twitter where it says similar to you Oprah for my profile because I like about Oprah I think she is a positive voice to people like her she's a positive voice to older women she gives them something to look forward to she has this fanatical following of like-minded people and her message is essentially positive her messages of life improvement and of dietary improvement and behavioral improvement or messages of spreading love she's nothing like me there's nothing about her I bet she probably hates everything I've ever done of every outside of news radio he likes your MMA I bet she hates UFC I bet she hates Fear Factor I don't but it's all good I'm very different human being than she is but I recognize that as a human being who she is is very beneficial and very important to people like her I like I like it game recognizes game son positive yeah I think she's a fucking well she means she might be I had a friend who worked for and he painted a very different picture of her then you know you see of her on her show when she's being interviewed by like-minded people but my friend who interviewed her is kind of a cunt and he likes to start arguments and I bet he would have a real hard time working for some powerful woman and I said I assume that that's probably what happened did you know he got stupid with her because he used to get stupid with me when we worked together so I'm assuming with her it was probably even grosser you know that I mean I just did the math but you know yes I mean I don't I don't know I just you don't like her because of your own personal but I didn't like her before that what didn't you like about it before that she's an egomaniacal phony it's all Oprah she doesn't give a fuck it's like the last week were there people on her farewell shows where there's a there's a people are gathered around to honor this woman that they've made a billionaire like thank you for letting us make you a billionaire and she said like fucking like like a fucking uh like a queen or something okay but how would she have handled it how what's the other way to handle it came out and start flicking them all no just say goodnight do a final show well you know maybe she wanted to give them the chance to say thank you and she wanted to give herself a chance to thank them why did Johnny Carson smoke five packs of cigarettes a day and dive a fluffy the harp cuz he's a badass ever see the pictures of him wearing about to die yeah I'll never forget these photos they had him in like Star Magazine or one of those things he had this giant gut like he swallowed a basketball oh yeah yeah he was smoking like pall malls and he was just insanely unhealthy when he died it's amazingly you think of a guy who is that loved by so many people was so fucking miserable so miserable uh yeah you ever hear Wayne Newton talk about him no Wayne Newton talking about Johnny Carson is the most hilarious shit yeah cuz Johnny Carson we should tell jokes about Wayne Newton and his shit on Wayne noon and Wayne Newton was you know it's a fucking egomaniac can he couldn't take it so apparently like he confronted Johnny Carson and grabbed him and threatened him said he was gonna kick his ass yeah pretty funny anyway Johnny Carson stopped doing it like flew in to see him yeah it's pretty funny I wonder if it's true though oh I yeah yeah yeah I mean it might have said that he threatened him he might have got in there so you stop telling those drugs about me Johnny get this fucking guy out of here yeah well that's what I like about you and your toughness is that you don't you're so physically threatening that you don't you just the parameters with you are very clear where is it I think with I just never get to violence with you but I like that if you just said like hey would you stop doing jokes about me people would just do it yeah I don't think anybody's really worried about physical violence in this day and age you know not from someone kicking their ass this is so much at stake and so much to even pretend that you would do that like you know I'm gonna go kick somebody's ass cause they told jokes about yeah that's silly I'm not I don't think that way ever might you know I've never been one who's into getting in fights on never yeah and when I was young I think it's dangerous and scary and I've seen too many people get fucked up I just been into martial arts since I was a kid I have terrible primate savage instincts and I'm trying to curb every fucking step of the way I'm doing it to try not to fuck people up i'm sure i'm doing it try try to not get angry you know yeah no that's good but that that was what the thing with you and Carlos that was what your size made it it kind of took that off the table like you couldn't be like fuck you and fight you you just and I also think and that's I don't have you remember when I gave you $20 a few weeks after it because I just thought you did yeah you deserve recompense for what you did but I think that you the only one who ever did that that video that video made it made joke thievery unacceptable you know I think that that Carlos's career has suffered as a result of the video because it just made it made something that was behind the scenes and only community's name and it made it put it in the public eye well it's also because of Brian Brian has one edited it and if the way he edited it it's so entertaining there's ten fucking minutes long listen to ten minutes of that nonsense you know this argument back and forth between two comedians it would have been really boring and it probably would've gotten not a fraction of the hits bright he made it so interesting because he had all these other people saying that mr. Mencia steals material and going back in time and you know and you know switching the time in that you know we go in the past and then the future and you know going back out forth he made it really fascinating to watch that was what's lucky about that whole thing that happened is actually I had been doing my research about the guy way before him I actually had made a prior video then you did your doctoral thesis yeah yeah I mean I was waiting for a day like this that happened in and all like pretty much Bates the first time I ever met him like I like stopped and like went shoulder to shoulder with me he looked at me and did that chicken neck thing where he's like like that kind of like to make me flinch or something like that I get out of my way I get out of my way and I'm like really okay are you were you what's the guy hanging out at the Comedy Store talking to Duncan Trussell and he's a cunt you know weird he was a he was a real problem you know there I've never been in a situation like that where you really realize how the business is structured and that no agents gave a fuck no club owners gave a fuck everybody knew he was stealing shit and they kept using him because he was putting asses and yes and it was so shocking to watch everybody turn a blind eye to him cannibalizing old Richard Pryor sees greatest you went around those people to the audience and said hey or you both did and said hey this is what's actually happening and the people have since spoken yeah with fewer asses and seats well you can also read his Twitter and you realize how fucking crazy he really is and right watch his little Facebook videos and he puts out then you get to see the real human being now behind this facade of being a fake Mexican and being the number one Latino comic you know but the reality is the Latino market is fucking gigantic and they were looking for a superstar and so Mitzi shore said hey why don't you change your name to Mexican right so she made him become disfavors name was Carlos Mexican yeah but not that I really like that in that it made people more aware yeah joke thieves and it made it it's people there was another like confrontation like a month ago yeah we thought a dead guys material yeah which was excellent yeah I didn't see it but I heard it's pretty good I don't want even I'm so connected to that world it's like I avoid glad yes the world plagiarism and of exposing plagiarism like I don't want to I just don't enough already I've said more than enough negative shit about it it was an issue that had to be dealt with and an issue unlike any way people bring up all these arguments about parallel thinking and you're absolutely right I've had jokes that I thought I know I wrote I know I wrote yeah and then I'll watch some fucking HBO special from 1984 and it's like basically the same premise here's a perfect example yesterday we were talking about racist about if dolphins could talk and we were talking of a came up with the machine to decipher dolphin language right and then I said that we would if the first words were I hate Jews you know and then we I was watching a clip somebody posted on the message board you guys did a Bailey Chapelle show where a racist dolphin I'm here at the nigger-hating dolphin yeah I'm here to read a bid from you Joe so there so it's like I did a bit I was doing it for like three weeks it was killing so hard that I had to I had to close with it because it was just killing so hard and then about three weeks into doing it Jim Norton goes hey at jim Florentine you stupid a bit so then I see Florentine and he's like I did it 15 years ago and he's like you should do it yeah it's it sucks it's one of the things it's like ah yeah rock it was such a good and I know I wrote it like I because I remember jokes I work with this kid in Vegas and he was doing bits off my old CD my CD from 1999 he did three bits yeah and just reworked him and changed him a few years back or he couldn't make it anyway long story so I was like you know what do I mean I'm not doing any this stuff anymore I don't do it right more but god damn dude I mean you're going on right in front of me and you're redoing my own my old fucking material did you say anything no no he was so terrible was like you know I'm never gonna be this guy again anyway the odds are yeah it was but you know when you have a bit that you know you found out that someone you know George Carlin did 20 years ago you got to let it go yeah I mean but there are bits that I've written that that recently that like someone else and it's kind of like I don't fucking and then you get into what day did you write it well you know it's why you tweet everything there's certain things like the news stories when things happen that it's unavoidable when you know the Mel Gibson arrest happened unavoidable there's gonna write some similar shit you know when you're talking about Charlie Sheen is gonna be some shit but when it comes to like you know a bit that's like really like a signature premise I've had this issue with a couple friends where I was like dude you got to drop that bit you know that's this guy that's like real similar to this guy's bit I've heard it before and they go yeah I don't think it's that similar I'm like look yeah you're gonna do what are you gonna do you're gonna do this unoriginal guy man you know someone in the audience for you're gonna be out there on stage and you must know that there's 300 people out there someone knows that there's another guy who does that bit at least one maybe one person for me I can't do it right I can't do that bit now if you can do that bit to me that says something about you artistically the year you got some low standards you know and you're willing to come to come up with new media which is like really close to stealing and so yeah that's one of those things that's a bit of a that's like that's a how do you live with yourself kind of thing yeah yeah yeah it sucks man but sometimes you got to let things go I mean sometimes you know some well say all this guy has a bit just like that and then you go oh no he doesn't you listen to it it's like a similar premise but you went in a totally different direction with it yeah some kid accused me I did I wrote something on Twitter like two months ago some kid was like Aziz Ansari did that bit on fucking his special and I was like I know how do you think I got the idea well we were making fun of our Kelly's video real talk we got watched again after a year I haven't seen a video I have a song memory yeah Milton yeah he's trying to Knowlton's at the end of fighting they stopped in to fight this it goes bogus girl yeah bitch I wish you would and so we were making fun of it on the podcast and someone you know tweets me yeah Aziz Ansari already makes fun of it I'm ready no he doesn't known that sorry you don't get to own one of the greatest fucking unintentional pieces of comedy ever right I don't care if he makes fun of it I haven't seen him in front of it I'm sure he does I know he does in our Kelley bit you don't own making fun of art Kelley that's like owning making fun of Michael Jackson or make you fun of Shaquille O'Neal you don't you don't make you own you don't own making fun of something ridiculous yeah so there's that I see that but man when you find a joke that you know that used to be on some fucking Richard Pryor CD you gotta let that joke yeah it's hot I mean even cuz I have a good memory for jokes so it becomes like a it becomes a hard but I guess it just force you to be more original that's when I knew Mencia was a thief there was a first thing that he ever did where it really popped a red flag back when we were friends is he did a bit about a UFO landing in the hood and that's like some old yeah you know you niggas tear that shit you know think about stealing the a UFO from the aliens Chappell did a joke when he was in high school that if Alf came to his neighborhood a week later you'd see nigger in an Alf skin coat like 15 yeah that's fine yeah yeah yeah so Carla so you really yeah you just kind of go uh yeah makes you not really want to get a drink with him after well Mamie Mamie like to tell him and then I told him you said no I've been doing that bit for a while I go doo-doo-doo-doo that bits fauna unless you've been in 1981 naughty young 70s like that nigger's crazy it's on that one I think it's thing it's one of the old it's a cassette it's probably you know just released recently on CD or something you know and you know he was like insisting on doing the pin I'm like wow that's crazy like you're telling me that you know you know that Richard Pryor did it already and right I keep doing it because you came up with it on your own yeah look at that Bill Cosby one you know playing football with your dad well that was the one that you guys we didn't do that you know I know well that because of you guys yeah I was the nail that was the final nail in the coffin yeah I think so I think that was the one where people went what there's like he's a sacred you know deity in comedy Bill Cosby yeah you know there's not a single comic that'll you know ever tell you that Bill Cosby ain't shit you know does the fucking Noah's Ark bit you know and Noah what you know I remember that bit and that whole thing that he used to do I kiss stories these long like he was like he had a real particular style of comedy man yeah he invented the he invented a style yeah the long story and what a punchline at the end of this story you know and then I I'm not a fan of his show I wasn't a fan of The Cosby Show then what I really was it was just condescending it was just the whole show was like children are morons and I'm going to chop them down every week just yeah well you know it's a fucking sitcom man you know I get it but I don't same time you like I liked family tides like I liked family ties but that's about do you like two and a Half Men I'll say this for tuna have men I've seen it on mute on the plane and it looks like they're having a good time that might be the best answer anyone is ever good and then the Cajun I'll hear like a dick joke I'm always like that's a pretty strong dick joke for the first had come at that time slot I only watched it once recently and I thought it was the most unbearable thing I've ever seen on television I thought it was incredible that it's so popular we were talking about it yesterday I was baffled by it I couldn't believe how bad the jokes were this is just this is just an alien language right I'm watching it with my mouth open I'm here in the laugh track and I'm like this isn't even my language like what the fuck yeah you don't watch a show with a laugh track for a while and then you do you're like yeah I would like to watch it and have it all the laughs extracted like someone do it through Pro Tools go in there extract all the laughs and just have them say that the jokes and have no response and see how fucking bizarre that I wanted to do that where every punt you take the laughs out and then every punchline I just go BAM but I mean if you see like you know Curb Your Enthusiasm has no laugh track you know and it's hilarious but if you did that with like a show like two and a Half Men take out all the laughs yeah and only have them act out the scene it's fucking proposed yeah but having said that Cheers had a laugh track sign below the left track friends had a laugh track hey there's nothing wrong with a laugh track what I'm saying is when something's really horrible yeah and then you're faking it yeah and when if you could just listen to it without the laughter it would be so service like that movie that looks that like the movie with them I always forget the guys name the guy from who hosted the Oscars and he's handsome he was writing oh yeah steal steal robot boxers that looks good it's like a boxing to you real steel yeah real silly at first I thought it was an ahkam Sock'em moody it is and that's pretty much what it is yeah I thought it looked good just cuz I like the trans flame what Hugh Jackman shirtless in the real Steel's real damn I want to see that bastard I'm a nerd then fucking ruin the Wolverine character man I'm Wolverine supposed to be like five foot three and and built like I find those movies pitiful I find the odd the fact that they can only do superhero movies now just pitiful like it's there it's I told someone it's like it's there for dumb people to be able to explain to other dumb people like there's dude and he got bit by a spider man and he wears a uniform so you're never confused about who's who and he's got a logo on the Superman has a logo on the front and the back in case you get them you're telling me you don't like comic-book movies man I liked I'm such an old man I like the Chris Reeve Superman whoa and which other ones have I liked I didn't like x-men I didn't like like spider-man Alvin didn't so I'm watching the trailer for this this Rock'em Sock'em robots moving oh I like the Batman movies I like the new Batman I like Tim Burton ones and I like the the what's his name's this by the way this premise of this film where there's robots and the people like where this robot outfit and get in fights it's a fucking great idea man that's actually real robots oh these are robots and they're controlling them remotely that's what it is no they're just they're just training robots it's a good idea to have a avatar robot yes robot fights to me it's no different than racing cars you know what you're racing cars you know you're not supposed to be moving that fast you're using a machine move that fast you know and you're bumping into each other and cutting each other it was in the end x-men are at the end of Iron Man wasn't that wasn't Jeff Daniels in like a or didn't it didn't I like that movie too Iron Man yeah it was fun right yeah either new Conan looks fun a lot of people are shitting on it online it looks pretty fucking bad-ass to me and they're like saying that all that guy can't be Conan and he's not built enough he's not this no nobody really looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1500 BC right that shit's unrealistic no carbs yeah it was just all red meat back then he was in a strict diet in the Paleolithic times Paleo diet paleo Act that's what a lot of people are doing right now so that's all the rage you didn't know that yeah that's a good book Paleo diet is all like vegetables no grains no rice oh yeah that's good it's all things that are meat and vegetables you know things that people in the Paleolithic would have eaten right before agriculture before hot dogs and shit yeah those those uh you think that that's a I guess I'm yeah IIIi just a big fan of robots in good CGI you're a big fan of frogs no it doesn't look like good CGI and now in a financial way of looking at this movie I think it's the most genius thing ever you're mixing like fighting like UFC li it's mixing like like it was generated by a computer like robot and fighting like the pain was a guy who guys down on his luck and then the you know yeah I see that too I mean but I I don't know I think it's a good idea for kid for a kid movie I'm guessing that's what this is kind of like a teenager movie yes good it's you mean a movie because that's their Alford fight well for these goddamn teens teen no I said I told somebody that if the Godfather was released today Michael Corleone wear spandex suit on it and drive a fucking by like a bat will be able to be like a noble no be a cannoli man only oh how funny would that be if somebody pitched that in a meeting I just think he's the best yes everybody loves him he's number one right different he separates him yeah puts it on it goes out it fucks you know they're you know who it is everybody's got a costume uh just a costume that retarded people can understand that's what Superman you just go oh yeah he's fucking I'm retarded that's definitely super what did you take on this fucking spider-man thing that they're doing in Broadway you know that you know the whole story behind this the spider-man play it's the biggest most expensive play they've ever produced by far on Broadway and apparently it's a fucking financial disaster fucking backs and yet I was if there was another accident I was gonna do a Twitter a tweet where spider-man himself came out and condemned the musical the thing where the guy's a hero he wants to save people and it's fucking more people been injured then yeah they've killed more people in the Green Goblin and they they're flying around during this broadcast right they're doing this this performance they fly around like they're unaware they've reopened it they're trying to just wreak they brought the original director back it's just it's like hey you just want to say - I'm like hey you guys know you don't have to do this it's hard though once you commit to something it's pretty much over you know yeah it's very difficult to quit something once you're going you gotta admit that it's some you know there's the term is motivated reasoning where you just go oh yeah the whole reason you're saying is cuz you want it to be good you know so tell about people's pitch oh yeah the worst is when you go to table reads and you hear the producers with the fake laugh because they're trying to yeah so is that there's yeah anything grosser it's uh it's it makes you wanna it makes you want to move to wherever I am right now the fuck I am the hills if you want to you think stalkers wouldn't even bother you in it to stalk you out here would take a lot of money you spent a lot of money on gas get now this is nothing I would be very happy if I didn't have my marital situation and children be very happy living in the woods I would like it with all the people that I see when I do the UFC all the people that I see when I do comedy shows and all the other bullshit I need the opposite I need it I end up balance I need a counterbalance so you ever see that documentary in The Shining DVD there was a documentary that Kubrick's wife made no it's excellent but like Scatman Crothers it's just crying for no reasons the best but Jack Nicholson says in the documentary a famous person meets in in a month the same amount of people that a non famous person meets in a lifetime it's true yeah which is just about true lie and just you have no capacity to remember them anymore it's I get embarrassed sometimes but not remembering people but it's a thing called Dunbar's number you really only have a runner in your brain 150 yeah - plus you know plus or minus but you know you only have room for that many people in your brain and you know what every fucking weekend I meet more than that yeah every weekend at the UFC well that was I met Obama at the at like a month ago that the on bin Laden Eve because really yeah because my buddy Seth Meyers hosted the Correspondents Dinner and I brought a bunch of shit form and I was there and I met Obama and so that debt and and we had a really fucking funny cool exchange like like I said I my name is Neal Brennan I created Chappelle's Show cuz I cook Kurdish culture because I know Michelle was a fan and he's like oh man we love that show fact it's gonna be the greatest show of all time or something I was like mom how cool would it be if you could get him to say I'm Rick James bitch and so we've like Michelle this guy created Chappelle's Show datian house over Michelle comes out when she's like we were so upset when I went off the air and I was like how do you think I felt and so so so then we have an exchange and I was like I'd said to Obama was like this is also odd man I go do you ever get used to this and he goes nope and he goes but I can't just up and retire like Dave did really funny that day he had gone to Alabama to survey the the tornado he went to Cape Canaveral to they were gonna launch something gabby giffords the woman who got shot that senator lugar the congresswoman who got shot was there saw her gave a commencement address at Miami Dade Community College flies back to DC has to be personal and engaging with all these hundreds of people are lined up to get a picture with him and then he's got to do stand-up also he's got a hit out on bin Laden that he knows and people are like this guy's too cool is he too cool would you want him like oh my god fucking stressed out like he's not he's the right amount of cool and the fact that he knew to be like he helped he probably doesn't even remember meeting me I'll never forget it you know what I mean like everybody knows that he knows that part of the job is just performing the job of the president whereas do you know you've got to perform Joe Rogan no but I'm sure there's a party that you you just want to go I don't give a fuck and walk away but you have to like no it's party or some duties yeah I don't think you yeah I don't think that you're whelmed yeah you get overwhelmed but you kind of be kind of can't it's part of life I would say there's just people being nice to you that's what most of it is yeah no it really isn't if you were a hated person and that was going on yeah imagine if you're you know Monica Lewinsky or someone like that you know where everybody's like goofing on you they were LeBron you know yeah hates him now you know any any that's that's got to be fucking really hard to be a celebrity who's done something really fucked up yeah yeah yeah it's got to make you it's kind of fuck with your your whole so what are you doing these days when you up to doing stand-up and you know what I'm gonna start doing is a I've been shooting cuz I'd like based on this paradigm I'm kind of into the idea of just Auto to do everything myself put it out like and and so I've just been shooting some sketches I haven't shot I haven't edited them yet but I've got a lot of sketch I did my brain is my brain kind of wasn't working that well for like two three years it was just a little sluggish it was like my harddrive is full and I started taking this shit called 5-htp yes and in sense that my brain has just been like fit how much milligrams of per day are you taking um 400 400 which is way too many yeah but I don't I've always suspected I didn't have serotonin and this is serotonin so since then I've just been spending a lot of ideas for sketches for stand up you know for jokes for whatever and it's gratifying that I'm gonna try to do it cut on my own because I don't know you know people always say why don't you write for this show or that show I'll write for Seth because he's my friend and and and I don't and I don't want to be on a show where I can't control what's being selected right so you want to do something on the Internet where you can control everything yeah well I mean I can kyndra I could probably have a show somewhere and control a lot of it but I just I just want to stop craving corporate approval hmm I want to get past this idea of like if you've been been knighted by Viacom or whatever then you're more legit because that's the great thing about Twitter and Facebook and all this stuff it's like it takes them out of it you know yeah so I'm gonna just try to shoot some sketches and and do stand-up and and I would love to be a stand I would love to like do what you do you know obviously being doing the TV stuff greatly helped your your draw yeah it all helps but this has helped more than anything this podcast has been the biggest impact on my standup by far by a giant longshot that's great I never have been able to sell things out way in advance like this before and it's just from from you feel like people have a better understanding of you yeah sure yeah and two things have happened one I put out that Comedy Central special my last one talking monkeys in space which is a good it was one of my best ones it was a real representative of a real set too because a lot of times you're doing and when you really sit here and a half two years ago someone that year and a half and when that came out it was I'm coming central even less like less than a year ago and that made a big difference because then people said oh but the fucking knees actually got material he's actually funny you know what enacted bill burr said Netflix has been big yeah for him I haven't won on Netflix as well my first one I did was on Netflix Netflix produced it in 2005 and then Showtime bought it so it was on Showtime in 2006 but that wasn't as good as my talking monkeys in space one that's my best one yeah so so that would be I I finally have I could do an hour so I'm a so that's when you're gonna do these music centers and a little you know clubs well yeah I'm just I'm gonna go out and start do an hour and and then and then hopefully I'll uh hopefully I can and you know I would also like to direct my now or anything that would just be like a Dickey that'd be cool then I think ooh like really cool I do it yeah like cuz I don't think anyone Louise probably done it but uh but yeah I just I'm sort of like aspirational again I just want to take the all of like the sort of corporate shit out of it mm-hmm cuz I just think it's it sets up a shitty yeah like I don't want to shoot something and then someone go like they the audience will may not see this right but I shot it right and felt like me and dub did a pilot for Showtime and it's not bad life Davidoff yeah and it's it's out me and don't do a thing this just if there's any comedians listening this is really helpful once a week we have to write thousand word essays and give them to each other like so we have guys are gays fuck we have to and so we have to so it just helps writing right now forces yourself but yes so just the idea that people aren't you write a book you guys should both go write a book and you know that the the essays you write to each other back and forth for a year yeah that's a fucking great you poured each other they're just like about they're basically stand-up it's just trying to flesh them out but it's not like dove to the fat the past week with you I think we should start doing that you and me will write to each other and then if you want to talk to each other we can make a podcast scared - scared - right I'm scared of the judge yes so so I yeah just doing shit from the ground up I guess cool I mean you know I don't really have I'm doing a bunch of dates which are I'll be posting what am i I'm in Chicago this weekend doing a boy yeah I'm doing a show with George Lopez at the Vic Theatre opening for him Viva Luisa no it's like a heat everybody does like 20 it's like four people do 20 minutes and he aims really yeah called Viva Larisa what is it uh they've done like three of them are you Spanish no but I am a hard worker are you willing to get a ten they it's just George I think he just sees it as like a way to have people that he thinks for funny due time and he MCS and and then I'm open for Seth on SS Seth Meyers yeah I think that's at the that's somewhere in Chicago it's a weird that your friends you look so similar I doubt it it's fucking hot like people think we're brothers yeah if we were brothers I wouldn't speak to it's a family you guys get it so you've been through a lot of shit but it seems like you having a good time yeah man I mean I'm sorry to blow your mics up but uh but yeah like this Chevelle thing was not easy on me like it was not I don't even think I realized it like how sort of rough it was the the disintegration cuz they you know we were best friends for like 12 years before that so would you ever come on dr. Phil and maybe with him and to work it out I mean no we've talked to Phil would probably oh no dr. phero now me Andy ever cool no so happened with him on the plane when he freaked out on the you any information about that I was gonna plane someone they they've actually shortened the flight and landed early good yeah we came out he told me that they were the pilot was fucking with him and just being a dick referred TMZ I don't know four teams are like they TMZ was like there when they landed or something like I don't know that's what he told me I didn't like the pilot called TMZ from the cockpit no I don't I honestly I have no idea that's he told me that the pilot was being a dick and like fucking with him and like doing this with the controllers or something what I don't know it's what he told me and then when he got was he what yeah what exactly yeah you may not really yeah I can't even wrap my head around that how is it possible that he wouldn't be smoking weed I don't I don't some people don't smoke me yeah but when they smoke that much weed wad well diet a theory about black weed smokers and white weeds burger which is I've never met a black burnout but yet like there's no like a bleep black hippies whereas white people can get fucking completely burnt out I don't know what it is but we actually did like a study we did a thing on Chappelle's Show words but I think maybe the day you were there where snoop got high with a bunch of people we and we rant and snoop got high and then a bunch of like our staff got high mm-hmm and we ran them through a battery of tests because I just have an idea that there is no such thing as a black burn up because snoop is a sharp motherfucker dude there's a lot of Davers Davers all is smoke more weed he's got to be in the top thousand Americans in terms of the amount of weed you smoke that I've seen him smoke hmm and he's the smartest guy I know Bob I think it's all misconceptions man a smart guy with weed is not gonna be a dumb guy it's gonna be a smart guy hi dumb guys on we'd just get dumber they just hire more enhanced right now they want to talk more about their stupid ideas and they appear even more stupid but there's plenty of black burnouts man I know a lot of them left that theory sucks I know a lot of go to the hood there's a lot of black dudes smoking weed sit on the porch they won't do shit they're lazy as fuck oh there's a lot of them there's a lot of people that are smoking weed they're lazy as fuck white or black you know they're just lazy fucking people that they get high and they get even lazier you know but you're a smart person marijuana I think enhances you yeah I mean I I found that it would not enhance me but I just didn't like it get the right shit no I don't even I like I like I like Who I am Jeff do you know the difference between indica and sativa I like how you said that and with Joe on the end of it he made it a personal yeah the whole culture of it kind of bores me the culture is gross we talked about this yesterday with Brian Posehn in the interest of brevity again the there's a huge difference between indica and sativa indica is a really relaxed like couch hi
