good Roy would yo junior doing man pleasure pleasure to have you on here man we shake it one of these guys alive I don't salute Lee you are you're trying to pay bills be one of the funniest guys out there man I'm very excited to have you near Fox and we're talking shit about Apple Electronics that was fucking you out here so got the new back right and the new MacBook with the new OS or whatever it is it doesn't fuck with the old versions of final cut but the old video editing software used to use new met but goes you got buy that shit again I'm like my nigga I just paid for that shit hundreds of dollars with my last computer and yeah I have to give you might you tell me my old software no good but there and you could make the software work with the new OS if you want it to but they don't to get you to buy it again and all that shit so dirty so now I'm having to learn Adobe Premiere I was pretty good with Final Cut but I'm having just walk around yeah I've got a whole new thing and if I'm going to do that then I may as well relearn a whole new piece of electronics but to do that means I have to gut everything that means you have to gut the Apple TV you have to let go of the iPhone yet the lid or the iPad my girlfriend like the whole house companies get you yeah Samsung he had a Samsung tablet also pet shit out of here get your iPad so we get that and then got a my so it's like nah man he put get fierce about that Mac versus Android shit as much as they do about like Republicans versus Democrats I want something where I don't have to keep paying for the same shit over and over again every three four years Apple makes great shit but they funk you the interface is so smooth it's so nice yeah I didn't check text messages I can do whatever on my macbook yes I can talk to my television I can one click and all that okay and all of NASA it's beautiful but in three years it's time to pay up again I almost switched over a couple years back I bought a pixel and the pixel 2 came out but then when it came out I couldn't get text messages and I had a I got an email Apple and ask them to take my email address off of the iMessage database in order for I'm like take that email off so that I can't get I messages anymore and it still didn't work I went online to try to figure out what is a way how do you get out of this how does this work you can't know and if you unless you switch over to text message for a long period of time beforehand like switch your eye messages to text messages on your Apple on your phone or unless you buy a new number you gotta kind of buy it is if you're gonna get in a Samsung phone or something you got to get a new number what got you what when did you make the switch to Apple in the first what was the thing forever forever but what was the genesis at some point you had to fight like a sanyo yeah 59 that was my old flip phone shout-out to seeing you I remember when I was in radio back home in Birmingham I was gifted an iPod touch oh yeah and I was all Android phones Android everything and I had an iPod touch and at the time all I had said played music was a minidisc player so I could only hold like five hours I mean this is like oh 102 and I had a five hour minute it's not a fucking I'll carry around an iPod Touch and then it made more sense why am i carrying an iPod Touch and an android phone when I could just have an iPhone that does both and that started the journey I started with iPhone one but before that I was using mac books I was using Mac forever but even before they had an iPhone I used to make my own pcs I used to go to the store or like go to fries buy motherboard buy hard drives never had no time for that you got it you got a want to do that like it was for me I was well I wanted to find out how to do it and it was it was cool to play games on a computer that are put together myself but then you knew how to lie so you're building the games as well you got a floppy disk no I'm not definitely not building eight games I would just you know I video games just play among the same but even format in it and doing everything I would have to call friends that really knew what the fuck was up and they'd have to talk me through shit there's some things you have to do in the BIOS and you know the irony of all of this is that I still have an AOL email address as much as I stitch of really yeah well I know and you know I don't understand email slander my fuck it's I'm sending you words electronically does it matter its company what is it is my email more ghetto does it come with chicken grease stains when you open it in your laps no it's the same words that if I sent it from Gmail now I have a gmail account so that people will take me seriously when I email them about business ideas but I still have an old-school AOL email that I've had since college and I'm like that's right it's a one it's one of those things though wouldn't you just don't let it go I just think about you've got mail remember when you first heard that you've got man happy you know what the doctor beat it was very exciting who to talk to me and then you get older and you realize well please leave me alone who the fuck is this no you've got mail yeah it was exciting it was like a new thing that was 96 that's when I got on live yeah yeah 95 96 we had an old CompuServe account at the house hmm and that was how we got online and then we started getting the AOL discs and all of that shit we had a Compaq Presario people oh I had one of those I had one of those I started out with one of those old Macs that was like a beige box oh yeah that'll - yeah I don't remember what number was but it was 95 94 somewhere around there oh no that might be like the og MacBook with the keyboard and the CMU was its own little like maybe you know you had a keyboard that you plug in a monitor that had a plug in and it was like a tower I was like a beige look in a slow shit it's 14-4 modem yeah 14 for I remember when I got 56 cat couldn't believe it look at that speed I wasn't that Jamie it was a monitor didn't have the floppy disk built into it I don't think it's hard to remember I remember it being there was an actual tower and it wasn't join the whole computer was like the monitor itself with the guidance are you all together no but man I thought I was living in the future I couldn't do something like that Jamie bro my older brother yeah that one of the far right that was it Moldova had a Macbook man he had a um uh old-school Macintosh in in 90s and he a Microsoft Flight Simulator and you couldn't tell me shit I go to his house for five hours which is fly Cessnas in real-time look I get it I get why people will sit down with the flight simulator and fly in real-time from LA to San Francisco you seen the new ones they have oh it's unreal but I would need to buy a PC and then I know I wouldn't get shit done have you ever used the HTC vive no oh what's that what is it virtual reality we have one here oh the whole helmet sit down joint dude my kids come here and they battle to the death to see who gets the VR they fight each other logic it jet it's amazing man you put this thing on and like you're in another world you're fighting zombies you're in the ocean with with with whales and shit I went to a Samsung event they had some AR type experience where you put the phone on and it's fun but then I just I don't know in the back of my head I can't get I can't get out of my head how goofy I look to someone else so it's almost like something I gotta do alone yes you look goofy you look really goofy when you put there's a boxing game though that you can get a great workout in like a legitimate great workout because this dude comes at you you see me throw punches and every time you see a bright white spark it's wild man you're moving around and bobbing and ducking punches and throwing combinations your feet start hurting but your hands get tired is that gonna catch on for real Joe is this like the Nintendo Wii when it first came out no it's war you're gonna lose calories with the Nintendo Wii and then you're just a fat bastard on the couch learning now I learned how to bowl sit him down yeah the weak you can you can get in shape with this for real like if you wanted to do multiple rounds of boxing with this thing you would get in some serious fucking shape because it feels real when you put that headset on and you're that dudes in front of you and he comes towards you and he's got his hands up oh shit and you're moving around and swinging at you you see the punches flying over your head it's awesome now this isn't something that's predictive in a sense or is it like four types of workouts of different types of sparring sessions because the predict yeah if you knew the patterns it's still a workout yeah it's a good workout but either way you're fucking this dude up that's the whole idea the whole idea is to keep it on them it's not yeah it it's you don't feel anything if he hits you you just see the spark but that's next don't have this that vibrates it in yet you know it gets electrolysis and yeah yeah yeah there's a haptic feedback nasty where there's a place called the void you go there and there's a Star Wars game and the stormtroopers are shooting you and they hit you in the chest you feel you measure does it hurt oh is it like just the sensation just a sense it's like laser tag exactly yeah it'll get bored yeah it's getting there they're doing these warehouses now when you go into a warehouse and it's all virtual reality so they have everything planned out and like you walk on across this beam there's fire to the left you and fire to the right so you feel heat tell us that stuff they have it set up to make it you know really sort of mimic whatever sensation you're supposed to experience that's that that I would be I would be all there before I you know when I was listening to you coming up like you started talking about the sensory deprivation chambers and I'm like that's always been something that's in the back of my head it's like you have any time today you could do it I don't know how much time I have after let's see okay it's I know because I know what the mindfuck it's a little bit yeah but it's it's it's where else things where I go when I get a house I'm getting a grill and I'm getting one of those goddamn Joe Rogan boxes that's what I call them getting on them Joe Rogan boxes and I'm putting that shit in my fucking mancave yeah everybody should have an isolation tank it's a it's a fucking beautiful thing to have man it's just it it settles your mind like nothing else yeah that's that's the thing that I always struggle with is just too many I got too many tabs open of course at all times those comics do yeah and the only thing that slows me down is video games and puzzles puzzles yeah jigsaw and Sudoku those like those are the three things that I can do that I know immediately the moment I start the activity everything closes and I'm just focused one thing that's the only thing that I can do when I need to get my mind off of stuff I was dating this girl on time and you know you're not you're in the middle of an argument and so you're trying not to you try not to be a dick in the moment so I just start doing the puzzle just trying to stay calm and the she walks over and just start undoing the puzzle sign that's a sign of someone's intentions when some are you aren't doing your puzzle like oh this is my place this is the one place I can go in just mm be late now yeah yeah that's bad intentions that's that's like seriously bad intentions someone's trying to undo your puzzle yeah that's some shitty kids we'll fight to the death over that it's my safe place it's like when we smoker so you fucking up there huh well I understand that yeah yeah that's that's the one thing ever you know with her anymore no no no you know I crashed that you can't help I'll take responsibility on them we get puzzles that's my theme puzzles and a little bit of video again and batting cages I'd love to have morals in it that would be amazing you need a lot of space you need like yes le yard yeah I'm in New York right now there's nowhere to put if you live in the city yeah there's no do you like living in the city no why are you there because de Lucia I thought about it at first but then I had a kid the same year I got the show so I needed to be closer so we got to Harlem so Harlem is at least a shorter commute to the studio how far it where's the studio studios on the side hills kitchen on the water so it's like 53rd 54th Street and we're liking the 130s too bad no way yeah it's closer than Brooklyn right which was where I was originally when I first got to New York like the subway from Brooklyn yeah tried to be a city boy the problem is that I've gotten more done career-wise in New York in four years than I did the eight years I was in LA yeah because of the show yeah it's just New York is just more I just there's more of a hustle mentality really yeah I think so I think that I'm more prone to run into comics that are going going going going going and so when you're around that it makes you want to go it makes you want to write because you see so I'm still working on a little bit and doing all of that and I didn't see as much of that in LA now granted you don't get to do as many sets in LA cuz of the logistics of the city but I just felt like there was more of a Go Go Go mentality that just rubs off on you more letters because of that you don't get to socialize all of my friends are in LA so a lot of social relationships have suffered because New York is go-go-go think you're trying to get the next career thing done and then you also got to go home and be a dad yeah that's it's gotta be weird raising kids in LA or in New York too rather I talked to Gaffigan about that he's raised all his kids in New York City yeah they're in like Manhattan are they in Jersey where Manhattan he's been Manhattan forever yeah I don't I don't know if that's something not for the long run how old you kid that's three now so yeah he's young enough so that you know it it will leave him come on back out to LA right either LA or I would go to Atlanta Atlanta some shit Lana's good move Nate bargatze shown us the recipe was he living it you know he's I think he's got a place down south in Atlanta no Nashville like that oh no chef yeah listen those are both great cities if you if you're traveling on the road all the time and you just need a base you know yeah look man you look I have a buddy mine lives outside of Nashville he fucking takes pictures of his yard salt green I hear birds chirp and shit you know yeah you need yard man I grew up with the yard and you know so that and then family and it's just it's a I feel like New York is a great place to go but it's not a the best place to start necessarily yeah a sister but I mean like I start now laying people can start anywhere I mean it's better starting and it's better starting there than like a place that doesn't have much of a scene like maybe Phoenix Phoenix has like a little bit of a scene but oh yeah my first 9 years we're all southern are we gonna Road guy at Alabama I started in Tallahassee and Birmingham where like in those days like a 98 open-mike that's once a month per city Wow so every week if you to get on you had to get on the ground go to another fucking City dude that's commitment so that's the only way and then we started creating stages like in the Panhandle like from Fort Walton over to Jacksonville you started meeting like yeah you form a little we can network mm-hmm and this guy's got a Monday night at a shithole this guy's got a Tuesday night in another shithole and looking back on it it was all trash stage time that's the best you could do until you move it is amazing though how many guys have crafted careers just doing that like the will the will to do do time and define spots and the find place to work out I would make the argument that I'm better off now as a comic twenty years in having started on the road instead of starting in a major market just because I feel like when you're a road guy you meet every version of what your career could end up being when you're young because if you're if you're San Fran if you're a big city comic you're only hanging with your peers you run into the big wigs every now and then but it's some high and bye bullshit at the comedy club and then they go on their way but when you do a weekend with Ron White and you get to watch them properly night after night after night that's a fuckin tutorial yeah and that's a fuckin gift and then you can do a weekend the very next weekend with a guy who's been doing it 30 years hadn't written a new joke in 15 Burnout alcoholic hates his kids hates his wife and once I got to LA you start seeing well no I know to avoid that because I'll end up like that dude yeah I know not to do that because I'll end up like that that was a comic god damn I can't name names there was a comic that used to he won custody of his child and the one thing in the court order was that she could not be around the comedy club so you know what he did fucking brought her around the comedy club so as his feature I watched his seven year old while he will go out and do his set oh Jesus yeah but that little a custody of his kid because of that I don't know I haven't seen him fuck you can't bring you kids seven year old I brought my kids when they were like nine and seven outside a comedy club and I he can it was at The Improv in Irvine and I said because we were all down there having dinner together and I did my show and they they were like right around the corner I said come on let me take you backstage I'll show what it's like and the show was about to start and I had my daughter like come on peek out peek out there she's like oh my God look at all those people on stage I was like over on stage should I know don't run on stage come back and yeah that's safe that's safe but but have them listening to your shit know what that taught me was the importance of how important it is who you end up with as it relates to your career I was it can choke your career cause a lot of the guys that I started with you know a lot of road guys they're not doing it anymore or they're doing it at the same level that they were 98 and a lot of them I can point to dating the wrong person who attacked their psyche and their self-esteem in that degree four-year window because I feel like every year you get another opportunity to skip a level right right and if you don't skip that level you go back down to levels and so these guys are trying to go from here to here and you're with someone that's attacked why are you doing that you shouldn't be doing that you know there was a guy that used to take me on the road with him down south kinda on some mentorship type shit and we would go to gigs and if it was within four hours the city his wife would roll his wife would roll and both kids are in the backseat car seat age and it's like 9 o'clock in Georgia and we're just riding together to a fucking gig we would do the show and then in exchange for an opportunity for stage time I would drive this family back home and then I would go home and sleep in my bed but we didn't spend the night the family would stay at the hotel while we did the show and then we would get back in the car and drive the fuck back home knowing what I know now he was fucking chicks on the road and the only way she was comfortable with him still doing stand-up was if she got the role interesting and that's gotta be stressful he fucked up he fucked up but he tried to have both he tried to say both he tried to save the career and tried to save the marriage yeah and I think who you deal with outside the business is as important as how you handle yourself in the business I understand that one I understand her more than I understand the lady who's on doing your puzzle a woman solution mine that makes sense yeah she's trying to figure out a prop what is probably you still want to do comedy or I'm coming with you that makes sense you shouldn't have a three-year-old on a car seat for eight hours on a nothing's day night no no no I'm just cruising the freeway yeah but if that's the proposition she presents to you in order for you to continue doing your career then you know you either got to take it or leave it the comedies a tricky one man because in order to do it correctly you have to do it almost all the time you got to be up all the time I got a good situation where my kids are in bed by like you know eight o'clock on a weeknight and that's when I leave yeah I kiss him goodnight you know and my spots at the store usually around 10:00 so I'll just roll in you know yeah I'll hang up my wife for a little bit then I'll drive into town it's perfect but when do you eval sets cuz that's where I start running into overlap in time is figuring out the execution of comedy versus the preparation to do comedy mmm so reviewing the sets watching tapes well a big one that out yeah a big one for me is the drive there and home so it's 35 minutes to the store 35 minutes home so that's when I'm reviewing material I listen to recordings so they have it bluetooth on my phone so I do that through the speakers of the car and that helps a lot that helps a lot that's gigantic you know like it also puts me into mind I feel like the more sets you do right the tighter your stand-up is but the more focus you put on your set like it's almost as good as like a half a set like listening to a full set is like doing a half a set that's how I think it feel like the same way you find all the extra you found all the fat to trim yeah you find the fat to trim and you also find like a spark like oh why did I say that oh there might be something there and yeah and then you got to write that down and then and then I spent time just going over scribbles like right here you know like straight Pride Parade okay scribbles you know what I mean like okay what it was I think in there oh that's right that's right right and then I'll start adding stuff together and then I spend time just straight out writing this straight out writing times almost always when everyone's asleep so when I come home from the store it's like midnight or something like that everyone is to the best time spark up a joint fire up the old fucking laptop and that's why right there's there's a time the thing that I struggle with the most writing is consumption Chappelle says something years ago in a magazine about how every comedian needs to understand how their joke machine works and identifying the stimuli that you were encountering during the time when you're having a creative high in your in the writing cycle when ideas are just popping and coming to you document what was happening what was going on during that time and do your best to recreate those situations and scenarios to inspire writing when you have writer's block so I know for me it's stuff that bores me or stuff that annoys me mmm be it reading magazines TV whatever so I have to find time to watch it that I don't like or can't stand because I know my mind will wander into a place where I can write some stuff but like to physically just sit and consume television and that's what I have to start doing on the go like I get it not like I used to think these people were stupid and now I'm one of those people who walks around staring at the fucking phone watching my DVR on the train or something because I have to constantly take in so that when it is time to write that there's something that there's something worth writing there I had a conversation with Theo von about this last night where he he's burnt out and he had to cancel some shows and I said what's going on and he said man he goes I just been going too hard too hard too much too many weekends you know nine shows a week over and over and over again seven eight nine ten weeks in a row he goes I just I need this type of goes I'm not taking anything in recovery he goes everything I'm putting I'm just putting everything out because I had nothing to say everything seems fake when I'm saying it like I feel I felt you know that you know you laughing felt that spot where you feel like everything you're saying feels fake yeah like you're just bullshitting yeah I'm trying to I'm still working on a lot more stuff that has more teeth to it and I'm starting to become obsessed isn't the word but there's something noodling at me about veterans and the trajectory of veterans when they come back from war and all that shit and I was trying to work on a bit about Vietnam and started watching this Ken Burns documentary that's on Netflix right now and it's like it's fucking great like they they interviewed North Vietnamese soldiers as well ain't never I never in my life seen no shit like because normally Vietnam is always told from our POV and they're sitting down with just straight out via Carla yeah we was trying to get them on fuck this we set them up like unremorseful in the sense of speaking about the war from their perspective and going and and it tells the story from both sides and so it changed altered how I want to tell the joke and that's the stuff that you have to do from time to time to make sure that your jokes aren't weighted to one you know to one side that's black level material man if you're gonna make some jokes about war and Vietnam and soldiers and soldiers returning you're just you're entering into the trickiest of balancing beams that's where the reward that's that Gabby Douglas double triple I'm sorry Simone biles pardon yeah I said Simone what did she do I don't know someday I'll make a legal in competition next year because black woman it's like with surya bonaly was figure skating and she did a backflip on the ice and they were like yeah no more backflips they said no more back yeah they were like no yeah this French chick did a backflip and immediately the ILC was like no more backflips it was too amazing it was too good maybe they were worried about like those BMX dudes vmx dudes they started doing double flips and then they started doing flips triple flips yeah a bunch of us are crashing and breaking their necks fucking snowboard shit that's insane rising yeah freestyle you're stuck on that thing - it's not like skis where your legs move that went in a snowmobile we're coming over the handlebars of the snowmobile and coming back down oh man oh man yeah know anything with BMX bikes or motocross or any of those crazy white dudes that are doing flips it's all just do how many flips can you do landing on your front tire and the directs man I spent an hour one night just watching Rex just watching guys trying to do flips and land wrong picture pound fractures this is a birth of big air 34:30 where he talked about a new start at that shit in the 80s Oklahoma and they were just doing it for the love like it's just a dude with a ramp in his yard and just work travel no email no nothing just word of mouth does a dude with a ramp so when we're entitled to do that race we're gonna go over to this dudes yard dangerous shit you had to be like a trapeze guy like before there was motocross and bikes and shit what did you do like if you a crazy person you had to be a trapeze guy yeah well reopens you didn't have with me with skateboarding skateboarding wasn't really they weren't thrashing like that in Hades you know they were just rolling around like assholes like you're the craziest shit they did is getting a pool we're in a bottom of a pool this is nuts man we're on the edge the shit they do like kids like in general athletics wise like the stuff they're doing now like you've seeded in jiu-jitsu and an MMA the kids that are coming up now they're so advanced and they're they're all doing flying triangles and flying arm bars on each other god damn the humans are evolving so I came up playing baseball is there a are there certain Manute like in baseball before you turn like 15 I think they try to limit you throwing breaking balls because it'll fuck with you um no Bo Tommy John and all this so are there MMA moves where you just as a child you just you're not allowed to do this yet you have to be a grown man leg locks as a beginner they generally try to get you to stay the fuck away from leg locks because leg locks I know if you're familiar like heel hooks there's there's techniques that you do that are going against the edge of your knee so like here's your knee your knee bends like this right there going again it's at this one trying to bend it back that way and it's just you does not much give in your knees man and so when you get a heel hook it's like your leg your leg is like in front of like wrapped around a guy they've got their heel but trapped like this and they're pulling on your knee sideways and your knee just gets ripped apart and it happens it's very very common that guys get knee injuries from being overzealous and not not not like giving a guy a chance to get out of a technique there's a heel hook right there see that guy screaming this fuck yeah bro I'm telling you it is some fucking horrific pain you get apart you fucking ligaments pop you know it's it's a terrible terrible feeling and yet at SAS there's not much room for getting an armbar this like your arm is locked out you could kind of take it a little bit before you have to tap but with your knee the moment you feel pain it's too late your shits yeah look at that right there whoa look how bad that's Dean Lister Dean Lister is a fucking gorilla that dude on the bottom he's like one of the leg lock pioneers in jujitsu he's fucked up many a dudes future walking I'll say this about MMA it's definitely leveled bar fights oh yeah a little bit more now I've seen some scrawny guys like really fuck up big dude that know what they're doing yeah like it and you just see the day and it's funny because there's all the shit talking before the fight and then the fight starts and then of course the big dude is like tapping and the scrawny dude is still going I'm like dude there's no ref you're you're at a bar like this isn't you don't get to tap out you get your shit broken yeah there's a lot of people to get in fights that don't know what they're doing it's restraint it's like imagine if you challenge the guy to a basketball game we've never played basketball be ridiculous like I know how to do it I've watched it on TV but there's a lot of people that will do that with fights but the consequences of a fighter way more grave the consequence of a basketball game somebody kicks your ass in basketball you just look like a fool somebody kicks your ass in a fight you're you you're getting fucked up maybe permanently maybe your face is gonna be scarred up for life and I ain't no fighter man I'm a one in one lifetime oh one in one-one draw we have with the draw teacher showed up I got in a fight I'm gonna fight in the 8th grader to stop the violence rally no because I figured that'd be the best place to talk shit what's a better spot to talk your shit then at a stop the violence rally because someone will come in and go hey man right let's not do we brothers yeah Mario Brown slept the shit out of me Mario Brown where yeah Mario Brown is Air Force retired to this day now but on that day the worst you take your ill in front of everybody oh that's a hard one that's a hard al yeah get off on that one wrong no I didn't know how to fight at all until I learned how to fight I was terrified of fights I never it never never never was the guy who I was just trying to get away from everybody because I grew up in different places we moved around a lot when I was a kid so I didn't grow up like with a bunch of friends where everybody knew everybody like I was always the new kid so you always had to always always and so then when I was 14 I was like all right fuck this I moved to a new city new new town and I was like I got to learn how to fight started started taking martial arts I just became obsessed with it did you teach your kids yeah yeah I teach them but they're not into it anymore they they were into it for a little while but they liked doing other stuff mostly gymnastics and shit but the are you teaching them did you think today because I'm trying to silo my son you know how to approach self-defense how is 3 he's 3 early but it's not it's not a bad thing to get it to be a part of his body when he's really young like daughter start when she was five but the question becomes about teaching proper conflict resolution mm-hmm because also I'm wired a little weird in a sense that I feel like because he's a black kid he's not gonna get judged the same if he throws the first punch so I don't want him in a position where he might get expelled or you know but if you got to get a motherfucker off you right going on bend at me sideways yeah well that's the beautiful thing about kids learn jujitsu too is they also they're really used to conflict because you have conflict in the gym all the time not conflict in a negative way but when you're sparring you know you slap hands and you just do it and you go full blast you're trying to get each other as hard as you can and you can do that in jiu-jitsu because you're not hitting each other you're just choking each other and getting an arm bars and then when something gets you just tap and then you move on to the next thing and the the thing about doing that is then you're not worried about conflict it doesn't seem as scary to you like for me until I started learning martial arts I was fucking terrified of everybody I thought everybody was gonna kick my ass like fuck I was like every I'd see some dude that bullied me in my shit and I'd go around the whole opposite way of school I walked the total way around the school to get to the bus knows how much Laura was there 15 extra minutes I didn't care I had to walk 20 extra minutes home if I didn't want to cut through the south part projects because there was a student Spencer that was always every week for sure don't give me the damn business oh those people ruin your lives every week like they would sit on the porch and watch me walk in the corner store and then we'll come and take my fucking now laters and laughing deficit and mind you I've set aside lunch my I ate less at lunch so I could eat candy and chips on the way home then able stat shit right on my only thing saved me growing up I had to add a good ass basketball goal so all the gangbangers in the neighborhood will come to our yard to shoot ball so I essentially learned every every terrible person in my neighborhood shot ball at my house so you can't fuck with me because then you won't be able to shoot ball oh that's nice so I don't know if my mom did that by design I know she did it to keep me from going up to Powderly Park to shoot ball where you know that's why the bullshit will go down but all the bullshit came to her house but out of respect to my mom and my dad like they never started shit and I just walk around a neighborhood perfectly fine now at school I could still get fucked with but on the walk home it was gravy that's very nice once she got the best well that was good that's very nice yeah it's hard kid who's really mean who's like bullying you in high school and junior high school and that could fuck people's whole lives up sometimes people never recover from that shed you know it's a natural inclination that people have to fuck with someone's scared week too did you see it in animals man you see in dogs animals that's what we forget like clothes and automobiles of civilizer ZnO it's still I'm trying to take your woman and reproduce and I'm trying to fucking spread my genes and I'm gonna take your food like that's yep the basic of bullying is that mm-hmm yeah it's its nature and it forces you to overcome because almost every fighter that I've ever met professional fighter was fucked with George st. Pierre who's like one of the greatest of all time told the story on the podcast about he was driving his Range Rover when he was world champion through Montreal and he saw this homeless guy and the homeless guy was his bully in high school they realized he was like whoa I was like what's going on man what are you doing and like talk to the guy and try to make amends with the guy and help him out a little bit it's like fuck man this is his bully in high school when you realize like most people that are causing pain and inflicting pain on people dairy in pain man that's why they're doing it you know it's like victims you know the victims of crimes oftentimes perpetrate those crimes on other people that happens when kids get abused at home they get beaten at home they're the ones wound up beating kids up at school you know they just they want to dish out that violence on someone smaller than them because they're getting it dished out on them by someone feel some power yeah man I mean the that's that's the constant victim narrative but on the other hand families of people that grow up that are martial artists like like all the kids know how to fight they're the nicest friendliest people they don't worry about it it's not the thing that fucks with their head like for me I knew I didn't know how to fight it was scary so like every time someone fuck with me I get away I can't fight I don't know what I'm doing some dude got me in a headlock and threw me down on the ground and was gonna punch me in the face I'll never forget this like I forget what was happening we were talking we like I said something he said something stupid to me I said something stupid back to him then he just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground and he held me like that he was gonna punch his like nano you got a bother I'm just sitting there going god damn and I'm helpless locked up in a headlock of this dude on top of me going fuck and the only is only his mercy that he didn't punch my fucking face in or he didn't want to get suspended or whatever and I remember going that's it I'm gonna learn how to fight this is ridiculous do you do you ever run into the people from your past who have a revisionist history on y'all's relationship I mean not too much because the only people that I'm friends with from back then I'm actually good friends with that I was friends with when I was growing up like a couple of buddies but most people I don't most I never bought a ticket to your show and came up to the time I was in high school that's that's the only people that are still I'm in contact with anymore I had already gotten balls deep in martial arts like my first year of high school so by like halfway into high school I was already crazy I was already competing and traveling all over the place and so it was but I do run it if people have fake stories I run into people that tell me things that happen every time we're at a party you kicked that dude in the hand like dude I never kicked anybody never happened hundred percent definitely never happened I never went to a party beat anybody's ass never with that memory do you correct him correct him I'm like I never fought anybody some dude was telling me some story about some guy told him that one time we were on the street and some guys across the street would talk of shit and I went across the street and kick both of them the head and like that never happened never happened i'ma guarantee you it never happened because the last I was in a street fight I was like 15 I'm like this never happened this is not a true story I'm the opposite man people come to me with shit that I don't remember I just let them have it if that's your memory of us in college fine whatever it's weird though right you know it's happened when you definitely know look I know for a fact I was never in any street fights outside of high school I had a professor from college accused me in a phase in a facebook thread of something there's some article about me and like all the other alumni are commenting on it and one of the professors I remember in 1994 when you said this thing to me in class and stormed out of class I'm like I didn't enroll until 96 but I didn't say that I just I literally just apologized like because she's clearly been mad at me all of this time about something that I didn't even do and I'm just saying there's nothing I can say there's that's your narrative fine you know what I'm sorry for the shit that I didn't do what all peaceful but but then she replies on a net well thank you it means a lot and whatever so in my weird arrogant brain I've freed her of her anger or whatever the fuck it is she thought I did that's very cool of you that's a great approach I just don't feel like going back and forth that's a great approach it's it's so much easier to evade I'm more of an invader and a schemer than a fighter I'm not gonna argue with you and go back and forth but what I will try and figure out a way to do is over the next two years diabolically dismantle anything you stand for and believe in like that's that's my approach to think like there's a comedy club owner that God is my witness before I die I'm opening a comedy club across the street I've heard the stories it's one of the Carolinas you know corners we have such a complicated relationship with them because we need them and we don't want to do I don't want to fucking run a goddamn comedy club but we need one you know to have some guys dealing with a bunch of maniacs like us day-in day-out every week coming in and telling jokes getting drunk and smoking weed in the green room and all the chaos this is essential to the artform yeah the existence of the comedy club is essential 100% you ever get scared that the young people don't really go to clubs don't fuck with clubs yes yes I do it's gonna change the business model like in the next decade well one of the beautiful things about comedy clubs though is that we all use them like even if you're doing arenas like you use comedy clubs you use comedy clubs to exercise like Chappelle comes in all the time does the belly room that's a 70 seat room dude your strolls on in it'll be half into it yep and he'll do forty fucking minutes and that is so critical man it's so it's so important to get that work in that's why I don't like when a lot of the vets attack the as they call them Instagram comedians they get mad at them because the club will book them and they'll go well the live shit was trashed it's terrible and it's true for most of them it's not the greatest performance because they haven't had the chops yet yeah but they sold 300 pay tickets and everybody ate and drank what do you think is keeping the lights on for your 30% selling capacity as to come back in next year yeah and the next year to go from 30% Sol to 40% sold they're not making no money off it uhmm but if these IG comedians can come in and at least help keep the lights on I think in the greater in the greater scheme of comedy there's more good than bad I agree that comes from that and I also feel like there's there's a there's a level of ignoring the tools that they've been able to use to get an audience in lieu of the fact that they don't put a new stand up on TV anymore let's it's contest shit Comedy Central just started with the things that put the laugh at the seller shit but other than that I mean it hasn't been a lot well no one's even watching TV anymore I mean the numbers on regular TV programs are so low now like if you're doing a set Coenen like what is what did we win over this right like the numbers are like less than 400,000 people watch it a night yeah that's a lot that might be laughs plus three yeah stop with it I might not even be just lying there might be life plus DVR yeah next three it's crazy so no one's watching anything anymore if you can get onto a stage the way I feel about Instagram comedians or YouTube comedians is if you're doing stand-up you're a comic you might be a shitty comic and you might be a famous shitty comic because you're famous from vine or whatever the fuck it is but who you're a comic like it's whether or not you decide to become a real comic and actually do the work and put in the time and then one day be look I hope we see these YouTube comics and they're fucking terrible and then you go to see them seven eight years later and they're murdering they're crushing great timing they're eight premises I'm like we got one we got one we need more this is a hard gig think about what you had to do when you were starting think about you traveling around all those fucking things getting on a bus to do open mics here to open mic once a month that takes a kind of grit and resolve that most people don't but this shit is like hazing where the old heads feel like well they didn't suffer the way I suffered therefore your success is invalid I don't take that you didn't do it the way I did it this is the only way to do it the game evolved that's the points of access it's like it's like comedy is like to me it's like a fucking grocery store you've been in line you've been in this checkout line and then a new checkout line opens and then all these fuckers just cruise through that checkout and you're still stuck yes in the same waiting to get a Tonight Show set line and the Instagram line opens and people just start whisking through to success and you don't know whether or not to change lines or stay in this one you know the beautiful thing about comedy is you don't have to get out of the line you just open up a new line open up an Instagram line open number YouTube lon you can do all those things and waiting in line as long as me so why do they get to leave the store you know you have that jealousy that little piece of jealousy when someone has not been in line as long as you leaves the grocery store before you that's comedy now it is but it's wasted energy you can't think about that you can't like you should think about that the same way you think about someone having success in some field that has nothing to do with yours like if someone is a Nobel prize-winning scientist like fuck I could have done that yeah but you did it's really the same thing just thought of that yeah it has nothing to do but some people are like that some people see someone with like a start-up some internet startup and it makes a billion dollars they get angry they get angry because but don't go fucking do something don't worry about what other people are doing it's a giant waste of your energy you know I read a book rebel without a crew I think it's armed I think Rich Rodriguez I think his thing is his name and he was a filmmaker and he made the I can't remember the name of the movie but it was the prequel to what became desperado oh yes yeah and you talked about just shooting that shit gorilla and for essentially pennies less than ten thousand dollars shot a whole last film and walks through how we cut the corners and then you think of how to shot paranormal activity for like fifty five thousand dollars fifty or sixty thousand dollars the first paranormal activity was dirt cheap they shot the first saw for a million dollars in 30 days in one building whoa every and every scene in the car they're just shaking the fucking camera and jump cutting billion-dollar franchise getting reboot it now like that like what I see shit like that I don't get jealous I go oh fuck I need to go and fucking gorilla some shit together yeah so that's why I started trying to learn like in video editing audio editing and all that shit man so yeah no I was inspiring I loved when I walked in the green when I saw you fucking with that software I love when people were hustling when they're doing things like that learning new things and you're like you know what fuck this Final Cut Pro shit I'm gonna learn a Adobe Premiere they keep fucking with me making me buy a new version every year yeah now to be fair Adobe makes you rent the shit but I think there's a way to Microsoft does that too now with like office yeah a whole office we eighty dollars a year there's so many cookies yes - it just Krupps crooks and then you can't use the old version of office we can do and if I send you a file that's like office oh three you can't open it with the new off like it opens as a text file with no form like they do it to fuck you I barely use office I use it I have it but I write with right room for the most part do you know what that is yeah that's grip software it's no it's uh it's a software that turns your whole screen black and then turns the text green and you can't access your browser you can't do nothing you just have green software have you ever seen it no Oh ms-dos code interaction yeah on uh on my Windows computer I use a I use a program called Scrivener I do most of my writing on that and there's a distraction-free option there that's what it looks like that's a matrix in yes I write like I'm in the matrix that's hot right when I'm um I went my Mac because I think they have a version of that they don't they have a version of that for Windows I think they do but I've never really installed it I just use yeah I need to yes Mac OS doesn't say anything about Windows I heard a story that they wrote the first Independence Day movie in three days in a hotel room make sense just focusing in like that type of shit which is helped me focus if you had a lot of coffee or some adderall or something like that you dumb action movie three days easy you can go crazy yeah there's a guerilla style shit man is that's how this podcast got started this part this podcast reaches some stupendous number of people every month and it started out with a laptop in my living room because I was bored me and my friend Brian because I just gotten back from Colorado mm-hmm and I'm I was like yeah I can't believe I'm back in LA this is fucking terrible I'm like well let me do something and so I just started doing like q and A's um like a like a laptop talking to people on Ustream yeah yeah that's the one thing I wish I could have back I wish I had taken YouTube more seriously you take seriously right now though I do now but not in 2005 when it first came yeah but does not 10 just start rolling now see that's the same thing you were complaining about before no I'm just it's the wish that I have done something that's what your career is is that man miss suna then it's two things I would've done sooner they took an Internet more seriously and I would have taken some mores advice and not gotten on TV for 10 years I don't think any comment can do it though I think it is impossible to be a working comic and stay off of the if you stayed off of television for Tim if you start at your career and just never ditch it no festivals just crush crush crush crush you become fucking the legend that by the time you finally decide you're like a college quarterback that just stays in college years and years and years and never enters the draft by the time you do then everything is stratosphere but there's too much money as too many offers well you know who did that Joey Diaz Joey Diaz didn't do any stand-up comedy on TV until like 15 20 years in yeah he was crushing for that but Joey also I think is from a different cloth where he wasn't seeking that Audi that he was dead well she was seeking out they were scared of him you know he was talking about eating ass and taking in the muffler and yeah he talks crazy but I think I have a different perspective I think their song I have a bunch of old sets for me when I was when I was on TV I was doing comedy like five years four years they're terrible yeah but the good thing about it is they exist and it's lets you see like look this was in the beginning I was talking terrible but just keep going just keep working at it keep working on it you get better you know like I'm not under any illusion that I didn't used to suck I try to talk about it as much as possible I was terrible when I first started if you're okay with that being out I don't give a fuck dude I've been digging into crates I've been digitizing a lot of my old VHS shit trying to you know just for posterity and going through some of my old fucking TV they're all terrible like the Letterman said is probably the only thing the Letterman and Def Jam said and oh six those are the only two that still to this day will go I still stand beside those jokes everything before that premium blend starsurge last comment and then Apollo comic view all of it unlike Barry that shit my biggest fear is becoming famous whatever the fuck that is and then bTW just rolling out some sort of remember when fucking thread you just use all the black comics it uses up twenty years ago just going no that's who you were that's that's part of the process yeah like not lights a process I don't care I'm fine with it the problem is that the gatekeepers that decide stuff they only want the newest shiny thing so if they see you disowning that's problem right that's the only problem you don't need those fucks you don't need gatekeepers internet the Internet has no gatekeepers they have people that are podcast to get you on their podcast you do your own podcast you put out a lot of content no gatekeeper but the problem with is that it takes comics discovering it because the problem is a young comic is that you inherit the goals of your predecessors so as a young comic especially as a road comic every road comic is trying to get on TV so they make you believe TV this is where you need to be going don't fuck that YouTube shit little nigga tell you right now you got to get on goddamn Letterman you get on Letterman and then you get the show I got on Letterman and is not a knock on Letterman and it's worth as a credit but the worth of a late-night credit in 2006 versus 1996 it's not the same currency no there was a deflation in the currency so it got me more rooms it got me more money but there was no Ray Romano fucking here's your career change your career here's your Kevin J like yeah it doesn't work like that but the only but you're chasing what somebody else wanted and the game is always moving the school of fish are always so you have to be ahead of that curve and it's just didn't listen to the instincts yeah it's hard to see where it's going though if the people from your predecessors the the guys who were successful when you were coming up where they were headlining and you were middle and for them that mean that was the goal the goal was the tonight show the goal was yet but I don't think is that hard to see the future not necessarily see the future but see the trends of where people what people are paying attention to I'm quicker to read Fast Company than I am a variety or Hollywood Reporter because we're tech goes that's where people go but people go they want to laughs figure out a way with that to integrate laughter into whatever the new tech of the net like this tick-tock shit whatever this seen it but I don't know a better fucking figure it out really because that's the next one is it the next one we brought up tuition maybe it's music it's musical vine in a way like it's it's music sketches but it's still funny it's entertaining so Tom Segura does it like all the time he's into it she's okay he's like ironically doing it but yeah but he doesn't he doesn't funny she's Tom Segura is self-aware that he's a guy that shouldn't be on tick-tock so his existence on tick-tock is what makes it funny it makes it but he's ahead he's ahead he's ahead of that curve so the other thing that then compounded guys like me from my generation is that Dane Cook was one of the first that was like I'm fuck TV what's over here and so many people shit it on Dane out of jealousy that you ignored the fact that his myspace move was some fucking boss shit it was it was huge it was huge for everybody I remember I read People magazine there was an article about how he had like 200,000 or 300,000 myspace friends that's crazy I remember thinking that is crazy how does he have so many friends yeah but he was using that and talking to people online constantly and rather look at him and see how he did it you stand in your checkout lane and go fuck him he got out of the store before me hmm well I shifted and I started promoting on it don't say I didn't I'm just saying a lot of comics like me just didn't you lean on what you're told because you look at older comics as mentors instead of realizing that maybe they don't have a shit figured out evening you should be trusting your instincts he was the first guy right he was the first guy to really make it through the internet under digital sigh yeah hundred percent right I'd say that I can't think of anybody perform because I can't think of anything before that other than my yahoo chat rooms no he was the first guy he was the first guy in the first guy for sure that became famous from my space because my space was like the first platform yeah social networking shit yeah his uh his album sold like two million copies or something Italian oh my god that's if you stop and think how nuts that is today like today a big artist like if Eminem puts out an album how many does he sell I'd say four hundred first week maybe three two oh four hundred well let's give it a year say depending on what week you're releasing right now you could be number one with like thirty thousand sales whoa yeah forty fifty thousand sales boy they just got it that record business didn't they that is crazy what happened with the Internet the internet took out porn and music by the knees I just have a fucking neighbor he lived right down the street like two houses down for me this crazy porn dude I stood jujitsu with him - it's all steroid it up and maniac good Wild Eyes dude just crazy like coke yes his coke and steroids and he was just fucking up a storm constantly and pulling it was like past his house and he's always had these fat Mercedes parked in his driveway and also hot girls and our underwear walking around was hilarious this dude was a maniac but then they the internet came around the internet just gutted his business just got it and they repossessed his house I'll never forget man his fucking house got repossessed and I remember seeing it in like the real estate section also fuck man a dude lost his house yeah he had a fat fucking Rolex with diamonds all over it porn got really fucked over but you own you want to talk about the people selecting what they want to see that's what's what's a bigger focus group than people who want to fucking jackoff right and they've decided I would rather see somebody in the hood in their house with no lighting and just terrible fucking camera work and that's interesting what it was it is that porn became free and they just used ad clicks and they would just pirate everyone's porn say if you were a porn producer and you were making a bunch of porn they would just take your point and put it on like whatever website and then you would have to get a lawyer to try to take it down yeah it was like some LimeWire to the eightieth power it was like way worse than gotten the entire business but you don't think the free side like the amateur porn oh yes I mean that's bigger now but in the beginning yes it was just porn clips getting chopped up and nobody paying $40 four or five hour DVD you know what I know that not I was doing research recently you know what I noticed there's a lot of like stepmother porn it's a lot of like stepmom horny stepmom porn your stepsister it's all like taboo stuff it's all it was also a lot of getting caught porn yes yes yes yes yeah like the wife walks in you're in the middle get your dick so yeah why and it cuts right there yeah yeah there's a lot of that I did we did a story on racism and porn for Daily Show and so we were shooting up in Chatsworth or whatever what I didn't I learned so much about the porn industry in that I didn't know that like they would just have a fuck house where's like a 8 bedroom house and every bedroom is this individual studio set up for whatever genre it was like at least 5 different genres of porn being shot in that house and we're out in the and I in mind you I still have this image that if you're a porn star and you're working with a porn studio there's some bread there's got to be a little bit of money and one of the porn stars was is it actress what's the fucking word no horn actress yeah so one of the actresses her car is blocking someone so I thought is give me a keys I'll go move your car in this car had to be the most filthy sad is fucking like to the point where I'm like if this is what fucking on camera gets you there's got to be something else out there and you want to talk about people that need to see where the curve is I think if you're a woman in your cool bit doing porn you're probably better off just doing it on some self start and shit than even dealing with any of these LA crooks in the first place yeah if you could figure out a way to get an audience I know there's a lot of dudes who they run these companies that girls use where they just people pay to see their videos like like someone will ask you like if you're a porn actress they'll say hey I want you to use this dildo and cover your tits whipped cream and I'll give you 150 bucks and then on some live stream yeah yeah they make their money doing that and they'll do that like all day long and rake in thousands of dollars yeah just like the food videos where you sit but naked and eat some food going up a virtual date with the person yeah I think it's butt-naked foodie sometimes naked sometimes not and like you haven't it's a lot of that in Asia yeah a woman's just looking straight at the camera so anyway today I'm talk to her doctor it's sometimes it's just a straight video and you don't get to interact with it because there's multiple people watching the feet concurrently or if you want to pay a little extra yeah one-on-one I will sit here and pretend to be on a date with you and we can and that's just that's more feeding loneliness then some sort of erotic desire but no Khalifa was talking about this shit couple weeks ago she did she says she only got like 12 K for the year she only did porn for like a week right here something like that [Music] she put in a solid effort thanks kidding if you're someone that wants to do porn you were coming off better just setting up your webcam like Joe Rogan yeah day one podcast you and Brian with a laptop and a microphone and just turning a webcam on and just doing whatever the fuck you want to do with yourself then dealing with the industry yeah and the record industry's becoming similar to that too I think so too but I think that it's hard for them to find an audience that way there's so much porn like I had a joke I was doing for a while about why they making new porn like who is jerk off to all of it no way anyone has seen it all but yet they keep making new porn it's like it's crazy like there's no demand like there's no demand for new stuff that's plenty like you would have to be some kind of crazy creep to have seen every porn that if ever as ever existed but it's no different than MMA there's people innovating is useful innovating in porn back flipping and POV in these scenarios breaking their necks yeah yeah it's uh I think the the cam thing is the big thing girls fuck on camera you know they'll have the boyfriend come over and they'll fuck him and suck his dick on camera and you pay to watch and I think that's that's the big thing and they do private shows and like the guy could tell you know you could tell the girl hey I want you to do this to him and they'll do it on camera you know the funniest shit though so Steve Byrne and I we were in Pittsburgh and three things lead to another and we end up in a strip club and it's a weekend and so a pair I didn't know this but porn stars tour strip clubs and they'll go to a strip club on the weekend and dance and sell whatever pocket pussy or whatever vagina mole they have and all of the strippers fucking but the strip is a coup because all they bring more people into the club but for the most part the men are saving their tip money to tip the porn star that they came to see so it's like being a seasoned comic and then the Instagram comic comes in who's never stripped before like yeah you fuck on camera but it's not stripping what I do is an art what you do is slutty behave because you know like there's like a beef between like strippers and prostitutes because like some strippers are sucking fuck in the back of the club and it fucks up money for the rest of the strippers right that are yeah they're you know playing the game straight-up right so there was this weird tension in the strip club while the porn star was on stage and I like stripping to me is performative it's in a weird way it's common in stripping it's damaged people entertaining strangers so there's more of a synergy so I don't really get anything out of watching the stripper cause in the back of my head I know you're thinking about groceries or some other shit but it was hilarious as a comic to watch two different same but different type of people for it's like the magician versus the stand-up versus the juggler and how they all kind of don't really like one another for one reason or another because they all think what they do is superlative to the other guys craft mm-hmm and it was it was goddamn it was fucking hilarious that is a inside scene that only strippers can really appreciate what you're talking about you know what I mean yeah like for them they're like yes those bitches real in it coming over here a bunch of fucking whores there's there's a couple of strip clubs I used to go to in Birmingham where like you know the club will close it too and the police would leave and then at 3:00 the club it reopened and then it was open season you knows whatever you want to do and then you would see strippers in the parking lot yelling at the other strippers who were choosing to stay for the 3 a.m. session saying that y'all are messing it up and that's why nobody comes before - it's because of what you're doing and so it's just so so 3 I became like a brothel yeah yeah it's insane isn't it hilarious that you could fuck anybody you want for free and there's not a law about it but as soon as money gets exchanged you're a criminal and everybody's mad at you if you're just a slut no one but if you want to fuck people for money that becomes a real problem for people because people desire sex so much and there's so many guys that cannot get laid but they've got some money and if they find out they could pay for it I think people like no you can't you can't pay for it you could pay for everything everything that's legal everything else that's legal you could pay for except sex you could pay to have someone cook for you you could pay to have someone rub your back you could pay to have someone cut your hair you could pay to have someone mow you want you can pay to have someone take out your trash you could pay to have someone clean your house all things you don't want to do you can't pay for someone to suck your dick you can't that someone could do it for free if they like you there's no problem it's very strange or in exchange for college tuition you can't even do that if you made like a deal like you suck my dick and I'll give you a house people go hey you can't do that that's prostitution very strange right I mean think about all the things we do that we don't want to do but we do it for money everything's fine yeah there's no issue even things like you know I grew up doing terrible construction jobs I'd never want to do you know might be better suck a dude's dick for a thousand bucks then the leader I will fucking carry cement bags all day for $400 for a whole week please at least she got that I used to birthday jobs faced over day labor when I was in a as an MC so I can make more money like in the one advantage to south had was at the comedy clubs back then were like five six day runs work during the yeah Comedy House Theatre in Columbia South Carolina used to be a six night room it was Tuesday through Sunday so I would get to town Monday night and Tuesday morning I will go to a day labor spot get a job assignment and work the whole week 9:00 to 5:00 oh and then at night go do my little MC bullshit kids need to hear this kids coming up they need to hear this that's important you go that's real hustling dude well I am I gonna sit here in a hotel all day and do nothing when I could go make a quick like minimum wage is like five and a quarter it's like the only making 40 bucks but that was extra money yeah but I counted on that little extra money and we used to work submit fucking oh my god there's a quikrete factory in Columbia South Carolina and I've worked there I worked there two weeks at any time I played the comedy club I worked at the quikrete factory Wow so did you have to call them up or do you how do you show that you show us at 6:00 in the morning with your with your driver's license and you sign up and then you sit in the lobby and you watch the Morning News until your name is called and then they give you your job assignment Wow and so you bring boots you bring a hardhat because you don't know what you're gonna get you might get something with a keyboard you might just be outside holding a stop slow fucking stop stick while they pave a road and that's your gig for eight hours Wow you just stand in the fucking Carolina heat and just fucking 525 an hour I'd love stories like this dude that was my first ten years was just working day laborer weird jobs to make extra money and if the gig was under five hours I would drive back home like I wouldn't even stay so that I could at the time I was still working morning radio so if it was within five hours I would do morning radio get off the air at 10:00 be on the road by 11:00 five hours nap do the show get back in my car at 10:00 p.m. five hours back to Birmingham sleep at the station wake up at 6:00 watch let's repeat I can't lose the radio gig because that's - that was too much of a good kid right and I was doing prank calls and I was using the prank calls I was taking my prank calls at the time and sending them to other morning show this is website radio online which kind of breaks down it's almost like billboard it's almost like Nielsen or some shit but for radio and so I would go there and I would look for other local morning shows that weren't syndicated in cities where I wasn't performing and so I would send my print calls for free to these morning shows I'm gonna look I'm a comic here's some free print calls we do in Birmingham they're not going anywhere else you wanna air them in Omaha the guy says yes he's not gettin have shit else to play on the air so I was in the prank calls the guy would play - prank calls for a couple of weeks a couple months and then I will call the local comedy club and go hey I want to feature in your room I'm on the radio and I know I can get on there and this is when the belief that radio still could bring people to the show so I will call local comedy clubs in cities where my prank calls were airing and used that as a leverage to get booked as a feature instead of an emcee and so that's how I was able to kind of jump a level because I was a feature that was coming in town with the pre plugged in media access and all of that shit dude you're a hustler you're a real hustler I love here and shit like that that was I really do I love here in the driving part I love hearing that get in the day job part kids need to hear this all you fucking kids listen to this right now they're thinking you want to visit a job in show business this is what comes with it and that's why you're so good man that the hustler mentality that's so important that's so important you just network you find people that you can that are as driven as you and then you just figure out ways to work together and do shit but comedy is so so many motherfuckers are lying bro they're lying also and you lie you get the leverage and like it's like so the way I got hired on radio so at the time the thought was that this is 2001 I'm out of college and if I can get on the radio then that will give me more access in the city and I can host my own comedy night by hosting my own comedy night I can offer money to out-of-towners who also have comedy nights and do swap out so I needed to get the radio gig so at the time they were doing some sort of contests or some shit who's the funniest in Birmingham some shit and I missed the window for the practice and so I knew I think the long story long story short is that I go to the radio station I ask the guy at the time buck Wow who was also 95 7 not the same story but a lot of different book well ok so I said hey man I'm a comic I have a degree in journalism it's a perfect fit fuck with me and he goes nah we're done with that we're not gonna have a comic I go ok cool now I've done enough of a comedy club in Birmingham to know that on black weekends the black radio station hosts the black comedy night on Friday snaked a lot of t-shirts and all that shit so I go to the comedy club and I told bruiser as I said hey I just got hired at 95 7 and they want me to open for deals you believe this weekend and he goes ok that's fine I'll go back to 95 7 I go yo I know you don't want to fuck with me but I'm opening for deal this weekend do me a favor watch my set if I'm funny put me on Monday morning he goes you got a deal so I get to the comedy club that Friday and all I have to do is keep buck Wow and Bruce airs apart so that me the one knows right what the fucking lie was right and Bruce came backstage and you just if as long as you act like you belong and you act like the truth is the truth people will kind of merge in with that shit and Bruce Cameron goes okay buck wild you go out and throw the t-shirts and then you bring up ruin and I went out and it seven minutes but fucking crush like just when you need that one set to go right in every syllable every fucking comma it's perfect and I demolished in front of DL Hughley and I walk offstage and book while says see you Monday morning and that's how I got radio it's just what were you gonna do not fucking book me I'm already not really working the comedy club I'm already not hired by you what is the penalty for this lie is this lie will this lice in me to jail no good it's a hustle lie yeah I'm not saying load your resume with 50 different credits that you don't have but if you've performed somewhere else outside of where you're from you have performed across the country yeah what you basically did like the comedy version of a subprime mortgage loan he sold the house of someone who really shouldn't be buying a house worked out he kept the house that's a man I just I came up man cuz you know I got a restroom when I was I was 19 so for the credit card front oh we was still in credit cards in college and like buying Jean's and all of that shit so my first two years of stand-up I was on probation so when you have that I could have gone to jail this shit could be a lot worse living in the back of your mind forever hustling like people call the house I just like no this is have no choice I have to fuckin do this I knew a dude who was one of the original credit card fraud stirs his name was international Sal yeah man he was a dude who used to come to this pool hall I was at and international Sal was like he was a real nice guy but he was a famous loser at gambling and that he would make millions of dollars on credit-card fraud he had they had an organized crime Empire and this would they would do back in the day remember they had this transparency like they would run your card they would put it on a machine ago just shoot shoot yeah carbon/carbon Marvin it would take those carbons people who worked in these department stores would take the carbons and sell them to him he would take those carbons make a totally new credit card out of Christ some sort of machine and then they would distribute them to these guys they would buy goods with this stuff and then they would sell the goods and then guys would come to him in the pool hall with paper bags filled with cash and all he wanted to do was gamble on pool and he could never win and when I'm telling you never win that guy was playing with dirty money and he knew it his head was fucked up he would be staring that nine ball would be in the hole and he would be away from it and you see his hand shaking and Shane just just fuck it up and hit the rail and bounce it off and people go no he meant stick I can't fucking believe he missed an international Sal could never win he could never win but he was one of the original dudes did you find something from him something very weird just happened what happened so I'm typing I'm typing international Sal right and I hit spacebar right and two things come up credit card thief and pool player but when I click to search for that nothing shows up huh like for instance credit card thief and it just brings up a bunch of other stuff about credit card thieves and other well honestly it might be because of us I've never left four but the search might exist because of us because I know other international Sal before in him being a credit card thief he's dead my friend's mom was actually taking care of him when he was in hospice he was yet cancer he died of rectal cancer mouths damn sound yeah I was bad it was bad no no sabe Terra is a famous pool player this international Sal was a lot of famous boats albutairi he was one of the original credit card fraud stirs he went to jail for quite a long time but and then got out and was doing the same goddamn thing again was crazy though is that when you get arrested especially for light some white-collar shit like that like what they don't tell you about getting arrested is that the first thing they do is try to pin other unsolved it on you so before you even like get a mugshot or anything you just go sit in a room and they go here are all the mug shots of other people we are looking at for similar crimes do you know any of these motherfuckers then you get a handwriting sample and then eight as in like there's and that's when you find out like oh I was just a petty fucking teenager that just took a credit card to get some jeans and then you start realizing like oh there's an entire fucking syndicate of shit happening in this city that I didn't know anything about they trying to fucking pin on me and that's when the fear set in cuz like and you're like alright well I know I probably won't go to jail I hope I don't go to jail oh shit I might go to fucking jail for some shade didn't do oh they don't care they do not care that's beside you already a criminal and that's when I got into comedy that was the fucking depression like that was the fucking moment like oh shit well Joey Diaz went to jail for armed kidnapping that's how he got into comedy he robbed a dude over some coke with a machine gun taped him to a chair and shit and then when he was in jail he learned how to do stand-up that is the best cold open to a myopic Joey Diaz gets his biopic it has to start with duct tape he took pictures together didn't he put it up on his Instagram he took pictures with the guy kidnapped he's like 31 years ago I kidnapped this cocksucker you know were friends that's the beautiful thing no man it's a Redemption and being able to make a mistake and get back in the mix some of the greatest most disciplined people could went to jail because they were like Bernard Hopkins one of my all-time favorite boxers yeah he's one of the greatest middleweight champions of all time and Bernard Hopkins spent like six years in jail for armed robbery and he learned how to be disciplined when he was in jail and when he got out of jail he not not only did he have like a drive that other people probably couldn't comprehend but he knew what would happen if it went bad again he knew what would happen if he slid back down that road again and apparently like the corrections officer too said when he was getting out you'll be right back in here like the fuck I will be the fuck I will be and he turned out to be one of the greatest boxers of all time there he is Joey's with the guy 32 years ago I made a mistake so what is that what you started and showed up to my show 32 years ago I made a mistake so what that's totally a start it's where you finish that isn't crazy you know that's that's what the whole redemption is about yeah you know do what you can with your second chance that's why I just tried to ground man all this shit as a gif I could have been in prison disco the reason I get sent to does not want people to have Redemption it's interesting this culture today wants people to be in trouble for things they did in the past you have to be who you were 30 years ago yeah we all go to church and ask for forgiveness Sunday for an opportunity to be forgiven for what we were that week well the idea that knowing that no one gets a chance to redeem themselves that's a terrible world like that's one of the best things about Christianity is the idea that you have Redemption you confess your sins and you move on I just think that it's all new and I think there will be a I think it's all new I think there will be a market correction at some point because as a society we are obsessed with who you were mm-hmm credit reports rental history drug history employment history but when you sit down with somebody wanting on your dating history so I can Twitter it's just racism history or your bad joke history yeah it's it's it's an opportunity for the first time as a society to audit your past behavior when all we do is judge who you are now based on who you were that's what our society is established upon so that's why it doesn't feel so out of pocket to me that people know it's a new way to see if you and me I can literally search your name plus a word and see if you say it the word and then I will forgive me yeah it's no different than a fucking bankruptcy sitting on your record from I like how you described it as a market correction because I think that is what's gonna happen we're gonna understand that what we're doing now is kind of unsustainable like going back and judging someone on some shit that happened in high school or whatever it was and and trying to look at words you said when you're trying to make a joke like would happen with Kevin Hart and yeah apologize for it many times and then he's hosting the Oscar and they're like look 10 years ago he said this he's like look I'm not gonna do this I'm not gonna do this again all right apologize for those things I'm gonna move on sorry and the Oscars got fucked they want to have a no host now did we get fucked did the associate fucker this stand-ups good fuck because the Emmys don't have a host now either it's good I love Sebastian I love Sebastian but Sebastian made me cry when I was looking at this fucking video musical world award he's gonna be amazed yeah he's hosting that shit and there's some thing this is what comics do we hold the jobs nobody wants to make it Sebastian sold Madison Square Garden out four times yeah the fuck is he doing hosting the Video Music Awards you want to sell it out six why else do it why else do it let me show it to you before you before you because in judgment go to go Sebastian's page there's like a thing weighs like asking he's asking Jimmy came out how to do it it's like dog get out get out of course they're forcing me to do a bunch of shit that's not good that's not a brand for him right no it's not a brand for anybody there no there's certain who else is gonna roast that shit who else is gonna show up he's not gonna roast it he's a nice guy so that's not gonna roast shit look if you got on the first promo he roasted himself for even there in the first place yeah that's okay but if he will some space roast people like a Ricky Gervais was hosting something that's different yeah and that's a totally and they all get mad at him and he goes after this is brand he is cut through everybody cleansing himself I don't know I just I've always enjoyed comics being able to have that to just go to whenever like if you look at the history of the Oscars it's almost always stand-ups a lot of times I just don't give a fuck about award shows see there it is that's the truth yeah that's the real truth it's not even the award host it's why the fuck we'll be doing this thing and that's like you would see Chris Rock prepare for these award shows I'm like you're Chris Rock you couldn't pay me to come anywhere near one of those stupid fucking shows Chris Rock Chris Rock walked out at the NWA CP Awards and did a Jesse small angel nobody else is gonna give you a CI you laughing look at you enjoying that shots different no other comic is gonna give you that that's true work what is the worst possible thing that can be said in this room full of black people that hold him and that shows sacred yeah and he fucking said right to it you went right to it no Kevin would have done that Kevin would have done that at the Oscars Betty Murphy would have done it you see Eddie Murphy when he did that we got the roulade he went after Bill Cosby yeah but it was great yeah it was great what he's talking about they're making him give him back his awards like yeah yeah what does who come back from it Oh it's Jesse small that you can't write yeah you can come back from Italy like people are the most forgiving genre of people are Kelly still sells tickets he did come back hard though that is amazing Kelly so tickets time everybody saw the piss tape he had supporters at his arraignment in Brooklyn yes big fat ones yeah black artis so if you told me just a small they can come back and telling a lie on the street of Chicago he say Canada's are Kelly he's not as good as our Kelly but he can get cast and some Jesus movie in Egyptian and it'll parallel and he said not admitting that anything happened the problem is that the people that could give him the redemption are some of the people whose trustee betrayed that's the problem is that you started looking at the lee daniels in the tyler perry's and you know maybe the ava duvernay DS and the people that are in that world of black cinema that could get them back in into whatever this crossover mainstream world is right so it's about earning that trust again but I think there's no and I'm just saying from personal experience you know there's no group of people more forgiving then I think Black Entertainment I don't think they're ever gonna forgive him for call himself the gay to part I don't think gay people and that's for gay people to decide I'd like to fuck fans but definitely what the fuck what the fuck did you just say yeah he's gone but then you sit down on somebody's couch ego yeah that was the old me and the new me now and then you come out with your wife you do some selfies on Instagram kissing yeah but he's not gonna have a wife boyfriend husband okay fine whatever it is come out and be happy and normal in some level of patrician mm-hmm but would have to he'd have to like explain the whole thought process for putting on the hoax why kept a noose on his neck I was talking to cops while holding the subways yes you got to get drug through the mud yeah come on out get this dragon and then get back to work and nobody's gonna care five ten years or not nobody's going to see a good actor I thought he was fine on Empire and I wasn't my cup of tea after a couple of seasons but I mean is fine show was entertaining well acted I I never know I could looking at like some self-produced Netflix movie where I go how the fuck did this get on online he's still saying that he didn't do anything right he's still saying that he actually got mugged with it I that's one of those stories where after he got clear at the first time I quit clicking the links and then the city of Chicago started suing when the city of Chicago decided to sue him for the cost of the investigation I'm done yeah there's a certain shit I don't click on any more injustice male stories I just is he in a new movie that's the only thing I need to know yeah I get it I think I think I honestly feel like there's a way back Marv Albert was right people on the back wearing a dress so there's a way back in entertainment there's always a way I think there's a way back for what's his face from the the fucking what's his name the the Matt Lauer so way back for that guy I don't know about justice Malay was lying on to Nigerians on the curb that's just hidden that's the narrative but apparently all those executives had that button they all had that button the lock did they use it they grabbed ass dude they got your top bring that yes they did I bet they did I bet a lot of them are sweating out right now they walk somebody in the room is there a way back from Matt Lauer I don't know if it is just a long road know what the problem Matt Lauer's I was talking about this last night no difference male he knows he owned any of it here's the problem he doesn't do anything he doesn't do anything that a regular person can't do he just talks to people he doesn't do anything he doesn't sing he doesn't tell jokes he can't paint so he's replaced now making motorcycles yeah what do you do so that's so awesome yeah do anything that everybody can't do everything he does anyone can do he's talking to people that's all he does is say hi I'm Matt Lauer with Good Morning America or whatever the fuck the show was today today the Today Show hello how are you just talking and he's talking is the land and non-spicy as possible but in the in the so you think he's because they replaced him was it was Carson Daly was that kind of who they used for a while on today I know I'm asking I know you don't watch this shit in the morning show that was on forever yeah let's go like 1 o'clock in the morning that no one watched but it stayed on yeah they just said a morning show for a long time too yeah does like special he's been in a mix oh no yeah that's called making that up no no they just matter of fact they just turn last call over to a new house they gave it to uh Lilly Singh mmm so there's I don't know I don't know what because here's the thing for there to be a path back there has to be what is what does redemption and ownership of whatever you've been accused of look like right because if you're and this goes back to the whole redemption conversation is it about your truth or is it about the truth of your accusers or is it about what society perceives you as bright or the combination of those correct because if you don't believe if you don't agree with what your accusers said to you then you're already fucked because that's part of the redemption is respecting their truth even if it's not true to you and it's not what you believe happened and what went down when you hit the church like you did to the teacher correct similar correct it's just hey I'm sorry right not grant I don't know if Matt Lauer will be saying that sincerely I was sincere like what can I do to show attrition to move back because now even if you've had that with the with your accusers society at large still gets to decide because the same ways society decides who wears the crown I get to decide who take the crown from sure and any shit you can do about that right I mean that's in a fucked up way that's the game I'll be saved up enough money he saved over money he made he was making ungodly something fucking go spin your money just relax go spend your money that's ego but that's ego in feeling like I deserve to be so you get used to that gig of being that guy who's on TV hello good morning everyone welcome to The Today Show today we have Tom Cruise I'll never forget him and Tom Cruise arguing over whether or not Brooke Shields should take antidepressants that's a real that's a real clip so crazy yeah yeah they're arguing over it it's so strange him and Matt Lauer and Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise is telling Matt Lauer he's being glib you're being glib Matt you're being glib because Matt Matt you know Tom Cruise is like he's a Scientologist yeah and they don't they don't believe in pharmaceutical drugs they don't believe in antidepressants or psychiatry there it is right there there's a two of them mark and Matt Lauer's got that I'm thinking because I'm holding a pen and pieces of paper war of the worlds' that's early acht yeah it was a big deal was a big deal it fucked Tom Cruise's career up for a long time there's people like this guys are fucking nut what are they talking about somebody else's business he had talked about it publicly he had talked about the mistake that she's making by taking antidepressants okay so yeah that's that's and that's all in the game well psychiatry psychiatry is the enemy of Scientology they have all these their big signs that psychiatry kills and it's like someone with like an electric fucking shock thing in their head it's like in Hollywood like they're they're on this crusade against against psychiatry it's like a big part of what Scientology is the thing that makes me laugh is that I don't see a lot of southern Scientologists I don't see a lot of Scientology Florida the big things in Clearwater audio that's the number one headquarters in Clearwater that's my sister lives down there she lives real close to where the number of the headquarters is it's fucking weird down there man everybody just they're all walking like they got a secret do you do you think in this society do you think Scientology will be the last religion created like when you really think about how recent Scientology is it's like the 1940s or 50s somewhere like it's roughly the same age just like United Airlines like it's not an old religion we have videos of the guy who made it yeah yeah will that be the last religion that it's like created no because every other religion it's like old school you know centuries and millenniums old but no there'll be new ones the interesting thing is they're probably the last ones to get task tax exempt status because their status is being questioned right now there's people that are very angry about it but they did it because they they all started lawsuits against the IRS and they start thousands of lawsuits the idea was that they were going to sue the IRS and to sizing them as a legitimate religion and the way to do that was just overwhelm them with litigation and that's what they did right that's what they did they then they achieved tax-exempt status a long time ago they're they're very it's a very strange and if you ever read going clear I saw the yeah yeah it's the doc is great the book is even crazier cuz Lawrence Wright goes into depth with all these different people that look like as they were realizing that it was horseshit like as they were getting like the the ninth level of doom papers open up in its handwritten nonsense by a retard like that that guy who wrote it was a he was self he was like self diagnosing all of his his own personal ailments and dealing with them himself and then trying to like pass that off as like a way to live amongst all these people that were paying attention to him but all of it started for him from himself diagnosing is it is it natural for Scientologists and I'm only only know what I know from that doc and Leah Remini in lifetime she is it natural to not be like the way a Christian is just openly Christian just hey how you doing the Lord loves you I'm here to tell you about Jesus I don't really feel like you get that from science I like normally like watching that doc I didn't know the dude from Chicago PD used to be like the gritty yeah detective guy yeah so damn I know he used to be a Scientologist like you never find out that somebody was Internet shit until after they're out of it now I think people keep it tucked it's not like Mormons where they're riding the bikes and you know what the fuck the deal is right yeah now they keep it tucked in but I think back in the day they used to talk about it as openly as pop they've proselytized they try to get you to join but how like just interesting to come just try try to get people to come to these events try to get people to come to these free workshops all these different things on anxiety different things on the mind Dianetics that's what he just decided to write about Dianetics and there's like the science of cleaning your mind and avoiding all external influences that are negative and that are ruin your your perspective and you should be commercials for that and eighties in 97 I bought it I bought a Dynex book I got our list with the volcano exploding than the commercial everybody bought everything man I bought Tony Robbins shit about all kind bought book of five rings I've got fucking art of war I bought everything I was just trying to figure out like what's the bet I was into psychology when I was young because fighting all the time and I was always scared so I was trying to figure out this gotta be a way to like overcome these mental hurdles like does that was like for martial arts competition the big thing was the fear it wasn't your physical ability wasn't as much of a hurdle as the fear you know if the fear of competition was terrible so I was like it's good but sometimes I feel confident and it'd be great and other times it'd be fucking terrified and like what gotta figure out how to be consistent so I started getting into all that kind of stuff and then when I came to LA it's like in 94 I saw a Dianetics commercial said fuck it I'll order that so I got behind the way the questions you seek the answers to here it is Kenward said during an operation harm you later page 182 is it possible to increase intelligence page 122 I was like oh my god was a good ad yeah look at that Ton Ton Ton Dianetics Brad like a fucking volcano takeover yeah I was like thinking that I was going to be able to figure out all my mental problems through this book and then I got on the list and like every week I got some new workshop to go to or this I just so they're just mailers mail just mail this is the 90s that's all they did was just mail you shit and but oh my god I got someone to this it wasn't until I moved and one of the reasons why when I moved I didn't forward my mail I contacted because of Dianetics I'd get so much shit from them that much it was so much shit it was like letter after letter more than like the grocery store also it started freaking me out that they knew where I was like it bothered me it bothered me like it bothered me when I was on a list I was on a list of someone who bought the book but didn't go to any classes and they knew where I was like maybe I could get him maybe they were just not kind of store hey do you want to clean up your brain hey come on we've got the solution don't you want to be a volcano that's scary bro yeah that's scary there are a lot of people get sucked into that man I met quite a few people that were Scientologists I was into some of it mmm I call it that you can do it motivational stuff I remember in high school a Junior ROTC commander who used to used to make us watch this guy I think his name was Bob mo lot mo w ad Bob Mowatt if I'm not mistaken here's a Vietnam vet and he likes survived like a terrible white phosphorus grenade accidents and lately got fucked up real bad in Vietnam but was now doing motivational speaking and once a month we would watch videos of this dude and like it just starts in a way like if you get into Warren you can kind of start getting in line with the next in the next and I think before you know it that's when you're it's a Dianetics land before you've realized like you can find someone that's meaningful with a meaningful message and then as you progress more and more it's alright I agree with less and less of each author that I'm starting to fuck with and so it ended up bottom a lot and then like you think Dave Ramsey started for financial shit yeah yeah well when I was 21 and I was first starting do comedy that's when I was really devouring as much of it as possible because I was trying to figure out how to not be so lazy how to be motivated how to get shit done and how to how to like find the correct path and think about things correctly and so I that's what I'm really like the mind exercise mm-hmm yeah I would follow all this personal power like you had workshop so you would do like a little lik notebooks and shit and fill out and things to talk about and things to concentrate on like if you did do it it would help you but really what it's all about it's just getting your shit together and moving just go do something like what you did by taking a job when you would show up at a gig and you'd be working there Tuesday through Sunday and then take a day job and work nine to five that is more hustle and more hustle mindset than anything you're ever gonna get out of an Anthony Robbins book like that is like just doing it just doing it makes you do more like do more hardship makes you do more hard shit yeah understand that you want it bad so you're willing to put into work and do things you don't want to do it's what makes you have that confidence that you know how to push through and the the mentality that I'm the type of do to get shit done like I'm gonna not gonna waste my day just sitting around a fucking hotel room no I'm gonna go to work I'm gonna work all day I'm gonna drive five hours and keep that radio gig and then drive fires and spend ten hours of the fucking 24 in a day in a goddamn car for dis gigs Ford Focus just to do gigs keep that radio kick those things are every like I had a guy on yesterday that's got Dan Crenshaw he's a congressman was also a Navy SEAL we're talking about mentality I'm like when you went through buds is it did they teach you how to think or do they show you by example they don't teach you how to think they just show you they hardened you through all that work and through all that work through that insane hell week all the shit that you have to do when you're going through buds training the six months of breaking you down and building you back up they teach you you could do anything just by by making you do anything so you will understand how you can pass your limits what you thought your limits were are no longer your limits that's what I feel like is missing from a lot of people that are getting into motivational this motivational that they ain't doing shit you got to go do something that's the number one thing right is fuck action take action do you believe that people that aren't as successful as you think they should be or qualified to be motivational speakers no no no that yeah most people who are doing motivational speaking should stop they should stop you're just robbing people you're not even motivated yourself like I want to say I want to wake you up at 3 o'clock in the morning go come on man we're going running like let me see let me see what you do when you're tired let me see how you push yourself come on man get up get up again tomorrow get up again tomorrow get up again tomorrow the next day get up get up get up get up keep going how long can you maintain a positive attitude where's all his teaching you're teaching people you can't do shit yourself they need to show people that you could do it the best motivational speakers to me are guys like David Goggins because that that guy that that's in that fucking that coin right there that guy does it every day and he's got videos he just did a 100-mile race the other day put up the results on Instagram you can see him showing up 22 hours after the race starts he finishes 100 miles like those type of people those are motive if you ever you ever seen Goggins is a Instagram page but this is insane oh he's a fucking animal motherfucker got abs on a point he's an animal he chisel in he's got the world record chin ups in in 24 hours he did some preposterous number of chin-ups what's that I believe he was beat recently somebody beat him I think I want to have a natural ami yeah yeah but it's those type of people those are real motivational speakers because they're actually doing something there's a lot of people that are teaching your motivation they don't have a business they don't they're not their business is motivation like it's a weird business it's like yeah it's like teaching someone how to drive a racecar you never drove one but see that's way and that goes back to the whole for me the whole New York versus LA thing in comics you just be around at the comics that are just doing like when you see Dave Attell like you'll see David sale in February you'll see him do 20 minutes right and then you'll see him in March you'll see him do a totally different 20 and then you'll see him three months later and he's taking two pieces of the five minutes from those first 20 and put it with a new killer fucking 30 and I go what happened to this one oh yeah that stuff wasn't tight enough and and is it but this joke this is it and when he breaks down wide that joke that you love doesn't even fucking matter to him because it was to get to this hmm like that you can't teach that you can't explain it but you can show it and then I can go home and go fuck I need to write I need to go back and look at my old shit and figure out a way David tells one of the rare guys that became an alcoholic sobered up and got better right like usually the guys who were drunk are fucking hilarious and then they stop drinking and they get boring yeah he got the opposite he became a way better comic tighter and just punchlines and people say that about Eminem they say that once he sobered up and what clean he's better know that he was worse yeah this what usually happens so it happens everybody happened to Kinnison happen at Bill Hicks it happened everybody I never had I'm not not necessarily Hicks I never had alcohol a loaf alcohol like I'll drink here and there but I used to get pissed in my 20s when I would go on stage drunk or tipsy or whatever the fuck and then after the show people would give the liquor credit for me being funny and it used to defend me so that's why I stopped drinking Wow like fuck gave credit to the liquor yes so funny when you join this was funny you should drink more or you know I had these rode rooms they'll sing you shots right cuz you're on stage wit Jack and they've associated that as part of the so also you lose control the audience at least I do what I love there drinking cuz this Center shot someone else is a shot and now oh it's a fucking big it's a it's a pep rally it's terrible performance yeah when people are sending you shots that's a disaster that's a disaster because didn't everybody wants to sign you sure yep then what am i doing in my performance that made someone think it was cool to do that and that that would make this experience better for everybody you're doing a Bert Kreischer you turn it into a party take your shirt off I must I'm in Howard I know shut the fuck up so I can get this chiseled shit out of my mouth so so it totally changed how I you know and also alcohol makes me sleepy and then it was too much driving oh geez and stuff so I can't be drowsy ate at home so no no this is never my thing yeah it's a tricky one because like one drink of loosen you up two drinks ah now again a little silly three drinks now you're kind of drunk you know and you could still do it but is it as good as one drink no it's not but once you get one drink and you get happy you want another drink fuck I'll have another one and then next thing you know it you're a little drunk and you're on stage like I'm at that age now I can't remember what comic did a joke like this but maybe a couple of them but wait we're before you drink you have to look at your schedule for the next day and a half right to make sure you have the bounce back and recovery and all that shit yeah it's not just can I go out Friday what am i doing Saturday and Sunday well you're a goal-oriented guy it seems like for goal-oriented people the the alcohol is one of the biggest impediments you know the craziest thing the only thing I've never been able to make proper time for my career is exercise really yeah why not I'm not good about exercise very trainer you got money because it said that still I don't have time there's the time and so in my brain it's well I'm well when I was still living in LA I had a training I got to New York and then it's must do this must write must watch the video if I exercise I will be too tired and then productivity will go down and when I know deep down when I exercise I'm more creative the brain juices and shit work more but it's the only thing that I've never been able to like properly regiment in my life well this is how you fix that force yourself like we're in August okay we have what six more days seven more days in August something like that what is today ten more days say the 21st so we have ten more days of August do you just say at the end of this fucking month I am going to have a trainer and I'm gonna work out three days a week with that draenor period this is how we're gonna do it write it down and then just get it done and force yourself for one month for one month for the month of September for that month you have to work out three days a week and you write it down and then publicly state it so that you can't back out of it put it on Twitter or put it on Instagram take one of those shirtless pictures of my gut just profile me but if you do that you'll force yourself to do it a next thing you know you've done it you know like I have this dog that loves running and so I make sure that if I don't take him running he's he's always a pain in the ass he's dropping the ball on the table trying to get you to play like he's a very energetic dog so like that motherfucker makes me run five days a week five days a week I get up I'm like come on brow let's go let's go he goes crazy starts running around in circles he and then and then we go hit the trails is this the dog that you saw what was it was it a snake of some shit you ran over while you were jogging one day like a dog yeah that was a different dog yeah that was crazy man I jumped over this log and as open over this long like that's how rattlesnake it was fat dude like my forearm I was like fuck one of the biggest snakes I've ever seen in terms of rattlesnakes it was big like six feet long big that is a big fucking snake and it was just laying flat out on the road like a stick just warmin yeah and the dogs went right over it they didn't even notice it because it was just completely flattened out I was literally in the air over it before I'm like oh my god that was a different one man I've killed a bunch of rattlesnakes men always seeing those fuckers there was one in my neighborhood real recently where there's a video of a bobcat and a rattlesnake duking it out in the middle of the street a fucking model from my house I'm at it's crazy freaking coyotes out here man there's a lot of weird wildlife out here you know California's got weird wildlife just a lot of shit out there a lot of Bobcats and mountain lions what do we have down stuff we just had squirrels so it's only little zit it's only real passes to cobras and yeah that's it yes coyotes now coyotes are everywhere they have coyotes in every fucking state really States probably eating them a fucking coyote saying oh yeah for sure people eat coyotes there's someone eating a coyote right now right now will someone listen to now jerky not bad I guarantee you one of your listeners knows a person and makes a coyote jerky probably yeah I'd try that shit my friend Steve Rinella who's gonna be here tomorrow he cooked and ate a coyote on TV they wanted to see what it tasted like oh this fuckers on a trail near San Diego a week ago the size check for crack god yeah it's all curled up and ready to go to we're too sprawled out as a society yeah well these motherfuckers are everywhere - and we need them by the way because that's why there's not as many rats and rabbits and shit it's a whole beautiful ecosystem out there have you heard the number of rats they've found out her in LA recently I just saw a story about last night it's disgustingly secure all to come these 12 million over 12 million they're all the comments and if they helped well there's about 1.5 percent on that I have this disgusting diseases and instead if it hits over 2% it starts spreading into people oh oh good times bubonic plague we got to move to the mountains yeah move something's broke genetic code too simple they can like and reproduce yeah sisters a mom that sisters and fathers and yeah probably no problem they have no bro there's no mutation is that true they don't they don't have like a sweating problem no that's what I can really dream us gestation can be pregnant again right three months get me pregnant again did you ever see that documentary on Netflix they're rats documentary no whoo ready for that one that's right that down and just that one's gonna freak you out because it details they catch some of them and they just run some tests on them and this is in suburban Atlanta and they find all kinds of crazy fucking diseases and they have Manhattan they show all these rats scrambling over garbage and into the sewer system and they show how smart they are how they'll send the young rats to test out poison and then the young rats will eat the poison and die and then the old rats like okay we get it and they're smart adapt if there yeah man they're clever I mean there are the most prevalent mammal in any city you know if you look at any like shared numbers just we're gonna dots a hustler right there there's more in New York City than there are human beings I think there's more biomass of rats then there is biomass of human beings so I mean it's the wait yeah just the wait yeah it's just the weight of all that's true sure boiling I might have made that up but the the biomass of mean just the sheer numbers it's there's not another animal you can think of that's like that what's the Linux estimate of anywhere between 8.4 million and 2014 all the way up to thirty three point six million rats and New York City Jesus that's more than there are people for sure yeah what 18 million god rats matter it's amazing that they're vectors of diseases they've always been what has been carrying disease what's the number of rat what's the rat infestation looking like in countries where they eat rats interests this is disease fucking not a lot of countries eat rats you know it's the weirdest shit you ever seen those temples in India where they feed the rats and the rats are everywhere dude that'll give you the heebie-jeebies these people are drinking out of like bowls of milk that the rats drink out of they like scoop it up they they have all these rats were like literally running the register sacred or it's just we respect this is your Griffey the rats they feed them look at this what do you got here Jamie who's this rat temple speed up ahead so you can see what it's like when all the rats and the people are interact there we go they put out food for the rats and the rats you could pick them up I mean the rats have zero fear of people and in fact they're like they get along with people so this is like a temple that you visited in India and fucking rats are everywhere and everybody treats these rats with respect very cool existing yeah so the reason why rats are scared of people they've recognized that people want to kill them because they carry diseases but in India they just got a totally different vibe going on so look like those pigeons are hanging around those rounds in New York City rats hunt pigeons here receive at skill a business in it and drag him away like whoa have you seen the video of the pelican that ate a pigeon swallow whole I saw a pelican eat a duck just pelicans are low-key assholes assholes dinosaurs look at these fucking rats man they're every but that's what we're headed rats repelled that's what we had it with fucking rats in New York you think so she's got to be normal I mean people are gonna try and stop them out and poison and trap and all of that but at some point you just gotta go I mean well if it they're maintaining right now all right you can still go to a restaurant you still go to the movies still go shopping it's all normal and there's millions of rats running underneath your feet under the ground what's what's the plan what's de Blasio's plan fucking plan what kind of plans you to use corrupt cops because of all the problems with the streets take care of all the crime take it there no rat problems like all these studies and EPA motherfuckers that mr. Johnny do they have how much money is de Blasio have like how much money they have to spend on things like rats they really don't have any budget it probably doesn't present as much of an ominous threat yes crime or bridges and you know tunnel shit yes and all you know infrastructure probably it would have to be a pandemic disease which can happen it's there we have medieval diseases showing up here now that well articulate ration shit in Hollywood or in downtown LA with all the homeless people it's fucking crazy because people are literally just shitting on the street just shitting everywhere the the homeless situation in downtown LA scares me more in the rat situation what's the numbers oh do you need a sundress mm have you ever drawn driven through Skid Row yeah bananas right yeah because it's close to fashion real just are you into fashion no but I was over there one day for sure there's thousands and thousands of people just living on the street thousands thousands like a like a whole gigantic theater sells out and all the people pile out onto the street but that's where they live that's what it's like it's like like people going to the Verizon Center like 7,000 people you find in a few streets and they think the solution is some sort of hospitals or something that they can start trying to do good luck these people have accumulated they've like they've become accustomed they've that's their lifestyle like that's not what they want for sure but they're accustomed to being homeless like they've acclimated to that world and they've lived in it many of them for years and years and years and they go to places and shelters where they get food they sleep out on the street they have a whole community of people that are out in the street they're all doing drugs and most of them are psychiatric patients half of vets though a lot of them that's the thing that really fucks me up with the homeless population in this country is it half of vets and then on some mental illness ship maybe some of them their family just can't give them the care they need but if they got the care they need maybe they could be a little more level enough to at least be under a roof with the loved one of somebody that can afford to you know yes to take them in no no I think you're absolutely right and in the 1980s they so some of them have problems that are solvable yeah some of them but some of them don't have anybody to help them get through the problem true I mean and then things deteriorate you know they get worse and worse and worse and as you get older you lose hope and then you say this is me this is who I am now yeah there's there's like there's there's like this weird thing with the homeless as well where I feel like as a country like we were quicker to help people in groups like it like in a weird way it still fucks me up in it it's gonna come out wrong but if there's a natural disaster the amount of money we will pour into relief and support for a particular area after the hurricane or the tornado or whatever and that's fine that same type of outpouring happened just once for the homeless coast to coast it would change so much fucking shit yes but if people are fucked up in a group mm-hmm at once right then it doesn't it doesn't resonate like when you see a single homeless person or the news just shows you the row of tents yeah you don't see the person crying but the rubble behind them and they've lost everything it doesn't for whatever reason it doesn't connect the same no you're absolutely right we need likes if if something like Katrina happened or a giant earthquake then we would realize we have to do something but if there was no homeless people and then all sudden something terrible happened and there was 20,000 almost people wandering around downtown we would immediately go oh we got to fix this yeah but it's simple slow sort of effect it's simmered in similar we spend on other countries right how much money we spend on aid how much money we spent and we don't fix inner cities that have been impoverished since the fucking 1800s we don't ever go in there and try to solve problems we don't look I've been saying this forever like if you want a better country the best way is to ensure there's less losers and the best way to ensure there's less losers is give people more opportunities and fix places where you have no chance you mean how many people that grow up in neighborhoods where they have no chance get out it's like it's a tiny tiny fraction of people that want to become unsuccessful and happy most of them are trapped by the environment that they find themselves just by a random roll the dice they wind up and they're in Detroit and they're in the worst neighborhood in Detroit or they're in the southside of Chicago or they're in Baltimore or wherever the fuck it is and then no one does anything to fix it no one does anything to change it but if there was no place like that and all sudden the disaster happened and then there was a place like that then there'd be an outpouring of contributions where people would want to do something to try to fix it yeah I just think that we live in a society where it's just the people in power know that if you help the people that you've been oppressing then you run the risk of facing that wrath once they have power do you think that's what it is to some degree why would I if I have an opportunity to make something better and people are labeling me as the fault for you being in that situation in the first place then I run the risk of losing power because those people are gonna come get me they're gonna vote me out office so it's it's about aligning your views and choices with the people that's gonna keep you on office yeah I guess man I just would think that in today's day and age people would be more forward-thinking and they would think look we got a lot of problems with the environment we got a lot of problems with climate control like we've got we got real issues in this world but we also have problems that have been here forever that no one's done a goddamn thing defense so these new particle the oceans rise and the oceans rise and what are we going to do like what it's not gonna affect all these inner cities these inner cities that have had these same problems forever if you looked at the problems like murder problems in this country like the the places in the inner city was where you have like gang violence and murder and drug trafficking on the same fucking problems over and over and over again year after year no go ahead no there's no no effort what do I gain if I am if I'm a politician and I'm in power what do I gain by helping those people well you get more people that do well and you have a better economy and you have a safer society and people look at you like you're a real leader like Wow mayor would do that what he did sure if they give me the credit or unless you get politically spun the wrong way or some shit yeah but I mean and then I'm out that's the case with every single thing a mayor or a governor us we're just like I don't know I just think we're like politics like that is concerned we are more inclined to vote and do things that serve our own interests first hmm politicians are more inclined to do to enact policies that serve their best interest and we're more inclined to vote for things that serve our best interests so the two things work against each other then for it to work for the system to work you got the vote for things that are for the greater good even if it means sacrificing your own position in the process and that's what I think a lot of politicians don't do but I think in this day and age trying to help impoverished communities who now there's an awareness of how long stuff's been going on and how do you know Michael Wood jr. is Michael Wood jr. yeah he was a cop at Baltimore and he came across this paper from the 1970s it was detailing like rap sheets all the problems and in the area and all the different crimes and he was realizing this is in the 2000s there's like these are all the same places with the same crimes that we're handling now so here we are 30 plus years later the same exact crimes and the same exact places and needs like the feeling of like futility the handling this the fact that no one gives a fuck and that this has been this way forever and nothing's being done done to do anything other than just continue the process of arresting people let arresting people letting them out and then it's just chaos I'll give you a good example of self-interest so in Newark New Jersey right now they are facing water contamination levels that are higher than Flint and there has been cover-ups out - that's where I was born so well I go get your shit checked your parents to let it's in the past I think it's like past 8 years or so they're starting to they're starting to pull it the threads now and figure out Oh what the hell was this what's going on with the water and it's all these people getting fucked up the people who covered it up the people in office who could have made the decisions that you did you're saying to not fucking let fucked up water get into the water table so if a corporation says hey man I'm okay don't worry about that dirty water here's some money and some campaign proxies mean that's what happened I think so I mean you got to unravel the story we got to see how it unfolds but if there is a cover-up a cover-up only happens if someone has more selfish self-serving intentions in mind yeah like the the the poor base of a cover-up is to fuck over somebody who doesn't deserve to get fucked over you know so off that alone the choice you're making isn't for the greater good of the society or the pride or like the way ants like you know what ants do the so dope when it's affluent you ever seen the fire and to make the float yeah that's what that's what we have to be we're not gonna be there because nobody wants to be the ant on the bottom drown might drown and can't get back up to the top in time yeah we don't we don't do that well I think there's also a sense of futility like there's a lack of resources to handle everything so you just just take take what you can handle what you can and keep moving and then just get the fuck out of Newark I mean that's how people look at it people look at those neighborhoods like a place to escape not that it's anything that could be fixed yeah that's what I that's what I struggle with with with Birmingham and in terms of going back home and trying to do things that feed the neighborhood positively because I feel like I never had that growing up like you know there were a cup your boat Jackson's and your Charles Barkley's they come around and you know give a high-five to the kid or two but to be able to do things that create opportunities so that that feeling of hopelessness or whatever isn't always there or if there's one thing that can be bit like Big Sean did something that was doping Detroit put a hundred thousand dollars down on a recording studio and to help underprivileged kids have access to just like an just record just to do something that makes things better so the problem is that in the process of trying to give a fuck it's stressful and there are people that are pushing and working against you and you could easily just go to sleep in your bed comfortably at night and just not care but I try I do as much as I can back home but the idea of getting the fuck out I'm always torn on cuz the same I'm gone I'm if nothing else I can pay my pills to lie down and think my son could go to a decent division to school and be fine but if I'm not using my gift and all these advantages to try and help him better other people somehow then I feel like I filled the city well I feel like I failed where I came from so I'm trying to figure out how because I've never what I've never seen is someone that gave back or attempted to put back into without it costing them something in the process as well right I see what you're saying like you you'd have to make a big sacrifice in order to help and you have to take time that you don't even have time to work out so how the fuck do you have time to go and save Birmingham yeah yeah that is a problem I mean you have bandwidth right you have a certain amount of bandwidth and you're in your brain and how much of it can you dedicate to charitable things how much can you dedicate to your career your family yeah it's the constant process I mean I think it's the job of people who are running cities and states and the country but it's about how much resource how much resources they have how much they delegate to fixing these problems that have existed forever what I've learned man is I learned a shit-ton we shot you Sean Maher Comedy Central pilot in Birmingham this summer which was not an easy feat in terms of the logistics of it just because Birmingham's not a it's not Atlanta it's not a bunch of fucking cameras just laying around but you start seeing how different entities of at the state level on the local level even the county level all have to get a little touch all have to have a hand in it somehow so that everyone feels like they are all part light you have to please to many people at the same time to get anything to get anything remotely done I don't know I can't speak for the rest of the country but I know in Alabama that's generally how it is I think that's generally how it is with all politics I mean everybody wants a little bit of credit everybody wants a little bit of a say and I'm fine with the credit but just doesn't help ya get credit but help like do this logistical thing to hope that like that's the stuff where nobody wants to really or you're not sure if anybody really has genuine intentions on helping mm yeah because not everybody is happy for you that's the saddest shit ever when you think about charitable organizations and you find out how much people are making to run those terrible organizations and Klaus and shit yeah and how little the money actually goes towards the charity you like Jesus like I know there's gonna be some red tape and bureaucracy but it's like red cross isn't it some insane number like how much of money from Red Cross actually goes towards the actual charity itself I'm gonna say 10% that might be generous but that is a crazy number that ninety cost ninety percent of all the money that comes in just to deal with overhead of sticks and moving stuff around and that's why that's why I kind of like though funnies cuz you can just find them I'll fuckin be like here yeah here's $100 yeah when there's real problems what do you got Jamie what's the number let's guess type that in and it's like stories come about the CEO has been serially misleading about where the 91% of money that they says goes I don't know oh so it's less than 10% 9% 91 percent there's 91% goes somewhere other than the charity so it's 9% no no I think they're actually saying 91% go to the justice we're very proud of the fact that 91 cents of every dollar that's donated to our services gasps come on sign it you see that dude the dinero de niro's uh was suing some lady that worked for him that watched fifty five episodes of friends in a week no yeah she embezzled money allegedly embezzled money took used his miles to fly on her own personal trips on she's making 300 grand a year but the the big story the clickbait title was uh he sued her for six million dollars after a wild friend's been she watched 55 out of 55 episodes of it in four days that's two thousand eight so that's DVDs in 2008 that is hilarious so they're still going after it eleven years later five-o she began she was his assistant in 2008 and then and then okay she began as De Niro's assistant and she now is being sued so she basically got to a place where they're working together for 11 years 11 years of employment De Niro Robinson rose to vice-president of production and Finance according to the suit which lists her 2019 salary $300,000 she finally left the company in April after being suspected of corporate sabotage said the legal filing she embezzled money and she you know that's seven hours a day that's 14 episodes a day that's doable it's doable yeah four days i benched 24 in like a day and a half do the whole see yeah a whole season like in a DVD box eight days there's also a good show it's just funny that out of all this shit that this lady did apparently allegedly the fifty five episodes of friends are the ones that became the headline that everybody had a click on cuz that's a funny issue also watch Tony episodes are arrested one day so just sit around watching TV while she's working for what is she supposed to be doing like maybe she was doing research maybe she's waiting around for something to do what did they were project needs friends yeah it's research what's a neo projects are even around I mean well De Niro is probably trying to figure out where all this money's going because he's getting divorced right now so he's probably yeah man he's getting divorced there was a some public spat at a restaurant where he yelled at his wife I wouldn't have to do these shitty fucking movies if you weren't spending all my money yeah oh I see that and I always feel bad for people like the Cubs the second baseman Ben Zobrist he's been like I don't know what the Oh physically unable to perform like he's basically been on the disabled list the entire season while he goes through and deals with his divorce like divorce is some serious shit even to go make millions of dollars playing baseball I can't right now I have to go to court and count my cash and make sure that my shit is so his disabled shit is just dealing with the divorce yeah it's I forget money a real injury no it's not real injury yeah well I guess it technically is that's a girl taking apart his puzzle yeah she's doing she's taking apart the puzzle of his life yes she's forcing him to go through I think it was like infidelity or something yeah I had a buddy of mine who he had to pay for his wife's lawyer and you don't even think about it that way like if you're married you go well who's paying for her lawyer well bitch you're paying for her lawyer if she didn't work you pay for the general of the opposing army to try to dismantle you financially and he didn't have a prenuptial agreement so he went to my boy for fucking years years and years and years and they were trying to drain them and the lawyers are smart man they know that the real settlement is great but what the real money is is in legal fees leading up to the settlement they just drag that shit out for a couple of years hundreds of dollars an hour Chang Chang Chang and next thing you know you've lost millions of dollars and this guy you know busted his ass 12 hours a day for ever lost almost everything still to this day how about this he's been married for I think he's been married for 14 years to a new woman he was with her for 12 years and he has been paying her alimony longer than they were married while he's married to a new woman and didn't even have kids with her so he's been paying her for 14 fucking years I'm talking six figures every year she doesn't do shit she lives in a fat house in the Palisades the whole thing is bananas did you see Larry King it's getting worse yeah I don't know his head this is 8th wife yeah I hope he gets another one I hope it gets another one and there's a skeleton I can't prove it but I feel like the divorce lawyer industry is tied to the wedding industry somehow somehow they don't have to be tied in like legally they know they both benefit from one another of course yeah of course look at that perfect relationship how did it go wrong I just want to know what that well apparently that was infidelity as well allegedly no way I can't believe I let sheet on him all on her side of his side her side apparently she had a year long affair prenup in that one I know she looked fucking hot 20 years ago when they got married because she's like 59 now so when they first starts shacking it up she was in her 30s probably lookin smokin she's pretty married pretty lady you know you think that's an addiction love the same as any other drug sure of course yeah most people lose when you talk about getting married seven times ya know it gets a little wacky he's had marriages that lasted like less than a year they get divorced and marry another one like I would get married I think once if I do it'll be once if you do hang out wanted me one I got one in me I was proposed to a girl I can o 3o so long the biggest mistakes almost almost look at me how do you get out of it it's found out she was cheating whoa that's nice it's a relief yeah it was back in the day when you share cell phone plans and she kept pushing us over our minutes full amount I'm like what the fuck are you talking to so the next month I requested the full itemized call along they like back in the day sprint would send you your entire call log for the month and I just went through it and then I could see the patterns of when I was sleep or when I was on stage you could just see that but it's all in front of you it's easy to just see the law yeah when I go to work at 6:00 a.m. you call this guy man yeah it was really easy to track now did you confront her yeah I was I was a little extra about it call sprint and the the I basically turned my phone into her phone oh shit and then I started texting the dudes how many times to get and so I tell both guys to come over at the same time to now sort of those two got it which is so my god caddy at me and of course they show up she calls me curses me out and boom BAM relationship done oh so you told them to come over while she was at home correct but you weren't there correct oh I like it no that's devious but in like in the bigger scheme of things if roses it came over and hit her Oh or done anything stupid yeah I'm liable and that yeah yeah no for someone at least will charge you were murder for somebody they shot this is there are laws not that that's not that's i deceived two minutes showing up to the fucking house you gotta remember my brain is going don't go back to jail ever again so okay and my brain I'm going there's something that could have that could have gone south somehow I don't think you would have got in trouble for that either way I wouldn't I see what you're saying by some sort of jealous or whatever I don't want that I was like dude yeah and I had my little $700 engagement ring from Zeo this is what I learned that if you return an engagement ring the salesperson loses the commission they tape the Commission back out of their next check cuz it is no brahmin got upset he wasn't upset but he spent like an hour trying to talk me out of return yeah he said man just go think about it man go think about it did you tell him just walk around the mall she's fucking two other dude that's ultimately when I didn't once I told him that he processed it with no fucking I just took that all no push back yeah there's a $7 ring he's cut was probably gonna be like what 70 $80 so what's the cut jewelry in the mall yeah you don't want to fucking lose your fucking commission yeah those are bad decisions being made buying jewelry in a mall it's crazy too it's more like it's like Joey though where like she and I are like cool that she's married like it's all oh wow it's all lovely well that's good look people grow and learn that's hilarious though that he did that yeah that was that wasn't my finest hour but like I said I'm not a fighter I figure out a way to diabolically construct a situation and tears down your entire fuckin operation yeah that was a good move yeah that's a learning process to what I'm gonna do drive and cuss you out and Gugino oh no we don't know about each other yeah it's time for us all to me so hey man come on over to the house hey man you come on over to the house meet me at 11:00 don't come too soon come exactly at 11:00 Wow cause we want to be there no some explosions you just gotta walk away from no man I want to be there for that one no that's where God that song I've never that's something I've never lived down like then it just it was just ugly there's just little things we just go you know what maybe I should have done that mom's calling me the next day you just talk to talk to the baby oh boy no man I can't like it was did it was full-blown bro I'm sending pictures of the fucking ring and oh yeah it was it was not it's not my finest hour but don't you think that like those brutal breakups and all the chaos of infidelity and all that kind of nonsense it's like it gives you a better understanding of relationships when they go well it gives you it's all like life lessons like you don't get to be you don't get to be a seasoned grown-up human being without getting your heart broken a few times without having a bunch of things going disappointing in your work life and then then you become a person with an understanding of all the variabilities that you're dealing with in life I think the problem though you know with love is that it also can be corroding SS where if you've really been invested you've really tried to love and then it didn't work okay like I feel like if you've been in love a couple also feel like people get married sooner there's something more pure about it but people get married later it's more honest hmm you know like it's like this blind love in love we've never been done dirty oh my god the sky is falling versus your grizzled vet you've been cheated on you've cheated so you know both sides of that corn so you know how it feels and like you know both sides to that so we enter into a relationship it's more pure but because you have these battle wounds and these battle scars I don't know if you love the same as the couple they get married in their 20s it still depends on who you're with and how much you appreciate them it also depends on where you're at in your life like if you got married now you're a successful man I mean you did all the Gras finding in the hustling but someone would be entering into your life now where you're already made it you're successful you're established the hustle of getting to theirs now it's just about about maintaining which although difficult you have the confidence that it's going to happen that you don't have in the beginning that early days hustling when you were taking those odd jobs who the fuck knew where your life was going beautiful things about it there was gigs I was headed to where I didn't have gas money to get home and the gig I was going to was the gas money to get home so please don't cancel and please don't pull some some black promoter shit and don't pay me like I literally need those $40 you have no way to get home Wow sometimes you don't get paid if you don't get paid on the way home you stop at a daily work spot and you do some yard work or whatever yeah you go do some daily work real quick for the day you miss it that you miss a shift if the radio station called a radio such a hey man I got car trouble in Kentucky I can't get home I missed a morning show sorry I mean you go do some day job Wow get your $40 in your home that's but that's a real life experience that you just can't pay for that's so valuable the fact that you did do it even though it's horrible when it happened like that resolved that you did you developed from being that person who figures your way through all those problems so I give so if you got married now like you're a different person like you you could you'll figure shit out better now like yeah yeah yeah you also you also learn how to communicate way better so that it doesn't devolve to a point where either you are being malicious to each other yes ma'am ago is way better communication than anything I could have imagined with anyone right in my twenties yeah because of those experiences and learning yeah yeah that's that's the part where you try to fucking correct within there's always a piece of you it's like do you ever find like yes I can't ask you this as a married man but you find yourself sometimes looking at past relationships like jokes where you go oh I know how I could have fixed that oh yeah for sure yeah what the knowledge we have now of relationships and love yes I can look back on stuff that I fucked up and go all I have to do was this this mom and that joke would it hit yep that would damn yeah so that eats like the way like when you do a TV set and you forget one part of the joke and now for the rest of your life that's the set yeah that's who you are there's a piece of you that's going fuck I should have done that thing yeah but that's of growth yeah it's like you have to leave behind these poorly finished projects to appreciate the one that you're gonna put out next that's gonna be the best version of it I look at every fucking special every did going even if they were successful just go I have nothing to do with them I can't watch them fucking get disgusted my first two special should be combined into one I can look at the material all that segues with that yeah cut that out put this in there yeah yeah and then there's old specials that I said ooh I'd like to have another crack at those ideas because they're good ideas I just didn't implement them correctly so why not move on you get trapped you trapped in old ideas it's out there it's done new shit find something new that resonates just as well in the future as this stuff does to you when you're looking at the past no no I feel like I have some unfinished thoughts from the last special of course but that that desire and that hunger is what makes you a great comic like that that's not done oh I got to do more oh this has got to be better next time or that make it tighter or make this better more punchlines less fat all that's what that discomfort and angst is what makes you an artist that's why I like trying to do stuff that has some teeth or some edge or certain opinion to it you're treading and stuff that oh no you should go with it no let's go let's figure it out there's aa there's a joke in there somehow when you can navigate those waters successfully it's like fuck man you get on the other end with a big laughter it's whitewater raft it's and there's just rock coming and you're going left right yeah yeah like this is a guy calling out how to do the joke and just navigating your way down the rocks and if you make it it is the most rewarding dis malice that for me is better than just something more but yeah something more mundane my head just I can't do it yeah yeah when you see people that are doing the same mundane shit over and over and over again you they don't know what it's like to have that thrill there they're basically getting on a fucking seesaw every day the same seesaw over and over there's no thrill in that no you're not for anymore there's there's too many good thoughts out there that's why I love talking with Neal Brennan like Neal Brennan is like one of those perfect comics that I can like go hey man or anything about this and he'll tag it darker hmm and take it to a place that I wouldn't even consider hmm and you know like you start noticing like there's only so even if you have a bunch of comedian friends there's only certain friends that understand how or which way you're trying to go with the bit because someone else might give you a tag that drifts off into easy land and I don't want them right right right ya know Neal's a great joke rider and his his shit like I like his I like watching him work out premises cuz you know you could tell him like he's put some real thought into those ideas yeah it's it's an it's a thesis statement it just happens to be funny like he's really breaking shit down yeah I like the ones where I know that it was an argument that he had with a girl into the stage and try to work it out and make it funny cuz if you have an argument with a girl and then she comes to see you at a comedy club like a month later and that argument gets relayed to the audience and it's fucking hysterical you win that's how you went you win and you fucking slam dunk that is a fucking grand slam that shatters windows in the parking lot I've never had the courage to do it I've never had the courage to perform in front of in front of somebody I was dating never done it no it's hard you gotta take a chance in them being really mad at you and you get offstage but I give you example like will savants is another guy that I like talking to out of New York and the premise the joke premise is that there are no hit video game set in Vietnam like that's how much we don't want to that's true explore views on World War two Bryant and Middle East is just yes we only want to discuss the it's where we want there have been games envy of course there's some video games in viña but as far as hit popular twitch level ninja shit right none in Vietnam and then we'll submit I told Wilson Vincent premise and he goes that and he says that's because if you're playing a game based in Vietnam you can't win even if you want to even when you win you still lose and it's taking that thought and figuring out how to weave that but like that's what I mean where a friend can help me work through an idea but then somewhere come the trick is to come around the back side of that and make sure that you're reinforcing and uplifting the people they chose to fight and yeah I'm trying to it's a whole world that I'm just obsessed with I don't know what it all boils back to the whole Trump draft-dodger thing in the hypocrisy that if we agree that the troops are fucked and they're treated horribly then how is draft-dodging bad and that being the the thought especially for vietnam war we all agree was a terrible war we didn't know it at the time and some people chose to go but a lot of people were threatened with jail that they didn't go so if you did not go based on revisionist history was that not a solid decision in terms of avoiding and so it's about getting that thought through without disrespecting the heroism right of what happened so this fallen tree whitewater rafting on rocks so i haven't figured those are the those are the basic Lego blocks and i have to figure out how to get down the river without fucking hitting a jagged do you write in like essay form do you write things out like with a computer do you do write yeah once I have the ideas together I just go loose on stage I'll go I'll just run a bit a couple times on stage without any structure without any real structure just bullet points here the four points right I make ya do that for we listen to the audio the stuff that's hot transcribe and there from that transcription start filling in the blanks of how to flesh out the thought and the point a little bit more like like but then some stuff requires research there's a bit that there's a bit that I'm working on now about how how the most important person the most important character in the civil rights movie is the white person is the evil white actor you cannot have a powerful civil rights movie without a white person being evil so these actors are never honor they're never nominated for shit like of civil rights movies only as powerful as the white actor is evil because that captures what was fucking happening back in that day right so I need to like sit and physically go to Box Office Mojo and look at the last 10 years of civil rights movies versus civil rights movies vs. white Savior movies and pull actors and pull examples and then look at that and then go to their IMDB and look at their trajectory post-civil rights movie to establish a pattern of if you're a white person you do evil you're risk because my arguments that you're risking your career if you're not an a-list actor and you play in a racist you may not do shit else at there because for black people if you say maybe it's too real so we can't see you as a fucking Romulan in a Star Trek movie years later when we're unable to process so so that joke I have that idea and I'll just work that out a couple of times but now before I put it on stage again I need movies I need examples to back up the thesis statement so that's what I'll start writing and really start looking at all of these examples and I also have like it's in the same ballpark of that is about how like people call like green but like a white Savior movie and how this movie is about white people doing a dick deed for black people back in the day and black people don't like play save your movies because you know it avoids the pain and the struggle and all that shit and I feel like white savoury movies are just reactionary to powerful civil rights movies because nobody wants to be portrayed negatively so if there are enough civil rights movies that play white people is evil it's inevitable that a white person is going to write a movie about remember the time we drove you around and played a piano like that's it's inevitable yeah we fed you chicken and drove so don't just say all that don't just show those evil things we did let's also acknowledge the time we drove you around and I think if I go back and I look through the history of the box-office over the last 20 years I guarantee you I'll be able to find out oscillation between powerful silver lights movie and white save your movie and when you write that you're just gonna write bullet points and then just run it on No now we'll we'll do bullet points of all the movies and then so the next stage is I'll do I'll write all those movies out and I'll go on stage and do half of those movies one set the next set I'll do the other half of movies and see which ones resonate the quickest with the audience cuz they're not all gonna be timeless classics right some of them gonna be deep in the woods but like Mississippi Burning or like like Malcolm X and Driving Miss Daisy yes those are two perfect examples of conflicting films in the same year so I need iconic examples like that where everybody knows the correct what I haven't even seen it yes so that's trial and error so that just has to go on stage a couple times and then once I know what the movies are then we write it then you verbatim that shit yeah really fucking get it worked that's black boat level comedy that's black belt level it's like you have to you have to have like this is not something that's obvious in front of you you have like a scaffolding and you're trying to construct this and figure out a way to squeeze the most juice out of it that's that's that whitewater rafting that's it's so it's so rewarding when that gets pulled off I just feel like if you look at every genre it is and it's not to defend a white Savior movie as much as it is to just show water fuck it happened yeah this is why like black people in the 90s like boys another in the 90s that was the era of shoot-'em-up bang bang hood Essex and some around 95-96 black cinema became much more positive and reinforcing and it was waiting to exhale and poetic justice and above the not above the realm what's the other one love Jones and love and basketball like there were all these more positive like Center that was in direct reaction to not wanting to be perceived and portrayed constantly in a negative light so I could probably go deep into the fucking weeds race by race on cinema like I could do all the Asian movies and in with crazy rich Asians as the counter to that but it's not necessarily Asian save like there's no way I don't know how to connect that but I believe there's a way with all of these cinematic movies to connect it all together and at that point you've probably got a 25-minute bit that you know needs to be chopped down to ten to ten yeah but that's how you build all it you build the whole house and then you just start chopping off and when you do that are you writing it out do you do you ever write things out while asking an essay form because one of the things that I found that has a great benefit as I write things out not trying to be funny instead of just writing it out in a way where I'm trying to be funny I just write it out like I'm writing an essay like I'm writing an article for a magazine and then in doing that I'll extract chunks that are funny because I find that when I'm trying to write as a comic I'm trying to write setup' punchline it's to defining it's too limiting but when I write in an open form then funny ideas are in there and I just come out and pull them do you think do you think part of that is having the advantage of the audience being with you the media like when you have your audience you're afforded that opportunity it's because it's weird because the way we build material now I don't think that's how you did it when you first start it was in or about just the joke the joke the joke yeah you had to be you got to gain their confidence right that was the thing is like you had a start strong you gotta have a good opening bit you couldn't fuck around two months they had to have confidence in you like this is gonna waste my fucking time you know they just seen if you're on a show when you're in a when you're in amateur i mean it's fucking ten other people before you you have to grab them you gotta grab them you gotta grab them and show them that you have something yeah but then once you become an established comedian the other problem is you're working with a bunch of other established comedians like say if I'm working with you and then there's Joey Diaz and you know all these other fucking people that are going on that are murdering and then you go up with some bullshit new stuff like that stuff has to be ready like having an established audience is great for a couple minutes and then you better have some shit yeah you know it's almost like they have there's more expectations so things have to be more tight but some people don't do that some people don't do clubs anymore where they're working with a bunch of people they don't do like the store or The Improv or they work with a bunch of people instead they do their own shows they do their own shows only they have the same opening act all the time and then people there to see them and it's a low bar they don't have to worry about it as much I think that's that's a mistake but I think the si form I started figuring that out maybe 10 years ago I started writing things in essay form I originally stood its blog posts I would write blog posts and I take those blog posts and I was extract ideas from them and then make it into comedy but I feel like the writing without the limitations of it needing to be funny is where I get the most ideas yeah and then you also have the most truth in there as well yes because I'm not just trying to bullshit people for a laugh I'm trying to find out like what is it if that premise of the white Savior movie like what is it about white people making these moves like what are they trying to are they trying to defend something are they trying to exonerate themselves like what are they trying to do when they make that movie is it just a feel-good is it their distorted idea of how to bring everybody together is to show that some white people are really good back then yeah even the bad times look yeah hey good job Michael you know good job wool like everybody did a great job in this movie like what what is it that it's the the motivation you could find you know you find those those gems of humor those roots of humor in that yeah that's what I'm that's what I'll I'll try that I'll try writing writing it out more before putting it on I just like writing that way because I don't have to do anything oh there's no expectation like it's just just thoughts just spill the thoughts out and then you get absorbed in the writing and then in that absorption you mean you're a funny guy you're always gonna think funny thoughts those funny thoughts are gonna come out when you're talking about something like what the fuck was this guy thinking and then you go on this whole rant about this thing that maybe if you didn't give yourself the opportunity to sit in front of a computer and just stare at the screen and stare at those keyboard you probably wouldn't have come up with that premise also once I have the joke in a decent shape even if it's kind of loose I start watching myself on mute performed like I go from audio to wants to joke a structure to video and then just watching myself from mute and just seeing body language and just seeing does this look funny does this look that's interesting never feel for and I think you just had once once identify where my comedic trance where it's quick spastic movements but not a lot of stage talking walking the stage doesn't work for me I'm not Chris Rock so operate in like a three-foot box to either side of center stage and if it's quick in head but nobody if I if I take my head one way then bring my shoulders instead of bringing my head and shoulders at the same time on a turn is if I'm caught while I'm contemplating a point hmm something as simple as that for me helps jokes and then I can go back and listen to the audio go back and watch the video and see where I'm getting laughs just off movement and I haven't said a word yet and for me it's quick movements and facial expressions those are the extra little a card at the extra season and that's the shin then you know once you kind of get the joke in a good place where can we add a little seasoning is it a vocal inflection is it coming down on this part is it looking this way then looking in that way for the like almost borderline performative like on some acting shit but just looking and finding places where the emotions can change and not necessarily on this line I do this thing mmm but it's just oh this part is funnier if I'm not as excited here though it Foxworthy says if I was watching bring the funny and he told one of the contestants if you started a team let's bring the funny it's won the competition comedy show new show it's its Last Comic Standing but with sketch comics sketched in there as well so it's not it's not strictly stand-up its sketch and variety acts and all of that type of shit but the same shit you go out in front of three judges somebody crushes your dreams and then you talk shit about it behind the backs kicked off the show but he told somebody when she started at ten you have nowhere else to go so I try to keep that in mind in terms of just not being too big to so it's really just shifting gears it's it's a fascinating process and we discussed this on the show many times before that there's no books that can tell you how to do it the only way you get liked one of the things that's really cool about this conversation is young guys coming up young girls coming up and want to learn how to do calm and you can listen to your process and they'll get an idea of the map ahead they'll get an idea of the road because there's really there's no courses you can take that are ever gonna prepare you you have to find established comedians and listen to them talk about how they do it and in a sense what we're doing is we're laying down like sort of a course for for the up-and-coming class for the people that are starting out now that don't really have anyone to show them how to do it they can cut a lot of time out by listened in to a guy like you who's explaining the mistakes that he made and then the good choices that you made and then your process I tried one of the tricks that I had early on was to just avoid topics that anybody else was talking about and then even if the joke wasn't the funniest I got credit for being original hmm no no if this will work for every comic but I know coming up early 2000s in the back half of the Def Jam era to be a black comic there wasn't um about fucking and sucking and weed and you ever been so broke like I just I didn't touch none of that shit yeah so to a mainstream Booker it was just oh wow he did a joke about suicide okay well right yeah well Kim well there's such a septuplet joke so like it was just weird off-brand shit but still finding funny in that there's such a temptation to pick on tried-and-true tried and proven subjects because you know their work you know it's scared in the beginning right yeah you start you feel like you start as a weird image like my early my first years of comedy was this weird Martin Lawrence Doug Stanhope hybrid child I don't know it was terrible it's very terrible but I started noticing that when blade the first thing I needed to do was the first objective when I got all was to alright all the road Booker's said you got to get a TV credit you got to get a TV credit and then I can pay you more all right well the only thing that was booking people on a regular was comic view so BET's comicview became the path but then I didn't get comic view like two three years in a row and I looked at the material I submitted versus the materials being performed it was guys doing better versions of the same topics isn't me hmm so alright this year we're gonna try doing different topics from everybody so I watched comic view for a whole year kept a log of every topic that was touched on for every episode and just never did jumps about those topics Wow so you actually wrote it out yeah every week um if you came on every night though yeah I remember back in in like 2000 2001 comic you came on Monday through Friday and it was six comics in episode so every week you had a cross-section of what 40 motherfuckers were talking about Wow for 12 weeks there's a shit ton of comedy it's a shit ton of topics and you'd be surprised was a lot of repetition and overlap so by simply not talking about that shit it's enough to get you a little bit it's no different what's happening now with the alt scene you're just a different delivery you're different cadence you have a different look being different is almost as important as being funny now yes I don't think that one I don't think that being different should be prioritized over being funny but if you're different and you're fucking hilarious than you yeah people appreciate it for sure just like any other genre of art music or cinema anything being different is rewarded that's why I've always liked emo Philips man really yeah just wanted to do and the cadence was never typical right that just I was like alright that's at minimum it's different so he's challenging himself so I tried it so that's like yeah Theo Vaughn's got Theo comedy like you can't imitate that like the only way that shit works is if it comes out of Theo's mouth it doesn't even make sense coming out of someone else Theo gets a laugh on he gets a laugh on the setup and he gets a laugh on the pause yeah and the pause is that anticipatory gig like you already know ah yeah like he's he's good man yeah he's real good and I watched that guy turned a corner man about two three years ago he he just hit his groove you know a full mullet well he had a mullet before but it was he just found that groove like whatever it is it made him he found what it is they found the frequency and they just hit into it and very very very original you'd never hear him talking about like stuff that other people have talked about there's a New York guy like that mark Norman Martin Norman has a way sure a lark love mark Norman pivot he's coming on soon he's great Norman just knows how to pivot and oh yeah you think it's going this way and this is a basketball crossover very good writer very good writer well listen man I gotta wrap this up but this is awesome I really appreciate it I'm glad we finally did it thank you so much it was awesome thank you enjoyed your work for a long time well so glad to have you on here man I'll let you know when the Vietnam joke gets worked out let it know let us know need some more time all right bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
