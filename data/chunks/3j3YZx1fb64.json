join my dango rocky block my night all day the early mornings thing I guess has been successful right the day of the no it's all done its article radically unsuccessful there's been seventeen different people missing wait for you all yellow really hurt it isn't like one or two in the same time to work it whatever what's this why is that done just because they want to get the edge to safety they see it gives people more time to rehydrate themselves but the problem is gives them less time to lose the weight right so if you're starting off early in the morning like if you're if you weigh-ins are at four o'clock and you know you're not going to eat all day you're going to lose weight all throughout the day but if your weigh-ins right eight o'clock in the morning when are you getting up you're going to lose all that way up you might not you might not lose enough weight so right people are missile-related on you later there's definitely a lot and there's definitely an issue with people cutting too much weight there's definitely an issue with people doing it unhealthy shouldn't they be punished or penalized even more though like I just recently heard ray or Gosselaar eighty percent of his well I got and that's why okay that that's fine even Calvin got some when they admit yeah I haven't really been looking after my diet right you're a professional athlete sign to the the biggest organization in the world there shouldn't that be part of the contract that in if you're fighting for us that you have to maintain you almost have those instead of even a random drug test randomly random wait well obviously they made Calvin go up to 185 yes next fight no it's crazy if you look fucking look amazing oh yeah I'm Kennedy literally liked in st. Joe and Tim Kennedy blew his entire water trying to take him down and beat him up in the earlier the first round I mean he he show his size advantage his strength advantage he's a massive like he's a massive power out comes his ground-and-pound Jitsu but Kelvin just stayed the course but we would defense and then eventually when he got on his feet man way to Swift on how many times did he was still three missed a bump okay he missed against Tyron Woodley and tyrant beat him and tyrant as a gentleman decided you have to even take his money over which is very fucking yeah ethical and moral move by the champ now the current champ so you lost that and I mean there was more than one fight in the past yeah for that but you when do you say okay again I shall not go to run them up here because he's a great fighter like you saying very good 185 so let's hope but he misses way to 185 million you should take a year you can't go you don't put the fear in them and then they they're really gonna die think Kelvin should fight at 85 right I mean I think he could win if you win it 70 I think he can make 70 but he doesn't always make sense oh you're right when I described yeah I mean unless you want to lose a ton of body fat and then try fighting in 170 you know really clean is diet up really going over to majority air works Donnie Hendrix has not seem like the same person who when the because of Thompson wrecking them the way a lot of work when I agree because I heard you say as well even the brains like physically did not look physically the same no he doesn't where he works as hard it doesn't look like he is as motivated he doesn't look as hungry his vaunted knockout power is gone gun clear down here yeah I heard it's weird yeah I wanted him and I said a long time ago if I was just coach I would just I his left hand to his body and it put him after every workout you go three or four arms on the back you know just using your right hand can you imagine if he developed the right hand on top of that yeah I mean because it was 90% was left you know you would that you know now he opened a whole new door you know you know it's unfair to question someone whether or not they tested positive for anything if they write good anything if you haven't tested positive so he never tested positive for anything so you can't look at it I don't think he did did he know maybe a diuretic or something maybe maybe find out Johnny Everett a positive or something I think he did so you know there's a lot of people throw in a QDI about him in George st. Pierre Worth same fears well you know what it cost would be like one of the things he said about his last fight he said he worked out for four times a week week he won one time four times a week it's like he just was not focused on that fight if that's the case you got together that's why he looks like that yeah nothing to do what you saw or anything else he just doesn't have the hunger that's it and that that's where you you put yourself a great risk like it but also mentally going into the night if you know that is not a guy train ten times a week and you're trained for yeah what are you gonna do before I just where'd his power went away you know I mean he used to make ice all I crumble Meester when he hit Johnson went to his lying Martin Kampmann flying was flying it's like he had magic in his hands yes and it also it stopped yeah so what the fuck I don't have to be a good thing that yeah when I can already know may Hansen really just ruined him hmm yeah fuck jump yeah and he locked him up and he fucked him up with like using a front leg side kick and then the front leg round kick with the heat of battle one to the body and then Johnny like what like nods his head like you got me and then slap him on right up to the fame yep and that's the thing with wonder boy he mixes oh yeah perfectly and then it's suddenly a hook a question mark and it's every time it's a different kick yeah I don't know what's going to come mr. Bamberger talk shit about him with like all the spinning kicks it's a waste of energy Oh for real okay you think it's a coincidence to the wheel kick Ellenberger in the head why yeah oh here's your waste of time dude right yeah yeah it's not it's not a waste some fucking do super good at this [Music]
