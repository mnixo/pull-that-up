that's cool five four three two one and yeehaw Brendan Schaub what's up dog did you buy those shoes yourself yeah I bought these this one a little too much flare for you it's summer Groff and a confident move I'll get the tight pants around the ankles just riding high enough to see the Gucci shoes Gucci denim bro get it what's up you're making fun of a guy I bet your girls like these yeah girls also like dick though man good point but your point sir it's true it's so true dude how about these fights oh my god how about these fights how about I almost didn't see them can I text you during the broadcast the ESPN Plus thing was a nightmare man yeah they had some hair cups yeah that'd be an understatement yeah that has happened before all right digital stuff 2019 though especially with the ESPN though that's where I was just shocked and me being like a super fan I had to figure it out but you know how I had to figure it out cuz it didn't work on any platform so and it's a hiccup where you cannot order it off the app so you have to close the app order it from a desktop and shut down something then go to your TV it was a nightmare but that didn't work for me and then I was like alright and then I slowly was missing the first fight I'm like now you have to figure stuff out and I tweeted out seven proms and 2,000 savages sent me links to legal streams legal or illegal but of course you didn't watch those illegal stream I didn't Joe and I'm glad you pointed out I did not but if I were going to would it be awesome it was awesome it was HD and had zero problems if I was going to glad you didn't because they could track you that face-recognition so I could definitely track me it's a huge problem well it was definitely a huge problem for the first event I don't know I don't know how many people downloaded it and did it but I bet they probably didn't see the number it was a big fight and those two fights were huge I mean first of all something happened I think within the last year or so for max Holloway or like when max hallways face goes up on the screen people go nuts as they know he throws down yeah I think it was overtake a fight I really think that Ortega fight made him a superstar I really did although one's definitely helped them sure the back-to-back aldo ass weapons in the Northland Ortega the thing that was different those Ortega had a big following Ortega was the young beautiful lion lion with fantastic jiu-jitsu handsome guy cool smooth talker looks like a champion yeah fucking everybody up so he had a lot of fans coming in there and they went to war they went to war and Max came out on top and I think max a lot of those PB cos they were so cool with each other during before and after people loved it - max is the he loses better than anyone on the fucking planet what losses or wins he just goes hey I'm just gonna get better he doesn't lose a lot he doesn't know I mean he lost it Conor he lost confidence is very clever you know but I twenty years old but I also think max is it because we've always said I think both of us have been agreement where if a guy is cutting a ton of weight and killing himself go to the next weight class I've always said that whether it was dare until whether you know Chris Weidman Luke Rockhold Jon Jones like Duke go up a weight class dominate and then this is kind of the first time we've seen a guy where it's like mmm it's not that easy because max Holloway went up but you could see the power wasn't there like he might have eaten he did he'd landed more than Dustin Poirier but when Dustin hit landed it thought you could see that it fucking counted Dustin is big dude he's big Mary he's 45 done used to fight a 45 and really struggled there but at 55 he's found a spot and you look at him he almost looks like a welterweight I mean he's big he looks like tyron woodley size and he cuts a shitload of weight and max Holloway in that fight just looked like they didn't look like the same no just pori like fucking medium-well and you gotta give credit to Poirier too because if you look at the two of them like after the fight there was a big difference in the amount of damage the Portland a big difference he was hitting him with big shock and it wasn't just big shots it was shots period he was hitting him with really clean well-timed shots with great head movement great movement that me dude everything split open his head yeah everything he did everything great I mean he really that was a coming-out party for Dustin Poirier in a lot of ways for the common fan well yeah well the people that knew him from the gay gee fight noon from the Eddie Alvarez fight they knew that man he beat these two really good guys but max Holloway might be one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and I think is I think's tonight Ali's the greatest 145 of all time yes I think he's a damn good 55 er but but 55 could be tough for max well this is a great example of what we've always said about the differences between the size of people and this isn't it's it's first of all I mean all credit to Dustin Poirier cuz he put on a phenomenal performance he got you know he got tested in that fight he came through he even talked about in the post fight interview that he got hurt in the third round he came through and just super impressive think about his liking tennis Anthony Pettis world champion kg world champion Eddie Alvarez world champion max Holly world champ had it's won though wasn't that an injury I feel like Pettis got injured they stopped the fight I did break his hand is that what happened no I feel like the Pettis one was an injury yet the issues with Eddie Alvarez right which was a no contest yeah I think well there was one fight where Dustin Poirier and no yeah I think it I think that was it there was remember Pettis where peds broke his hand Duke Rufus stopped the fight remember that Tony Ferguson was it Tony for this Tony Ferguson you're right but I think that's a great Brown maybe was an injury I was a rib member oh that's right that's right Dustin got on top of him and hurt his wrist right but still look at place wins man yeah well that's a weird one too right it's cuz like what was that rib injury from a Poirier body shot yeah what was that from or is it from the takedown like what was it something happened yeah I don't remember that's right but you were like a TKO yeah you look at poor Hayes his list man the guy said who's fighting whose loss - it's so impressive yeah and poor is the guy same thing with when Michael Bisping won I for those guys those guys have been around forever and they fight the best of the best they might lose one or two here but they've been around for so long you just hope there's a title at the end of their career yeah you just hope and it sometimes doesn't look like it's gonna happen then when it does happen I just I'm just so happy for this good guy - Dustin Poirier great guy he's a great guy he's smart he's ambitious Neil Vaughn's favorite fighter works hard the whole heiresses that scene those two guys together that was Helen it's called on the right people in the same home school how about Theo was yelling instructions I'm gonna I seen them on can you see I'm gonna roast the shit out of him did you yell take him down what what is happening right now why does this happen yeah shouting instruct the UFC provides me with headphones I was hoping you wouldn't turn around like dude what are you doing yeah character unique kid he was so happy he was so happy I mean him bad well I just bet because obviously him and you thought that did you think I'd be a great fight I thought max at 55 if everything was in carry with him I thought max would probably get it done by noon was gonna be a good fight I was just betting filled Castillo his boys with Dustin from the same area so it's just a friendly bet I would never bet against us Emporia look at these fools we're gonna fight before any text me halfway through goes dude I can't believe you did this shit I know maybe a little respect now around King the sting all right you little fucking respect bro yeah he was looking at it as a complete outsider there's no idea I told him I said super intense man your scene for the best fighters on planet Earth yeah you've seen the very very best shootouts man the Kelvin Gastelum style bender fight was a shootout that style of fight for me I've ever watched ever it's one of the best fights of all time has to be it has to be and when you see style done to get rocked in the first round Rob you like holy shit I think it's best thing that happened to him it's a good thing I think it's a good thing for career-wise and going for it's a good thing you face a little adversity we see that he's not gonna get hit and crumble you and I you got one you got special dude in style bender and how good is Kelvin goddamn he's tall how fast are enough he's so fucking tough and even after all that I mean style bender was teeing off on him in that fifth round and Kelvin is finding a way to survive I'm as a great incredible style benders face looked like he was allergic to shellfish he wore Kelvin hit him with some bombs man bomb yeah but I think it's also I think it's good we saw we saw a Sonia get hit and get knocked down so I'm getting taken down we saw what happens when he's off his back look pretty fucking Judas triangle he's transitioned seven o'clock duh who knows what the fuck would happen if that was early in the fight agree they were dry so I think he that that fight for stop and checked all the boxes but also what's great about this is Kelvin stock doesn't go down no if anything like I'd watch that guy fight whenever whenever and let's be honest he's really a welterweight correct he's super small food air until can make 170 pounds soak in Kelvin it's a discipline thing yes I just think there should be more weight classes I don't even think it's I don't think he's a doctor boy Dana may as well 65 you could text him nobody no one listens to me I don't want him to really yeah I do I'd rather just stay out here and talk about it yeah I want you involved well happens have pushed it I've said I think there should be a weight class every time I get out of here we could like dangle the carrot like yo we'll do a fight campaign every time I 165 her fights and just dangle that carrot yeah he surprised it won't do it probably still wouldn't do it it's um it's one of those things were like I think they'd like it the way it is if it ain't broke don't fix it yeah but it doesn't make sense cuz if you didn't do all these interim belts why not do 65 I think belts on belts you think they do it would think that it's watered down to have too many weight classes the people would just be jumping back and forth from weight class which they would be timeout chaos which I love but you would also have people that find a weight class where they could be at their best versus either have to bulk up or have to drop too much weight and compromise yourself but your happy medium for a lot of guys that are not they're not hitting that happy right now we're not getting the best performance but here's the thing so if Kelvin should be 1/7 here style benders a small 85 er yes you weighed in at 183 up he weighed under the 8 limit so look at how big some of these guys are oh my cousin Brandon Davis 235 235 it was 162 there was Brandon Davis right was it who said that well some of those 80 fibers like you look at Jacare get your romero joe romeiro the gigantic dude I mean it's gonna happen throughout yo Romero stop him like yo remember jack dude yeah it's a big flex now bender could probably make 170 easier then fuckin 85 I me 85 sir a big wake up yeah that's why you have you seen the talk it makes no sense style bender and John Jones that's crazy what are we doing who the fuck's picking up on that's just cuz they're talking shit what would he just the last card just just says yeah you balloon back up 260 pounds yeah it was Brandon Davis right yeah 35 he's really talented it's crazy when I'm standing next to this guy waiting at 35 because I'm looking at him he looked at all of 165 pounds some things you look so bees 510 he looks so big for that 135 pound weight class like this is crazy well even max at 45 fucking huge but the UFC performance Institute gave him the green light to do that Wow so they must have know what they were doing says Davis white with cost was a first in the bantamweight division said he needed to make serious sacrifices to get there he said he cut out drinking alcohol shit and ran 20 miles per day Oh to tear line in order to make the wait by the time he stepped in the Octagon 236 he had ballooned back let me see this dude he's really big man he was huge for the thing is that the he was also he was not just like tall but he's like he's thick you can it's weird how you can lose that much weight but why not just fight at 45 why kill yourself like why 20 miles a day 45 he fought the beat you know his last fight well yeah as a beat magomayev it's a beat got him in that crazy armbar from the battle leg with a Glock right black yeah yeah which is so nasty from filthy back mount feels nasty there's two thousand eight woof I know it's crazy that's a crazy move right easy but think when I think of 185 or think of Luke Rockhold mmm-hmm he shoot up man yeah it's a big ass he's huge but then Whittaker is not like I think freakish on deck I think Luke's done with 85 yeah he's at 205 now he has a fight lined up already but I mean is he gonna stay there as he's just doing it for one fight pretty sure he's staying there probably good idea but then you look at Whittaker 85 son he's stalked keep he's not like huge he's like the perfect size Whittaker cuz he still can knock out anybody but he's got awesome cardio and - he's strong he's not as strong as yo el Romero but he's strong enough to hold them off knowing this who is no one is you got to get that that Cuban gene pool to get that cuz you know I'm saying like there's certain gene pools like that fucking mountain from Game of Thrones there's some gene pools out there man well yeah and then we throw in steroids in that blow you do of course it did of course he did yeah yeah he was like yeah no shit yeah I know when they kept asking about the gore you currently taking us listen I don't really want to talk about this hmm like yeah no of course I am why are they asking questions like that that's the strongest man contest but think about this come on yeah who's gonna win how about a style bender verse Whittaker yeah the all oceanic fight are you really gonna fly to Australia for that are you thinking about it dude three there ain't two dudes on this planet then get me to fly to Australia - there's not it no dudes on there live no Joe under here rather be here you're crazy hmm I love Australia but now free on ax was like yo dude get Australia like I'm on my way say no more fam no not two dudes yeah but that fight dude I want to see that fight in the flesh live you're gonna do it I think I might I want to see how that goes down right Whitaker is a fucking animal man I had to be in to an almost fight with a hernia and a ruptured he had a ruptured rectum right there's a ruptured rectum my thoughts just a hernia I was fine no no I think he had two major injuries no I know his intestines were popping through yeah but I think it was another one damn his rectum was fucked up - yeah so isn't that it didn't have a tear as I called a Jamiel find a hemorrhoid no no I got tear in his ass but you don't you think about the house rain from sparring just think about getting taken down while trying to throw a kick you land fucked up on your hip never rip my asshole you could rip your asshole chick easily for sure sure people whose eyes how about someone misses spinning back-kick low and it just catches your tank off and just the heel hits your taint and rips your taint away from the bone that shit happens I wonder what I don't know what the odds would be out assume Whitaker's a slight favorite in that fight I would say so yeah I would say you know based on what Calvin did well based off what Calvin did based off Whitaker's two fights with Yoel he's been the only got to hold Yoel off although this app says that I did think that ul won the second fight interesting I thought yeah I think I go either new scoring yell Wow had him rocked and hurt by the new scoring I felt like it should have been worth more you thought she'd been a 10-8 yeah I mean he had him almost out hurt he hadn't be staggered we didn't see him do that to Yoel but but he did he's one more round to in survive it he survived you one more round it's like how much of those a draw if you're watching a fight if a fight is a fight if it what I mean understand it's a sport but it's the sport of fighting if you're watching a fight and one guy is really fucking a guy up and the other guy never does that who do you think won that fight do you think you're right you can't yeah but do you think the guy that just moves around and touches them with the jab not saying this what Whitaker did but just as as what if if a guy's just moving around for four rounds and he's touching you the jab and lay kicking you and shut and you like fighting in the street but then in the fifth round you knock him down four times you beat the fuck out of him and you he's running away from you his nose gets bloodied you end the fight with your hand raised without a mark in your face the other guy's face is pizza maybe I think of my boys bike damn for that first twenty that boy is moving right right it's quite it's good question it's cause like what how much is that round whereas a sport though yeah that's what is it because as a sport yeah to judge it yeah if you're gonna judge it on a scorecard you have to be it has to be accumulative the question is like how much is it worth for a guy to really take it to a guy and almost stop him see I don't I think there should be more drawers I don't have a problem with the draw I don't have a problem in that fight if it was drawn like that make sense redo it let's get a clear-cut winner I think when a person gets really rocked like that it's worth more than a point I think it's worth more than two points I think it's worth a lot you think should be like 10 7 I think it's a big deal not then you're fucked do you fuck if you want in real life here because I ref well no because real life you're kind of fucked right like you did the idea that you could go through a round you don't know who won right around where it's like a lot of feeling out a lot of touching you know this and then that and you know ok perfect example first round Anderson Silva vs style bender yeah okay you could give it to style bender for sure but it was it was a round where they were feeling each other out of the way it was not one big moment where stole my god style benders taking over this fight is almost done so that's ten nine but yet another fight where a guy beats shit out of a guy and doesn't drop him and they have exchanges but the guy gets rocked and hurt that is that ten nine - no it's weird what if he had to take some a drop something that barely survives you hammer fist instead of the Bell is it ten nine and the old system it is but what is it in the new system is it ten eight but if it's even if it's ten eight I think it's you need more than ten eight like that kinda thing yes you went out but the only thing is your fuck yeah that's how you do a 10-6 or down seven right then you get dropped it's gonna be tough you got to get energy argument against what I'm saying here's the argument against it Frankie Edgar versus Gray Maynard especially the first one right Gray Maynard drops him has him badly hurt in the first round Frankie manages to survive and come back and win enough rounds and win the fight is a exception though but it is the exceptional it's kind of like if you gave him like five points for that round yeah well it's kind of like with Roundtree and Eric Anders - how the fuck did where people scoring those rounds ten nine yeah that's ridiculous a perfect exhibit n 9 do that was in a competitive fight how good is Roundtree look how good - why would you set something on the brownie so many lifes it everyone's someone's booking a trip to Macau it was clear the fuck was he at they're making fucking plane trips to Phuket my only thing is with that what's the grappling like out there hey man I don't know man but get somebody to help him get somebody that motherfucker he throws some of the nastiest inside leg kicks and so fast and he was total Thai style I wish I could lift my arms up you could tell you just style but he was a light leg dude his timing his speed was off the charts he fucked his leg up I hope it can they're supposed to the picture today about it but how its up first of all how fucking tough is Eric his coaches what are you doing this is not a title fight Ryan this there's nothing really on the line here it's just not his day couldn't ask him plan for fun ask him to quit they just wouldn't ask him to quit so fuck coaches have to he's so tough Crimson Tide alumni monster did you hear with John annek said what he said he said it he goes he loves when he fights because then Bruce Buffer has to say your boy boy he's a bad motherfucker because that guy does not have a long history of mixed martial arts like a lot of these chaotic way more athletic than the blazed then a lot of them but look Khalil's athletic as fuck - man you know he used to be under 20 pounds yeah he was huge have you met a great guy to train with him monster I'm just well I was impressed when you knocked out gokhan Saki and then I know he lost a Johnny Walker who's just a beast I don't know what to make of Johnny Walker you oh he's care I'm on the train but I'm kind of like me - I'm Johnny he's a bad motherfucker dude he's something special he's Sam so I'm not hope he didn't hurt his fucking shoulder when he fell I know did that worm thing I hope I hope he didn't really hurt himself because if he really hurt himself and they can't fix that that would be a damn shame if the way he got injured is falling down playing around after an a spectacular victory I thought he came out today was fine though his man should he's fine would say that I would say that - got to tell everybody you're fine we'll fix this well if he does look like it though he's a freak dude he has crazy power crazy power he's gay and he Hawk Khalil with an elbow with nails up when those elbows were he hands up high in the highest in the clinch but it was beautiful flatline them was put the way he did it though like the Technic anybody gets flat in line with that fucking elbow anybody that guy hits hard and how about that's the fight he's like Leo went to Thailand yes noise it's beautiful and now he's all in he's like he's moving there he's gonna move his family there he's gonna do all this so intense it's so intense but when you have results like that like I love it I love a story like that I love a story like that till a grappler comes around goes more time that's cool Thailand riding elephants and shit check this out but that's what I'm worried about Phuket top team and a lot of those places out there in aka aka mic squeaks place they must have wrestling I'm sure right came out of a kmicic Academy but Mike Swick wasn't exactly wrestling well he but he knows what his deal always with wrestlers yeah you're right I mean he knew how to wrestle swear could do everything yes he's been the gate was I'm sure that mother but is that where he's at a Kate out there hey he's got his place out there nam says that were Khalil's that I do not know I think he's that straight kicking out handbook he's doing the Rhinehart style yeah coconuts he actually a lady boys go to his so you can go to clear Roundtree Junior's Instagram page because he posted thanks after the fight there's a lot of people doing it yeah well a lot of people are going to Thailand I think there's something to it man learning in the motherland with those dudes you know watching those guys work out and train just to be in that environment it's like good for the soul nobody would be like he's the nicest guy Joe the nicest guy that's Khalil's history that's me and him and his crew you know he used to work at like an MMA warehouse and sell shirts when he's 300 pounds it was like dude I want to fight that's crazy see if there's a thang go to the back to the oh that's it right there sorry go back to that one they see you there it says teddy bear peachy indie boxing see that link click on that that's the dude I think that's that's the gym so he's with or that's one of his friends G that's him he's training with him right there that's the in there yeah that's not what I'm saying let's see I wanted em that do this in shape I want to see listen you want Khalil Roundtree jr. kicking you he's probably better off in that shitty be wicked yeah you'll be shaped like it says do not I'll be his pads guy that helped him with his pants he's doing work man oh damn look at the legs on that fucking time it is he's on a Western diet son he's like pass on the Pad Thai and get me the Donald Trump that's I like that noise there's something I think it's good for the soul might be so being over there you mean yeah there's something about Khalil man oh this is a shame he's doing this just to make us laugh thank you I shout out to that guy yeah there's something about being in a place where something was invented that must give you like some extra juice every done jiu-jitsu in Brazil no special place I mean they hate white people fight Nogueira doing jiu-jitsu yeah and your jiu-jitsu guy yeah yeah you came from jiu-jitsu so you to fight knowing that was a thing like right like if you fought a jiu-jitsu guy and remember the early days if I do Jitsu got fodder jiu-jitsu gotta be a real issue yeah just a community like once you fight somebody else remember where they Anderson he didn't want to find out they're brazilians that's when we fought like towels ladies and baby Amaya yeah I was like the worst fights ever yes that's right strange weird the the talus ladies fight it's like almost like you just kind of let him survive because I'm Brazilian that's crazy like one fuck each other no I think it's second do you think it's a nationalistic thing you think they made like take care of each other yeah what do you think it's just that Taos late this was good he wanting any chances right I think it's too much a respect yeah I think so so you think it was a Brazil thing although with Vitor Belfort and it was like a cool story flicked to the face yeah but but the thing with Demian Maia was they had like a real problem there was some sort of like real animosity between them because remember Demian Maia the mask yeah no no that was Vitor you're right but he was yelling at Demian Maia try it and Damon like that this is dis respectful person act this way yeah there's something going on there were gnashing when he's fighting other Brazilians it sucked and then he blew himself out going after Demian Maia and then coasted for the last few rounds remember yes that was a big deal it was in Dubai and Chris Weidman fought on the same card and BJ Penn that's when Frankie Edgar beat BJ Penn right that's a new one the titles I heard the I heard khabib snakes fight might be in Dubai in September whoa dude khabib is pack your bags Gusti versus Dustin whoo that is that is going to be wild that's gonna be wild that's yeah fuck it up din can crack Dustin can crack he can crack I mean he's he's an interesting cat it's like how good is he gonna be able to fend off that grappling how good can anyone defend it all its gonna be hard no one can it's gonna be hard I'll tell you what the fight is my had him on my show is just engag mm-hm and he was like do I'd love to fight could be he's like what's he gonna do to me like take you down yeah I can wrestle my ass off and I scramble that's where he gets guys in the scramble he doesn't that's what I specialize in he's a wild man you know one thing I believe there's a lot below I believe he would want a fight I don't mean wild like he's not calculating but I mean wild and that he takes risks correct he calculates his ability to perform in those risk but he forces action he wants was like yeah he forces actually it's definitely technical but he's he's a risk-taker he's not laying back like if we just talked about Anderson Silva versus Taos latest that was a that was not a risk-taking fire go fight that motherfucker never had fights like that never just engage you know I said sure yes your soul says he fights that way because he doesn't have the car he was out the way I fight I don't have the cardio to go fight like my style isn't conservative I have to get it in Jesus well with khabib that those are issues men yeah a fucker will go all five all five and I don't know who's gonna it could be he's big to compare numbers can be it could be struggled 455 he struggled could be scary until he got like his nutrition on track member he'd had some issues he's a fucking phenomenal grapple I don't know who's gonna beat him he's so good grappling so good we tied up Connors legs in that first round like crazy this is early on I think maybe Tony Ferguson Ferguson is a real good chance of making it interesting because of his own wrestling and his scramble ability twenties a wild screening for this Tony first engage e they're both available everyone else has matched up but I bet Tony is pissed and wants a shot at the title which you know he was on his way to that when his knee ripped apart at a fucking promotion see tonight thing so crazy tripping on wires a freak incident talk about a guy who deserves the title shot yes and a guy who people have kind of like forgotten in the mix of all these killers there's so many 55 pounders that are just straight up killers monsters you know I mean it's what a what a wild do vision you look at 55 70 85 it's there's never been a better time be UFC fence it is murders fucking row it really yeah you look at it oh my god really like I was looking up the matchups for stop and I'm like Oh advice I look at areas free if you gotta think of a style bender which is Joelle Romero the scariest fight that's pretty scary fight right stylish scary Frye everybody he's scary for everybody still 40 years old Jesus Christ every bit of it to enjoy every bit monster monster it's so explosive and the fucking wrestling his wrestling is on it's from another planet and they see an explosive and striking yeah he'll fuck you up he'll spinning backfist you you always got to worry about him exploding because you got to worry about him exploding if you try to catch a break if you like you you know you're standing on the outside and you're both breathing and you're moving you're like maybe this is time I'm gonna catch a break and then all sudden he flying knees you in the face and you didn't see it coming and whether you're Whitaker of style Ben or whoever wins that fight in Australia you got your Ramayana yeah he's number one I'm sure he's my fan wasn't but how much longer can he do that when's father time go y'all you're special but yeah let's go yeah when is it you know but Whitaker also might might the thing with Whitaker's he gets seriously injured after every fighting has to have surgery when's that gonna catch up with him well style benders healthiest fuck it's true shellfish but healthiest but when you're that good and you go that hard I mean to train is hard to see much train to be as good as Robert Whittaker is the human body like what Cain Velasquez is the great example of that right wasn't that explosive like those guys right but he has unbelievable work ethic correct that's part of what it is mad right it's just the ability to push through pain the ability to just keep working and working and working and we're in crying and attack and that way when you're in those fights like a guy like Cain would put it on people to the point where they couldn't believe it was real they're like this doesn't even make sense like how is he coming after me still like how was he not tired what the fuck is going on here but you know who can do that and this decides whether or not you can do is John Jones John John can do this look they're not suffering from those kind of analogies and John does what style do you do you're a grinder let me show you how to grind yeah oh you're striking or you're striking expert let me show how to strike yeah it's so fucking good and why is style bender and John Jones why are they talking shit to each other how do you know what started yeah John did a it originally started it did start with John he came out an interview and goes you know style Boehner's looking good he's fighting 85 it's only a matter of time before I think we cross paths which is silly and then style bender I think TMZ asked him he's a guy or he beat one goat I need another one you know I'm just getting started but if you're John why even engaging in this why you punched John because Santa well it's great for John because he wants to let everybody know hey I'm the best motherfucker on the planet but you know yeah but he wants to let everybody know like when he's when there's a car that's about someone I mean he's active now right John Jones got momentum now think about where he's at right now he's in his 30s right long ass fucking career as champion it's the best ever sect he's on a run right now that's what I think I think they took it away from him for all those months when he tested positive that long suspension all that time off all money that he should have made all the legacy that he could have laid down and I know I think I think he's just fucking chasing it about it how do percent all about it however talking 280 183 pounders kind of silly yeah but if you say that in you I don't think that's that disrespe I don't either way he said is that one day maybe we're gonna fight yeah but then style bender you know TMZ ass shit about finding like oh this guy's big this guy's big they're both black let's fight they have no idea you know that's what they think right so then it then it gets picked up but then also I think John Jones is the hot you know senior in high school and style benders the new freshman who's hot and it's like Mean Girls like fuck that dude it's also I wonder how much of this is like they all agree is good for business it's entertainment yeah look at Economist anytime there's a fight blasted out well not just blast something out mean Congress real good about that but like the way he's able to turn these shit talking back and forth into publicity for fights they are there is real shit talking his psychological warfare but it also wipes people up to no end like the khabib fight all the craziness that led to that obviously that backfired when could be tried to fucking attack him after was over and was it was punched him in the head and all that craziness to me has never been bigger yeah look Habib's never been bigger Connors never been bigger and yeah I mean he needs to fight you need to find needs to fight he needs to fight guys know this I ride Connors nuts I read competes nuts non-benders nuts but with Connor oh my god hopefully something gets lined up yeah but what I'm trying to say is like that shit talking gives you relevant it was yeah it's worth something it's worth something all of them agree like if style bender and John Jones did decide to fight one day it that shit's worth something to both of them okay yeah agree there's a big gap between 85 and 205 though man John - a giant 205 John shoot John could beat up any heavyweight in the world with these could beat up probably six of them in a night so to fight out 183 or is weird yeah it's well obviously he wouldn't be 183 if style bender was gonna do it I'm sure you'd want to put some some weight on just that's such a nightmare but that's what makes style Ben especially cuz those guys same as mash Holly because I'll fight anyone yeah sure that's that's what it's all about it also like and this is not a knock on Santos or you know the level competition but at 205 there's really nothing there to get excited about there's just not you look at the other divisions Santos gonna be a fun fight he's gonna be a plus 700 plus a ton underdog so you know but I like that John's active I like watching John beat everyone's ass yeah it's it's one of those things now where you gotta find contenders for John right because no one's really standing out Rockhold would be cool at 2:05 so heavyweights the play Dominick Rey is just be who did he beat did he fight volcon arose DeMint no yeah he did I didn't think he beat him and I'm a race fan belt think you be those two minute I thought he'd lost yeah that's where I was I was a weird decision yeah that so that one is look volcon is a very good fighter no doubt about it but you saw what Daniel Cormier did to him neither one of my right for Josh not ready for John not even even the same realm right so but we were looking at Dominic when we were like that kids really talented super he's got massive potential and I still think he does know yeah you know stud he's just gonna get better from this Johnny Walker right but that guy might have a blown shoulder let's say he doesn't though if he doesn't he still fights away from John Jay he might be for fights away here's the thing he might knock four people into another dimension on the way to John Jones like guys something special that's what I'm saying yeah you gotta knock those four guys out you can sell this thing you do he does I mean he's he's put away two top-level guys pretty spectacularly and I mean you look at the way he fights too he's loose and weird and then bone jumps on you and it's so special our dude fucking crazy power but I I think with John his team's smart they're gone no we know heavyweights there we're gonna clean out to a fight ain't nobody penis we're in clear clean out so we're considered the greatest of all time don't go to heavy weight get paid well you know they wanted this fight they thought it would be a good fight with Thiago and I think one of the one of the things it's a good fight one of the reasons why it's a good fight is Thiago was shut anyone's lights out he knows he can shut anyone's lights out that motherfucker throws for the bleach and used to fight at 70 no 85 85 85 struggled Mike 85 look he's big he's big he's big a big dude but the fucking power that that guy has and I heard in the manual fight and he just swings man he swings wild now John is not going to fight him the way man and will fall in touch you know John is gonna keep money outside with those kicks taking sides to clinch him he'll clinch them wrestle him take them down jon's ground-and-pound as horrific as top games off the charm missions are great submissions everything strikings better elbows are from hell from the top don't gets on top of you the best you're getting elbow to oblivion and they're coming one after the other after the other have the other but the in the wild exchange where he has to be careful is that that Tiago dude Thiago Santos will swing with everything Johnson he will throw it all in there John's damn you engage in that you know I can see the opportunity I mean that's what makes him so special those guys that go that's where you're one places to win watch this yeah he just canceled it out I don't think that he would willingly wade into a firefight like how it happened but it could have that tie sella fight sir it could happen see what John is gonna do if I had a guess as try to further cement his legacy he's gonna fight the best way he can he's got great coaches they know what the fuck they're doing he's gonna go in there he's gonna kick that dude if he decides to clinch with him he's gonna have a giant advantage in the wrestling but he's got to be careful on the way in man that dude will swing he will try to kill you he swings in a different way he swings like this ain't making it to the fifth round there's no fifth round he's not even looking to get he's that guys just every shot he's trying to take the lights out no I'm definitely gonna watch it he's a wild motherfucker man I think this is an interesting fight John Jones should be the strong favorite should be a giant favorite but it doesn't mean it's not gonna be interesting because this dude's style because he's so fucking wild question is gonna be how's he perform how does he perform when you won that octagon door shuts and you look over you see it's John Jones in title fight the title fight but not but I think one of the reasons why John talking shit to style banner is one of the pros is we're talking about him right cuz yeah we probably when I talked about him for Santos on this show what it wasn't happening it keeps him relevant it's you know he is probably the biggest name in the sport now outside Conor the guy who's the most active him and could be part of the biggest names in talking shit to stop banner I actually think it helps style Ben or too right because now he's associated with the greatest of all time he wants to be the greatest of all time but when he just did and it's gonna get there I can't fucking wait when he goes I am ready for heavy weight him verse Francis - what are we gonna do what are we gonna do timber steep a cane well they're probably less than a deal doesn't get done the talk is steep a versus DC because the Brock lesner deal is not done now in that whole process is Brock lost no that's not real what WWE fuck you didn't know I thought it's real I'm sorry do you see Game of Thrones I'll give you some more spoilers to it I did bet your sweet ass I don't talk about it people get angry now shut up there are trash TV ah ring dragons are real um they think that in a sea steep a to rock might not fight they don't know maybe Brock has to decide this is something he definitely wants to do hey Brock quit fucking giving us blue balls and get the fuck in there get the fuck out you know he's got to make the commitment and I know he's been training he's been training him in training yeah he's trained with some high-level wrestlers I hope mission hundin's I drop DC you know why hmm what's up yeah and in July sergeants stat you got to be careful with Brock memory tag Randy Couture and dropped him and hammer fist at him into oblivion he was 48 years old but I hear ya I hear ya like me only twice never how smash Frank Mir yeah it's terrifying that was Romero him and break a to each other and he's fucked Frank up well it's cuz from thought about that knee bar and he didn't he he tapped the referee didn't stop it Dana White's STP Miocic not blocked Brock Lesnar next and luck when did this happen Wow well yeah but that's just a headline he goes we don't know what Brock's gonna do but if it doesn't happen it's steep a oh just let them they got us they got you I got you know better Johnny Sam could it work click baby I love steep steep ADC I'm like alright yeah yeah I need some spicy man I get what you're saying and I get the Brock lesner Pele I would rather see steep steep it you know I could you're purest and that's why I like you but not me I'm like the Paris Hilton of ever-merciful not me sir out of respect because I know he won he defended the title more than any human being that's ever held it he's the number one guy in the heavyweight division so you have to rate him the greatest heavyweight of all time if you look about accomplishments he's the greatest UFC heavyweight of all time he sees not on bushman's in terms of accomplishments just because he's done it four times okay you know DC beat him obviously DC is supposed to mean if you if you had to rank him you know like right now like 1 through 10 think that's easy boy Frank DC's number one because he's the champ and it knocked him out to say he's number two would be silly but to say like the all-time greatest most accomplished heavyweight boy dynasties okay the all-time most accomplished greatest heavyweight is deep a you got a 10 count well Cain never defended as many times as steep a did the question is did Cain beat the better guys did he beat Junior dos Santos when junior was young he before had been through those wars with Cain right because by the time steep a got him jr. had been in some wars and jr. has looked really good lately he looks amazing but you can never discount that damage I'm not saying that he's not as good now I think he's still phenomenal now but the battery vasa fight the knocking out that toughest shit man knocking that motherfucker out and the way he did it he looks good man dude is that his JDS Francis of ESPN card that's not a pay-per-view I think that's fucking does ESPN I think so do a fucking can do him around and he fought Derrick Lewis right yeah stop Derrick Lewis stop there close yeah look Junior dos Santos still is an amazing fighter that's something July card okay so I'm gonna watch it soon when Steve hey beat it but you know what steep they can knock anybody out like that too it's hard to say you know what the problem is with steep a the problem is is DC spot what twice since their fight you see buddy just been chilling square he's been one that's rematch hey guy I get it but but it's a risky thing when you're a former heavyweight champion and you're gonna take a fight when you rightfully deserve a rematch and what if you get hurt why are you taking this fight what if you get you know you have this fight and you get hurt and then you have knee surgery then you're out for another year and then DC loses it and DC retires he wants to fight him again and the way to fight him again is to hold out to hold out this whole time well no I'll see the UFC wants to fight DC again that's the way it seems all now in hindsight because lessons that happened John Joe's not gonna heavyweight but he's there a third choice in all this well I thought waiting for that I thought it was very interesting John said that too steep a that John weirdest I don't think it's weird of July thing the same thing we do with style bender he's just fucking with everybody he's getting his name out there he's learning from Conor see I think there's more to it well I think UFC was fishing II went hey you down the fights deep in gentlemen yeah fuck ups deep a and what's deeper you don't fight Johnny yeah fuck up John I think there's more to it do you think so yeah what makes you say that I don't know no reason at all maybe they did have some preliminary discussions as to whether or not the two would engage in fisticuffs maybe they did that's a great fight that's great fight TJ deserves 100% he deserves big fights men look the guy doesn't deserve to be forgotten no not at all but Francis in Ghana fight was one of the most impressive heavyweight title defenses he because Francis was on fire he was so danger does they have Francis ranked ahead of them now that'd just be disrespectful but Francis is doesn't world Steve Bates gotta be the number one contender know what be decently cpas number one yeah come after Marian have to be you never know what's right have to be have to be France detail Francis yeah Steve baby Francis it's that simple Steve baby jr. it's a pimple yeah I mean come on man dude Francis dos Santos oh my god dude I can't believe that's even happening but it gets dicey down that heavyweight after six it gets dicey look man Francis there's only 15 every two in the world Francis would take down defense Francis with an understanding of what it's like to fight five rounds and Francis a little bit more experience and yo Santos fucking luck Steve a book jiu-jitsu match I saw did he break it - dude imagine you blow your knee out a Jitsu match and you can't fight for the title let's do two matches a backfire you dress with a rough man and those big dudes want to fuck you up so he's going against right fights true fight to win 110 and Cleveland who Zeke and please don't say it's a leglock guy please don't say oh no or cyborg or Gordon Ryan Gordon Ryan can't really do that right now right for gate onus Garrett Gordon Ryan just tours no sir no info on its opponent oh okay that's cuz he's probably booking a face back see ya dude your boy Ben Askren is fighting yeah bill the fuck not my dad all he's fight mods but all but yes it's not crazy yeah reason that's like makes six I think you know if if Ben asked him can really hang with Jordan borough still dude yeah insane cuz everybody who rolls with them I've never I've never even clinched with them but everybody who's done everything with him like the closest I came to a clinch is like that hug you do and you do it over under a little bit just to feel it out but they say that it's like he's got four arms they say dude it's ridiculous I've heard she's telling me you know Thomas is saying dude it's ridiculous like it doesn't even make sense Holly wops world champions we all know yeah just ragdolls people that's how good his wrestling is I mean if you see that fight with Robbie Lawler the fucking bombs that guy took it's fucked up and the fact he still figured out a way to get a hold of Robbie Lars neck he still figured out a way to get him into that head like once and Robbie knew he wanted to clinch with him he couldn't keep him on I was sweating in that place you and I hide me up so much I was like al please don't get starched in the first round it's still super controversial ending to me what you had her bond would he say well herb said that it first of all Herb Dean is the shit nice guy couldn't be nicer great guy but I love his perspective so laid-back and need his ego is so healthy I liked when he talks about things like you don't see any it's very reasoned like a way he approaches thing but he's just like chilled out and he's like very self-deprecating and chilled out about it but he had a very good point he was like that's not just a manipulation of the neck like in terms of like cutting off the carotid artery cuz like this is a manipulation of the spine it's like a bit of a neck crank I need to think about that he was talking about like you look how he's got a hold of the head and how it's he goes the real what I'm concerned with is if someone's going unconscious from some nerve shit oh wow yeah from a neck crank like apparently he had seen a guy who had got neck crank like that and then afterwards the guy couldn't walk he like couldn't move it came back but for moments but for moments he couldn't move we don't think about like exactly yeah exactly that's why he's Herb Dean he's the gold standard he's the gold standard speak John McCarthy and him and Big John doesn't do it anymore so it's a herb herb do you know and um just that when you think about and Askren says what he says is that you see that's nasty dude that looks terrible that's nasty with the way he's holding on to the head like that and and cranking your neck I like that they're not very bad position I like that UFC went now all right we're good yeah I dig that I it I want to see it again I like disagree I think that um I agree with her stoppage and I see that the arm went limp but then the thumb came up but then as soon as he let go Robbie jumped up loose man had me convinced that Robbie was never out but herb had me convinced that it was too dangerous for him to allow he wants the arm dropped in that weird way so do you side with her you have to side with her yeah and that's a TX but you have to side with her because he's right because that is a special circumstance see I looked at it in terms of and I even consider this when I was talking at least mom that I looked at it in terms of it's just a choke yeah you know it's a neck crank me too so but still I'd like to see max so I think if they both win because asking Maas would all know that doesn't get your dick hard I'll ask her in Maas for dolls and then it lets say ask and wins that which is tough fight to win it's a tough and then say Woodley and Lawler say longer ones that and they fighting it's even bigger would live versus longer though that's a tall order ya know after we looked all over for both old fights enough for both fighters to fight to call either way yeah I'm really interested to see how Woodley bounces back but he's been saying all the right things I love with Lee I love Woodley too and one of the things out of love that he said he said he didn't realize the value of the title until it was gone and Dan said I mean I just think he really understands it now that it's it's not there anymore he's not the champ anymore and to get beaten in a it's not like a fight like you know you could make a rematch with Kelvin and style bender in six months true.you comes back and forth yeah you can make that rematch Calvin knocked him down killer that wasn't that kind of fight no who's been like so different fight it was funny guy this one looks spectacular former champions tyron woodley and Robbie Lawler to meet in UFC main event yeah oh yeah yeah that's booked gets bucked yeah delivered Minneapolis right yeah no no I'm not gonna be there for that one fight that's in it's a fight night yeah June 29th Target Center that's a hell of a fight imagine that that's a fight night two former world champions and broke Robbie Lawler physically in that last show good credit he said he had this crazy strength conditioning program super motivated you know dude we haven't talked about this on here we talked a little bit at the Comedy Store how much your boy TJ Dillashaw both our boys yeah it's not good you see his apology yeah I did what'd you think well I mean at least he's just straight up admit I think it's a you have to do because then you're kind of guy fucked up then people can't really come at you yeah I mean he's being honest about it and oh I do have to correct something he someone wrote an article that said that Cody Garr Brandt found out the TJ tested positive for his fight too and Cody went crazy I think I got duped by a clickbait t article oh we all got duped everyone thought that and actually I got us with a clip baby article everyone did but I should have been more responsible so my apologies to TJ so they have I don't think there's a been another one that they tested him on that he's positive but they're looking into it now here's the thing well we have to this is something that I know EPO is not always tested for correct and what'd he say cuz you sought his expense of his fuck yours hold on you guys aren't yet he didn't know he goes you guys don't test for EPO every time we paid this much money and for you numbnuts to show up guys at 3 in the morning and test them you're not testing every time when we paid this much here's I had no idea yeah well time to cancer usaba thanks boys thanks boys thanks for playing see ya everything's been looking good you have to take it from here come back be cool bro yeah next thing you know everybody's back looking thick their conducing now but they still I see I guess what they're gonna do is they're gonna go back and see if they still have the samples for when he did beat Kony and test those for EPO well this is what you and I were talking about we're at the store when like how far do we go back dude I'm telling you Joe you don't want to go down there I'm all your crazy ass them all let's find out what's real why why you want to do that you're crazy dude you can't you can't do it you're gonna ruin the foundations CC UFC this is a intellectual exercise I don't really want to test them all yeah but if I was gonna argue and I'd say test tomorrow I think line it up let's find out what's up we've always wondered half we'd not be test for some reason and Stephan Bonnar you'll see just tomorrow that this the fight that catapulted the begin test you see this but but then again test all the football players test all the best everyone's feelings for me to watch screwball did you watch screwball no I have it holy shit is it good bill at the Billy Corbin document do you know what they did yeah though they had little kids play a writers yeah it's crazy right it's hilarious story the story's nuts because it's in the people who were actually there narrating it there they're telling the story and they got these little kids playing a rod and playing the Riddler it's fucking great man crazy story it's a crazy story I feel bad for TJ men you know what man when everybody makes an agreement to not cheat and they're testing you all the time to try to make sure that you're not cheating don't you think that the environment is different now than it was before you saw it it was instant was initiated and don't you think that's a good thing words in your mouth knows how to phrase that question yeah no thanks no you might think it is better overall for the purity of the sport I think it's better but I still assume guys are gonna figure out a way to cheat yeah because because peds in sports is no different than than a referee or a judge or gloves they go hand in hand people have always done peds or enhancements within every aspect whether it's football basketball music surfing zags it's just what humans do especially when the odds are so high that this little thing can help you achieve maybe it gets you a victory but you know and then also with with TJ Dillashaw is then granted we know EPO is illegal but this is this one's a little different tested positive for like steroids or whatever it's like straight-up steroids because if you and I engage in a fight and we have eight weeks of train and you go to Mount Everest or where the fuck you want to get your red blood cells higher and then fight me back at sea level but I just stay here inject those red cells you know the difference is that if you operate at sea level and you're taking EPO you will be able to work much harder and get more rounds in and you'll recover much better if you are up at altitude the problem is living and training really at high out so you can't put out as much output but the night of the fight we're gonna have the same know why the EPO will have more labor yeah not even close no you're getting you you have a stroke from that stuff made in Africa right depends on how much you're taking yeah that was one of the things Nowitzki was telling me about her young cyclists thick they were just having strokes well your boy I think it's Lance Armstrong that maybe is on your show but he would wake up mill night had to have to ride a bike another so sick that was my friend salami do I know Swami no no I explained okay but you know I'm saying like if you like it you know like racer you have the talent like up in the middle of the night yeah right Lance did discuss how guys think that's where I got it yeah it's been we've talked about it maybe Lance did did Lance talk about having to get up and did you and I talking actresses did I talk about get up in the middle of night right but no I'm just kidding no just kidding but anyway obviously look that with the Lance Armstrong thing I feel like everyone was doing it and you don't everyone you think TJ's the only one no I think other people are taking EPO and they're hoping they don't get caught that's what I think I think it's still cheating correct and I think I don't think everybody's doing that I think there's a lot of guys who were doing it honorably I agree those guys are doing it honorably you know I think you could get it in your mind look I don't this it just is what to take from max Holloway it is what it is right it is what it is what it is it's cheating right he would TJ would admit that I'm sure he did a minute yeah he did that's what it is but I mean I don't even know if have a point I don't know if I do either but it's but it's the guys trying to but he I was gonna say the guys trying to provide for his family but so is everyone Kody Garber so his cards are brown so is any Sahu dough so is everybody everybody he finds but I would like to sit down with TJ and I've reached out them since he's been suspended I want to sit down with him strike why would you why did you do it like what led you to this because his card has been great since he was a child with his with his wrestling background at what point along the way was it six years ago six fights ago did you think you need to do this in order to beat these guys well let's we could look at one thing that we know that he's been doing he has a rigorous strength auditioning program that training when I'm at that drink auditioning program that he's doing you have an issue with that I understand your issue but that shit is off the charts crazy difficult they're doing wild stuff and Madison ball work and plyometrics and all this stuff and TJ looks like a fucking beast when he's doing it have you seen Brian Ortega's work out with with his with Mike yeah they do crazy shit - yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm not justifying it but what I'm saying is that in order to do that kind of work like to put out that kind of pace your body's going to have to have some time to recover in between workouts well if you take EPO that time of recover is diminished quite a bit according to novitskiy you're saying it allows guys to put in more work so it doesn't just give you more cardio it allows you to recover faster so you could train harder and you know as well as anybody that sometimes the difference between victory and defeat is just having a little more in your gas tank just having specially at that a little longer camp and I'm not being injured the last couple of weeks we lost some cardio you know those awful feelings well if you had the opposite of those awful feelings of not instead of being compromised being his hands there - it's gonna help you then exactly it's gonna help your head you're gonna come in there like a fucking champion - that I what's that song he always comes in - oh give it away give it away now no he comes in he um the Red Hot Chili Peppers Oh - damn - damn I always forget guys what the only guy who's walkout music I always remember two - one was of course Matt Hughes because he'd come out - country boy can survive yeah that fucking song who's the other Randy Couture when he came out - stranglehold oh interesting not Anderson Silva DMX oh that's right it was yeah that was scary Mickey gauls got the best one though what do you think come on man Wonder Boys got a good one what's the song it's called Wonder Boy like Wonder Boy what is the secret of your powers who came out to the GameStop song though don't give out a game of Thrones that's pretty gangster a little boring but you know shit's bad but it's still it's something special you see daliyah that fucking dork with his shirt off yeah we're doing an air violin - Game of Thrones fully committed fully committed do you think I've seen about TJ do you think two years is good enough it's a good question I think it is two years without income but here's the question what are they gonna do it what if they decide what if Cody demands that they test his sample for EPO that's a good question so let's say they can't test that and let's say oh this might have already happened and we don't know you'll know before me so let's say that they go back and test the to five just County then they beat them so let's say both test spots for EPO I don't think they well but let's say they did that's three brother that's the three-strike rule you're out for life mmm ma'am can they go back that far and do it I mean this would be stressed this would be the best argument for getting rid of nowitzki says Dillashaw was testify on both files against Cody gosh absolved it's Kate come back and have it came back negative okay so so he's good yeah so he's good for that but they could go back to you know but go ahead and go because if he didn't do it during Cody gar Brandt fights right come on dude well but training at the training lab was the first Cody grant fight when he was out of Denver was yeah he was switching time and then moved here permanently because the training lab but also which was the first fight was at the Cody grant fight pretty sure the first Cody the first one but also at 125 it makes sense you do EPO because cutting that weight and 125 every snap more ya know energy where he's trying to train yeah yeah cuz you wrecked so that was more sense test is hot for at one time yeah maybe that was the only like 225 fuck that's awful awful mmm before this first fight with him okay for UFC 217 the Madison Square Garden okay so that's yeah so that's when he started that's the winning you would do it right makes sense because he's trying to get down to an ungodly weight dude he looks so bad when he was walking around that day credit City the day but no no it was more than him Skeletor stuff that's why I'm talking shredded like an Ethiopian kid if it was more like like I was starving yes I was like his face was not so sucked in I was worried about this this just doesn't look good yeah looks so sick he looks like an ultra marathon runner like one of those crazy dudes who's just doing one every weekend god I need to get like that what is the one on the bottom 35 he looks so much bigger that's crazy the difference in the amount of muscle carries on like his body ate muscle what a nightmare what a bad decision go to 125 well and also to do it where it wasn't draining himself that much because he got down to like 135 naturally got the last 10 that training lab how and they have to do a safe face I get it mmm they but TJ came on my show and he stocked on other interviews saying how they did blood work every day and test everything you're telling me the one you insert fucking EPO no one had any idea you're doing it yourself and this is the other alarming thing EPO is not a gateway drug it's not like marijuana the drugs not gateway peds that's some black belt level shit is it yeah talk your boy Lance about it you just don't start with EPO that's some high level shit man cuz think about your blood thickens you got to run tests right you won't want to start with like some anavar yeah a little psychic winstrol what's up babe look at the traps coming in sinuses dawg I'm always yeah like you feel some serious shit man in his surge that's a very not maybe someone came to him was like dude better cardiac 125 EPO is the way to go and I know how to do this let's go down this road who do you thinks gonna be the first dude come along with gene-editing might be your ammo there's a Cuban experiment just some fucking crazy science project the hunt kids he never gets old he's a ninja too he looks exactly the same yeah what is happening here yeah he doesn't age like a normal person probably some Chinese dude but what yeah one day they're gonna deal with that one day there's gonna be a person who shows up who is ridiculously jacked that never gets tired and it's fast as fuck fucked and everyone's fucked if they figured out a way I mean how much can they manipulate cardio when you're when you have big muscles that's what we're gonna find out you're gonna find out there's a point where you can't like the physical structure won't hold any more muscle and you can't get any more oxygen through it you only get to a diminishing point of returns you know what are you gonna do then no trying to be the first one China for sure for sure Russia Jack Chinese dude Russia doesn't need it they think they might have already done something like that with Karelin did you ever see Carolyn and it's his parents know the crazy conspiracy theory was always that Carolyn who was one of the most feared wrestlers if not the most feared wrestler ever who just would take 300-pound men and hoist him through the air and he move like a panther and he's a big giant guy Panther his parents were small little tiny folk wait here oh dude they called in the experiment there's a picture of him and I think with Sports Illustrated one of those sports magazines wears got is like hand on his mom and his dad he likes his children bro he said cha I just be afraid though Mike these that my it's like I don't think Shaq's pants are big dude holy oh that's him with phaidor oh my god dude go to that black-and-white photo of him looking ferocious there's a look at the picture of him right there with the shirt right there click on that one click on that whole da fun row listen oh yes giantism we could his chin dude ba row he's got more than that dude he's got more than that he's got more than that how big it he's not he's fucking huge man look at that picture with him that's him right look at that bro he would pick dudes up and they would go for a motherfucking ride guys would try to flatten out and lay their whole body on the ground in hopes that he couldn't pick them up he would clinch his hands underneath their belly hoist them up in the air like a fucking pillowcase and smash them on the ground he's the guy our American beat yes the big fat guy who lost all that lost his toes in the winter yeah Rulon Gardner yes yes yes you have him on you know I never happened I would but Bruhl on Gardner beat him in the twilight of his career there's not taking anything away from Rulon but only beat him by a point cuz he made Karelin separate his hands as assumes a controversial new rule it was like a controversial new changing in point system I can't believe I'm calling that correct we got Rudy sure I'm calling that correctly like how Rulon Gardner had that Russian that's fuckin right dude he was so scary dude he's Jack he was so scary and he had one I think he had a fixed fight in Japan it looked like a work you know I think is do those in Japan still do yeah it looked like you chin and fucking Floyd was fixed what you think is real 100% oh you want to watch again we can why do you think was fixed come on do you watch it yeah I stay in some bullshit no it was a guy who's a legitimate 155-pound man who is fighting the intention ain't crying and rolling around on the ground do two fights at 1:26 it doesn't make any sense never had a professional boxing match how crazy who's fighting against the greatest boxer listen to what you say so small and tensions fixed intentions their fucking poster boy yeah and like yeah here's Floyd Mayweather dude I don't think they thought he was gonna knock him out really tensions a beast man I mean he's being abused but when it comes that I have but we comes to boxing I understand that but they were really thinking he could hit him this was the thought was attention is really a striking genius have you never seen him so scowling McGregor welven no no but it's different tension is faster it's smaller I mean he moves like a lightning bolt and in Japan the the fact that this kids only like 18 or 19 years old crazy and been fucking people up including knocking out world muy Thai champions so threw him to the wolves real early on ok let's watch this and tell me tell me why you think this is fake I see a dude who's so much smaller than Floyd look how little he is way smaller he's way smaller Floyd is not even necessary he's not remotely nervous this kid is a Amino remember Floyd laughing yes no matter he do this to Conor right this is cook buff of course Conor can knock him out this document supposed to be the next big thing dude he's a great kickboxer but he's not kickboxing he's boxing you're not gonna outbox Floyd Mayweather when you've never had a professional boxing match at least I don't think he has he's had a lot of kickboxing though and in kickboxing he's fucking amazing but he's also amazing against guys at 126 pounds also 18 dude look how small he is compared to Floyd Floyd it's tiny and Floyd look how easily Floyd blocks those punches and he's not feeling any danger so he's just tied to put it on this kid he's walking him down he's walking him down looking for an opening this is the first round boy - sweet he waits boom he cracks him why would you ask him does he just BRAC you don't think back it up back it up watch it up Jim back it up let's watch it again dude he cracked him watch this right there here goes let it roll from here gets in this corner here with the left hook to the temple you don't see that left hook to the temple watch water prank right there thank you he fucking cracked a dude who's a legit 30 pounds lighter than him temple and drop - how did watch the crack you just watched it dude out you it's a that is a free-flying that is a full-on left hook first of all there was a stumble in there as well but he hit him see the stumble after he got ride that's a tough one see that it's not tough at all the kid gets up he got wobbled they give him a standing eight count he looks nervous as fuck he looks over he's sticking up man great you're fucking crazy and now Floyd moves in and the kids even trying to fire back he's just not good enough man Floyd standing right in front of him with his fucking hands up the kids got no chance he's much smaller no experience against the guy as good as Floyd and Floyd's walking him down with his head this is real man this is real that kids trying to hurt him he just can't do it he's fighting the best ever and then BOOM God's side was real that uppercut was not all of its real first one they love you as you should know we've all seen guys get hit with shit that didn't look like much and they go down we've all seen it you know we've all seen guys get touched on the chin and they fall down let out Floyd look at this do you remember Travis looter vs. Marvin Eastman you know that a lot of people said that was fixed they lie - fake no one gets hit with the punch like that no no sometimes you're coming to a fight compromised look this is a hundred percent legit one two right on the fucking head and he falls down dude this is a hundred percent of legit fight this kid got fucked up by the best boxer of all just be there - 126 I mean none of this made any sense in the first place but you know since you got to make that's real fight that looks pretty legit it's real that's a real guy that first one that first one is questionable the next two were great it was a questionable are the same for though I meant for my first one it look questionable to me if you watch the whole thing play out in slow motion what happens is you see a left hook if you see a stumble and Floyd moves in and their legs tangle up a little bit and then Floyd hit someone the right hand when he's on his way down boy fuck that dude up did you see how that had a Pacquiao sign with him now or is that let out I might take a night that I was watching that video didn't fight in Japan oh this this was a this wasn't a sanctioned fight dude expose the old mouthpiece they'll oh yeah no you don't need a mouthpiece cent dude they let dose Carl's remember that dudes aspect that dude who wore the what was the guy's name that wore the wrestling mask when he fought cro cop that's one of the best photos of all times like a scene from a movie dos caras is that who it was I'm trying to remember his name but anyway cro cop hits this dude with the perfect left high kick shin to the dome the guy goes down like he got shot and blood starts leaking under there the fuck was he thinking dos Carlos that's it so why but when he lands this kick dude the end is so crazy it's like a scene in the movie like a like a Quentin Tarantino movie some dude who was a pro wrestler who decides to fight one of the best kick boxers of all time to ever enter into MMA boom now watch this watch when they focus in on homeboy or these downs take them right off let me see this it doesn't did when he was during Pride when it ended the dude is sitting there you see blood trickling out from underneath the mask he shinned him do you have a crow Cup had to retire was having I think if something this was his Macker heart you have to retire though what was it he had a health scare hit like a small heart attack I think is that right Jaime at some health concern stroke yeah every time had a stroke and the thing with throat Whitaker - I was trying to bring it up but you guys were going too fast he had an abscess on his not torn rectum oh he's in the same area and then because he was taking antibiotics for that he got chicken pox guy oh which ones they had that as told team was like you're not fighting still kind of wanted to but Jesus Christ such I'm so he had assistants rectum if he had the hernia mm-hmm and then an abscess with an ass in your rectum it's like hair like it's like a puss but probably from some sort of an injury right you can get it from a lot of different things the common room yeah have you ever had a hemorrhoid yeah they're awful lasting awful wise preparation-h work so well it doesn't work out if you have a serious one it don't give a f--- oh man I bet yours gave one no I didn't let it go I did like dead tips or something I went let's not do that and flared up the size of a song great yeah they get gross oh my god re bleeds every time he shits still yep that can't be helped gotta be bad right I mean have you had a me once but I just the pics Inari's he's like shows pictures of just like like just yeah lots of them yeah he sends you those love re stacks about our tweet about Game of Thrones spoilers fuck you I want to talk about it yeah I'm fine that's what happens the offline love Game of Thrones yeah I was pretty dope last night how mean can't give away any spoilers but how good of those goddamn special effects they're good fucking dragons man there was a lot to get this episode there was just they had to like ya type thing together so it's slow they saw fit to it yeah cut the shit they need like the White Walkers fighting no they also need let's be honest you can't do this all and eight more episodes you're lying to us they're going to those fuckers only five I thought was my sixth total I'm pretty way wrong but they're longer - they're like the last two or eighty minutes I think this first one is the shortest one right I read it's it's I thought it was eight isn't it crazy that this shows that my most popular show in the world and they're gonna stop it I wonder what they're just like I'm just good like the whole thing you always want if you're in show business is they have the most popular show in the world but it's good to go out right but I mean it you know how hard it is to get the most popular the fiction show and one of the greatest fiction show if not the greatest ever and you're there in the peak of it how many people are watching it like how many watch last night do you think Aventine seven days only six do you know how crazy that is seventeen point seven million people watch something on HBO that's crazy you know that would be like if it was Fox if it was just thinking like Roseanne was like 40 mil hearts it would be off the charts because everybody has regular channels but everybody doesn't have HBO especially today with Netflix how many people would watch it if it was on YouTube oh my god but would you watch it on your TV on YouTube yeah I watch it all the time on my TV on you do you do you have an app you use yeah use a fruit Apple TV yeah well no I I'm my dish I can just go to channel 372 and it's YouTube like click and watch all my shows 372 on DirecTV as you do a dish on dish it might be 370 ones Netflix it's amazing that there's only one right like this Vimeo but like YouTube in terms of like how much content is online they have a big competitor that not a lot of people talk about what's that pornhub a lot of people that I've had to move and they put their content on there whether or not they're doing like there's tits out or whatever Tooman a lot just uncensored and like there are people actually making money on there also it's with a drop again yeah but probably know what oh I don't know I don't know how much I pour a ton there's a lot of guys on there so grazing there on the both website says when is VR porn gonna really start taking off when those headsets don't become so cumbersome to wear yeah relax you know you won't be able to relax that brain tracking thing though would be an interesting while you're beating off yeah meanwhile Jamie's just thinking about like animal attacks do we know how many games say users really but how many users is YouTube half compared to everyone stay close yeah I don't even have to have an account to go watch no you don't have to site login or nothing that's really a crazy business model right they figured out some wild thing let people to stream shit and the the thing about it is that there's no one else like it we're here to fuck her the next one there's not even close I'll say this too like I've never just go back to the the fights I've swear on my life I've never done a legal stream ever cause I was thinking us take away from the fighters don't want to fuck them over right and when I couldn't figure it out and I thought I might have to do that I got probably 2000 DMS of links and not and I'm just saying I'm like hold this out people watch the fights now yeah it's a real problem like I was in a coffee shop before I came here and the guys were fight fans and listen to my shows and they go man I want you take the fight to it yeah yeah good how'd you guys watch it and it's for young guys and they go come on man we're not paying 80 bucks no what you just illegally stream there you know it it tons of people are doing that but I think it's actually good for the fighters I think it's good it's good for their popularity correct and that's all they care about because he's gonna pay him a finite number no matter what yeah it's probably also good for the sport that way too because more people see it more people see how awesome it is the more people that saw that last fight the more people gonna recognize how at the very best level how fucking exciting this because thing comes out ESPN Plus and when you have to buy the pay-per-view you're limiting how many people can see that by applying these paywalls right so with these illegal strings at least for the fighters sake everyone see these great matchup mm-hmm yeah I knew I know what you're saying you know like porn I'm always cuz I don't want you to see a shutdown I love the UFC love the fucking UFC I don't want it to do bad I hope these numbers do great but when I see what I have to go through as a die-hard fan like my dad was a gone out nope I'm not doing it Mike come on man taking out too much so I'm wondering how many people did that I'm sure quite a few but that's you know what it is what it is there's nothing to cite max Holloway again there's nothing you can do those strange they're gonna say yeah it's over yeah the streams are gonna existing they can do really got to make it easy for people to just get it make it easier and once they make it easier once everybody's setup I think the numbers will go up I think most people don't want to go through the hassle of going through a stream putting on their television most people just want to be able to tune in correct and if you can get that ESPN Plus on everything that's the other problem right if you have like direct TV and that's the only way your TV set up your TV's not set up for the internet correct so then what do you do you know what if your Internet's not strong enough to stream it even with all that but then yeah that's that's for everything yeah but but that's for a fight but now if you're eighteen to thirty six eighty dollars and let's say you just you're struggling to get by eighty dollars a lot of money it's eighty dollars for the whole year though the whole year of ESPN plus and the fight so hold up yeah it's not eighty dollars for all the paper views no no no no no no no for ESPN plus a membership for a year correct but it's going to see the paper views right then it's not pay eighty bucks yeah but which is much would a year cost of ESPN plus sixty sixty bucks so for $79 you get the fight and a year of ESPN plus not paper use not pay per views and there's ten to get all the fights all the fight nights every fight that you know that has happened when if you get to ESPN fights as well as the spm plus fights yes do you yeah yes but the paper use that of course they would do that wouldn't it yeah so if there's ten paper use and they're $80 there'll be another the eighty bucks was just for the one deal just for the work they can do it again and they might have other deals you might get to buy two for once a lot or who knows what they can do there's a lot of content on there now too because they put the paper views up there they put a bunch of paper views up there like of the older fights like fight Pasi fight past on ESPN Plus yeah you can gave me the old fights on there yeah yeah you can watch some old fight yeah you'll see five baths just over then I don't know well you know with it there's other stuff on the fight past it's not that you can't get on ESPN Plus right make sure I'm right about that a profit I'm just your stuff that kind yeah yeah fight passes a lot of great shit but they have glory to is that you guys thank you make sure that's true though that fight that ESPN plus has old or a paper I'm pulling my Joe pretty sure does really yeah pretty sure that in the lead-up to one of these fights well you can click on it but you can't go back and like say watch UFC 183 you can't I don't think so I don't know no no I think they might only have that would be kind of cannibalizing yeah fight hypothesis David maybe like they only have the stuff that was aired three SPN like from now on they'll have all that stuff like they're building their library from this point must have been a pain in the ass but I know fight pass like what that could be could be buck honor you can watch on you oh yes only certain ones yeah there's only certain one 97's on here also mmm and then I'll see okay so it's not all of them but there's some so he's right there there's some like fight pass we can go through and see how fast you can see everything see every pride fight and I'll see if I passed for me is like I like throwing up some shit that I've never watched before like some Muay Thai like we're you know just some dudes I've never seen fight early yeah I love doing this in it that's I like doing that when I workout for whatever reason well ESPN now though but like on espn2 those throw up like classic fights yeah that's all the way Brian or take was on 108 ds2 was like I'll watch those when I'm working out but again with all this ESPN and buying this in seventy 9.99 I've never been a dark web guy and when I clicked on some like dude this is a problem yeah cuz it's so good yeah it's so good and then when I talked to the young like fans around like yeah man why would we pay $80 I'm like I can't tell you because I used to always think you'd be fuckin over the five do you all understand the the tech knowledge behind it do you know how they would stop it how do you stop a stream I have no clue from from or I've watched they've never they can fight them but you can't stop them remember when they were suing people yeah my buddy got soon really yeah he put on his gym put a pay-per-view on his gym he made me able to play oh no no he just had it on for free he paid though whatever the who ratted him out I don't know they are they can track the IP address in right hold up this is a gym well you owe this much money because you in they look at the capacity of this how much it is if to do that so he paid just this whatever six $9.99 at the time and would hold up you're doing from a public gym it fits 300 yours whatever 15 grand oh so he made the pay-per-view so he paid for it dreams it on a big thing yeah they don't fuck around man this is also for us only so for people that are outside the United States the ESPN Plus thing doesn't it's not for them they still wants to fight password okay they cannot they also get it on the regular never extract yet the bps they don't have all that yeah like in English fans were making fun of me on some problems like you fucking Americans alike yeah so in England they could watch it for free a lot of it yeah yeah there's ill they don't have a pay-per-view thing in England the way we have it here they do but it's cheaper like when Joshua fights like 1999 oh really yeah huh why are we suckers like what's going on we're willing to pay for it yeah yeah man if someone's fighting it's a crazy fight and you got to pay 70 bucks for the it makes people not Floyd me with a pack up for a hundred bucks is that what it cost yep they've never gotten cheaper from what I remember my whole life it's always been our choice been expensive bucks maybe yeah it seems like it's always yeah it's always in the like $59.99 $69.99 so it's never like cheap no it's not cheap they're wild encounters do you know I panicked though and I couldn't figure it out and I knew for my favorite fighters I panicked yeah dude listen I love working for the UFC but I used to fucking love watching and I still love watching a good pay-per-view I love them a preview comfort of my own home nothing better just sitting down kick him back the watch all play out listen if I did watch it on the dark web I'm saying I did right if I did I did buy a style benders shirt to give back see that's good money how much this diabetic seven cents I've seen about just DM and him eighty dollars you start selling his own shirts I think you can during you can't I don't think so you have to sell it it has to be through Reebok yeah happy insane if that's the truth I'm sure it is don't you think like do you think fighters are they must have some sort of a garment in apparel deal because they all have like style been dirty shirts like everybody has a you buy a t-shirt with yellow Mero but you better can still sell your own shirt do you think so seems that like a unknown fighter would be prevented from doing that would be a little strange as well to stop from China that would be fucked up but if your stop everything but O'Connor has is maybe not yeah Conrad's is McGregor August shit what is that his own line of clothes yeah but that's like a it's not athletic yeah that's not athletic Lear that's David August that's he's like he makes suits who makes the suits that I wear for the UFC or riot bro so can he so as a fighter you cannot have your own shirt and your slang it I don't think you can I don't know that's don't I'm not a businessman I'm not sure but I would think they have an apparel deal Reebok yeah like I know that I'll owe you that gol Romero shirt which I almost wore today I forgot to wear it I've been hilarious what she did dope shirt ok chums arre buck it's Reebok shirt you see the style been to Reebok shirt no fucking dope it looks like the matrix he's all different colors ah shit was sick that fight was sick ma'am he showed who the fuck he is in that fifth round he showed you the fucking great fight that was a great fight in that fifth round favored fight he went out there like him they both went to fuckin chance both yeah they did both go out that way just style bender eventually got to him don't live that fifth and final round whoo and you know and that's what he said when I interviewed him that he just felt like he was ready to just throw it all out he was talking to himself with didn't 5th round he's seeing something like this Saint something yeah do that yeah that's it he decided to go out there and be a champion you don't think about if let's say Francis becomes world champion was definitely possibilities number two you got three African champion boom boom yeah well when if Daniel Cormier decides to retire and Francis keeps getting better I mean Francis only been doing mixed martial arts for what five years four months he's he's so powerful man he's just what I told him I feel so I don't wait it out let DC do his thing and you just go do your thing cuz he was kept saying Iowa whatever gets me entitlement I don't know what you're talking about let's not fight DC let him do his thing then you go what that dude needs is a best friend who's a super heavyweight wrestler correct that's a tattoo needs just a best friend who's like bro I'm not gonna hurt you he's that shoe yeah yeah look he's friendly that guy's like 55 no I'm saying a guy like yeah you should watch a wrestling match with him because it was so preposterous the way would hoist guys up in the air see if Google Karelin slams to dish no no I've heard of them yeah but when I saw him it I recognized I had a picture of him on my Instagram said that I looked at I used to have it in my favourites of my iPhone I pull it up every now and then just to remind me of what a pussy I am - so I want him with him grabbing the guy and all the fucking the teeth and the muscles he's it's crazy like our American beat him real I'm gonna beat him chunky this look at this watch how he hoists guys up in the air do please don't serve that's embarrassing watch this what the fuck boom he hit you he's just using the ground watch this but look how devastated this to you boom he's driving you with all his fucking weight all that momentum and power and he's knocking you the fuck out man holy fuck powerful Reebok switcher yeah look at that Reebok back in the day was sponsoring Karelin dude he's so ridiculous little boys wrestling that's all yeah as who the fuck's he gonna find another seven foot three guy it'd be nice the Reebok shoes look at a fucking monster man how tall was Karelin I think it was like six nine or something like that but just didn't he he was the undefeated for like ever for yearly six three it says he says in like six three that seems weird that doesn't spit he was undefeated forever oh man he was a man when he was fighting I think he was 300-plus pounds was it say there 285 okay he's 51 now goddamn that guy was a gorilla I don't what he does now I think he works with wrestlers holy fuck I mean I think you know that whole Russian program they probably have a very very prestigious position it was he undefeated forever rule on beating yeah but again the way he beat him if you could please google that because I think rule on garter beat him and this does count but by getting him to separate his hand I was looking that up there is a day to do a video review even if something that happened and then rule on was awarded the point and then that made Karelin be extra aggressive and rule on kind of later 84-inch Jesse said that was really hard for him to get his hands around in the first oh yeah that's right rule ons a big fella thick remember one rule on fought MMA yes last in people with a jab didn't hit with the bottom of a dumpster yeah so big anyone on my hiking got lost in Colorado and lost his toes and finger no I think he was snowboarding on board yeah I think he's no Nobilo mobiling he was snowmobiling and it broke down and he got frostbite nice toes he lost at least one toe and I think he kept fighting men I think he fought even I think he fought in Japan and I think I let him wear shoot regime oh that's right they let it let you wear wrestling shoes what's he do now I don't know he was on The Biggest Loser all that and he had eaten a lot after he retired from fighting bro he was not so big country fed son besides that motherfucker that was when he was on The Biggest Loser he was away got some hits high but look at him in Pride go to go to Rulon Gardner and pride when you see him in shape as a an MMA fighter you realize what a dangerous guy he was he was an enormous man everyone should be thanking their lucky stars that rush it freaked into sight look at him right there in the far left far left that picture dude that was a hoot he fight there ain't skinny that's odd that's god damn it that's the the judo guy fuck god damn it I can't believe I can't remember his name that guy was a one day weren't they to Olympic medalist say that is does I think they're both Olympic gold medalist right just go go - Rulon Gardiner's MMA Wikipedia oh yah schita that's right exactly Yoshida started out where he was a gold medalist in judo and was fighting with the Gion yeah cuz I remember that fight they were saying they're both metal medalist I forgot about Yoshida another great fighter that was fighting during the Pride days but here's the point Rulon Gardner was so much bigger than him dude go back up and you see that photo of the two of them standing there right there Jaime the one yeah that picture that's how you get to just an understanding of the difference inside one didn't have that many fights though dude he was so big he was smashing that dude with a jab too like he was beating him with a jab like Yoshida was getting stunned by this giant heavyweight jab and Rulon Gardner yeah I think I don't know if he really if that was his first love though you know I think he really loved wrestling he said he was burnt out of wrestling too though yeah I've never seen that man with the MMA that's tough man after all the years of wrestling especially at that international level how many of those guys do you think at the in the top echelon of amateur wrestling if they just decided you know what fuck this I'm gonna ready to MMA right now like how many of those guys would be a giant nightmare for everybody all the above all the about I think about Jordan burrows yo you kidding me kidding me his athleticism dude and world-class experience and work ethic yeah hey and the knowledge and like all the mental fortitude it takes to become Jordan burrows detecting reason that aspirin and him are gonna go out at while Askren is in the middle of embarking on it - but what if African beat him what if he takes him down that would be insane I don't is it I don't know wrestling that well to the point where I just ask and stand a chance we're gonna get lit up on the internet for this but does he even stand a chance easy no I think he does I don't think you take it if he did it I don't think you would take it if you didn't either he's too smart yeah I mean I want to see I mean I'm very curious like I think so hard dude yeah go ahead good odds for it if there's odds you know like well I would imagine Jordan burrows got to be the favorite because you know see how big it was or something yeah because Askren has been fighting MMA for so many years now with 1 and then before that with Bellator the belt or one is such a weird situation because he was clearly dominant and clearly their champion and they just let him go you know and I'm really excited about him and Mazda at all because if there's anybody that's gonna be able to give him a really hard time by being sneaky and creative and and using slick counter punches and having good wrestling takedown defense and good good defense and and he wrestles with a lot of big guys big powerful guys he's a slick customer that's a real interesting fight because he has such a giant advantage on the feet especially coming off of the the dare until fight him being able to knock out Darren till like that that's a giant statement I mean Darren till is a legit expert striker I mean he's a lightning-fast knockout puncher knockout kicker nasty Muay Thai skills and to see mas Vidale crack him like that and drop him so it's like this this is there's never been a better time like Shaab and i were saying like like fights has never been but no one's ever there's never been a better group of Champions and contenders either it's like everyone is at the top of the chain so what were you pulling up right there trying to find that there's odds on the fighter with what's going on it's like a charity event apparently so I don't know that it he said they're also fire fighting but they're weighing and it's 74 kilograms which is 163 put that up so I could see it it's 163 mm-hmm Wow so so Ben's got to lose some weight um he could do that easy though I'm sure say too much more about it really it's at 163 apparently the Jordan burrows Ben Askren match Brendan Schaub back from peon college boy that's the best feeling in the world and you have to piss for a long time that I dude maybe if I nothing better hmm very interesting very interesting I'm looking forward to that if it works can you watch it son I think it's a pay-per-view thing right online is that what it is it doesn't say I'll definitely pay for that wrestling on the dark side don't go no I'm not going to bleep $80 you got sued majesty went after you this is allegedly alleged allegedly right I I'm happy I'm a ESPN Plus cardholder oh there you go and I contribute you should be able to illegally stream no one should say shit why if you're a cardholder oh no because doesn't get for the pay-per-view I try cueing my money that's a bold move on the UFC's part to go with ESPN Plus for all their papers that's a bold move that's like when Apple got rid of the CD tray yeah what it's a little shocking more CDs I'm sure they'll figure it out yeah yeah dude you're ESPN employee no it looks like Congrats well I'm a independent contractor that's what the fighters say - I am I'm I'm an independent contractor but to watch you have to have ESPN yes I love you spin so I grew up with the SPN listen I think it's good for the sport I think what these hiccups aren't great but the future is in streaming yes is in something on the internet 100% it's as long as everyone see right now there's a lot of people out there that got fucked because they had they might have a nice TV but it's not set up for the internet and they couldn't set it up in time so it's gonna take a little bit of an adjustment period you know and and eventually you know and some people don't want to go I have to go out and fucking buy something that's internet ready like a TV that's internet ready like to watch it on your TV if you've got a TV at home you see you've got satellite and you don't know how to fucking set up your TV for the end he's not paying on those people they're breaking on the people to figure this shit out and the nature but what I'm saying is it's going to be a bit of a learning curve for a lot of people for they absolutely know this is how to do it yeah so that's why it's a bold move but you have to do it whether it's now or in six years you have to do it don't want to do it in six years because then everybody already have done it dude I support the movement yeah you got to be there in six years so six years down the line everybody knows pay-per-view tonight on ESPN Plus that's what they gonna say they're gonna say dude pay-per-view tonight on ESPN packages yourself ESPN plus a bit you in six is just ESPN there won't be any plus I bet everything's digital interest yeah hmm which is its it's a good move it's funny because the only reason to have regular TV for a lot of people's live sports regular people a lot of people like look you can get a whole fucking year of whatever TV show you want to watch on iTunes or you can watch Netflix now YouTube has splits right but remember how much it used to cost to get like cable like how much cable used to cost yeah how much Direct TV used to cross how much did it cost well I yeah I did have a dish sponsor for like last eight years than they're like a buddy no more so I have to pay for it now it's like 100 something dollars a month now now think of that in terms of what Netflix Cross what's Netflix like 10 bucks mine bucks or someone think they just raise it to like 15 and then you need an internet connection and then that's it that's it Apple TV tube Apple yeah or Amazon HBO but I have HBO now crime is even more interesting because if you have Amazon Prime for shopping you get Amazon Prime for free like the TV you watch the TV shows so you get to watch mrs. Mazal you get to watch you ever watch the guys from Top Gear when oh I love those guys they went over to the codes the Grand Tour yeah then when I wanna fire them and the other two guys went fuck it were going with them yes well Jeremy Clarkson got drunk punched some dude so they fired him I guess who's the bass he's hilarious the best funny dude can't do a show without him and so apparently like they just ended that show and he was crying like he cried like that's how he teared up oh it's over it means to him yeah oh damn yeah I think they committed to do like a couple of seasons they're paying them so much money I'm sure well it's a good move on Glee so that Bezos dudes burning money to do whatever the fuck he wants yes so much money although his girl has half now she's third on the list of richest yeah he has that die me piece with him now though who lose got in that game to for live stuff so there's nothing everyone is playing the game pretty soon it's gonna be over imagine if you're trying to do a shoot a sitcom right now could you imagine if a guy got divorced from a woman who's like a duchess or some shit and I made out in the deal as good as Jeff Bezos his wife is gonna make out to be sick do she then she'd be like a billion dollars something that she had way more they get bill young yes and they said as soon as a divorce she's be like top ten richest in the world yeah he gave her like twenty five percent of his stock or some crazy shit yeah yeah like but they did start together like his room yes listen man yeah she deserves it but it's hilarious it's so much funny like damn she banked on it correctly she's hanging out with that dude when he was like 24 going this fucking psycho have you seen her on the world everything that yes that PS is amazing that's I want that send me that picture I picture do me a favor and send that to my phone I need to see that in that great I'm gonna I'm gonna put that as my face the American flag with that and that great I'm serious and he's like and he's like shaved his head to your aunt anomalous ballin just look at that banner on the wall look at the just a little bit banner look at him there dude and have you seen his new girl yes sup holla sure that costs you about forty billion dollars but you gotta be happy yeah it looks like he was enjoying also when you have 80 billion what's forty who gives a fuck how much can you spend and Bob spent it do you think he's gonna kiss a problem with that dude he might be making so much money they think about it like when did Amazon even start was it 15 years ago was that gonna go wasn't that long I don't know what's gonna be like 15 years from now when he's on fuckin gene doping and they got a backdated to a 24 year old Bezos his chin looks thicker his shoulder caps Ron and she's gonna be 85 years old run and shit lookin 30 how much money do you need like a billion billion dollars like how much money kiss my point like if he stays healthy and is enthusiastic and still has like this drive to succeed how much is gonna be worth how when you start getting that kind of momentum that's why companies like that's why you get people like Elizabeth Warren but I don't know too much about her politics but one of the things that I do know about her is she wants to shut down or break up some of these big companies you know there's a yeah I forget what big companies she was talking about but that would be an example like yeah just too much power so much fan club so much crowd she'd probably wanna break them up it's interesting cuz it's like you see like what is kept when you see capitalism play out right you see someone they start a business they want to kick ass they want to make a lot of money and then they do and then they keep going and then they get to this point where they can make more money more easily more often and they just keep going keep going and then they get to this point where if you hit the right river at the perfect time with the most ambitious person ever at the helm and you got this fucking boat running yeah running down this river I just passing everybody that's where you got Amazon with Jeff Bezos is the perfect guy at the perfect time with the perfect thing to the role of Scrooge McDuck he's making right he's like Elon wants to make a rocket shop get me a rocket ship correct yeah you have nothing to do like what challenges does he have throw that one click is the shit if you need something it's the shit Amazon yeah it's amazing does anything anything yeah just just go fucking find it bang boom you have to think about anymore that to me that means a lot to me that means not everything time I can save time and hassle thank you I don't have to leave my house thank you she's actually the only third richest third richest woman they made a deal last month or this month actually to give her 35 billion that's it oh good for her and she keeps a 4% stake oh I thought it was more than that damn four person she is balling she's ballin she's just four percent stake in Amazon oh my gosh and where is it going where is it going what's gonna be ten years from now what's gonna be fifteen years from now Jesus and she's got 35 billion cherry sauce cheese sauce 35 billion I bet she went all right you know I bet she's so using thirty five billion dollars you're not going that okay okay I mean right you need 35 but also I think Jeff Bezos had a weird agreement with his new hot girl where they were like they're not having sex until the divorce is final so I'm sure like that oh sure yeah it's like some weird thing do justice nuts the story they're staying away from each other till they do what are you doing Jeff or stand married or something like that oh yeah she's getting divorced too if you want to live like a movie you got to write a script like a movie script yeah dudes already living like he's in a movie what's yeah you right yeah yeah and then when you get married make everybody dress up like priests or some shit do whatever you want to do thank you everybody dress up like like a Kanye service yeah like one of those do whatever you want God what do you do control what do you do what do you do well what would you do you just do whatever the fuck you do whatever fuck he wants to do you're supposed to do it over the fuck you want to do there's only one Jeff Bezos I know Ben would you just stop kind of you fucking keep going the foot on the gas I give you the line if you're the rock do you need you 19 movies three last year it did nineteen movies this year 22 22 movies 22 billion up get bigger man yeah he'll be 3,000 pounds yeah yeah like how many he's a gorilla man that did so jacked right now he's so huge - when you meet him in real life you're like oh my goodness he's so Jen he's so jacked he's so inspirational to men you know he's but if you know how odd is being busy like how often is he home dude he's so inspirational oh that's true yeah yeah it's hard man it ain't easy well I know my schedule yeah and I like at half time I like his that's a silverback dude his Under Armour shoes ourselves always work out act ok she's heard oh I love this fucking guy man I love the file of him - I can go to his Instagram at any time and he's always super positive and he's always super motivated and motivational and he's always getting after it I love it he's always getting after it but I wonder what it is in him that you have to do this many movies when he was young man he was young he fell upon hard times he never forgot and that's that's who he is now and he also knows that he inspires people with that work ethic part of what who he is is not just the things that he accomplishes but how he makes people feel like that guy he's an inspirational person I think the same thing you could say about Kevin Hart in a lot of ways man don't you think it's for selfish reasons too though cuz you check those boxes I'm not saying as a bad guy but there's also this this ego everyone has an ego that he has to fill I'll dude if she gets from the tongs even red carpets and he talks about it he talks about kicking ass he talks about how everything's going great you know he talks about that whole lot getting after it the whole aspect of it sure but there's a kid I'm selfish for sure for sure you have to be yeah I have to be it for anybody who does anything really good like that like you gotta be doing some of it for yourself but he's also what he's getting out of it is his what he gets out of it but what he gives out of it it's not just entertaining with that guy what's interesting is he's he's also super motivational right like if he leads by example check - it's always really positive always now but before social media when you had an action star you just had the guy that you went to see in the movie and you saw like you know Sylvester they would do interview can't relate to him yeah it would be kind of interesting but it wasn't this kind of thing the rock is the rock and he's also the rock on social media and he makes very good use of social media because he just products right to the fucking camera and you could tell he knows what he wants to say but he's speaking from the heart playing right so he's interacting with people and who's done even better than this which the rocks might be the best but on the other side of this Will Smith he's fantastic and he'll Smith hold up okay so the movies doing alright but instagrams the new shit all right let me focus on this and it's I mean yeah read a kiss how good he is on their wand YouTube as well remember when he did that fucking dance on the roof of that bridge what do you don't fall down with Kevin Hart's get a social media - though nice phenomenal honor he's um he's one of the most inspirational guys I've ever talked to Kevin yeah because I liked his message so positive super positive genuine genuine not a bullshit positive not a fake show that spot a motivational show business positive he's gonna healthy outlook she does so many things though I got I got tired just listening to him talking so much energy he was talking about all his businesses I was kidding a hostage I was like how do you do that how do you have the time it's incredible I mean he must sleep and he said he only sleeps a few hours a night but I mean he must be just from the moment he gets up just fucking foot on the gas I wish I was one of those guys I wish I was one of the guys you only need four hours and just do function at a high level if I don't get eight I'm fucked man do you I don't think but I mean do you really wish you were that guy though that like always hit the gas all day long whoa whoa no I'm saying I could get just Monday for Sunday I and then before my son gets up at 5:00 I'm up at 3:00 he might work out I can do all my research for my shows and then I'm off and running yeah I need eight man Brian like if I do let's so if I do a set tomorrow at The Comedy Store are you home at midnight no matter what I'm up at 5:00 5:30 with my son when I go to work it's a beast of a day yeah when they're certain guys they just need four hours yeah those people are freaks you're not that guy no now I need five to feel okay six to feel good six I can work out normal I could do anything seven makes me feel happy seven is nice a weekend I'm settling like I'm a seven guy you know sevens good sevens a solid number if you could get that you probably got most your bases covered but damn if you get eight or nine that's when the real if you could really sleep for eight or nine like engineer it so until my problems I drink too much water at night I got a pee yeah it's so so annoying that it's so stupid and like I had a CVO last night while watching Game of Thrones like a shit no shit I'm gonna have to pee do I have a problem I have to it's so wet I have to have beverages yes yeah I just want to be able to sit back and slurp that xenia and then at five o'clock in the morning do you ever sip on whiskey anything at night with the wifey watching game with her no I'll drink a little wine with dinner but I don't drink whiskey at home very often I drink whiskey when I'm looking to get fucked up or before did he stand up yeah I'll have a shot yeah here's a prompt so if I become an alcoholic in three years it all Stan I'm blaming you because when we're doing that said I think in the improv you like go on a shot of whiskey I'm like I don't drink before shows man yeah I'm telling you it helps you with your nerves so I was like all right this guy's been doing forever let me try it did the shot one of the best sets I've ever had I don't how long let's go every time I do this comedy now I have a shot of whiskey well make sure make sure you don't do that make sure why not well cos you don't wanna become an alcoholic which one shot one Charlie I was gonna get whistle every day yeah you could do it yeah I feel good as long as I work out the next morning hydrate one shot is not that bad for your body no it's not the best thing in the world but it's not slipping though but it's a good amount to give you like a little just a little fuckit juice yeah loosey-goosey so uptight it's a fucking man yeah that's fun yeah that's what whiskey's for you know that's why it's been around so long they like that Buffalo Trace shit that we drank when we're doing fast shit man that stuff's from the 1700s fucking right it is that fucking company was started in the 1700s how ridiculous that is I was thing about orange some from my house cuz I like that was so much like I don't need that in my life yeah cuz I'll just start drinking it's good during fight companions yeah I'm gonna save it for that yeah I don't keep like whiskey at home I don't find myself interesting I don't even yet cuz I if I want to get like a little tipsy I wanna be with my boys yeah and like I don't I like it at a bar I like it I like it at a comedy club I like it here I love it during five companions my favorite but it'd be like if I had like a man cave or guys came over we played poker we drink some whiskey gonna be fun yeah but again you're with your boys yeah but I'll just chill at home by myself yeah might get drunk could say something inappropriate yeah get cancelled in my own house yeah it's a different kind of drunk to like whiskey drunk is like Jesus Christ like you you you know you get belligerent I don't need that that that you start having fun you start playing Hank Williams jr. songs real loud and outlandish yeah yeah dude there's some fucking go into that deep country music what were you just telling me about country music that some giant country rap yeah what is the song it's called Old Town Road Old Town Road yes one of the biggest songs out of its abdomen it's number one on the regular charts in the country charts right put it together a little nas X is that right everyone's little X little NAS yeah a little nas X but so he was on the country charts they took him off because like this isn't country man but then he linked up with my lease his dad what's his name Billy Ray sorry really Ray Cyrus how dare you yes I think what also had to do with this is he used out whether he did it or not I don't know but he used the video game Red Dead Redemption and some of the cool graphics and then made a rap song country rap song it's called country trap is what they're calling it that's why Oh a different thing but it's got its got its catchy and it's based around this kind of stuff it got it got hot it caught they caught the wave country like the DJs on all the stations were like just ripping it off with YouTube and playing it that's why I made it on the Billboard and then sorted like that's not-- this isn't a country song take it off and then because that almost sex tries to in effect it got bigger so they um they who who took it off billboard did why they take it off because it doesn't and their third a description was that it doesn't meet the qualifications for country meet country or Billy Ray Cyrus jumped on board and then there's video of him and Billy Ray Cyrus and you know it's so interesting when you're looking at the the footage of it how cool that fucking game there's just a game this is that's a huge game right red redemption too but what a great idea to rap over so smart demson that's a genius idea you played it in here Jamie good game yeah you guys beat the shit I mean whatever game we played last night that was quick that's fucked you don't want to fuck with that game dude Tom Papa walked in Jeff and I were battling to the death Tom Papa don't play you know he was just watching us what the fuck are you doing yeah what are you doing he doing tom pappas so funny man he just wants everything to be old-school he said want to go to the to the paper vendor and get a newspaper and bake his own bread I take that what is this Manson I'm not feeling the real video dude dances with a cowboy hat on though he's become a star because of this it's getting played all the festivals all the last couple weeks the crowds are loving it why didn't he open up at Coachella it was already booked it's more along it's it this happened so quick you could sneak them in those Ray Cyrus let bait you know you get his whistle let it go Cho how to play that I'm sure but like I saw that little that the yodel kid was singing this song like he's even tono do you know who Billy Ray Cyrus's no you know his big hit oh yeah don't keep breaking my heart anywhere this daughter's way bigger um he was really huge for a brief moment in time yeah yeah he was never like what she is she's she's like a just sound to his buck and she was on that crazy Disney hit forever hand of my Hannah Montana forever which made no sense I put a wig on nobody notices because it's so ridiculous like Batman there is glorious locks god I think yeah he owes brother yeah so powerful everybody was doing the achy-breaky heart back down quiet D 3 million I bet that must have fucking freaked him out man thank you yes he was back then for that brief moment in time dude don't you think it's weird or now Mouse to be famous like then you could get away with things and now it's a nightmare yeah that's true do you remember the Bill Hicks bit Bill Hicks had a joke about Billy Ray Cyrus what he says I was terrible he was so mean he was saying that uh this is my last show I'm not doing stand-up anymore because I got a TV show he goes thank you ladies and gentlemen I mean I worked hard forever and now we're gonna do a new television show it's called let's hunt and kill Billy Ray sighs all right wait let's chase him down forget what he but he said like grab him by his faggy ponytail he said-she Wow it's intense it was ruthless it was ruthless because Billy Ray you only had that one hit right you didn't have my monkey kids maybe I was going shit one or two other songs that were kind of popular but that song was Giganta it's interesting that his daughter so big she's so talented man you're first that song Malibu does she so good so good yeah can't tell people like it though they get mad at you like like get them out of you when you wearing those shoes I don't give a fuck dude wrecking ball for Miley Cyrus acoustic suck this taste I'll listen that in were these shoes the best thing she ever did to me like when I rip well the most impactful so the first time I realized she could really sing was that song Jolene Oh My yes Christ monster aah damn like this so fucking pop you watch American Idol at all what do I look like a girl you don't want any American Idol talking about Malibu bro yeah I thought we were brought out of the music in now watch the American I'll do the feminist like dude as they did at the Grammys this year but the American I hold it together yeah that kids awesome yeah you watch American Idol you fuckin I let you do you have the timely Sun Sunday nights the other time for Sunday night my night off bro a night he's playing quake with us yeah oh yeah have a little lamb party least they're real you know real people singing it's your balls deep in Game of Thrones to drag and thrill now I love it as well true I'm just saying at least American Idol other people are pursuing them yeah and they can sing yeah a whole new world I don't hate on the show I'm happy it exists I just so many so many hours in day son it's all I'm saying I hear you you know but at night when you're chilling mmm not me I like to chill to fiction that's what my favorite shit is like what you like Game of Thrones type shit or like mrs. Mazal or any show that I'm Park it needs stranger things any sure they're really into that's what I like to chill with I like to follow like a slow line for years it's weird yeah I'm with you when I get soup like I'm super into Game of Thrones like I watched all the old seasons leading up to this yeah that's dope dude that's just it's just like a fun little escape where he just locked into that and to me I you know Paul Mooney said to me once a long time ago he goes if you really want to right he goes go get entertained first mmm and I said like how what do you look what do you do he goes whenever you go see some music he goes go to the movies he goes go be entertained you're entertained and then you're gonna want to write oh wow yeah that was great advice that I never heard anybody say before but it made sense so go get entertained and you like it'll fire you up and then just take take that fire and then just are creating inspires you yeah so it's a great piece of advice for for young people because I know there's been many times where I've seen someone like murder at the store well I couldn't wait to get home and write I just couldn't wait to you know I just wanted to run home and bust out that fucking laptop and come on what are we got in here what do we got in that brain come on there's something in there do you listen to music when you drive sometimes depends on if I'm on my way to the gig if I'm on my way to the gig almost always try to listen to last night's set or whatever new shit that I'm working on to go over it just not not just to go over but to examine it see if there's any way that I want to stop and rewind and maybe slow it down or speed it up or do it different if I don't take those extra like say if I do four sets a week but I listen to three sets a week that's seven sets instead of four sets I think that's that's a difference like a rep thing but it's uncomfortable if you don't want to do it or it's annoying but I think it counts almost as much as doing a set it's not as much because doing a set what happens is you get that spontaneity and you get the flow when you get the instinct the feeling when it hit the punchline in the car is the mental rope it's a mental repet it's also like a third party examiner like it's almost like you could watch it from the outside you can watch it as someone walking so be second party you'd watch it as someone watching you and you go huh I don't like this is clunky why you saying this like this if you could just do that and say it like yourself and say it like yourself but then listen like you would listen to it too yeah what it's a phantom yeah yeah listen as the person who's also you know you do it you practice it so you know where the or the but sometimes you get caught up in doing something a certain way and it's hard to break out of the pattern of doing that bit to try to find a better way yeah it's like you you're cuffed boldly got to get into this bit how do I get into it then you'll stumble into this one way and then you keep doing it that way when really the right way to do it is to kind of break it down and rebuild it yeah like you know where the funny parts are break it down and I've done that a few times in broken bits where they never worked again sometimes it just they don't bounce back you know yeah you freaking a thighs house man yeah you did it give me fucking you did that cuz you're getting ready for your 4/20 show yeah yeah yeah that's the biggest crowd you've ever done yeah no Air Canada Centre was bigger air can ahem that's the Scotiabank arena fuck in Toronto and that is is that where that's where the UFC is that's right yeah it's the Scotiabank arena now it used to be there cancer and how many was that joint that's like 13,000 were you on a stage a Kevin Hart stage no no no some like a regular stage is San Diego circa yes and you know sir can I find it awkward man watching and I find it awkward it's gonna kill it but it's gonna find it awkward yeah I'm excited I think Joey Diaz doing 420 in Milwaukee is the best can't get enough of that dude so happy Joey so happy he's around hmm he's one of the most you know what he's doing right now right I don't think I can see it on it don't say it then oh yeah I dunno I don't think you say it no I don't think he's announced it it's amazing yeah yeah yeah I can't say that can't say that but you know yeah yeah so cool he's the one of the most important figures in the stand-up world today in my opinion he's one of the the most free guys like in terms of like you if you look at if there was a style of say the style of jujitsu right where one guys just always catching triangles on people super aggressive and always catching triangles like how is this guy always catching and it sort of changes your perception of how often someone can catch someone in a triangle Joey's so fucking loose he changes your perception of what's loose like he he moves the needle yeah there's rats rare I think bill burr does that too moves the needle to like with with bill and maybe it's because I'm around Brian and Brian's always like you know you gotta be careful if you say this stuff especially in the culture society right now yeah be careful with this I'm like yeah maybe so I've started like almost reserved and then burr went up at the Laugh Factory like oh shit you can do that yeah he's on fire right now he just filmed he just filmed some special did he really yeah yeah yeah he's kind of come out with a oh I should say anything a while ago though right cuz this did announce all new it well I don't know if I'm supposed to be saying this did I give something away I don't know I don't know if that's been announced so I'm gonna shut my mouth by there anyway either way murderer murderer yeah and like you know bass no fuck skip it all time no fucks given at all yeah yeah he's um he's uniquely free like he was making the comics in the back like and we're just watching like what he makes fuck hilarious points to they're so bold but that's what you so bold that's how he started yeah he's just sticking with his guns that's what he is that's who he is who he is I think I see a lot of guys now to get away from that cuz they're afraid of offending people and then Burgett something's like shut the fuck up well people are taking comedy as much more of a statement than like if you wrote a movie where some fucked up things happen like if you were older and that's probably coming too if they let people take comedy they'll probably go after that next they which would it kind of falls in line with what what could be next but if you decide that someone's saying something that they actually mean that and they shouldn't be able to say that even though it's funny and it made people laugh it's the guys clearly joking which is that it has been especially when you try to use it in print you're it's a slippery slope it's a slow but greased hill because then wire why is Quentin Tarantino allowed to write a movie where a bunch of people get killed why is he allowed to write a movie that might incite violence why is he allowed to write a movie where people use racial slurs and shoot people over nothing why is you're allowed to read to write that movie yeah oh it's all Quentin Teno so he's responsible for this whole movie fuck that we got a boycott him and that that kind of nonsense is an episode of fucking South Pole County went on in this world I don't think it I think it's swaying back the other way it could sway back the other way but you got to realize we could take a little break and then have it come back hard again maybe or this guy or the guys like louis c.k who's selling out everywhere and doing great comedy like he can't he could sell out fucking staple center right now multiple times in a row what's crazy is he doesn't want to doesn't want it it's just doing comedy clubs just working yeah he could easily come back like Tiger Woods easily right now he said something so fucked up too because they asked me why I did it he goes I like to jerk off and I don't want to be alone I like to jerk off and I don't like to be alone like and then you know he's great man yeah I mean he else he did some creepy shit definitely did did some creepy shit I move of it but he didn't molest anyone I don't think we know exactly what happened either no but I do know is he could sell out Staples Center yeah because I think most guys and fans go all right man the other thing that is really good at comedy yeah that's the other thing that we always have to think about whenever we talk about anything is that we're dudes and so when you're talking about someone jerking off in front of you just imagine a woman jerking off around of us no you can't because that's not the same cuz it would it the only reason why a girl could jerk off in front of you and it's hilarious it's cuz she can't rape you see if the guy is jerking off in front of you most guys are bigger and stronger than most women obviously there's some variables there but most guys are bigger and stronger and Men make all the rape and webinars out they're raping dudes right it's all men so if a guy has his dick out and he's jerking off the scary shit that's why it's scary it's Nair it's the creepy yeah if a girl if you go over a girl's house and for whatever reason she goes I want you to watch this sit down and fucking fucking fuck she starts to finger yourself fucking I know I whoa yeah but you will laugh you would laugh and you would come back to here and would talk about it because I know I could get out of it right we'd be crying laughing but it wouldn't be like you were in danger but if a guy is with say if you have a daughter and your daughter weighs 110 pounds different animal and she's with a guy in front of her yeah and he has to do it and she says yes cuz she's scared then it's like would what would actually happen and see he hasn't really said anything other than the stories are true and you know this come from a guy that sounds like you know that because you have two daughters yeah so you have to think like that well you have to think like that as a human being right yeah but I'm saying to you it's probably the first thing you think of cuz you have two daughters right but I don't think that's what he did I think from I can't say too much because I don't know but I think he did some regrettable things and I think he would admit that but I don't think he did what a lot of people are claiming he did in terms of that's what I've heard how often he did it or who he did or what the circumstances were but it was either way there's no defending when it was bad no it's not good there's no difference it's a terrible thing to do but what's the punishment for that you know did he not pay for it he lost all his jobs lost all his TV deals thirty five million dollars in a year of work and people still were say no but he's still he's fine I've heard that argument that he's fine like what these are also these are also things that he did like more than a decade ago right what when do you offer someone compassion like when do you when do you let some explain themselves when do you when is enough is enough or should he have to do something like what would people like someone to do well I think they're mad because some I guess there's only a year and then he's back and killing it because she's so good at comedy because like with Tiger Woods right people hated Tiger but there was that but there was also the material that got leaked when he came back so people are upset at the jokes and joke yeah it's that shit falls in line with how he's always done jokes though that's always always whether he did this or not he says the fucked up thing to say it's part of what makes him really funny he does that in real life too it's not it's a style of comedy man I mean it's just like a Quentin Tarantino has a style of making movies his style of comedy is to say fucked up things so that compounded the fact that people are upset at him that a year ago you know he just said he was going to take some time off it's um I don't you know I think it's really important to know that I don't know what happened in in you know he knows and they know and it's it's never good when someone's upset the II jerked off in front of them it's not a good time but also him losing thirty five million dollars in only being out a year I think people are upset that it was such a quick turnaround like it would TJ it's not a quick turnaround man I mean not as a comic but for to the normal person like a year that ain't shit dude mmm-hmm but as a comic not to be able to let's let's imagine that he's gonna live another 50 years right a year a year out of 50 it's like 2 percent right yeah so what it's a lot you know a lot of money yeah but now now compare this to TJ Dillashaw 2 years 2 years of he's 31 yeah 135 ER not a lot of fights left no two years is almost the death sentence it might be is that fair it's good question I mean the real question is would he have even been able to pursue that weight class like what you were saying in terms yeah like having the advantage of the EP oh yeah wonder if he would have been able to pursue training what are the same way in hindsight what a terrible idea right you know I don't know what the thought process was but it's definitely definitely not good and it doesn't take away from how talented and skillful he is as a fighter and if that's the only time he did it it's kind of understandable given what we were saying yeah yeah if that's the only time but I think honestly all bullshit aside I think you are right as far as don't test anybody else don't don't go back and test everybody know unless you want to spend a lot of money that one of the things they were saying they'd like to test everyone for EPO it cost an additional two and a half million dollars a year something ridiculous like that I might have made stop doing that divide that money amongst the fighters how often you test don't care to give the fighters more like what stomping and Kelvin did and max Holloway and Dustin Poirier they should be set for quite some time but here's the thing if we look over the history and really are only testing pool would be Conor McGregor who never has to fight again Nate Diaz I guess you could throw into that who they make life-changing money they don't fight a lot do they no and here's the question because if you give I'm sorry I don't mean all right let's say you know if you have certain fighters 20 million dollars like you want me to do what now and they don't fight right so if you're Dana you're like listen look at Connelly getting ideas when they get this boatload of money we can't get them to fight there's power the sports too hard right they won't do it hmm that's interesting I know so to keep to keep them hungry we gotta tame this but that's so fucked up so if I'm gonna say it's the right thing to do but I'm saying if you're Dan from his standpoint like really they don't that way I think they really think that way I don't think that's the case you know I think it's a side effect of making boatloads of money but I think they try to make boatloads of money because it doesn't happen very often it only happens with a Ronda Rousey or Conor McGregor or some gigantic huge star like a Nate Diaz if you have to be a gigantic site yeah but that's that's rare there's so few of those guys there's so few those the idea that you would try to pay people less because you want to keep them hungry because if they become giant superstars and they're not hungry then they stop fighting then we're not paying more so what you're saying is pretend you're not they're not giant superstars even when they are no superstars still get paid but they also have crazy demands they do they want to fight who they want to fight they want to do it when they want to do it you know there's all sorts of jockeying going on back and forth I mean I don't know what happened with Nate Diaz and Dustin Poirier but they were supposed to fight this fight that injured but so Nate was scheduled for a fight and he's never pulled out of a fight that he's been scheduled for as far as I can remember no he was gonna fight that fight and then went there happened that made a lot of their offers you just like I'm good right but let's imagine that if Dustin Poirier did not pull out of that fight what if he did fight Nate Diaz and what if Nate Diaz beat him the Nate Diaz could very well have fought max Holloway made Saturday night yes maybe maybe yeah if you paid him enough it might maybe I'm sure he laid they might have decided to make that shit happen you know and you know what I bet it would have been that was it that was the face to face off I bet that would have been a very entertaining fight too oh my god oh my god that's an eightieth bullsh I'm insane kardea insane volume striking that would be an incredible fight man fuck that would be a great fucking fight there'll be a great fight yeah max in Nate it would have been insane but max was gonna fight Dustin Poirier and you know he could be looked I hope you a big fight Dustin Poirier if he doesn't fight khabib if for whatever reason they decide to go with Nate over khabib they're not they're gonna do khabib next yeah in September well maybe could be fights the winner or the winner rather fights Nate that could be possible too if he really still weren't Tony Ferguson named Tony Ferguson yeah god damn engage he's still in the mix I mean kg he's deep in the mix that's boza he's so excited for now he's right there how can you deny that I mean what a fucking division man amazing what a fucking division it's crazy how about that dude in one Fc that knocked out Alvarez I know nasty yukkin what a crazy name too how about a mouse though in the wind yeah so waiting for sage Northcutt to fight um yeah no she's not fight - he's fighting Cosmo I exam his to fight dude cosmos no Punk that dudes a nasty Muay Thai fighter I got these John Wayne par he's really really good yeah he's built like an Adonis - that's gonna be a best bod contest between those two all body yeah this first team first team both dangerous fight for sage Northcutt while they're standing if he can't take it to the ground means stage is a very good striker and it's very fast but cosmic world-class see something special he's some special nasty nasty boy Timon monster yeah big guy too you know he's jacked his thick sage is such a nice kid mm-hmm could be nicer couldn't be nicer somebody it's almost fake did you sweetie surprise that the UFC let him go uh no I'm not surprised by anything you see does not surprise they don't need anyone I thought they were grooming him me too and put a lot of marking behind him there like that fuck it we're gonna SPN we're good so what do you think the future is gonna be like do you think there's gonna be that this is gonna be how it is for most sports they're gonna be watching on apps you think they'll ever have that for like the NFL 100% they just yeah yeah yeah like the last two years a Thursday night games have been on at least last year was on Amazon Prime they were on Twitter to twitch for a little while they're on Twitter last year so they're doing all sorts of stuff the NBA has talked about moving towards being maybe on Twitch they've even talked about shortening their season they're doing different stuff it is not a big conference about that so they made the smart move yeah it's a smart move they're smart because they're getting out way ahead that's what it is I feel like once everyone's TVs hooked up to the internet because right now it's not everyone no you know it's a lot of people but it's not everybody it's gonna be everybody for sure dude I get a roll you get to my kid on 6:00 p.m. I know man Brendan motherfucking Shawn I Love You Man come on I
