the gyro can experience ice-cream capture all the time all day there really should be sexual service industry there really should be you know the idea that that's illegal is so fucking gross you know I think it probably causes more rape it causes more anger if branch disease yeah I don't want my daughter to be a prostitute of course but if prostitution was legal people are gonna do it and guess what some people are gonna actually like to do it and some people gonna enjoy going there and some people they're just crazy bitches and they really wouldn't do anything else anyway and what are you gonna fix the whole world you're gonna fix the whole world are you gonna let them get tested and get taxed and let them be treated like they're not some outlaw you know it's not and it's it's an outlaw thing you know it's if you're a prostitute you're a criminal if you're giving away sex for free you're just a whore but if you're actually getting money for it you go to jail they lock you in a cage and the idea that we still have that a 2011 regardless of what your beliefs are about sex whether you should or shouldn't go to a prostitute I agree that's kind of a weird thing so dehumanizing the whole conditions it's a very strange but fucking for short should be legal you just can't lock people in a jail you want people in a cage for making someone feel good with their mouth what the fuck is wrong with you it's insanity it's absolute fucking insane fucking lunacy man it's complete insanity the fact that it's not challenged the fact that that's not challenged in 2011 like and the fact that Apple is not censoring it off of Siri when you're asking for a blowjob and they tell you what they look the closest escort agency is yeah did you know that this is what he did he asked it he this I go last night I bet I just sit there in bed to try new things you know and I'm saying there we go I need I want a blowjob and they're like we found for escort agencies closest to you it is like 27 miles away you know Steve Jobs is programs that will shit in there it's just waiting for someone to say the right thing I just hope they don't start censoring it though Apple's keep on going that way make it like the internet don't start censoring it that's fucking cool that you actually have that in there yeah open a time portal Siri he just put it in there knowing eventually someone see what is exactly going to happen December 21st 2012 cannot access future node yeah that's fucking cool man one thing that seems interesting it seems like that it's run off a server because it's been you know everyone's activating this Siri which is a remote assistant on the new iPhone 4s that's what we're talking about well you know what it's based on right uh that dragon or no no based on Wolfram Alpha which was that search engine that was created by all these phd's they wanted they literally wanted to put together the concept is a website that can answer any question so no matter what your question is you know Alan what is the weight of one pound of nuclear waste used it before I've used it for shit really yeah yeah awesome yes apparently that's what that's what what's behind all that's really cool it's amazing yeah when you ask for a dead body it goes a sewer an old warehouse a junkyard no yeah I said where to put a dead body yeah yeah you didn't make that I thought you this is a fake no no no no no I've been laying in bed using it just like fucking making up holy shit I never have a device if you ever gadget and want to learn everything about it I just bought Brian one too I say where we at now he's like dude this is what I just found out and he'll find shit on it that you would never figure out your fucking gnome yeah well he's just a gadget whore I need to figure it out you with them well and I think it's run off a server like I think like that they're gonna be able to constantly upgrade it as time goes on and I'm just worried now that with all the attention to all the of course the x-rated stuff that they're gonna start censoring it when and I hope they don't really start doing that and but but it is cool to think like what Syrian five years is going to be just like when we first saw the iPhone one to see how it's changed the technology from then it's going to be pretty much like most relationships without sex it's gonna be better than that you know it's it's it's going to be anything you want to talk about any questions you have to ask and you're going it's going to learn it's gonna get to know you it's you know it's pretty much going to be like a artificial intelligence I think what do you matter most relationships about sex because what else is that you're sitting there talking to some computer oh you mean most of them yes Oh like most like a relationship without sex yeah but you know what you won't feel the same that's if you know that the robot is there for you because it's artificial you're gonna abuse it it's not like a person that you love to have around I think most people would probably just beat the fuck out of their robots but I knew that robot wasn't a person but was always going to like look out for them and be there for them and you would find that robot annoying and you would kick his ass because you know he couldn't fight back his leg dude right but if it gets to know you better and me I'm already late man robot no but if it gets to know what your answers would be in your personality better cuz I'm already interested in it and it's just not even smart right right right but what if it starts to get to know you and now you're so interested in it like crack are you asking what if you fall in love with your phone.i yeah if she has things I even asked it to sing the other day and I started singing me a song I mean it's pretty much it's it has it's fascinating like I wanted to addicted to it I'm addicted what if Brian just got a cursed iPhone it's not serious
