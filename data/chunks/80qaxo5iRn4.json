a lot of this shit's in your head man let it go and if you do let it go go to my website and then the code name Rogan and you get 15% off when you click on the link for the flashlight oh there you go we are also sponsored by on it oh and and I t.com the makers of alpha brain a cognitive enhancing supplement and new mood a 5htp supplement that actually boosts your mood you know it's a funny thing about this new mood stuff but people who are on antidepressants their doctors are telling them not to take 5-htp because they say it's like taking two antidepressants which is really fascinating to me because that means that this natural vitamin is actually an antidepressant I don't know enough to comment on it maybe Bruce Lipton can help us out once we get this podcast absolutely rolling we're also the makers of shroom tech which is a cordyceps mushroom endurance supplement which is wicked if you work out hard if you don't want work out really hard don't bother with this but if you're someone who does anything like really difficult but in you know football you know wrestling or jiu-jitsu or something like really strenuous like mrs. Rogan likes it she's into cycling you know if you get on this stuff it it really does give you like a nice little endurance boost you feel it's good stuff yeah I don't appreciate it you based on science I don't I don't know that nothing right there's no reason for me to take nobody that shit at all now you're completely sedentary now I'm good at lasagne tech you're very happy being sedentary though a lot of people would say they're like this kids in denial and he really wants to know you're fucking fine with it right there's that the less activity I have to do the better yeah a turtle you are well that's why I chose was so wrong that's right you know I heard something I don't know if it's true but that every animal essentially from the moment is born to the moment dies of old age has the same amount of heartbeats like you or very similar at least you know and so like you have a certain amount of heartbeats right and if you like no professional athlete has ever lived to be more than 100 Gennari yeah Pete yeah you'll burn your body out you're going nutty meanwhile you'll be around to the fucking Martians come back you people and cold weather live longer that's a good question I don't know I don't know cold weather like make your heart beat slower because you're really I would think that you use some way too many resources and cold weather to choice alive oh yeah you shivered yeah wait my talk and ask you're going nothing anyway so trim textile for you Brian but you can benefit from new mood and from alpha brain and no this ain't like it's not like something from the movie limitless is that what it was yeah it's not going to make you smarter if you're stupid but it does make you know like a lot of different substances - they're called nootropics and they actually can give you like a little bit of a mental boost research it and as I always say if you're interested in this stuff and you think what we sell is too expensive go online and steal the recipe steal the recipe and go buy your stuff in bulk and save some money and if you like it I hope see I hope you do I hope it helps you you don't have to buy our stuff but if you want to buy our stuff go to Joe Rogan neck click on the link and turn the code named Rogan get 10% off all right freaks god glad we got that out of the way who slips into the Bruce Lipton yeah excuse me Furion who's Lipton is in the house hit the wittman you doing man please do you know what job this shows a stray dog the serious man here can you get our shit together we slipped in the author of the biology of belief and we're going to learn some shit today freaks because I talked to Bruce Lipton for about 30 seconds before this podcast started and I already was like too anxious to get the commercials out of the way because I this is a fascinating fascinating subject to me and you are a guy who actually has like letters next to your name so like people are going to listen to you it says PhD this guy knows the fuck he's talking about right it's not like when I write a book the biology believe Joe Joe Rogan comedian Fear Factor hoes nobody's going to give a fuck alright what you you sir you command respect with your ideas I tell you I am the happiest guy ever because all this stuff was new to me I never believed in it when I was doing my research so to find out things like like the concept of a spirit and an energy in a and how the mind controls life when I was teaching genes control life and it was like boy is that an error boy is that wrong out so consciousness you believe controls life no I believe consciousness actually does control life and it's very simple to understand it and what you really start to find out is that our consciousness either enhances us like a placebo effect or the same consciousness can take away your strength and kill you what which is called a nocebo effect it's actually a name for that so it's the power of your thinking and the thinking is who are we and and we can program the belief that we're frail and vulnerable you know like all kinds of things are out there to get us and and we have to protect ourselves and all that and it's like this is a totally insane because we're so powerful that we even don't believe it it's just just amazing things like okay you can say something simple like walking across hot coals okay it's like you can walk across hot coals if you believe you can do it but you can't do it if you don't believe you can't walk across the coals and so belief comes into it or Joey I mean you're a big health guy and all the stuff so I asked it and if we go out here in the parking lot can you lift up a car yeah I mean you got a lot of training and stuff like that but you think you could lift up a car no well interesting I had so many articles from around the world about women lifting up cars when a when a baby or their child is trapped under the car this is all true because I have you stories too but I never really google them but no no they're absolutely truven there's large numbers of them and what does that mean it means like this untrained unathletic woman could go out there and lift up the car okay and so that's like that's pretty neat but here's what I really think it's cool down south there's this Baptist fundamentalist kind of people that get into in a religious ecstasy state and they do what they call testify that God protects them so they believe that God protects them and so what do they do they do strange crap like that they handle snakes like rattlesnakes and copperheads snakes Oh snake handlers so they get bitten by the snakes nothing happens when they're in this and the state of belief but that's those are the lightweights the the serious ones are the ones they drink strychnine in toxic doses to demonstrate to show the proof that God protects them they drink this absolute poison no harmful effects Wow no harmful effects Brian it's it's the most I mean they're insane looking people when they do it but the fact is they drink poison but it's in the belief system and why so this is all stuff that's been documented right yeah we should your initial background as a scientist what did you I trained as a cell biologist and I started doing cell cultures back on stem cells in 1967 that's like that's so long ago as 40 this some years ago right and the thing was there was just a handful of us an entire world working on stem cells at that time and the results from those studies were so completely different than what I was teaching medical students about how life worked about how genes control life because it showed that genes did not control the biology genes do not control it the control is how a cell or an organism responds to the environment and so it's a an organism becomes a complement to their environment and you say well why is that important well if you live in a crappy environment than your biology becomes crap and the issue is is that the real environment it's actually the mental environment so that's why it's so important and everyone sort of knows this but it's so important to surround yourself with positive people and not be around a bunch of energy Pires because there's people that are caught in a downward spiral and if you are with them their gravity can bring you into a shitty place that's an absolute truth that's a quantum quantum physics aspect to who we are there's more than this physical reality and and and energy is actually who we are so the flow of energy determines how we are isn't it funny that that idea is so easily dismissed it's it seems like such a woowoo idea yes you you know you know why it's more scared of it it's money well it's also fear well it might be fear but I'll tell you more so is it's very simply the science that we have in the textbooks today is more or less a product of paid advertising from the pharmaceutical company and the significance why I mean that is the they ask you questions obviously are you aware there's much more effective ways to create energy besides burning fossil fuel I mean I'm not really aware of all the options that there are aren't there I mean I mean solar and all this other times but I mean I know about solar but I don't know if so necessarily generates enough energy to replace it right now well that lets our technology but the question is we have all this new technology and the question is why are we still so preoccupied with burning fossil fuel because it's not in the interest of the petroleum company to support anything that would take away the sale of their product they sell oil what good way and then I say now here's the exact parallel it's like you can heal yourself with energy you can heal yourself with thoughts you can heal yourself with with the right vibrational food and everything else surrounded by dealing with the vibration part so you say well we know this for thousand years why isn't it recognized by the world the answer it's not in the interest of an industry that sells drugs because if I can heal you for free then what are you going to do with the drug market do you think that's mean do you think they're suppressing it or do you think there's just never been any evidence demonstrated that I guess on any sort of a large measurable level where there's there's quite a bit of evidence but it's really evidence that's not talked about in the public and it's very difficult well I'm sure there is but what I mean is it's not like it's in their face and they're trying to suppress it you know I mean I think it's just I think a lot of people were just ignorant to the idea I don't know if it's being suppressed as much as just a lot of people really don't know how things work absolutely absolutely but then the limitation of what are we being programmed with you know what are the beliefs that you will police did you get programmed with about your life for very simple reason if you get down to the simple understanding how your mind controls your genetics and your biological behavior then you have to recognize them the question is what programs have you been programmed with because those are the programs are going to shape your life and the belief system is can you drink strychnine Joe yes or no the answer is well if you don't believe you can then don't it's only a good go there you know or if you have any doubts at all yeah belief like that is like pregnancy you either believe it or you don't believe it but there's no like Gees on I almost really believe this it's not going to work do you think it's fascinating that a lot of the people that are pushing that belief are actually they actually are caught up in it themselves you know the people that are suppressing information yes people that are you know they even if they're aware of it yes you know they're actually they're doing it to themselves as well it that's the that's why you can't say there's a conspiracy right level no the sin conspiracy self-interests yeah there's self-interest this is my interest this is my belief look there are a lot of religious people out there trying to shape my behavior today right right it's like that's their behavior well you know they're trying to shape my behavior with it sort of like the science people that tell their science are almost like religious people that say this is our story mm-hm and the fact is but there's a bigger story than what you saw in the book so is it just that it's not measurable I mean well no it's measurable like I show you hundreds of papers on all kinds of things about electromagnetic fields that vibrational fields can do control every function of the cell they can control the synthesis of DNA it can control the cell division it can control what we call differentiation where a like an embryonic cell becomes a muscle cell or bone cell it controls the organization of cells we their demonstrations of this all the time vibrational frequencies with exact frequencies cause cells to have very specific biological responses so if it was up to you would this be something that they would be teaching kids in school like on a regular basis to try to Blayne I'm so very early age how important it is to think in a positive way and absolutely in a positive way and surround yourself with positive people that it's not just a luxury that you are looking I just want to settle down and be around you know where it's quiet it's not that but it actually is like you can establish your environment you it comes down to a simple point we are creating this life that's in front of us at this moment this is a creation and this is a nature of what quantum mechanics look quantum mechanics came up with a very simple problem and said wait is the fundamental particle that makes an atom is it physical or is it vibrational is it a particle like like a piece of something or is it just a vibrational field and the answer came out because it can't be both when what once solid the other ones an energy wave right it's like and yet it comes out when they do the experiment if you think it's a particle and you design the experiment to see a particle you see a particle if you think it's a wave and design an experiment to determine a wave then you see it as a wave and the question well how can it be a wave and a particle there you can't be both at the same time the conclusion of the physicists and this is fundamental is that it's the observer that's determining that reality it's the way you look at it if you look at it like how far does that go does it go like the residents and you know ultimate acts we know how much listen we create it well this is a co participation so we're really we're creating but we're also participating in the creation so it's not a single event I maybe was a single event I say okay let's send all this the roar and crap and let's clean up this place let's have a good time my voice is a single voice obviously just didn't change anything right but if you get enough voices say the same thing then what you're doing is you're amplifying the field the more people that are in tune with the same voice it becomes a crowd response it's like even like in soccer games in Europe when they get crazy they always break out into these big fights and stuff like that a pacifist sitting in the middle of you know what are those vegan pacifist guys sitting in the middle if there's a fight that breaks out all around they'll be caught up in the energy a crowd response and it won't be their consciousness that's controlling them then now they're just caught in the field and they will pick up a chair and club somebody over the head with it like anybody else in that field even though at that moment when they were being conscious they were pacifist but once I got caught the feel that became part of the field so the issue is what field are we living in right now in the field is sin a state of flux and this is really critical because your audience is so involved with this upheaval that's happening right now changing the fields that there's an evolution going on and it really is going to be a fine subdivision between like the 40s and unders and people over 40 I think you're going to be a separation at some point except there are a lot of wonderful old people like myself old people do you think the internet is has anything to do with the age group that the Internet and that has everything to do with that the Internet is the nervous system of a new so a new organism with a what's evolving here's what's important sometimes we think oh when humans evolve with it oh how they're going to be involved they going to get bigger heads and you know change their bodies it's like no no look the human evolved that's done cockroach evolve the cockroach evolves 600 million years ago still the same cockroach the human evolved it's going to stay the same human the evolution is not of the human it's of the community of humans each human is the equivalent of a cell in the body of a super organism called humanity the evolution is the evolution many that's why the Arab Spring that's why the breakdown of politics all over the place that's why the thing is falling apart people all over the world are recognizing we're all people in the same thing called humanity and and so we have to break free of the limitations that we have been programmed with and in that breaking free which means changing the thoughts changing the beliefs getting into a new understanding we are on the threshold of an evolution that's so amazing and what's interesting is people look around right now they're scared to death and I'm going you understand this is the most important stage the simple reason is this the institutions that have provided for us up to this point that helped get us here they were important for a period of time economics education healthcare politics religion all those things were helpful to get to this to a certain point now they're destructive because their belief systems end up having us destroy the planet so this is a simple fact this is not what I'm just saying it is a fact science is recognized we are deep into the sixth mass extinction of life on this planet five times in the history of this planet life got essentially wiped out and started all over again those are called mass extinctions such as like a comet or asteroid hitting the planet destroying the environment wiping out life start all over again this is the sixth one this is a fact we are losing species of organisms faster than recorded history or unrecorded history as we know right now meaning we're accelerating the loss of the biosphere right now why is this important is because we're part of that extinction and now that here's the neat part about it the source of our extinction is human behavior simple as that we are so undermining the environment we we were created from the environment you know religious people will tell you oh oh they create an environment and they stuck humans on top genesis kind of story scientists will say oh it was just an accident of genetics mutations that were here and it's like no every organism was an integral part of the evolution of a larger con the biosphere is the living organism we're part of it well if we're part of the biosphere were derived from the biosphere then this is a simple logical question if you destroy the biosphere what the hell are your chances of surviving the answer's no and that's exactly what science has shown us that we are now have passed a very critical point and destroying the environment threatening our own survival I mean the simple fact that's scary if you think about it within 30 years there will be no fish in the ocean at the rate we're going right now it's like that's almost like science fiction story feelings crazy yeah so why is it important because the conclusion is human behavior is causing it and Einstein he had a great saying Einstein said you can't solve the problems with the same thinking that created the problems well the institutions that we are living by today are the cause of the problem so the crash of the institutions is a necessary step in the evolution because you can't build a sustainable world on those belief systems they're the they're the systems that are causing the destruction of the environment that we live in now do you ever consider the possibility that all behavior all life on this planet is is natural and that there's a reason why people are so selfish and so destructive and yet so also so ambitious and so prone to technological you know creations and and and and pushing pushing things forward it's almost like it's it's almost like that's what we're supposed to do it's a strange thing it's almost like to be as ambitious as people are to create for technological innovation is like there today there they're announcing that they may have spotted the Higgs boson park or bosun post and particle they may have spotted they don't know they have like evidence they have to go over I mean this is this is what right at the at the peak of human innovation it seems like it almost seems like we have to be this fucked up to do it this way you know and this is what we're driven to do do you is it possible that it says like every other animal has like a natural pattern of behavior is it possible that the human animals natural pattern of behavior is to almost like give birth to some technological creation okay there's two parts to that question the answer to technological innovation is indeed the evolution process itself think about this we have a tendency when we're humans to look down at everything less than human is not being as intelligent right right and then let me tell you you're made out of 50 trillion cells like amoebas 50 trillion amoebas living in a community they created a technology to make a human body they created Tecna gee we an artist it with the amoebas did they they created the structure for us the body was created by these cells okay we can't reproduce the technology of the cells because they're far greater efficient than we are matter of fact that would be our direction of evolutions is to see what they've done but why is this important because the technology is part of the evolution the idea of technology is simple can we live in the so-called and if you want to use the like a Garden of Eden that there was a garden here before we destroyed it and the fact is you know if you want to live in the garden without destroying the garden technology as a requirement because it reduces the footprint so we can live here without devastating the environment around us okay so that technology is a built-in Drive is the behavior that we're expressing during this part of that no behaviors programmed what you're talking about is a manifestation of Darwinian theory as a scientific fact which it isn't but but what's the basis theory says life is a struggle for survival with a competition for fitness and what does it mean is that every day you go out there and struggle to beat the other guy why because the cow this theory says if you don't struggle with the other guy they'll beat you so you have to beat them first and that's we've been playing that game for since Darwin right and that's the competition game that's the competition game in the garden was if you think about it a garden doesn't survive by competition a garden surprised by cooperation as a matter of fact that's what the evolution is all about cooperation in the biosphere we're the most uncooperative life-form in the garden isn't the argument to that that the competition is what breeds the innovation um well that's why you know I I said that I don't agree with it now Ireland I don't know I don't want to say yes to no but I will say this that there was a good reason for living this way to a certain point because it got us to a certain point right but continuing that process is where the problem comes from and you see that that is the the recognition of that is why the whole human race seems to be like putting the brakes right now on this conventional culture putting the brakes on this can decide it society that we've accepted up to this point it doesn't seem like people want to accept that anymore it seems like people are sane about yeah they're seeing that it's ridiculous and they're seeing that our leader aren't really leading us and seeing that everyone seems to be bought and paid off and everyone's hitting the brakes everyone's going stop stop this thing examine stop it stop it stop it yeah because it's time to build something that that takes into consideration not the the few that possess the power you see look we can talk about and I talked about the biology and the nature of the mind controlling the behavior in the biology of women lifting cars drinking strict on the powerful nature you are do we know what actually physically does it mean is it adrenaline with it what is the actual physical thing that happens to their body that allows them to do amazing it's exactly the same thing that the strychnine drinker has absolute belief that there's no what Mike child is under this car there's not even a concept though can I lift the car she never asks that in her head it was I'm lifting the car because my baby is under the car right it's absolute belief it's the same as walking across the hot coals the drinking of strychnine lifting the car the things you have that absolute belief in you you can do powerful things beyond anything except that's what I said go back and look at our programming our programming is we've been programmed to perceive ourselves as frail and vulnerable in fact is we're farthest thing from that except for this and this is an interesting story about the upheaval and that goes like this you look at the world and say look am i powerful maybe ok I'm not so powerful why there's some very powerful people over there and then you may say well how did they get to be so powerful this is the joke and it's on us they didn't get more powerful they just took away the power from us we've been programmed to be disempowered and the fact is that's what you think this has been a conscious thing it's been propagated look but D I'll give here's a fact think about it this way the Jesuits have boasted for 500 years they said give me a child until it's 6 or 7 and it will belong to the church for the rest of their lives what did they know they already knew that if I get the first 6 years of programming I own your life they knew that they boasted about it and why is that important well it's you think that's a minor thing that just would have slipped away in history that you can control the population by programming the first six years of their lives think is kidding me that's that's fundamental to the leadership of the whoever's in leadership capacity and and if you want a reference think about this there's a book Rich Dad Poor Dad and this is a book about power empowerment and disempowerment and what's the point people from poor families will grow up and remain poor and people from rich families will generally grow up and remain rich is it genetics no it's the programming that the rich give to their family which is completely the opposite of the programming the poor give to their family it's not the individual it's not the person it's the programming and and this is not new this is 500 years of boasting that fact not much I mean they keep it a secret they actually said you just give me the kid for six years belongs to the church for the rest of its life they knew it's kind of like this whole this whole theory and I'm sorry I mean the rub you real quick is really fucking loud in that other room and it's picking up on this mic okay thank you master that's I mean it sounds fine but you don't hear it isn't it distracting no okay it's distracting me turn down your headphone so your headphones are really loud but don't the whole taya follow the string the whole thing with it kind of follows the fish in the fish tank or like how big is the fish tank of how how big the fish is going to grow almost it's like kind of the same thing you know like like in some ways like the fish nose is an environment so it's going to grow I mean does it have anything to do with that at all well it's basically they know their world and they read their world and we're having problems recognizing our own world we've been programmed not to be sensitive to the experience that's why indigenous people the Indians the Aborigines all these people man they can tell you what the water is even if you can't see it's under the ground they they can tell you what's going on in their world around them we are so disconnected we have no idea but how did this happen do you think that this is a natural occurrence is you think that this was that this all happened because this is the way we would be so innovative this is the way we would push forward push forward regardless of the health and safety of each other and of the planet itself yeah it's an unfortunate situation because you have to go back and say when did when did this group of individuals which isn't a large group at that decided at one point they were helping us as parents I'm helping you guys on I know more than you so I'm going to I'm going to help you become better okay but there is a point where maybe their knowledge is not is so limited that they're thinking inside the box when the knowledge is outside the box so the question is is it a conspiracy because they want to control us or is a conspiracy not as such but like a parent saying look the people don't know what the hell they're doing we got to help them we got a guy damn and all that it's a toss up was this conspiracy or helping I have no you know all I did is this they're involved what either either of those two reasons they are the problem that we have right now because they're thinking is not up to the current awareness of science and you say but why is that relevant an answer simple it's like the world we live in sees truth based on whether science says it's true or not this is true all science up so yes I'm true well if the science is limited then the knowledge is power lack of knowledge lack of power if the science is not fully knowledgeable and limits it to that little narrow knowledge then we've limited our power and the fact is there's new science that undermines all this stuff that you learned in school all this stuff I taught in medical school that science is in the last 15 years man is it's a revolution and the revolution is the rebels in the front the the the old guard is still in the back were the old textbooks with outdated information it's totally outdated does it become an ego issue at that point with people are teaching one thing for their whole life and then they don't want to change I don't know if it's it's a habit it's a habit this is way I know it's the only way I know it I mean look there was a time before quantum physics the only physicists were the the Newtonian physicist the ones that only saw the mechanical material world as real and didn't consider the invisible realm as anything quantum physics comes in and says it's the invisible realm that is actually shaping the physical realm energy shapes matter and it's like well if you're a Newtonian physicists up until let's say 1924 and 1925 the the belief change is 1924 you're teaching the world is a mechanical machine you've done this for 30 years and then all of a sudden a few minutes later you say no guess what all that's wrong it's all completely different and it's like you you've spent your whole career doing this what are you going to change tonight it's not going to happen so what do those guys do they just put the pants and everything they squash it down they keep it repressed and it's interesting because that's so disgusting well it's it there's a statement that isn't it really no but there's a statement that the answers either says progress in science is measured tombstone by tombstone Wow meaning yeah but for that I before you can get the new thought amazing it's just the ego right absolutely and the money no the money - money is big the money or the money is big the health care costs the united states are sinking the entire country just on the bills of that alone and that's totally inhumane it's inhumane by by definition it is and it's a business entity and medicine is a business entity it is not a healing entity if you got healed the whole business would collapse so guess what how come with all the money and all the technological advances we're spending more money now than we've ever done having more healthcare than we ever had and we have the sickest population we ever had this is the sickest population we've ever had yeah yeah the population the numbers issued just as too many of us is that what it is no it's just that we have been we misunderstand how our lives work we think we're really like machines and you go to the pharmacy guy and it puts a medicine in there and all of a sudden you got some new parts and you it's like no you there's there is a part like aspect of your body your body's like a vehicle for sure but the mind is the driver so the drivers been left out of medicine all I talk about is all the vehicles broken is you know keep fixing the vehicles like there's a driver in there if the drivers got some shitty driver education man he's going to destroy the vehicle the answer that's where the problem came from so is what we're experiencing really a step in the evolution of what we're going to become and so this all this this these problems and all this is rebellion against the the standard behavior that we've you know fed into for so long is all of this like a step in a resolution to some one of the most important steps in the world for simple reason if the institutions that we are living by now have created the problem then there's a simple understanding you cannot build a sustainable future on those institutions so you think this is a consciousness step as I would absolutely it's a people waking up to who they are as people stop being the the blind sheep that are being led to the slaughter every day by those people who know who they are the fact is if I program you to be weak and ineffective I program you you know here's interesting fact being black in this country is a totally negative aspect they took black students and let's run play basketball all of this and they shoe about that too but and that's part and that's part of the problem that's a trade-off when when you grow up in a threatening environment the fetus will develop bigger arms and legs and a much better hind brain because this is was necessary for defense Wow and if you grow up in a very loving environment then the end right I was into the four cup of jelly man what no I agree with that hundred they're always trying to reach for their dreams you know so they have longer arms I like it uh Michael Irvin actually told me this I was on a plane with him once and he was explaining to me you know he does a lot of you know he's a famous football player does a lot of work with kids you know that uh you know grow up and have like a lot of anger issues and he sort of explained to me that when you're a baby and you're grown up inside of a woman's body you know you're developing in a horrible environment with this you know no father and it's violence and it's you know crime and all this the the fetus will like become like programmed to act quicker to be more violent to me yeah literally yeah that's exactly what the disorder is try to stick them in a fuckin cubicle that that's I think this whole thing is so screwed that way because then we propagate that and we say look look well okay look blacks are great athletes I said yeah look where they come from they all come from you know essentially an environment that is totally not supportive which means biologically they have to acquire the ability to fight to survive so their bodies are designed much healthier in that regard that's pretty crazy when you think about it it's like nature the suppressing of the you know the black man has made the black man stronger than a suppressor well it was a logical physiological sense yes Wow because you have to they have to struggle to stay alive so they're designed to be in struggle is it true that's shit that Jimmy the Greek got fired for when he said that black people have been bred you know as slaves the biggest ones they would breed with the other biggest ones is that why so many black people are big or do you believe that it's a stress and environmental stress and environment issue Wow holy stress an environment and and this is why we have to recognize biological organisms are designed to be a complement to their environment so really like boxing promoters they should go to like horrible neighborhoods and Scout Talent yeah well that's what the toughest kids in a block are aren't they right yeah so that's we're going to find them so yeah wow that's a fascinating statement it's fascinating to think that so much is controlled by environment and by thinking and by energy but we all know that we gravitate towards those things naturally you know you gravitate towards good times you gravitate towards people that make you feel good you know your your unconscious drive is to seek out harmony that your vibration so first of all we see ourselves as physical reality but physical reality is an illusion atoms or vibrational units there there is no physicality to it so your vibration and the significance is when you get other vibrations that are in harmony with you that's called constructive interference that means good vibes when you find your pull itself with other people that have the same vibration as you your energy gets enhanced it's good vibes if you find yourself in a threatening environment the energy gets cancelled and that's why you feel all of a sudden drained weak you feel very vulnerable and it's because you're an environment where the energy of the environment is not in harmony with who you are so organisms unconsciously will move too environments that strengthen their vibration they'll seek it out that so your that's why we're naturally designed to to seek out harmony in the world that's that's our intention if that's our intention then why do we do so much destructive shit because the there's conscious intention conscious mind and this is this is the big issue that we have to that people have to understand the mind has two parts there's a conscious part and a subconscious part the conscious part is you your personal identity it's creative it has your wishes and desires the subconscious part is like a record playback mechanism it learns experiences push the button plays experiences back ok so now I say well ok our personal drive is our conscious wish and desire and then I'm going to tell you a fact and this is a freaky fact science has shown that we only run our lives 5 percent of the time with our conscious mind our creative mind the mind with your wishes and what you want out of life 95% of our life comes from the subconscious automated programs that play when we don't even pay attention you know you can drive the car without paying attention it's an automatic program you can do your job without paying attention it's an automatic program so why is it important only 5% of our life comes from what we want 95 percent comes from the subconscious programs and then here's the catch as we mentioned earlier the first six years you are downloading behavior from your environment and those become your fundamental programs you watch your parents your family your community and this is what I said the church saw that they said give me the first six years whatever program I put in that six years will become the fundamental programs in the subconscious mind the operating system is that's the basic operating system and 95% of your life is going to play from that program so who are we whatever we've been programmed to be what do you want to be not necessarily the program but when you're trying to exercise your conscious mind like positive thinking conscious mind five percent of the time it's dealing with so much unconscious floating around it's thinking about the futures thinking about the past so what do you propose do you propose it may be like Oh standard of thinking be established or a way of thinking where you teach kids in school how to overcome like these subconscious thoughts and how to overcome look at it it is possible you can oh absolutely they can you can reprogram these if you couldn't this be a crappy world because I said well that just like James oh you're stuck with your programs your whole life sorry no I don't know you can change your programs and change your life virtually instantaneously but you have to know what you're trying to do it and that's the whole idea if nobody knows a that they're even behaving from their their unconscious program so they don't believe that they think oh oh I'm running my life with my intentions and my wishes it's like what they're thinking I say that's 5% but I in my lectures I give I say to people I said look I know some time in your life you had a very close friend you knew your friends behavior and you happen to know your friends parent and at some point you may have seen that your friend had some of the same behavior so you volunteer you go you know Bill you're just like your dad and the first guy you back away from is Bill he's going to go ballistic and say how can you compare me to my dad and I tell people that's so profound a story for what reason here it is everyone else can see that Bill behaves like is dad the only one who doesn't see it is Bill and and we're all bill huh meaning we play behaviors that don't even harmonize with our wishes and desires but when we play them we don't see them because they're automatic and unconscious and then we wonder why our life isn't going where we wanted to go and we didn't realize fundamentally we were the ones that were shooting ourselves in the foot in the first place and it's because we didn't understand that the control can be controlled by the conscious mind but when the conscious mind is thinking about stuff then the default is the subconscious but the subconscious programmed by other people do you think that people are starting to realize this because you know if you think about it like on Twitter you'll see people even like dumb people say something you know today just going to be all smiles and like hashtag positivity you know you know it's like there's you know that wouldn't have happened in 1930 no guy would have left his house with you know one of those little fucking knit caps on and shit okay this way though it said positivity yeah they didn't think about Franklin Roosevelt used to read the Sunday comics to the to the on the radio to the country in the depression on Sunday read in the comics like come on man it's time to take a break and laugh and stuff like that so he was he was a guy that he had the answer way back then he said this was his motto or statement the only thing we have to fear is fear itself what did he know he knew that it was the fear that will immobilize you not the thing you even were thinking about just having the fear of something immobilizes you if people have so much control of thoughts and ideas and consciousness has so much control what is the what's the cause of things like the Great Depression what's the cause of these giant hiccups in the historical process where something terrible happens like the Holocaust or yeah you know something along those lines like what is it is it just is it like push and pull I mean is that that is it a natural process of evil and good constantly battling it out so that good does evolve I so forces fear did not sin either knowledge that that that easy to say I have I can't say that for sure but I could tell you this every one of them by by definition is a learning experience for the organism called humanity it wasn't not for the individual man I mean it's like you're in the Holocaust you know I don't want to participate in that play but that but what did the Holocaust teach civilization what what did these big upheavals and these things that are happening it's we're supposed to be learning now I mean that's what the whole concept of humans are we learn well the learning path if you see a pattern and you better start responding to this pattern well that we have learned a lot of lessons said we've come to the end of the way of living that way that's what we led to we were through a simple point you take tower winning in theory and you make politics out of Darwinian theory that's Nazi Germany that was Nazi Germany was science right to the line just said hey there's a master race and all the other ones that genes are no good get rid of them and were cleaning out the population according to Darwinian theory that was science politicized at that point and now it's a like I had to tell you but I think the pharmaceutical company is still got its roots back in that time period it's a manipulation of people the drugs are toxic I want this is a fact that is fun a fun fact fun fact the third leading cause of death in the United States as recognized by the American Medical Association is medicine itself at regenexx is what they give the latin term to it it is the third leading cause of death according to the medical industry they are the third leading cause of death but it was based on conservative estimates because of April and you see the medical industry yeah when you say the medical industry are you talking about pharmaceuticals or pharmaceuticals primarily a medicine does miracles I'm not only NOC medicine down because medicine does miracles man anything physical with the body mechanical they are miracle makers you want to transplant a heart you want to cut pieces fix them go to them right you want to deal with cancer Alzheimer's diabetes obesity depression they have no idea what the hell they're talking about because they know the mechanical biology which gives them the opportunity to work on the body as a vehicle cut out parts change parts but how do the parts necessarily work now there's some missing information because there's the new science undermines the existing belief system so that's why the failure of the system and it turns out that when you do the statistics medicine actually becomes the leading cause of death in the United States today and the pharmaceutical company is one of the major elements behind that that's amazing that's a fact of science you know it's even more creepy as cigarettes so here's a secret oh here's a secret instead of taking oil of olay smoke cigarettes just go to Toys R Us once a week and suck your thumb every night you'll sleep well I don't even know what you just said I have no idea what you just said what was that a Brian train right no no I mean like I've always you know it's so interesting to me because I've always thought that you know one of the secrets to life to the to to feeling looking young being young is to don't ever change what you're used to so that's why I still play with toys that's why it was too young well no no you just like I'm feel like I'm a little kid still I'm tricking my mind and my my health and everything into feeling like I'm a little kid I voices I'm just like pack of cigarettes a day what the fuck are you talking about but I go to Toys R Us once a week cigarettes huh absolutely it changed are you really talking about positive thinking about you sugar of course my body thinks I'm a kid lotta people about those cigarettes answer is it amazing but the fact is strategy is Travis neutral child I don't want to knock ensure that you get a lung cancer from cigarettes but does that that's the same strategy says that strychnine is not poisonous exactly yeah yes fucking cancer that didn't think they really cancer there's nothing cop smoking cigarettes hundred bad but I don't believe you believe it enough how about that oh yeah have you seen my apartment I've seen this office I don't even know what that means don't even know what that means you're smoking cigarettes stupid ridiculous they're candy cigarettes Joe oh I didn't know that singer that's awesome smoke is pixie dust right yeah it's amazing that it becomes such an issue he's lighting up stop talking about cigarettes dude don't like oh my god that's gross why you lighten up indoors man nasty motherfucker we stink you have it I'm gonna there's no an amazing is we're talking about positive thinking and beliefs and how you can structure the world and change it for the better this fuckhead lights up a cigarette just to prove a point Brian no it's because he that's who he is that's who he is I can't help it I just like the smoke effect in the studio oh yeah that's what you like just like when you see you look so you know when you used to say go to comedy clubs like you like Texas before they ban cigarettes used to always say down states how cool it was to go into I really like that I think that's that just to the whole like sitting around yeah but none of that podcast when you talk to a gentleman talking about positivity and you go and do the exact opposite of what he's selling you fuck you just became the problem Brian you are the problem you're the fucking whatever percent it is you know and you can't go ninety nine thousand one percent I know they can do that financially but when it comes to moron it's a much more complicated scale okay that's not just two groups man and people are probably of feat in both groups that's also an issue how do we fix this your your smart guy you obviously instead of knowing just knowing these things you must have some sort of an idea of how it can be absolutely how do we how do we implement a positive move forward the first thing that's happening right now that's really critical is Occupy Wall Street it's just saying look we're finished with this stuff and it ends when enough people say it ends that's basically what it's going to come to what do you see happening with this occupy wall shoot what are you in it's it's obviously all over the world downsizing was like you see one of those occupy maps and you see are literally all over the world people are protesting but where does this end I think this ends when when the institutions that exist start saying they're not able to handle the situation anymore and then we start looking for a new way of handling life I mean it was interesting with a governor one of the places said I have really a lot of trouble this Occupy Wall Street so because I can't find anybody to talk to that's in charge and we sort of like yeah because man is it this is a new way of life you're not going to have that old little game any yeah so all of a sudden the old guard will not be able to communicate with a new way of life and right and it's like the internet no one runs the internet there's not one person it runs the internet you know yeah you could have one person it has a show on NBC or a show on ABC you know you can have you can have someone who controls a network but once you're on an Internet it's just one thing just like moving would occupy wall streeters there's not one leader yes one giant cohesive thing all working together that's very fascinating that's what I said the this the technology of the internet was the final evolutionary stage required for civilization because it's the nervous system of a global civilization and once that was put into the cells started communicating with each other and once they started to do that then look what's unfolding in the world around us today once they the groups of cells from every part of the world started looking at the same dialogue in the same language for me it's exciting I travel all over the place I give lectures I what hit me was a few years back I was sitting in my living room in Santa Cruz and a video crew from Russia was there and they were setting up for the video and I was just sitting there looking and I thought if you didn't hear them speaking if you just had a video without the sound you wouldn't know where if they came from LA or where the hell they came from there all of a sudden start to realize all around the world people are beginning to to you know start to act as one community of people and it's real exciting because that is what the evolution is all about you can't have separate countries that say well look up well let's burn all this crap and put it in the air because it's going to blow over there and we don't care about it that those days are over every nation represents cells of people coming together is like every country is like an organ in the body you need all the organs to work together to create the wholeness of it and that's what we're beginning to recognize no organ is separate from any other organ we're all part of the same body so your lungs are fucking up your whole life son that's we sorta say boy he bites out of that one doesn't let go man please try to say Brian so I say your lungs are fucking up everything stop smoking marijuana and you're doing it too no marijuana doesn't do the same yes you're lost silly any smoke in your lungs does it no doesn't you're wrong what are you a doctor you fuckhead yes yes talk about your eyes you never let a single thing about we ask - we've never read a single you think of what a lung is it has to go I don't say anyway it's not like it's opposite smoke first of all I don't think you're inhaling nearly as much smoke when you smoke marijuana because you're only doing it like maybe once or twice in a day you're sucking on those stupid things all fucking day long and on top of that those things have 500 you make money on him that's like a pack of cigarettes the fuck it is it's going through water that's not a water pipe stupid that's a cigarette all right filters oh my god Brian cigarettes are filled with chemicals that kill you no one's ever died from pot ever in the history of the world you do not get that there's a direct connection there I'm so what I'm sure there's people that have died from marijuana no but it was a helmet or help of marijuana stupid when you're high but that's on you that's not on the pots plant that's like you know that's like blaming a Corvette cause you crash into a tree it's not the cars fault if you know how to drive you didn't you say like there's definitely been lung cancer cases that are probably attributed to you I wanna know there's none ya know I don't know that they don't say it's may 101 I smoked pot and done lung cancer so it would be there'd be cases of it they would talk about it look there's freak instances in medicine this freak instances were people's reactions to certain things and people get cancer from fucking all kinds of weird shit that doesn't bother you or me but you look at the history of human use where's the fucking bodies dude you can't say that pot smoke kills people you can't because there's no evidence there's no evidence of anybody dying from it there's a lot of evidence we were done from science right but you're very strong on your side of you're a successful I do I don't want you to die no no no I met a guy I'm saying you're very hot you even though there's no evidence you seem like you've picked a side but don't you you're just rolling out that there's no one that has got lung cancer from marijuana smoke as well as that guy died he's a pussy one guy died are you miss a person that's what I said Jesus Christ if he kills you with it's because we've got there first died sniffing glue I just like you dude I want you to get cancer I know you're stuck in this stupid thing and it's so ridiculous because you quit for a while and you talk about how smoke makes me sick now and then your cat stubs its toe and you fucking light right up again you know and you're eventually you're playing a game that's going to catch up with you and I think this this message is to anybody's out there smoking cigarettes is the most ridiculous fucking thing you can do they taste like shit they're terrible for you this whole reward mechanism is just because you're addicted to their chemicals and when you get that chemical you get this reward it's not even just about and I will say if you give a get a law that says banned cigarettes from United States that 90% of the smokers will sign it that's see that right there that's incredible it's incredible yeah I mean you don't know understand what it's like to be addicted to cigarettes oh I imagine I can only imagine so you always say my boy when you talk about it you in any state oh I just preaching today I want you to be strong son I get it well do you go to tell government to stop smoking well Bruce just told me that you are creating your own life dude you're creating all your own problems see he just occurs to me what's happening to you on a quantum level I never suggested me are making me happy was a person for you he'll make the perfect foil for this intelligent debate we're having we're Bruce explaining the nature of the fucking universe are you like no cigarettes are awesome not saying that all madam please bamboos also I can't stop when the smoke is gonna be bought up here I don't care if it stinks it's like you just like it's like if someone who really likes to fart you don't care you just fart all over everybody I'll be putting on people lighting cigarettes all over people mention the stupidity in the air it's just and if you like cigarettes man that's all cool and everything that's all cool in the gang I'm just telling my friend here don't be stupid right it's ridiculous isn't that what you're supposed to do if we're supposed to re-engineer the world I'm supposed to call stupid shit out when you see it it's gonna be great are you gonna be the king who's gonna be the king no I don't see I want to go back to the mountain what a mess no I just want to be you know back in the woods you want to go hide in the woods I love that I like that too yeah yeah you and I are on the same page you animals Oh fucking in the woods you know if you're a sensitive person if you're thinking all the time you sensitive to other people around you and I always believe that people around you affect you their energy effects we do you don't realize what how relaxing it is when there's no one around well there's literally no one around like you you sit on your porch you hear chirp chirp chirp chirp you see a chipmunk walk by and you see birds flying overhead you see the wind slowly moving the trees fuck that feels awesome it's that's that's the released yeah an experience yeah yeah you're released from the hive yeah briefly that's why I don't understand New York City but you're just trusting all these people's vibes around you you know you're just gonna you live in some giant fucking cement box with a bunch of weirdos and they all think weird shit and who knows whose toaster doesn't work right and lights the whole fucking place on fire you're going to trust these assholes and you're just going to be around them every day stuck in traffic and just breathing their energy right III was one of the lucky guys in the world I ended up teaching the Caribbean islands whoa I taught there for about three years and and I want to talk to you Marion Avedon not back then No oh yeah oh yeah I offered this line and there it never really works it was like it's like hey you want to yeah you got nothing to do I got a villa down the Caribbean want to come down I had that great line but a while you know that was like I would a great line and I'm wasting it that's a pretty baller line well you know you know you want to come to my place down the crib rack oh yes sometimes I fuck around with the Caribbean and the last days and luck with that sometimes I gotta fail or whatever whatever that's none of those things yeah so one of the things you really should have used it you should have forced yourself with some sort of a bar situation you know you just yeah it's one of those things if you you would think that if you didn't have it if you didn't have eating man if I had that boy would I fucking use it but then if you did have it you probably wouldn't use it right now it would seem so cheesy rejection could be so hard for it was actually we're a couple try that no you did try he did try oh yeah and they rejected a rejected and it's just like wow that didn't work I'm really bad am I when you say something really cheesy like that you take a chance head of hope you know the girls basically a materialistic slut no binturong chicks don't like that yeah that's really you're taking a big bold chance it's like when Bill Clinton used to just pull this dick out in front of girls you know like man I guess that works sometimes but holy shit what a gamble you know he represented the testosterone of the country so he was you know that's what he was it must have worked so many times there's no way it didn't work because all these like that state trooper woman that gennifer flowers women these women that which claim we just whip his dick out it was not just one you know it's like it obviously was his go to where was our unconscious behavior he didn't see himself doing it but I mean I can't believe he did it with like women in like professional environments and stuff I mean he wasn't like alone at his house they're having a couple of drinks and he just whips it out no he would whip it out when the first person left the room you know there'd be like three people in the room I'll be right back and we go the bathroom then one person would go to that room he whipped his dick out I mean he was fucking crazy he was king he was king yeah but is it natural to have that kind of behavior like is that isn't that what drives a lot of those guys to get to that position or explain a because you're in that competition out there in the field and how do you know how you succeed in the competition well how many toys do you own and what's your position in the hierarchy and so when you driven yourself to that level there was a reason why you wanted to be up there not to because there's something to do for the week or something like that there was a mission statement so that was playing the game full-out going for that this is why a lot of people really identify with Ron Paul and one of the reasons why they identify with Ron Paul's they know he doesn't want to fuck anybody yeah you know he's like an old dude it's not like he's not like I'm some crazy pussy prowl and you know once he gets an office he'll be playing golf every day you know no he's done with everything and he any thought of anything masculine or dominating and you know he's done with all that absolutely and it would be great I could I could just see it happening because of the internet community a third party could arise within just several weeks do you think voting is real voting yeah I think it's not rigged I think it's set up it's rigged yeah especially with computer voting yes did you watch that documentary hacking demacian that and I know some of these people in the industry and it's sort of like yeah that's that's just a given but what's a hit what's insane is that that wasn't followed up on chased down and beaten down in front of the press like like that girl killed her baby what the fuck's her name Casey Anthony like that that that got beaten down you know that got beaten down of the press why wasn't this but because obviously anything that was important doesn't play in the press the press is owned by the people that own the opinion they'll play what they want I mean what went when - haven't they done that it's disgusting you know that's why the air now is so that's why they lost control all of a sudden what a fuck up the internet is huh it's magic yeah it's pirate radio for the whole world exactly you know what a disaster you know people think for themselves you know and the fun stuff is like I said that Rodney King people don't remember but Rodney King was the beginning of everybody getting caught on camera you know I love it like yeah you're you know and once that opened up once I opened up all the sudden it's like oh you mean you could expose the secrets and everybody had cameras like UC Davis thing yeah I whispering I was a great that's a perfect great demonstration how they yeah they peaceably just push the guys right out of the thing but it was neat it's like fifty percent of the audience at their hands up with cameras and everybody was shooting his holiness sort of like in this world I don't think that guy thought that that was going to happen no I don't think he was going to get I think he'd never thought he would get contacted about it though just totally so that was amazing to me that someone could think that it would be the right thing to do to take some fucking kid who is a college student okay and all they're doing is sitting there protesting and you're going to spray some fifth whatever they are nineteen twenty year old kid in a face with pepper spray and you're a cop what a piece of shit and that and that that reaction is completely natural and important right because that is verification that there's a new process in place absolutely and that's what I was so proud about those people because they got into a situation where it could have gotten into violence and what they did is they they just held the violence back and just you know there's just shame on you and they shamed them like push them back back until they were off the campus and they got off and I was like oh wow non-violence because what people have to understand is it's the violence that's being planted I think most of it I would say is planted is to throw people against this Occupy Wall Street movement when and and when they did it peaceably it's like what are you going to how you're going to complain about that you know it's like that was a great demonstration of of how to handle the situation because the moment violence comes in the then those those they're almost like Nazi storm troopers out there especially with all that homeland security you know all that that cracked all their new guns ins all that's that technology for crowd control they're freaky people out there and it's like and they love the job they love to go out there and pound on those kids that's what they they train for so ridiculous so ridiculous it's it's very fascinating though it's very fascinating the the tone that the movement has taken the fact that it's really been a amazingly nonviolent yes considering the amount of resistance yes that's what it needs yeah because otherwise if it's if you're gonna play the game of force you're already out you're not gonna win the game what do you think is going to happen would you do sit down and prognosticate do you see a direction that this is gonna go to yeah there's two choices here and the choices are we're going to survive this evolutionary thing or we're not going to survive it so we continue doing what we're doing we already know science already said that's it's already on a calendar man you're going out and and the question is can we mobilize and make the change and I really think we can because it's um especially the younger generation and the older older generation the ones in the middle uh but a little concern about but there are a lot of old hippies out there that that really are in total alignment with the Occupy Wall Street movement that's who they are they were there back then when it all happened and so I I think there's this great opportunity for this evolution it's going to be fabulous and but you have to recognize like anything when a child is born is there there's blood there's there's there's some pain and blood when it happens and birthing this new civilization we're going to go through this a little bit of this chaos here which is going to be painful for a lot of people but it's like we got to see past where we are and look to where we're going to go isn't it amazing that no one would have ever guessed twenty years ago that we'd be talking about this that we will be talking about society eroding to the point where it really becomes irrelevant or not irrelevant but just it doesn't doesn't it's not respected no no it's it's you know the the set up is we've accepted it because it just is what it is no one is happy with it everybody recognizes it's full of flaws but it's almost like there's this attitude that like this is as good as we can do as humans oh no I mean today this complicated society with the stock market and the exchange rates and so you know Saudi Arabia oil this is good as we can get but it's not obvious actually not because it's not perfect you know it's always quo to keep those people that have the haves to keep what they have yes and to keep all the other people in that place but instead of evolving it's in fact evolving but that's what's going to cause it come to a head come to a crisis point where something can I have to happen right you have to realize that the people that are in power are not looking out for their interests anyway what isn't it obvious that's obvious let's do this new thing that was passed the Senate about the United States being a battlefield oh man did you you see this that they're allowed to mobilize troops now on American soil we barely Obama said he's going to veto it but what the fuck ever man the fact that he got that far in the first place that's horrific it's just this manipulation by very small number of people like you know listen we're going to extend unemployment but you have to sign for the pipeline at what point in time does that become criminal for like the Senate at what point in time do we not say hey you fucking crooks get out of here I'm waiting I'm totally waiting for this and it's really upsetting and that's why I actually started looking I even looked for a place in New Zealand now it's going to be so hard to get rid of lobbyists it's going to be so hard that kind of shit it's gonna be so hard to get all that stuff out like look the Internet as I said could overnight change the entire political spectrum overnight they never counted on that and if you do anything voting is real if voting is real but then the idea is you really start to swamp the market it's very hard to say that you know that's what the other countries know it's like well obviously this didn't conform to the people isn't it funny that we are becoming a fucking banana dictatorship we are we have become everything we fought before for other countries and and freed other countries we've imposed with a Patriot Act we have taken away personal liberty and this whole country's to my opinion with that person with that Patriot Act in operation is as bankrupt as any of the countries like Chile was under under their leadership and their dictators we're whatever the government says they can create whatever they want take you yeah Joe off the street and not tell anybody for 90 days that you were even gone there's nothing credible like in America that's incredible like whoever sign that you are traitors after you guys are traitors just straight traitors they should be fucking ashamed of themselves to call yourself a representative of the people and the past something like that what do you think what if what if everything at the top is completely fucked up and the right thing to do is to march in the street and to block traffic and to stop this fucking tyrannical situation it that's a space if that is the case then we're there well anybody who poses that is treasonous yeah look they already have the internment camps to hold several million people and they're because this was not a new thing a matter of fact there was a guy at Stanford University at this think tank called the Hoover think-tank in 1980 the government asked him to write a report on a scenario if there's a big financial collapse 1982 ask him to write this so you know the these were game players how would you play this thing out and the thing was that was real interesting he said in this process of what they were talking about in the future the guy who wrote it up said one of the things was interesting said people in this future period are going to become more conscious and and this is going to change the relationship of what what's going on but he also came to the conclusion he said inevitably we're still going to come to a chaos period where there's going to have to be controlled maintained and I remember putting parentheses and he said and I hope not for long but what he was saying is it becomes to a crunch issue like this for the government to maintain control they'll have to put a lot of people away in internment camps to keep it from from burning up and I mean look it's not very far now I mean the the essentially stormtroopers and Oakland and and all these other cities coming in there with I mean it's like it's out of some other country's history book and you're looking at it live yeah it really is yes it's terrifying it's weird how quickly it happened to you know remember right after 9/11 when everybody was like all raw raw I remember just you know a week or so after the the tragedy I was driving down the street and every other car had an American flag yeah yeah you know it's amazing everybody was all we blew it yeah because there was an evolutionary moment it was right on the edge because all around the world all the countries at once started say let's unite together and stamp out this stuff and then it was you know now Boy George said no I'll do it myself you know and sort of I think Dick Cheney said let's just go take a same money bitch Dick Cheney just when it all told everything yeah there's Darth Vader real-life man so yeah his fucking heart doesn't even have a pulse you know that no he doesn't have a pulse he's got some crazy pacemaker in him to keep him alive like what what doctor thinks it's a good idea to keep that dude alive oh my god Hollywood animatronics yeah Jesus Christ what do you won't want him to be around to influence or make make more crazy decisions he's had a long time he's done good the fact that he managed to get this far and still live considering how many people he's probably responsible for that housing you know that whole secret government stuff with god damn I remember when he was always in the bunker too he would always hide in the bunker that was like the crazy shit ever George Bush be out playing golf bringing a mile underground no because they were they didn't want Dick Cheney to die you know it's a member the he's got pulling the marionette strings isn't like the first time ever that we can recall that there was a real like the Vice President really was sort of in control the whole thing you know that mean I don't remember that happening during the Carter Administration or Reagan administration or well Reagan himself wasn't in charge of anything he was a figure people I remember he was he was a an ad spokesman on television early days of television for things like General Electric and big corporations yeah it was that guy that would distinguish look and they just bought him from the television set and put him in front of yeah is it our world and and gave him the lines to read he was an actor he did all the lines it's amazing though how many people respected him it's like people that argue that Hulk Hogan really did fight all those guys like there's people you know if you ever seen those dudes on the internet like there's one there's a very famous clip of one guy and he's in a he's in a High School Auditorium or something he's talking to these wrestlers and he's crying and he's literally crying he's like I just want to thank yo what you do if you ever seen that clip ride that the coach talking to the players it was real to me it's real to me no he's at find that dude he's that he's a pro wrestling fan it's fucking hilarious oh so what why should i search for it's real to me it's still real to me but well you got to see this guy this is this this guy man you can learn a lot it really is along the same lines you know people that just they don't want to hear it but that's most of the populations first I can tell they see it in front of their faces and don't don't even say anything a lot of people are too busy to that's another pretty it's very hard to even concentrate on anything other than watching TV and eating after you work all day it's fucking hard man and if you go to the gym - oh Jesus what do you have time for you know you take a spinning class or you know you do you know whatever do some place of racquetball or something yeah you know after that's over man how much time do you have to fix the world you got to go to bed do it all over again stupid put down your sign you know we're going to be over with everybody's gonna fall asleep alright did you find them Daria's Brian that was it this hold on one sec just is that is a problem the people are working all the time they're tired very difficult to get a fucking movement going with a bunch of people retired from work here we go who says yeah bye thank us how many people are not working anymore so check out this poor guy yeah um I just want to thank each and every one help for all you've done to your bodies it's still thank you thank you guys you're awesome thank you so much mr. fuck person what needed to be said oh it's not amazing that's how far the mind can wander how do we bring that guy back how do we get turned that guy into the coolest guy in the world oh hush rooms up that would help it I was gonna hold him down now I'm think got a home down the street is wrong at a funnel in snow yeah you gotta let go let you try to make foie gras like those things they do a duck to the horse freedom to make their living which by the way is delicious you ever had that foie gras style not going to be illegal in California at the end of this month people have decided they're going to outlaw this foie gras we've got a Susan's wrong what they're doing these ducks they're eventually gonna fucking kill and eat anyway but meanwhile cigarette - we go look at this wacky fuckin douchebag government we have Joe did you see that architect that just released lovenox dude for real Teen People okay did you see that that architect that just released the new building drawings that the kind of building that looks just like 9/11 here's here's a picture of it wrong on the screen right be my did you see this I it's it's actually at first you look at it you're like oh that's just creepy looking but then the more you look into it's actually really cool like it was like oh well as I kind of the clouds really yeah the idea is that it sticks above the clouds was so high but it also looks are fucking planes like I mean like exactly yeah but what kind of fucking cloud is like that like a pixelated Kirk yeah it's kind of interesting though it's probably a dope building let him build it who gives a shit well you know we're so sensitive to explosions and buildings and you know is it like Mohammed now you can't draw the 911 hours will go after you you fuck oh you know strange place America yeah the whole world right yeah but we're great leaders well we're better than the Middle East man check out what the fuck they're doing throwing rocks at people when they're dancing and all that bullshit you know we we are less oppressive than them it's not funny that's like a badge of honor you know we fuck you less hard like I know we kiss you you know we haven't gotten started yet you know that's the one difference on all the other countries that they get in a revolution they throw rocks and bottles each other we've got ak-47s automatic weapons so a revolution here is going to have a whole different aim and we're not what we're also not under a religious fundamentalist rule namely not completely but in process in process you think you feel like just going that direction all the Republicans that's their that's their whole mob well that's just because that's the best way to rape in the retards a rope in the retards you know gets a good pattern that they can adapt and think that way but if you believe like Rick Perry is looking out for God it is you know God would want that fucking dope be in the present that guy and we never have you seen a guy at a debate that forgot like a primary part of being a fucking politician what do you stand for us to but do you have your shit measure memorize you have it written down anywhere he didn't even have notes in front of him you know where he's talking about the three branches of government who's going to get rid of and he blanked it's amazing yet the first move he did after that was to put out a thing about being a Christian and about the gays who don't want you to celebrate you know the whole world is falling apart and all this stuff and they want to easy other fears it's like you guys are there's big issues here and they don't work they don't deal with any big well they're mining for low-hanging fruit and that's the best way to mine that's an unfortunate situation and I think I remember back at some advertisers like Oh George Bush should be the kind of person you like to go have a beer with at the bar and I'm thinking not really you know who said well I would have a beer with him just to see how fucking guilty he feels oh you know just to see what it's like I would definitely have a beer with that guy yeah I think he's a spokesperson and the thing that I always point to is the the time when that dude was throwing shoes at him yeah you know that he's acting like smilin he had this look on his face that to me was like this is the first fun this fucking guy is happy you know in years finally he's having a good time go through shit man I just fucking work here I responsible how much his Big Mac is basically like he was behind the counter of McDonald's and someone threw their shoes out of a tomato he probably hated that day probably had the worst night no I don't think that oh I think he's having a moment it's like Secret Service have following him every day with bulletproof vests and fucking guns and tanks and cars you can't blow up he's having a good time once I was throwing shoes out of mass a sports moment for him yeah I was like something is actually happening in his life that they didn't plan out in advance and pull off to a tee well the whole world thought they were you know battling good guys start and fucking wars over weapons that don't even exist and even though it's been proven those weapons don't exist oh we're just gonna stay for another seven or eight years look we got rid of a bad guy you know like in this whole thing that's going on in Afghanistan um it's it's amazing that people anybody supports it who is a lot of people man a lot of politicians supporter obviously that's why we're here yeah well I mean a lot of that's a best government money kanpai it is it's amazing than anybody could I mean if you needed the best example ever of how the government and the military are not looking out for your best interest Afghanistan's it to think that we didn't learn not only do we not learn anything from Vietnam we learned less this is a Dumber war this is way Dumber right it's way down will probably last longer the money was good though you have to make the money was great it's an amazing way to make some money so amazing that was the whole motivation it's just push the money around for that yeah I was looking at they had something in the news the other day about the the amount of heroin that's been produced it's something like sixty one percent more in 2011 than in 2010 it's incredible and it's really response to the price increasing so they're just making insane someone is making insane amounts of money from that insane amounts of money see I invest in here we're gonna have that Michael Rupert guy on did you get that message no like a collapse guy oh really I sits there and just as we're fucked we're fucked we're fucked I got a documentary yeah he's gonna do it yeah oh wow yeah we're setting that up do you hear about the alarming toxins found in baby food like they've they're there they're finding canned baby food they're finding in Japan the monsters devel in Japan they're finding from the that holy shit there's the radioactive fallout yeah there's stuff in the baby food of course it is probably in everything probably on the ground me now that's why when Shane was here and he was telling us that Tokyo was two hours away it I was like I'm gonna go two hours away from that yeah even going for a couple days that's terrifying for me those poor people have to live there and that that stuff is going to get into the water and stuff's gonna get in their food and how many people are going to be irradiated before they actually do something about it you know Dana White's going to come back with a full head of hair okay works that was no way to do it actually makes your hair fall out silly but but these are the lesson back with no eyebrows these are the lessons and whether we learn them or not that's this is that period there's no way to fix that right that Fukushima how do you say the name Fukushima Fukushima you can't fix that right I mean that is that's gone that's not yeah and they can't even contain like the the core right isn't like melted oh no containment walls it'll be contained a planet earth it probably passed planet earth but it'll stay on planet earth isn't amazing it's amazing that people still will say that we should have nuclear energy it's like what if one of these things goes wrong every 20 years do you understand that in the course of human history the whole planet is fucked we're like these things it takes over a hundred thousand years for people to be able to go anywhere near that without dying right we have a short-term memory problem but I mean that's a ridiculous calculation yeah and yet the people as long as it's in the front of the newspaper then it's there and the moment it's not in front of newspaper it's gone people like the you know what the nuclear power has an amazing record no it doesn't i can tell you three times that i know and i'm not even barely paying attention Three Mile Island right was that chemicals no no through mine I was move legally as well yeah three Mile Island Chernobyl Chernobyl and Fukushima that's three and he's worried about each one got bigger than the last one that's ridiculous if you know three fuck-ups you know three fuck-ups in your life that's amazing but we have here in California our nuclear plants on the fault line as well what the fuck is wrong with us are we crazy are we doing this on purpose I like playing chicken down dumb pretty we down dumped ourselves so that we're more easily controlled we didn't do it it it's just like we're playing chicken what it seems like we're guy or your wife goes to the gym and you call prostitute into your house and it's like you're it's a race against time she packing it now get the fuck out here it's like you're almost wanting to get caught you're crazy person you know when you're building a fucking power plant on a fault line you know if I was your psychologist I'd be like homie what the fuck are you doing man hey man the land was cheap yeah you couldn't put that over here you can put it over here where it never moved oh that seems ridiculous yeah it's a good spot it seems it just as a ridiculous that we all live here now Colorado man that was any other words my number-one feelings for like why does everybody have to live in this one spot this is so stupid and that's what I felt like when you live in a place that only has a few thousand people that's like we're we get to breathe you can fucking relax yeah why do we do this why do we group up like this because we get things done easier this way no it's a nature of cells started to do that before we did that cells lived in community before inventing or we the unhealthy cells because we separate from the pack and want to hide in the woods well even with us the whole idea is that yeah there's definitely some bad growth in the colony and and it's got cancer itself system got cancer itself so when you look at the future and you see with all the information that you have we have far more than most how do you see this ending I think this has a the greatest possible most wonderful ending in the world let me just give example for some so the people we talked about the conscious mind and that we're being controlled by the subconscious mind and that the conscious mind is the creative mind with your wishes and desires well here's an interesting fact go back to a time sometime you you fell head-over-heels in love with somebody I call it the honeymoon period and then I say in that honeymoon period where you're healthy and almost everybody when I'm going to ask a big audience almost every buy goes I'm super healthy when I was in that beer and I said did you have energies like yeah we had so much energy we made love for days didn't even stop for food man and I say it was life so beautiful that you couldn't wait for the next day to have more of that in there because yeah yeah I go yeah just think about is that tantamount to having heaven on earth is that would that be something like that and everybody goes oh yeah and then I go that was not an accident that was a personal creation and that the honeymoon was the one time in our lives and this is the interesting part because neuroscience says the one time where you operate strictly from the conscious mind and don't revert to that default program and the sub just mind where you're operating from your wishes and desires is the time you're making love when you're making love the conscious mind stays in the present moment well why is that relevant it's the conscious mind it has all your wishes and desires so if that mind stays in the front guess what then you created a life that was heaven on earth but the moment life starts to get too busy and your mind starts to wander and think then you start you go you resort back to the unconscious programs well you didn't see you did that but your partner does and your partner goes what the hell kind of behavior is that where'd that come from and that's when this whole honeymoon starts to come to an end because when you just said whatever you did from your subconscious program which may have been your father or your mother and you didn't hear yourself say it your partner heard yourself say you didn't even hear yourself saying that so that's where all of a sudden the honeymoon starts off start to collapse is like what do you know what are you talking about I've always been this way or whatever you want to say it's like you start losing a dialogue because you're now talking from your subconscious programs and but the whole point was what when we did operate from the conscious moment when we did stay in that period we created heaven on earth both health-wise and yeah but then she got fat so bitching at me about shit - I'm tired of the fucking texting my friends no gonna probably talk to me isn't that what happens though that you guys get tired of their own bullshit conscious my story no I want people to you know traveling it's a utopian concept because we were talking about is this massive up beat up rise of serotonin - absolutely dopamine serotonin actually happens when you first meet someone you want to fuck them because you know no but the question is the question is why did it disappear though it disappeared because you when you met that person both of you were operating from your creative wishes and desires when did it fall apart is when the subconscious mind started to take over more the operation because life started to occupy your conscious mind it's now travelling yeah that's when it ended so you hit this perfect moment and then life got in the way yeah and guess what but if you reprogram the subconscious mind to have the same beliefs and wishes and desires that your conscious mind has so that both Minds have the same vision and destiny then there's the honeymoon the rest of your life it doesn't end then because you put in your wishes and desires so even when you're not paying attention that's when your subconscious playing is still going to play the same wishes and desires that you want in your life anyway but right now it plays the programs that you got from other people when you're not paying attention that's why you lose control over your life said I've only said that very few people have their own opinions that they simply have a conglomeration of other people's opinions that sort of adopt it as their own but they really haven't like audited every single one of them down like a lot of them yeah and try to figure out why is that in there yeah and the problem once it's downloaded then you become a slave to the program even if you have no desire to be in the program it's not your choice now it's unconscious it'll take you there whether you're paying attention or not and don't you think that same sort of thing has happened to pretty much everyone who's in a position of power so they are in a certain sense a victim of the same system they've been a rule of they were programmed somewhere along the line to get to that power so that they were being driven by the program it's amazing when you really think about it that you know but one of the things I think is really terrifying to people is that you're describing this and people are realizing this I'm sure right now but they're also realizing this is not a conventional idea that's really sort of pushed in the media this is not something the president knighted States addresses the nation about no it's not necessarily something that's there's no money well there's no money for the corporations in this process and when when the information is expressed and you know and people know it to be true sort of recognize it and think oh my god does this mean that there was no one who has set this whole gigantic thing up this human civilization no one did it consciously no one planned it out they might have made the infrastructure and planned out where the water was it was going to go this way anyway it was going to go this way planned out yellow krisily pattern we're playing a pattern and here's the pattern civilization is a living organism an animal and by its definition it's going to evolve in the same characteristic way that animals evolved so there's a part we went from let's say of fish amphibians reptiles birds and mammals the fish phase was when human civilization Early's phase mariculture they lived at the sea they they had to live at the water they they couldn't live without water they were stuck to wherever the water was agriculture was amphibian phase why they took the water with him on the land so they could go deep into the land penetrate in land get the water grow all the stuff and live because you needed the water ok the reptile stage reptiles are the only animals that were first designed for land they're almost like machines they're almost mechanical like when you see a lizard like it's almost digital the way it moves the reptiles were the equivalent of the Industrial Age that's when we became reptilian and it's interesting because we're still in that age and guess what we're fueling this civilization with with what they call the the blood of the dinosaur we're fueling it with oil which is the character of that that reptilian phase and and so we're living a reptilian phase of civilization the lizards were like mom-and-pop shops but they grew into dinosaurs which were corporations and the corporation's evolved and then here comes the cool part the bird phase of women's civilization started in 1903 when Wilbur and Orville Wright started to fly it changed the whole world because now you can fly around in a few hours a change the world was so massive at one point nobody could imagine it now we could fly around and put a satellite around it and I say so the birds evolved from 1903 but guess what they reached their fullest evolution in 1969 1969 the birds landed on the moon and they took a picture of the earth and those hippies back then saw this picture and created Earth Day within to within a month or two of the picture coming back number one number two they said oh man look at that we got to take care of that that's all we have got to take care of the water the air take care of the kids and all that taking care is the character called nurturing nurturing is the character of mammals so in 1969 the mammalian phase of human civilization was seeded with the hippies looking and say oh my god take care of each other take care of the planet regeneration it's what it was all about but then go back in history and recognize when the mammals first evolved the dinosaurs was still here - and the dinosaurs were you know the big big killer things and the mammals were the little meek furry guys right and the fact is that they talked about the meat taking over the earth while we're in that transition the dinosaur is falling the oil is running out the you know the power that's been feeding this whole reptilian phase of corporate dinosaurs so the beak is actually the individuals all banded together against a united corporation or absolutely knighted corporate so the young people that are taking care of each other and recognize why this hold none this really this non-violence movement is almost prophetic absolutely inherit the earth that's what it's all about a beginning of it that's what it's all about and as someone back then when who wrote the Bible or wrote any of the religious texts to think if they go through this already no III don't know you know there's a there's interesting things about that is I believe a lot of that we translate the Bible whatever people think today an issue is maybe they were writing about real shit back then that really happened something happened here on this planet enough people occurred in that biblical time period globally and things shifted on the do you think it's possible that this has happened before that we just fucked the whole thing yes and almost start from scratch yes yes Wow it seems like a invisible Lemuria Atlantis and those are natural exact disasters well that's what they what we believe but we don't know about the loom Orion was more of the natural disaster what about the Atlantis one still don't know what actually thought they thought it was a tsunami they found it in Spain remember well they're finding pieces all over because of finding now every that the were let the water level is much higher than it used to be a long time ago and so and everything just like now we live on the edges so yeah water level raises than anything on the edges doesn't exist anymore so we lost it all at some point but there's a time that this has happened before the Mayans know this the ink I mean they created buildings that were completely earth proof designed earthquake proof and they are they already knew that this would this world was just going to shake and do all this kind of stuff suppose how did they make earth proof shit earthquake if you look at these giant giant blocks I mean they're so big by human size I mean they're massive stones they're cut with very intricate angles and the point about it is they're designed that if the wall shakes the stones loosen up but then they'll all settle back down into the original resting position what's really absolutely as we design this knowing full well that these massive earthquakes we're going to move these boulders size building blocks and yet they're designed so they're their angles are cut so that they loosen up and on earthquake and then fall back into everything slides back into the the right you know the right structure was before that's amazing it's amazing that they somehow another figure that out it was interesting because they built a when the Christians came into the Spanish and they they took over the Sun temple which is this big Peruvian temple in Cusco then the church did it and like dogs pee one on top of the other one they built their church on top of the foundation which was the Peruvian temple they built the church on Wow and it's interesting three earthquakes have demolished the church each time and in three earthquakes not one thing happened to to the foundational building which was the Peruvian temple Wow yeah that's amazing yeah totally they knew all this stuff there was great technology there was a lot of stuff happening in those there's something that there are civilizations that we don't talk about in history books our history book talks about oh the Middle East Babylon and all that kind of stuff it's a source it's like there were civilizations that were here and died out that were much more advanced before that blew that yeah oh they got enough archaeology I'm just showing that now yeah there's there's definitely some evidence that points to that a new everything is being revised that's the greatest thing about that every part of our knowledge is being revised that's another thing that people are fighting against you know when you were talking about people who are academics have been teaching a certain thing most of their lives you know that happened with a lot of this trying the people that are trying to predate the Sphinx you'll wear well oh yeah yeah that's a to me that's a perfect example because these people these Egyptologists were like you know where is this evidence of this culture and they're you know and like been how much evidence you really think there would be for if you're really talking about thirty four thousand years ago something like that like how much evidence is there going to be it was really going to be anything better than blocks a stone I mean when we let go of a city how long does it take before other things back into sand again it doesn't take long no not all good all mean how long would a car last and left a car outside a little last even I'm only able to have a few cars I've left in the woods that are probably not there anymore Yeah right Yeah right you remember when kids used to do that I remember when dudes used to have cars that would just sit on blocks yeah you see fucking trees growing in their car we had a we had a mountain near where we lived and we'd go by these Junkers at you know cars that were burning oil and people didn't want really pay ten fifteen bucks drive them up to the top of this hill and then we use them like a dirt track and just you know cut through the weeds and all kinds of stuff like that and just ran him into the ground till they finally so it was like 10 or 15 bucks for the investment and then spend a day or two playing you know bumper cars that's before we were where that we could hurt ourselves yeah when you're young and silly yeah a friend of mine had a van and he parked it is is like garage re never fucking use day just it was all broken down a junkie and one day we went into it and there was a plant growing out of his floor mat almost like dude look at those like dude nature's gonna eat this back nature's going to slowly figure out a way to eat your truck it just we're seeing like day 7d something that's going to take a million days but it'll eat this fucking thing it's gonna be nothing left so that's why she'll say well would there be leftover things it's like most of us own stuff will be gone in a short time yeah just stone yeah that's about it which is really terrifying to me because now we're moving into this digital era and everything is getting put down on ones and zeros and data that you have and we're also going to hit a era of sunspot activity that's going to be rageous which means all that memory going to go god that's so ridiculous cuz you imagine if that happened it was just some super big gamma bursts that fucking erased everyone's hard drive everyone all over the world not not usually no I wasn't fishing anymore we go right back to front him from Wikipedia we have to go find some books and a librarianship under the desert 40 years in darkness that's a goddamn low if that happens I don't know what I want to do I really don't know I don't know if I want to get swept up in the in the in the fucking hurricanes that kill people or if I wanted I just sold my DVD player my my television keep working cuz I'll I'll just watch movies as the sunset continues yeah brilliant news watch oh he's just hang out on my hilltop and think he'd be come kiss on your hilltop by yourself how long if you knew that the rest of the world was dead where the rest you were like that dude Ernest Borgnine we had a Twilight Zone remember that he was so happy that the world exploded because he was inside of a vault and he came out and he's like all these books I could read these books and he dropped his glasses and broke them oh yeah there's a problem yeah yeah but he was so excited before that it was so excited to be alone with books do you think you could rock it like that I could do it for a period of time I did it in the Caribbean watch so that was all yourself oh yeah that's just kept by my line never got fulfilled died and there I am by myself so what would you do down there oh man well as first thing I started living more outdoors than I ever did before because I was always a laboratory scientist so it was like what you weighing an athlete Lee by yourself down there he didn't have any interaction with people I taught a class with was so see that ain't the same no no no no you got a we're talking about like if you were the last dude on earth how long would be able to deal with this geez I know you're teaching a class that's such a such a big difference castaway thingy wouldn't last very long in a good state yeah you would commit suicide be friends with the ball you'd be angrier yeah you get angry after a while relson don't you think probably yeah I think the human animal and that's a fascinating thing about people is that we we need each other so much that we get sad when there's no one else around actually in biological understanding there it's inconceivable it's just a quote it's inconceivable to think of an organism ever living by itself no work in ISM ever lit isn't amazing them because you definitely need some alone time you know why can't we balance that shit out right because you know I do like watching TV ramas when everyone's asleep and I'm a lot I like it now look if I'm staying at a hotel room I'm like oh I get to watch whatever the fuck I want to watch and no one's going to talk to me right now like you like that you like being alone but ultimately if it stayed that way you would be miserable you know but that always make coming home even even the better yeah it's a weird sort of a pulsating back-and-forth things it's like everything seems to be yeah mr. Lipton why is it all go like that there's a pull and a push there's a battle going on right now everything's vibration jump how do we fix this fucking thing start thinking differently start thinking in a way of let's start living in harmony with each other and let go of this that's easy for you to say though what about people with bills and people live in shitty neighborhoods they just pretty soon all that's going to fall apart this is the try I really believe we are going to go into a state of chaos not that far into the future so my fear factor money's fucked it's no good no spend it now and there are other things you want right now because it won't be worth anything soon right no the money's not gonna be worth anything when do you think money's gonna not going to be worth anything because that's how we should manipulate no no but I'm saying like how much time do we have left to buy shit seven months how much time do I have no idea but it's surprising me how fast some of the changes have occurred so since I because the book I'm an evolution that I that I wrote was what just a couple of years ago and stuff that I was talking about is now beginning to manifest already especially with like Occupy Wall Street meaning people are pulling out of the system and that's all it begins it's once they start pulling out critical level the system will stop yeah but how are they pulling out of the system by just like us or not because they're not even being able to participate they can't even get a damn job how those people eating how's that all working people community community are feeding them and community is he is the necessary step of evolution and that's what will keep people alive it will learn to live in community they'll always be a support system but if they try to do it without community it's not going to work well that's what seems to be going on with this Occupy Wall Street thing is that there's this is the biggest number of people that are willing to hang out together outdoors that I've ever seen yeah it has become their united in this like you know Jamie kills teen remember Jamie kills him for the podcast my buddy he's a he's a Akhtar every fucking day look at his Twitter it's you know it's pound sign OWS like everything is Occupy Wall Street even went to Australia vacation over there are working I don't know what he was doing but he went to occupy Melbourne or me like to settle the fuck down it's not even your country no you don't even know what their argument is you know maybe you'd be on the bankers side over here you know I don't know I'm just talking shit yeah but it's it's amazing how much like it becomes a community it really becomes you know all these people that are supporting Occupy Wall Street they're United in this thing now they feel like they are the only thing that is going to stop the tyranny they're the only thing that's going to step forward and say enough is enough that's hopefully something comes out of it know what the definition of humanity is community it doesn't work if it's not community so basically that's the motivation and look at look at the consequence of this isn't the reason is we have been systematically deprived of community overtime at first you know local neighborhoods and then even in a family home when they put the telephone televisions in there and all of a sudden the family's not even working as a community that was the last piece of it and Nelson there was no community anywhere and that's why she leave the television families watching television robbed some of the community is a lot of it so at some point it did because she's a lot some of it can you watch like one show oh I love no i watch i watch the news I watched Jon Stewart yes my only total day 30 rock I need to laugh every now and then so well Jon Stewart's hilarious and that shows the perfect example to for me of what a comic can do with just the regular real news the real reality of this world that we live in especially in and do it dressed like them you know wear a suit sitting in front of a death like that I'm just telling the truth has become humorous that's all isn't it well in the way Jon Stewart does it yeah yeah yeah so uh so what do you suggest that people do they have to change the way they think that's by your book no no no they have to buy anything got a lotta luck folks don't listen that's called the biology of belief by Bruce H Lipton PhD and that's very important that PhD part cuz I mean there was something there at one point all right I was more than you stupid where'd you go to school a graduate school University Virginia and was that in the during the the summer of love and all that absolutely and and and so it's so unfortunate because I always I'd like to see that happen like Thompson had that great line about you know seeing that and then seeing the tide roll back you know and seeing seeing it the one time like being in during the 60s in San Francisco and the acid culture and seeing what's possible and then seeing it all pull back yeah it was what is it like to you it was the most exciting time I can experience and that I have experience on this planet because every day we get up and we didn't know what was something was we knew something was going to happen every day because everybody's like it was on the edge it was like beginning to burn so something was happening what was it like to meet a person you know I'm I don't I'm not that familiar with like what it felt like when you say like that something was going to happen what was going on this is the Vietnam War the Vietnam War was going there were protests against the war the the first was students congregated together against parents and the community and so there was like Occupy Wall Street with a little bit more anger to it and a little bit more you know real heavy heavy protests going up much more echoes of Vietnam yeah absolutely and at some point is because people started to wake up and say wait what this is you know what's this war all about there was no reason for the war right and there was the reason they the Vietnam War was a real oil oil oil yeah and control of the drug trade which is part of a CIA thing and this was on television in fact this guy Bill Moyers one of the best news guys because he was like a real honest guy you know he had a program on that was years ago people are remembering it was like it was called the shadow government and as you can see it on the web and it's great because it's play right now it's the exact same thing and turned out the CIA was a funded organization of the government it was like on a budget right but then they found out that they could precipitate a war in a place and have all the local people buy all the guns from them but then you said well yeah but the local people in these places in the jungle where the hell did they get all the money in fact they didn't have any money Oh what they had coke morphine marijuana and and so the exchange was not and this was on Bill Moyers show he had a CIA guy there say that they linked up with a mafia and so this was you know this is on the show on PBS and they linked up the mafia with what the CIA would carry the guns to this country make money sell it to both sides essentially and then because they didn't have money they were getting paid in all all this you know like coke or whatever the hell it was and then they fly that back in and CIA planes into the states and then the Mafia would take it from there and pay him back so they got in to a circle but the point was this they ended up making more money from the guns and drug trade than the budget what was the point they need the budget anymore they started operating independently they were making that's what Halliburton and all this stuff came from these are operating independent of the government because they were making more money creating the wars and and and getting involved with the drug and the gun trade and this was all this was explained to people and it's like today the same issue with me it's like oh my god what do we can do about it nothing it's just like that's the way it is and everybody walked away it's like it's just the same thing today with these things I hear it's like what are we gonna do about it nothing well Michael Rupert the guy who are talking about who's the guy who was a star that movie collapse you know you know we're talking about yeah he was a cop and he actually caught them selling drugs in in you know bad neighborhoods and was told to drop the whole case yeah and testified about it that's why we that's why marijuana is illegal there's more money for the industry if it's illegal if it's legal the whole damn thing collapses so there's so much money that's being paid at every level of course to the police and every other level yeah I want is one of my favorites yeah the fact the fact that that's illegal and cigarettes are legal oh there you go it's in my logic falls out the window and that's well the best evidence whatsoever that you're being fucked there's absolutely s'more money and making it illegal than legal so is there a book you recommend is there a pattern of thinking recommend I mean how can people sort of wake themselves up out of the state there and now and and sort of evolve past the situation that we're at now together now let me knowledge is power we got to start looking at the knowledge we got but it's also like you have to have an ethic in a way of thinking yeah you have to look for the knowledge because it's not the knowledge you're going to get in conventional school in the conventional textbook that's selling a program we've been playing that program for years and that's why war after war we all go oh another war in other words like somebody's been playing us it's so beautifully and it's time it stopped it's not working anymore because they they tap the system dry now we got masses of people with there's no money for them what are you going to do that means that you're going to have a movement of people that is just like the haves and have-nots and they're so in balance ninety-nine one man and so eventually somehow or another it's going to work itself out probably when the old people die and that's one of the best ways of making the change and you notice like just in the last I think it was eight years six eight years of the the survey of people wanting legal marijuana went from 36 percent about six or eight years ago it's up to fifty fifty-one percent right now so assess geez in a few years you know we're that older group that's got their claws on to the system are dying you know like like Cheney kind of people's right because that's the most successful way to get rid of but but the best thing that's going to happen is recognizing if you stop playing the economic game with them get out of their game they can't survive right and so that's why a whole new economy in a whole new way of communicating in a whole new way of community is what is the evolutionary point a disconnect from the structure and a rebuilding of something new and better how long is this going to take a few years not very many I'd say within a decade Wow yeah it's going to have with it okay we're gonna have a total new government something that's going to be such an upheaval that something it will it will not be anywhere what it is right now within a decade listen man I know you have a train that you have to catch yeah so we're gonna we'll come back cuz I have to talk about some other stuff but I want to thank you very much for coming on the podcast and I want to tell people to buy your book it's called the biology of belief Bruce H Lipton PhD and I'm sure you can get it on Amazon right Doug dot deg GED tech and there's a great website mind book dot WS mind book dot WS and this is your social networking it's a social networking site this is yours right no no no this is another community people that are thinking outside the box and providing information for my mind book WS yeah and it's just a group of hippies essentially yeah yeah are you a chippies okay thank you very much for coming of rice everyday to join a pause for a minute and we're gonna be back in about 15 minutes after we say goodbye
