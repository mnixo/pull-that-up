hello freak bitches about these nazi furries like neo-nazi furries well absurd obscure subculture of furries has a problem with neo-nazis any groups of sexual abuse there's a lot of Nazis I mean cut the fucking shit please just please cut the shit please please I can't I can't keep going I can't I can't keep going this is too crazy every day it's more and more fucking weird this stuff I get and I think this is the same people that watch those YouTube videos or make the YouTube videos I think the people who make the YouTube videos dude I think it's just like their lit there in Asia or somewhere like that and they have a script and they just keep doing the script over and over and we're looking for like hidden messages in the script I think the scripts probably just fucked up they think it's fucked up to have a cartoon character hit himself in the head with a bottle and I think you're probably right like maybe these fucking child predators maybe they communicate on all sorts of different websites maybe they just decide like hey let's meet on this tire forum and we'll just say things in code and a tire means this I mean wasn't that always the shit with pizza gate like they thought that they were talking in code like all the conspiracy theorists thought that a slice of pizza meant like a kid and the YouTube one I mean the them beings there's being so many of them sort of says that there's money in it yeah they've tapped into the algorithm and they're just beating it to death yeah and they just have the same script and they just do it with a computer change one more thing a little thing here and there and that's what I think it is I think it's not as nefarious as everybody likes to think but it's really fucking weird to keep seeing the same video playing out over and over again when the bottle flies through the hair and the baby gets hit in the fucking heads utilize so I think that was a little weird or when it's people actually people doing it yeah can't just have a computer make it people are goddamn nuts they're nuts and they're out there I like Frieza I get that I I have a bunch of outfits that I I make videos with and stuff and that's pretty much what that is that's just basically cross-play like anything or roleplay yeah they're having fun yet having fun they don't feel like normies right I say all right yeah and I'm sure having sex like that it's probably that's kinky like hey you're dressed up as my pretty pony and I'm spider-man a lot of dude-on-dude crime under wearing these hats they're wearing fucking weird animal hats and they're boning each other okay why not man B you know why cuz this is crazy so why not why to do it why not do it see look at that just like a fox and you're fucking each other and the Fox is fucking the chicken why not why really why not I just I don't know why not I can't tell you why not why is it okay that people wear crazy fake eyelashes and extensions in their hair or and they pump fat into their ass and put silicone bags and their tits why is that okay but it's not okay to dress like a big chicken and get fucked by a big rooster mm-hmm all right why isn't it why can't you pretend to be like a Fox in the henhouse why not like if long as everybody agrees like do you agree to be the Fox okay I'm gonna be the Bulldog mascot the big Bulldog head we're gonna bone they're gonna make some some rendevouz why the fuck not have you seen the movie I hadn't it wasn't worked out during the movie I still didn't like him during the movie they asked him us they asked him do you have any good recollections of when you CT growing up when it's time do you find recollections of you and CT you know as a kid and I boy I was looking at him Charles wait now where I really I really wanted to hear if he was gonna fabricate something right because I didn't have none and I'm like I wanna see what this motherfucker gonna say this is questioning and he didn't have anything and I was like okay cool you know long

was ready to go off but he didn't have any so won't even have any files okay now that's the same recollection that I had but I really didn't forgive him until his last heart attack in June and what happened then when I had the heart attack in June and it seemed like a revelation came to me it looks like I'm it's not hurting him it's not hurting him at all my dad is 86 years old he's fine man he's good I don't he's like you know I don't think he thinks that he has anything to be sorry for I think he thinks he's done a fantastic job raising me and I was just waiting on apology was never gonna come but but it was still the hate that I had for him was eating me up so I had to get that burden off me and I think having that last harder I didn't want to die carrying that burden with me of hating like there so I went to my dad and I asked him to forgive me Wow yeah damn yeah how did you say that I say you know look dad I have blamed you I told that I recently had a heart attack and I
