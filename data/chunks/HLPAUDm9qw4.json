the gyro can experience let's take like just one small example of like how my belief system works about this there's this one thing called the accumulation mindset I call it I work online with people on fat loss programs and when you really look at their lifestyle their into this accumulation mode of just buying and amassing all the stuff I've been in some people's homes where the shelves are just littered with stuff they never use or don't need you know that they just have so much stuff the attic is full of stuff the garage is full stuff but they keep buying more and more adding adding adding adding their bodies reflect this type of belief system and for sure they're adding more cells under there's mulchand just indulge it you know and then they find themselves over eating eating more than their fair share of the natural resources of the universe taking more end I mean it's just like this whole belief system in accumulation like I need to add I need to add it's all subconscious of course no one goes into it you know yeah how much do you sleep maybe now that I'm doing all this crazy stuff three hours through a lot yeah wow what do you normally sleep if you were nine hours if I'm lucky Wow four hours maybe well you're juiced up on nicotine all time no it has to do with I have to work like you know like I have to do the notes at night so that they can edit during the day and then i go in at night and then now like with all these like with radio as you know like radio and on something it's like there's a weird schedule to all that and then doing shows at night because i never stop doing shows you know right of course but i meant like when you're not doing this you said five hours yeah five hours maybe is that because you're all juiced up with nicotine all the time I
