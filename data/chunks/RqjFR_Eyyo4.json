hello freak bitches that's the good version of it or whatever in Dubai they just you know in Dubai it's interesting cuz they stop paying and the fucking workers just started walking home they just all packed their shit and started walking to the edge of town the whole place is so crazy they've ever been there so yeah yeah they were balling at such a high level and then it just kind of all came crashing but the base donor it's a resource-based economy a limited resource based economy and you can't eventually that's gonna go dry no matter it's now or 50 years from now you're banking your whole worth on oil these fuckers are gonna be Hawking rugs like they were in the 50s sooner than they know it and it's gonna be a creepy period for that well they also have debtors prison so you can't be you can't be in debt you can't just go bankrupt over there right lock you up in jail right so a lot of people they park their Mercedes at the airport got on a flight and just left everything behind elite like I don't want to be in jail fuck you in your country take care exact lot of people were living there like Michael Jackson was living there I mean it got to be this you know really the idea of this enchanted paradise place where millionaires and just sounds like nuts sounds like Las Vegas run by Southern Baptists yeah the whole thing is really fast religious police like I got him called on me yeah during my show during your show yeah and Dubai yeah hello I was I was doing a show with Jon Lovitz of all people I guess and he I was I did the first 45 he did the second 45 and I introduced him in between show yeah you know shows and I come out and his and so I'm up on stage and I'm I'd gone up to the top of the Burj Khalifa the tower the tallest building in the world I've now been in four of the tallest structures in the world school whatever blah blah I feel like it's pretty hot it's actually you know it looks like it's the same view you get in a landing airplane you know when you're flying into LAX and you're over that what would be Pasadena and all that shit you're that high in the air that's what it looks like I would just start shitting and pissing yeah it's all dirt it's terrible and I even said like I think it's great you guys built the Tower that high cuz that's dirt looks its best from about 3,000 feet you know what I mean like dirt up close sucks but all this dirt so great to see cuz there's no damn plant any fucking trees it's all construction it looks like shit so and they don't even like the biggest observation deck doesn't even face the water the Caspian Sea because they wanted to impress people with what the city looks like so they put the observation deck on the inside well the city has built yet so bullshit anyway so I go up the top of it was originally called the Burj Dubai based on the city the Sheikh Khalifa the the president of the UAE gave them ten billion dollars to finish the tower ten billion dollars to finish it because it didn't look like he's gonna and so on opening day they decided you know what fuck this we're gonna name it Burj Khalifa after him like this impulse thing but you go up in it I was one of the first 200 people to go up in it you know and and I go up in the gift shop all has shit that says Burj Dubai on it and it's the same bullshit gift shop crap you'd find at the Sears Tower or in Disneyland it's fucking golf shirts and and pocket knives and bottle openers and they all have burkle paperweights where there's water in it and you can shake it sandstorm maybe but they it's stupid like and but it all still said Burj Dubai on it I'm like this motherfucker gives you ten billion dollars and you can't replace the bullshit printed t-shirts in 24 hours what you say this yes so I basically what I said onstage was it's pretty rude to Monsieur Khalifa I think that you you know that you did this or whatever cuz I'm not paying for my hotel room but when I call room service they say they say yes mr. sparks they don't say the guy who was in the room before me you know and m'as actually trying to say something deferential respectful to the guy right you know well it was the fact that I said Monsieur Khalifa instead of Sheikh Khalifa that drove this one guy crazy and he stood up in the back like eight tables back and people were laughing so I didn't see this happen he was back in the dark he Jenna and he storms out of the fucking place whoa so I walk offstage and finish my set it was a great set actually I had a great time there was he's like $40,000 tables you know evers round tables in the front full of sheiks and these guys and I can and women and their had jobs and burkas and the whole deal and then their business partners from the West so I know it's really weird so I go offstage and promoters there and he goes yeah you said something that offended one of the sheiks who was here and so he called the CID the religious police and they're here and they're gonna take you into custody we'll try to yeah this is fuck that Wow we'll try and mitigate it as much as we can but the the fine could be as much as $25,000 and three day in jail and but we'll try and talk them down and it might not be a big deal cuz we're not even sure what he was upset about yet and we'll try to talk to them uh but can you go out well they take this out can you go out and introduce John and then come back and we'll deal with it so I walk out on stage and I I go up on stage and I introduced John and as I'm on there as I'm on stage introducing them I see them come down the aisle I see the religious police these these uh they're three of them in these white shirts with the little belts across their chest and a little you know stick holsters and stuff and they're walking down the aisle towards backstage and they go backstage and I introduced John and instead of going backstage I walk straight off the stage and walk right out to the lobby where they had a table set up for me to sell shit and sign things where's where I had intended to go in the first place right but I walked I just instead of going backstage I went straight out front I'm like they'll find me out there they're gonna find me they're gonna find me but I'm gonna go out there and do that shit first and let them stew you have to sell your merch so I go outside and I'm taking and a bunch of t-shirts and shit out there totally and DVDs and took pictures and blah blah and I had a bunch of people come out cuz John is Jewish I am NOT Jewish and they definitely have issues with Jews there so a lot of them came saw me and didn't stick around then one torch to Jew right assholes anyway so they come out I'm Stan and these guys are back there for ten fucking minutes before they realize he's not coming back right and so they could turn around they come out to the alley I'm right when they walk out I'm getting a picture with a sheikh and his wife like this like like you were in fuckin Wisconsin arm around both of them big stupid grin they're smiling he's got his fucking son classic sunglasses white shawl the whole deal is white burka you can't even see your fucking this is it and I'm just a big smiley picture I'm assuming she's smiling and and they they come out and they go well if he had that said anything offensive these people would be they would not take a picture with him this shaker here and his wife would not be taking pictures if he said anything were saying they'd saw it there was a so they basically said he's not he didn't offend anybody because if he did they would be mad too and so they went to the sheikh who was standing by the doorway I didn't know who it was but apparently he was standing and they walked over with their arms crossed what did he say what was the big he goes well it wasn't what he said I just thought that other people might get the Fen and he started backtracking on what he said oh so they stuck around and watch John show for about 10 minutes to make sure he wasn't doing anything untoward and I think they ended up finding him $25,000 it's fine John 25 mentioning his Judaism too much watch yeah fuck that it wasn't anything else I mean he does this thing Bob Saget is gay this song he does which like might have been it cuz you mentioning homosexuality is worse than mentioning Judaism there I think almost they conflate the two but it's psychopathy I mean it's crazy behavior imagine if fred phelps his family ran Vegas who's Fred Phelps the the Westboro Baptist yeah God hates fags that organ like imagine if they ran Vegas oh my and every time you were you were having a great time in Vegas you had to like kind of stop and make sure that nobody went and told Fred Phelps his fame do you have reservations go in there and performing there and do what you like that'll be okay I not really I felt okay about what I was gonna say and I knew that like that was an issue but I didn't think I was going through my act going is there anything that they're gonna come touch did you swear to swear at all yeah yeah there's no problem no they didn't they weren't bothered by sexual stuff you'll have to talk about sex yeah yeah really yeah how much so
