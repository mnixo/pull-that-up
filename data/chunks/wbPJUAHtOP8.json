the gyro can experience I was just on the phone with Alex Van Halen and talking to him about we're gonna be playing at the Tokyo Dome weren't playing at the big arenas they're in Japan and I wanted to remind him of exactly what you just described that in the United States and in Europe you have was like an idling cheer a scream all that's listed it's kind of like a car idling but it idles like a drag racer like you depend on it the way you do your feel your talk your punctuation you know the dough is beating you let them go you know when do you still now say the next thing that you're going to say you know so you're listening with that and when Americans cheer there's it's like a car like well I think it's called blower whine it goes for a long time and if you're waiting like to say something next or whatever you're listening for that and you're listening for it to hit a certain point volume wise or duration wise that people are making the long noise they enjoy themselves great let them enjoy themselves you know they love hearing their own power yes we are strong we're wonderful we're young and skinny in Japan you don't get that correct you get these yes yes like it's like it's sort of like cheering for the ball getting spiked in a volleyball tournament and it's quick and very quick and I said to hell you got to remember think back how fast the cheer is here that we can't depend on that idling scream and you know in the comedy show and it'd be weird where we get it laughing like you know I call it Rat Pack style but it's it's just where you've made a connection with the audience and pretty much no matter what you say as long as it's delivered in the right tone with the right mood is you're a host right the worst it that I can be on stage is a host the best is a really funny host or a really smart host yeah they'd have fun you did you're gonna help them exactly so the worst thing the least I can do is be a good host and that means keep the spirit you know okay specially if something goes wrong oh my god the plumbing just exploded then everybody everybody's instantly okay great it's an adventure you know it's a posh that's horrible oh my god this is it I don't want to be here this isn't fun this is now turning into something other then that's up to the host right on a good night if you get everybody kind of humming and bubbling and well fed and watered and you know then pretty much anything you say can be it's a little bit funny right and every now and then I hit a moment when I'm just Sammy Davis Lee we're done just straight stand-up you ever try to do never have got the nards for it because you you kind of do it a little on stage yes just a tiny bit enough to sneak up and tap the door and run back I always have those trapdoors built every like Felix the freaking cat I can draw that door anywhere on thin air and go look a song you guys don't have that dorsey's so when all of my greatest respects to the job you have chosen for me there's always it doesn't even have to wind up funny it doesn't even have to wind up clever or anything just shut up they'd be the hosts no it is already what the fuck son
