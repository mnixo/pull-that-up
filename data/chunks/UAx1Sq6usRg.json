three two one boom alive what's up ray how are you buddy pretty good great to see you man it's been a while it's been ten years no more than that really 2007 I moved out of LA Wow damn that's weird and talked about you in the podcast several times though you know what I never listened to the podcast until recently someone told in the second time you said so I think three times you mentioned me probably yoga ray yoga right all these kids are contacting me they mentioned right y'all go right on the show yeah it was cool I appreciate it I appreciate you I appreciate ya and I always thought truthfully I always thought Joe Rogan's gonna do something good I honestly I can tell you that and it may be embarrassing to say but and what I'm proud of you oh thank you don't mind me saying that of all you've done thank you that's very nice that's a funny thing to say though and you've had great just Joe Rogan time you had done some great stuff first of all stand-up comedian that's that's a great gig it's fun gig it's a great gig and if I could pick a second thing besides stand-up comedian it'd be the announcer I wouldn't want to be in the UFC even if I was good because you get pounded on it's a tough job right yeah that's why you know I went to Thailand see those kids fight they're retired at 21 yeah did you beat up keep it up the trade announcer of the UFC and you're also skilled at the stuff most people think the announcers aren't so skilled sometimes you're very skilled I just remember rolling around with you yeah those were some of the greatest memories of my time in LA is when Eddie opened ten planet yeah we had a lot of fun man I mean it was such a special interesting time of Jiu Jitsu I think that it was going to no noogie there's a demographic of jujitsu guys who didn't want to wear a gay anymore yeah what was a lot of people wanted to learn things that would transition directly into MMA and to not have the clothes to grab on to it changed the grips and Eddie was one of the very first to really truly concentrate on using wrestling grips gable grips over unders things along those lines and then the other people were still really clinging to the gay he was like a and I think the thing that I was attracted to about the Ultimate Fighting when I first saw I think the first one I saw was - you know you have C - and I was like oh man this is and you watch those Gracie in action videos and like yeah this is real stuff real stuff yeah and so I started even noticing in my game I just played open guard and I was lackadaisical and I'd always have to tell the guys hey do me a favor just try to slap me because this is getting a little unreal I don't want to I want a real life situation right and I'm figuring okay I don't want to get but I don't want to get caught up in the guinot geetha right now but I always felt like you know real practical fighting I'm the guy may not be wearing a tuxedo I think both are good because like you live in New York New York gets cold if you get into a scuffle with someone I hope you never would do but if you did and he was wearing a jacket like yours you could manipulate him with that jacket and they really probably wouldn't know what to do yeah you know this is a real benefit like being a judo player if someone has a winter coat on yeah like if you had a fight with Karo Parisyan or Ronda Rousey or someone like that and they they're wearing a winter coat they'll fuck you up you know they just grab that thing yeah okay yes all right well I'm glad I learned that way yeah it's good way to learn it's good it's good for defense too because the guy keeps you from just yanking out of stuff and exploding out of things you have to be very patient you have to be if to use correct technique anyway it was appreciation and it was one of my biggest lamentations of moving away was not to be around that whole Posse and then I never expected it to get as big as it did I know so believable because back then it was like the seed I used to bring my my big kids who were big now I used to bring them and they used to just box we used to do it at UH legends known before legend oh bomb squad that the bomb squad wow that's crazy that's old school yeah that's 2000 what - somewhere else yeah it was cool it was a great time I just got my purple was super excited and then Eddie just got his black you guys Brown is black super quick yeah where that got his brown and then he beat Hoyle er and then he got his black yeah I was there that day and that was crazy when John Jacques took it off his back unbelievable that was heavy yeah it was a good place to be a good time it was it's like when you look back at those times it's in it was an interesting era it was an interesting error for us as humans it was an interesting era for martial arts there's a lot going on and that 10th planet was really a hub of exciting innovation and still is but it mean back then it was this really unique thing this this completely nogi branch of jiu-jitsu that's directly connected to John Jacques Machado which is a totally re conservative legit mmm judge Aquos is you know I was always impressed with him - he still roles man he's a my age and he doesn't get injured like he might have like a little tweak here and there but he's so intelligent and he's so technical and he's just so good that was I'm saying was only because I'm not there anymore but when I was going there I was like this is such an amazing place Jean Jacques Academy the quality of fighters you would get there yeah I mean that was also at a time where there was no jiu-jitsu in America I mean was you have to travel yeah ginger squirrel get the fuck you have to be into it and go somewhere and to have that many black belts at a school mm-hmm that was like unheard of in his class one day and there was like eleven black belts I was like this is crazy and it wasn't like that no there's a random rogue black belt somewhere and say you know somewhere in Portland or something like that you had to find him it was a lot of purple belts teaching schools and blue belts teaching schools in some places even that was a great time to get in jujitsu oh yeah like I went I started with hens Oh in New York yeah I went there the day that Matt Serra got his purple belt wow that's crazy it's not crazy it was it was it was such a cool interesting time would you Jitsu that place is still the top place in the world it's pretty impressive and it was such a great guy - he's the best he's so nice week I gave him a CD of my band just as a gift I just met him and he gave me a krugen ghee Wow yeah that's legit whoo super legit questions was the the ghee but that was the ghee yeah if you had a krugen you know it was a fair trade I wasn't a trade I just wanted to give him a gift and he just like without thinking just threw the back at me he had a great attitude well he still does he's so loved that guy said I mean that's one of the really nice things about jiu-jitsu is the camaraderie and the friendship it's like it's very different than I was it's compared to other martial arts in that the problem with striking martial arts is that you hurt each other all the time you never developed a sort of closeness that you do with jiu-jitsu because you're always trying to kick each other's fucking heads off well you know I did a stung a yoga for years where it's sort of silent and you're just doing a set series of poses mm-hmm I could be with people like every day for a year and practically never speak to them right I remember meeting a guy at the DMV I was like I know you you're right next to me every morning for two hours but you've never spoken worth jiu-jitsu you become best friends with the guy you walk out with like 20 new friends you know each other so well to look you know when someone's breaking you know when someone's exhausted you know when someone's getting better you know has really been consistent you know and you roll with someone they're super sharp you like what you've been doing well what are you going four days a week now you see it yeah they become like your best friend yeah well it's also like we appreciate when someone's really good like if you roll with some of them they're really good and they start getting you and they didn't used to get you before you like a pretty league you get excited I got a ramp up my game cuz he's doing something doing room do we have a different metric with all these yeah well I remember you being one of the first guys that I knew that got into yoga and yoga is a huge part of jiu-jitsu now so many people that trained in jiu-jitsu I think I'm JIT by the way I'm Jiu Jitsu illiterate now I still know what did you see when you stopped will your brown belt I was purple I was purple because I didn't I stopped going to John Jost classes and we just wanted to and I think it's sort of before Eddie started giving out actually maybe he did he get who's giving out no but I just wasn't it was confusing it was confusing because I was sort of with John Jacques right but I I wanted to do the noogie stuff yeah and Eddie had this natural flex has this natural flexibility that I related to and he's my size and I related to that and I'm not like I was never super athlete in high school or anything like that I was short but I was flex I was reasonably flexible in yoga got me really flexible and so i apprec-- okay he has a really great close guard game I want to learn that from him and I really sort of like honed in on what he could give yeah and so yeah I never like approached him hey can I'm a belt mmm do you ever who's a vulnerable weird time my life but you know did you ever feel the desire to do it again yeah I do every now and then I go back but yeah when I train because I trained with you guys and trained with jean-jacques it's hard to go to something it's hard to do it now he's twenty years later all the stuff I just and I just did some Jiu Jitsu the other day was at some school and someone got mad at me for i I guess it's illegal the some of the stuff I did what did you do um I did a bicep scissors that's not illegal it's not legal someone know someone could play then I sat on someone's chest I do a mount where I put the feet forward I don't remember how you said mmm with that yeah and I'll crank their neck yeah not to tap them but just to have them react and give me an arm or something so I my feet are forward I'm sitting on their mount I pull their head up and they panic or something and throw an arm up right and then I'll take a triangle right arm bar so I did that to someone until you can't neck crank listen I didn't know you're going I didn't know that's not a good school it's that's those are legit techniques neck cranks are legit right you know I just went to bed you illiterate yeah but no I don't think so and then here's a deal I don't want to I don't learn this stuff to win points right you know I want to learn now I want to learn you know that's how I know this other guy was on your show James James wells yes great guy ultimate fighter great guy yeah no I knew him cuz I used to do some knife fighting with him oh yeah he's a tactical instructor yeah he's real he's super rounded guys yeah very rounded yeah I knew him right when he just started jujitsu you see he did a debate with I saw the guy I saw out opposed commander this is very interesting because that debate really should be like 15 hours long we only got into some points that the other guy fucked up and got incorrect and you get in the weeds with nutrition stuff you know because he was a part of that game changer documentary yeah yeah you know I heard that documentary was good i sat down with my kids to watch it it's interesting it's like there's a lot of it that's not legit and then there's a lot of it is like you can eat only plants you can you can be healthy eating only plants but you have to do it right and it's not easy and it's different for everybody and some people it does not agree with their body it's not the optimum way for them to eat for some people when they get off of it and just start eating like more paleo or they start eating grass-fed meat it feels so much better like I just don't know if there is a perfect oh no I do know there's not a perfect diet for any like for every single human being on this planet it's not like one diet that you could lock in and if you ate that way you'd be fine everybody's different people have all these weird autoimmune disorders and shit and a lot of them are triggered by certain carbohydrates and plants and and when you eliminate those things from your diet you find all these skin problems clear up and when I try to figure out what's that all about and there's all these people to think that maybe it's there's certain toxins like oxalates and polyphenols and stuff that exists in plants that might trigger your your gut sensitivity or autoimmune issues in the gut this it's so in the weeds man it's like infusing you can go on and on and on debate about details mhm and everyone has a point yeah they all have a point the the vegan people have a point when it comes to ethics when it comes to animal rights when it comes to like cruelty and factory farming they have a point and then the health conscious people the people that are like you know I don't give a fuck about that I'm just I'm just trying to be healthy and I heard up all my my my diseases by just eating grass-fed meat and I'm just gonna buy it from you know ethical ranchers they have a point to right well last appreciation for joe rogan okay really for it for what is I was appreciating your independent thinking it takes a lot because it's really easy just to opt into one side mmm and sin dig your heels it's bad for you though it's bad for you it's bad it stops you from actually free thinking and that's a problem with anything you get it to be so politics yes or be it a religion or spirituality or be it ethics and diet in everything everything the way behavior I think people have to realize that you are not your thoughts yeah you are not your thoughts you're you're a person and you you accept thoughts and sometimes become attached to them but though it's not good to do sometimes you should re-examine those thoughts and don't don't hold on to them as if they're a part of you people argue points they'll argue subjects and topics as if they're arguing they're very value as a person they're very value to exists and it's crazy it's not a good way to think if someone tells me I'm wrong everyone's instinct when someone tells you wrong it's like no you're wrong for you you're getting to this right petty world but my my disciplined reaction when I'm doing it correctly is to go hmm okay how am I wrong what did I do wrong and just do don't take it personally just these are not this is not I mean if you've made a mistake that's just a mistake people you're not a perfect person no one is everyone makes mistakes so if you make a mistake about a fact or a subject err just pause just pause and take it go okay what what is running in is this person correct are you wrong or are they incorrect and you know can you can you correct them without getting personal about it too can you that's another thing like can you tell someone that they're wrong or that you believe they're wrong without it getting weird you know that's that's hard to do as well because then that other person is gonna be very attached to what they've said I mean people dig their heels in it's yeah these are all these are all points I'm working on in you know my book I'm working on which is sort of extracting all these teachings of ancient yoga but not not getting lost in just philosophical thought not getting lost in how to make it relevant and practical but it's exactly what you're saying yeah it's hard for people it's hard independent thinking is it's difficult nowadays because it it see it's not the easy way out right it's either easy to have clothes picked out for you and her ideology picked out for how you're supposed to look and where he's posted and if I'm a Democrat I'm supposed to be like this and not like this do you remember bud bud Brett's Minh he was one of the guys I trained with us at John jocks he was older guy younger guy he's my age at the time you know he was in his 30 but only wears black he's been on this podcast before he's a good friend of mine he lives down the street from me he only wears black okay he wears black shirts who wears black pants I go why remember him I go why do you only wear black and he goes I don't have to think about this way it is good it's a nice way to think he grew in his closet like oh my god it's a crazy person it's like all black t-shirts all black jeans like what the fuck he wearing but he never thinks he just puts his pants on like that's one less thing I have to think about I was like all right that's his thing everything's black easy yeah it was black sneakers check black pants check black socks all right that's his thing and he doesn't it doesn't have to spend time thinking about his image like it's just this he said what's a burden yeah that was the one thing I really was relieved for me as a monk I was a monk yeah yeah you know my bio worm I do know I know jiu-jitsu I don't I don't even know how you called me up truthfully it was a weird situation I was traveling with a bunch of student I'm a yoga teacher by the way my name is rockin off ray well how did how did you get that name so rocky Knauth was oh my name's since about 91 a teacher in India gave it to me oh and does that work how'd that work it works where you you approach teachers that you that resonate with you that sort of speak to you the universe sends you people that speak to you I mean I'm sure you found that in your own life there's certain people that explain something better than anybody and it might be at different times in your life and then the teacher feels you're ready and they want to like sort of like give you a mantra they give you a mantra and the mantras mantra sound and the sound is very powerful because sound affects the way we think they say as far as transformation in yoga like we do if something very physical and it starts to transform the body you're into yoga now from what I know of you know we both I guess when Reese touching each other but so then you have an appreciation for yoga cuz it radically starts to change your body and then starts to sort of slow down the pace of your thoughts and your mind and your in doing helps with your endurance in your cardio and all that stuff so the grossest way to change is the change of the body and the breathing start to also change your cardiovascular system your endurance and then of course the sounds that we hear they say are the most transformational and it's almost hard to believe especially coming from the West because in the West we're thinking you know sounds how's that gonna make me healthy but it's all about sound that creates a healthy mind a calm mind a connected mind the mind can the idea behind yoga is it can go to a dark place the mind can go to a very dark place very quick and those thoughts you were just as we're not our thoughts but our thoughts can get us into trouble and give us some jail and get us divorced they could cuz they can the thoughts create an action and so we might have an external cleanliness but if we don't have that internal cleanliness it's you're not actually healthy so there's a different metric of what health is in the yoga system and we've always taken it in the Western world to be well we're gonna you know health means fitness you know and so we're gonna become fit but you could be fit and be angry you could be fit and be resentful you could be fit and be unforgiving and so then the next question is what is actual health in where is where what is full-spectrum health look like right and that's sort of what I love what yoga addresses and I feel like what we are doing therein and these great martial arts teachers that we've had teach us is how to be sort of almost like you're fighting this fight mm-hmm but there's no rage you're not actually even angry at the person it's actually just you're just doing what you're supposed to do right now can I be completely relaxed and do this under stress under guys try it's guys trying to choke the life out of you yeah literally yeah I had that I had I had a I had a fight back then I don't like to fight I'm not like I don't look at myself as a fighter I looked at myself more as a meditator I got in a fight right at that time probably when I saw you last what happened a guy it was in Santa Monica guy just stole my car oh wow it was my first date with my wife is our first day we've married 16 years a guy stole my car and how did you catch him well we are walking up the street and she said oh you left your lights on in your car and I said now I have a I have a Saab you need the keys to turn on the to get the lights on so I can't be my car but my top was down was a convertible Saab and the top was down and I was like man that is my car had my lights on and then I realized there is this dude in my car trying to start my car and my wife left her keys in the glove compartment and I guess he opened the glove compartment went into a convertible which was open I had no long was what was old Saab 900s I used to have and you put the keys in and he just couldn't start cuz it wasn't the right keys so I don't I don't know if it was because of yoga or jiu-jitsu or whatever it was but I was so calm about it I just said hold my sweatshirt and I was super skinny then I was like I don't know if you remember my diet was I was a hundred percent raw foodist vegan like you know a buck 47 soaking wet with the crystal in my pocket you know and I just said in a very calm way I just said hold my jacket and I ran I jumped on the back of the trunk I jumped over and jumped on his head and then I and I'm small so I Drive real close to the steering wheel and I slipped behind him and tried to choke him but I couldn't get deep enough behind him to get the choke in and it was this big dude I couldn't really tell from when I jumped it was a big dude I just said and he said you trying to choke me I'm gonna kill you but it was such a stall mate because he couldn't move I couldn't get the choke in deep enough and it was just a stomach and it went on for like three minutes just there whoa but I was just breathing and then it went back to grab my face and you do that thing in jiu-jitsu we hook the guy's arm with your leg so he had that I had that arm trap he couldn't move I couldn't move my wife was looking at me she's not calling the cops she's just like looking they're shocked this is your first minute it's our first date it's midnight in Santa Monica right down elections right you know by the coffee bean or something yeah and finally we stand up in the seat we're standing the press and my windows are up at the top is down I cup his neck and I punched him twice and he grabs me by the shirt he I grabbed him by the shirt and we throw each other through the windows oh gee and they snap and shatter we fall out of the car over the door and roll in the street and I put him in my guard and then he just at that point I think he just turned and ran and I pulled his shirt off check this out I had his shoes his because his shoes fell off they were sort of like untied adidas his shoes fell off his pants dropped his ankles cuz they were low sagging pants his baseball hat fell off and he pulled this and I had a shirt and he ran away and we're both covered in blood cuz there's glass all over us and he runs away in his underwear pulling up his pants in his socks and that's the story my wife looks and I like what you call the cops she's like I don't know that was sorry look is the coolest thing I've ever seen I was like I was the coolest thing I've ever think I've ever done she's like he could've had a gun I was like I know I he could have actually killed me I've never you know I don't know how I would react again if that ever happened but that's just what happened I think it's because it was sort of like in that mood of this is my duty I have to protect my car right and also the other thing is you are used to like pretty intense conflict when you joined you just all the time and then you don't we do MMA yeah we yeah and that was all this yeah yeah and all those guys had jean-jacques sorry are the cops mm-hmm I'd call them cops or robbers they were seized like one of them well the thing about jujitsu is you do it full blast right you don't you don't break arms or actually choke people unconscious if they tap you go but you're that trust moment yeah you're going as hard as you can that's the difference you're so accustomed to that so when you're rolling with this guy also people that aren't accustomed to that they they feel vulnerable panic when is guy gonna do feel it right away they feel awkward they feel strange yeah like I've rolled the people that don't know how to roll just joking around rolling with people like come on let me do jujitsu with you let me see what it feels like they're helpless they're helpless helpless it's a weird feeling that's like what you look like a normal you look like my size you know you look like Lee and I should be but you're you're vulnerable you're so vulnerable right it's just like it's such a big learning curve is so sharp it's so sharp it's so sharp but once you get to like Bluebell purple belt it's like that area like a regular person has really helpless they really are you know it's you know it's interesting even with that fight I don't look at myself as a fighting guy or and I definitely don't look for fights but it's almost like you're learning a game you know and then you realize oh this game is completely deadly yeah it is a deadly game it's exactly what it is you're playing a game I'm trying to kill you you're trying to kill me but we're really good friends that's the crazy thing it's like a lot of guys who have technically killed me you know because I have a tab they're my they're basically good friendly my best friend yeah they're really nice you know and I can't wait to try to kill them again like it's a very strange thing to practice but it's very cleansing like the pieces that do it all it's a therapy yeah they're so peaceful yeah I don't know if any other I don't really study Marsh other martial arts except a little more Thai in Thailand but um but I wonder if it's you get the same cards you don't have to pull yeah you'll have to you know either go light or you I mean in Thailand if it's like I went to kick a guy and he blocked it with his shin you know it lifted his knee and I got a bruise from my ankle to my knee that was like yeah it's brutal its brutal spirit yeah I might have to condition the shit out of your shins it takes years to yeah that it's just a different sort of camaraderie this real camaraderie was striking but again it feels weird because you do hurt each other so you don't have that same sort of on that you have in jiu-jitsu also this is a thing in jiu-jitsu is body contact like body contact is different you know it's like you're oh you're like like people who don't have good friends they they ever hug yeah right there's a lot of men who don't want to be touched by another man like yes I don't know why I'm not I'm not giving a reason why but if you go hey what's up and you go and hug them or just shake them they like they're just grossed out yeah touching of another man yeah you got to get over that quick yeah I mean how many times have I talked about jujitsu with people and the people that don't do it so you roll around with other guys isn't that kind of gay I think people say that all there wasn't that video out there at one time jujitsu that's the gayest sport around remember that it was from some TV show oh yeah they're like I'm gonna learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu yeah yeah well I mean look at some of the positions like being the guard or being on someone's back whatever so you were the first guy that I knew that was really into yoga back then I knew Hicks and like when that documentary choked yeah it was great doc that was a great documentary it showed how much jujitsu and yoga together made Hickson this really incredible force it was the yoga had affected his mind in this great way cuz he was able to meditate and he would do all these incredible yoga poses he was so flexible and he had such dexterity of his arms and legs I mean a lot of people got excited about yoga because of Hickson but you were the first guy that I knew that really went so deep into it you actually became an instructor because when I first knew you I knew that you were in a band and that you you did yoga then a little bit because everybody called you yoga Rey but it's like I felt like you were on this path and this this yoga pack could tell and then pain essentially on social media and following you that's like well he's really into this shit I remember when you were moving to New York we had talked online and you were going out there to teach jujitsu or excuse me yoga and I was like I don't even think he does jujitsu anymore I think he's just all doing yoga now and that's what happened right you know I did music for most of my life with the youth of today you thought today was the band before I became a monk and then I and at the height of that career this was a New York City hardcore straight edge band we didn't drink we didn't smoke and we you know we're all strict vegetarians oh that's me yeah the more relaxed form so that's what I did as and and the idea of the band were teenagers we're all teenagers me and my bed buddy parm Ananda who also later moved into an ashram so we started this when we were in 1617 and there's a cool scene making our own music and stuff like that but when we got youth of today together it was about sort of a message of better living positive mental attitude these spiritual principles like karma and what goes around comes around and respect dignity controlling your senses in your mind and what what led you to that no really no I've always been interested in my idea of a good time was this was like 80s in New York City was you find these like eesti West ebook stores that have books on yoga and metaphysics and reincarnation and just plop it down and read books all afternoon by Swami's and sadhus and weirdos and palm readers and stuff like that that's my idea of what a good time was and I always felt like life is meant for our self edification that's why we're here we're here on a mission of growth and when I and when I read books by sages or mystics and things like that I was always like I want to be like that that's what I want to be that's bigger than anything out there that I want to be so truthfully the band I never really want I'm not a musician I play a little bit of everything I wrote all the songs but I always looked at myself as more like a seeker and it made me a spokesperson but then at a certain point in the success of that band I started realizing okay now we're big and there's a lot of people who are following those sort of principles of controlling your senses we don't drink we don't smoke here we don't take drugs we're you know we can care about what we eat but that's not the goal that's like a doorway to something bigger and so for me I had to step away from that even though it wasn't bad or anything it wasn't what I wanted to become and that it was a certain point in my life you know you get to a certain end of a chapter in your life and it for me in at the time was the height of the Bands career as well we started touring internationally and stuff like that but I realized there was no amount and and by the way this was 80s in New York which is a very cool time Run DMC Madonna The Beastie Boys he never knew like what was about to like blow up and you were with all these other people that they were your inspiration and they were your friends and stuff like that so at that height and excitement I just said there is no amount of like material success I want that's gonna fill sort of like a god-shaped hole in my heart there's nothing out there that I want and it was it was also a very precarious time in my life or not precarious but a time where my father went into a coma for three years I know it's all right it's so horrible to even say think about it what happened was he got some unknown lung infection was young 64 the unknown lung infection and there was some neglect in the hospital and his lung collapsed and so comas are one of these places where you don't is he dead he's is he alive and it's so confusing for a person that loves that person how to even react and you know in it I'll say in a humiliating way I couldn't real I couldn't deal with it and I sort of shut myself off and I went and just started working on my music something I could do and then at his death when he finally left his body I was cultivating a strong desire to go to India and and study more and I was at that time I was also studying yoga Ayurvedic medicine so he went into a coma for three years three years hard and then when he died at the end of the coma at the name I never came out of the coma and when he when he left his body I decided I'm going to India now this is that was a sign for me and I quit the band and this is at the peak of the band it was at the peak of youth of today yeah was that hard to walk away from all that you know what I was at a point where I was saying and you probably experienced this too and I'm sure Eddie probably does too sometimes when you become very successful at something that same thing sorts this the thing that you love sir can eat away at you as well sometimes sometimes the peep I'll share it I'll share with you how I how I saw it I remember sitting in an ashram on 24th Street a Shiva Nunda ashram Shiva none there was like a Swami he came he traveled the world he taught the teachings of yoga outside India and he wrote lots of books and there's a library of books worse bookstore up on 24th Street where he has an ashram in New York City and I remember reading this one quote by him in the midst of my life is in a band and being a teenager living in New York City and it was before you first so the first one was really interesting where is your happiness coming from is it coming from your day-to-day living or is it just happiness from your ego and I thought ah where is my happiness coming from is it from me being a person that I want to be is it from you know people people nowadays they collect houses they collect cars they collect so many things I collected records I collected rare Punk records and in my brain I thought oh man this and you understand what the music scene was like that if you're unfamiliar with it there was a band that was great and they put out one thousand seven inch records and then a band broke up yet the punk scene always grew so these what records you bought for two bucks are now worth people pay $100 for that record and so me and my guitar player Purcell we had like thousands of incredibly rare Punk records that if you remember the world of records no one played their records because you could damage them what you did was you put everything on a cassette and so I started thinking about this quote by the Swami who said man where am I getting my pleasure from I'm thinking well my records are pleasurable I was like well actually the music's pleasurable the records are only pleasurable when somebody comes over my house and says oh my god you got that record that records Oh impossible that again and so once I've read that it was the first shattering of my concept of self and where what is joy and what is pleasure based on my ego and all those records that are really valued and I had really valuable records and we started our own record company at the time so we would basically print limited editions of their Bant we put out all our friends records sick of it all Gorilla Biscuits these are all bands that we grew up with our own band youth of today and so we put out these records we'd make a limited edition and then we trade these it's like printing your own currency basically to make a long story short after I've read that one quote my whole concept the pleasure changed and I took all those records and I threw them out on stage to all fans record collector fans it was all it was one all the rare ones it was so liberating for me to do that it was like the shit was like maybe like the first attempt of shedding my ego that was a roundabout story but the second part of what that Swami wrote was and I'm paraphrasing this of course it the diseases of the soul are not new they're ancient the soul is pure the spirit is pure but it gets covered by lust greed anger and envy and I started thinking I don't let me lost lusty I'm not greedy I'm not angry I'm in a band I have no money you know and if you've ever been in the band it costs money to buy a guitar got a guitar cost money to buy strings got strains cost money to buy an amp so it's just like it money pit to be in a band and get paid 50 bucks or whatever so I thinking not me but as my band got more successful I realized man I do have there is money out there that I want and I remember got I got offered money for the first time being a band Wow I'd get money I should get you know I wrote these songs I should get more of that money you get in a fight with the drummer no I should get that money we should split it four ways no way I just so much more I booked everything and I realized wow I wasn't not greedy I just had no money I I'm covered with greed people hate the greedy hate the rich hate the 1% you got to see what would happen if you were in that position yeah so that was like my first lesson in like actually I'm complete I thought I was above it because I didn't drink cuz I didn't smoke because I was a vegetarian big deal big deal and it was these and the spirituality starts to work on these subtle things that are plaguing me and you know the people who really want social justice out there they're it's very easy to point the finger at everybody and watch what everybody else is doing wrong but in on the yogic path it's about like putting the microscope on ourself where am I wrong if I really want to change how can I start to really do some psychic surgery of my own ego of all these other things that are that are there baked on to the spirit so anyway that was I can't remember how he got on that tangent I'm sorry I'm going tangents a lot feel free to go into engine that was a that was my first like glimpse of like where I'm at and so my point was my success oh you you said what was it hard to give up the business and I was like no I was so over it I was over because here's another one Envy that plagues the soul they say so there's Pete there's people that are looking up to Joe Rogan I want to be like that and there's people that maybe you're looking although you're pretty big right now I don't know if you're looking up to anybody but but they're the feeling like in a corporate world where someone wants your position hmm and that plays a person a person who's not gracious or a person who's like there's a scarcity mentality there there's a younger but I know in the music world there's a band coming up and there's a band I want to get to and I realized that all these real subtle things they were plaguing my heart and these are the things I wanted to work on and yeah so yeah was it hard to give up no it wasn't it was great I think even relinquished it you were on like a spiritual quest I was less legitimate one people talked about that kind of stuff all the time like getting spiritual or being on a spiritual quest but you you legitimately went on this quest and that's why I found it so fascinating that's that was what was so appealing to me it's like okay this is a real one because there's not a lot of real ones there's a lot of people that pretend to be on the spiritual quest want everybody to think they're spiritual it's like you were talking about the pleasure what's the pleasure of owning records well the big pleasure was people coming over your house to think you're cool because you have these records it's the coolest record man that's the same that spirituality in a lot of ways what people love is the fact that someone finds out that you do yoga every day where someone finds out that you meditate someone finds out that you've read these books the ego so damn sneaky isn't oh it's so sneaky and sometimes it's fucking obvious shit like you know it's like a funny story um Bryan Callen when I first met him he's with us too yeah yeah yeah I love that guy to death but when I first met him I went over his house he had apartment in Venice no doorknob the doorknob had been broken out so you could just open his door and walk in anybody could open his door and people would walk like he would come downstairs and there was a homeless lady cooking in his his kitchen she goes son you got it going on and and he was like what it's just eating my food she was just cooking food in his house but I came over his house and he had a book I forget what book it was it was something obvious like Catcher in the Rye or something like that sitting on this I go it was just sitting on his coffee table you're not reading that book I'll give you put that book out here so when girls come over to think you're smart and it's like you're so right of a fraud we're both howl and laughing but that's a thing that people do like people want a well-stocked library not just to read those books read the books then but yes but it's also there's an issue where people want people to think that you're this brilliant erudite interesting person because you have all these books in your house like that's that's there's a there's a factor in that they say that jiva or the spirit has to go through a tail elements in each element to leave the material universe this is according to the Yogi's and they get progressively double in size and the last one so the first one is earth and then that last one is you go mmm it's the hardest it's the biggest of all of them and it's so refined even people you do altruistic things you do things for your self betterment it gets wound up in religion you can sign up and diet it can stand up in politics it gets wound up and in race and it gets round up wound up in animal rights it gets wound up in against animal right you know everything that evil is that is the biggest thing and you could sort of see it on a person too and I and and and almost better than seeing on some someone else is to see it on yourself that's like that's the work of the yogi it's try to see ma'am I was motivated by that yeah look that was a motivated again mm-hmm so yeah it's a constant um checking in with the ego I think that was part of my I mean think about it I came from sort of like a scene where everything everybody had to be cool a certain way there's a certain look a certain dress certain you know sneakers we wore certain haircuts we wore and then we're dopey robe mm-hmm and I'm walking around and it you know it was you how long were your month I was a monk for about six and a half years Wow yeah and it was a it was a great time of life and how old we limit I was 22 so from 22 to 28 you a month I was a monk that means celibate no masturbating nothing for seven years seven years of I lived in ashrams in India and in America and I traveled all over the world actually but it was it was I but I'll tell you what brought me to that place after them after being very materially frustrated and I said two main factors were some type of material success I wasn't the Beatles when I wasn't you know Michael Jackson but I had somewhat ears I had fans and then realizing how life can get taken away from you in a moment with with that precarious place my father was at it just made me start thinking what the hell am i doing in this short in this short life what am I supposed to do give me some GPS give me some where do I go from here what do I want out of life what is the what is a home run is it you to be as very famous is that is that the home run is it to be collect tons of stuff is that a home run is to live a natural life is that a home run is to learn some art you know some type of art is that a home run and so this was like my burning question and now it's still a New Yorker and was still sort of like you know New York in the 80s was a little street smart New Yorker I'm actually from Connecticut but I started hanging out in New York City my parents were New Yorkers and so we stood my older brothers lived in the city so I visit them but something that time I was 14 I used to just go to New York City and just hang out on the weekends and when I became a monk or what and went to India I had saved about 25,000 bucks not a lot of money not tons of money but it was you know some money I made and I thought in my brain okay this is my cynical self I'm gonna go to India I'm gonna meet a guru the Guru's gonna want all my money this is how it works but when I actually lived with the monks in India especially India then 1988 there is no central a/c and it's hot there's no heat and it's cold in the winter the showers are freezing because all the water's kept on a tank on the roof of the ashram in the summer that water super hot because it's all kept on a tank on top of the ashram there's no creature comforts whatsoever you go to bed early you wake up super early you go to bed you know 8:30 you wake up three o'clock in the morning there's nothing that there's nothing to buy there's nothing to purchase all the fun things that we like to to like ease the pain of existence are not there you know there's no movies there's no television there's no comedy there there's nothing and so two things happen when you strip everything away from a person they lose it they hop the fence so to speak and I've seen that happen or they learn to find their pleasure from something more subtle and so when I first went there and saw the joy of the monks I realized they don't want my money they don't want anything I have to offer them I want what they have that was sort of a game changer moment for me I want to figure out how to be connected with nothing what did these guys do all day everybody does every I storms got their own thing you know it means you have chores that you do to earn your food like yeah you know every ashram is gonna be different and every spiritual path it is Christian monks and you know monks from different traditions around the world I'm sure they all got their thing different things but later I started doing my next band because the interesting thing about the bhagavad-gita the bhagavad-gita is you're familiar with it's one chapter of the biggest epic in the world the Mahabharat and it's a it's the most studied and discussed and commented on by all the saints of ancient India people even bring it to politics and stuff but it's a real conversation between the spirit and divinity and it's a conversation about just about it's just it's just considered ancient wisdom for all people so the one of the ideas of the Gita is you don't give up what you're born to do you do what you do but in a spiritual way you don't try to like wipe out your desires it's not gonna happen you take what you do and you do it in a way that is going to assist you in your liberation and as can assist everybody else so even I'll say I love comedy but I want comedy that uplifts me and not doesn't degrade me I like entertainment that when I walk away from it I learn something I feel like I'm growing I feel connected I don't want stuff that's gonna just give me darker thoughts like the Joker I've never seen it you didn't see it I didn't I want to say that I live on a farm I look at a farm we've rare I rarely watch anything except comedy I love comedy because I think laughing is important but I don't watch so much TV so I'm pretty if I do go to the movie movies it's out of like with my wife let's just we want to go away from the kids we want to do something right but there's no plan on what to watch but I'm open to good ideas The Joker's a really good movie but it's really dark he's really dark you walk out there feeling really confused thank you like did I like that like that I know it was awesome I know it was really well done but did I like that and it's just it's a it's complicated I mean we could get we could talk about the Joker for the next two hours you know you know the mind is like a garage and you you become like what you store in that garage so the thoughts the thoughts that we put in the mind we got to be careful with the words just we were talking about mantras before these mantras are like repetitive sounds but they're considered trans-identified chant the hare Krishna mantra so the Christian of mantra you might have known it from the soundtrack of hare Hari Krishna Hari Krishna Krishna Krishna Hari hari hari Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hari Hari it's considered a transcendental sound for the mind and it sort of connects this the soul with divinity it doesn't matter what religion you are it's considered a mantra or sound vibration that is a potency on the Mon that's where they get the word mantra from it delivers the month or the mind so what we store in the mind starts to create our external being and if you don't believe in it it's one of those things we have mantras in our mind anyway I have things on loop running through my mind that have been handed to me from parents from from elementary school teachers from crazy uncle for whatever we get things handed to us and we play them on repeat and sometimes their mantras of self-deprecation self-loathing you're not good enough and these are the mantras running through the mind so and the yoga system says notice those monsters that's part of self edification or self-realization you notice what's playing in the mind and you replace those mantras with transit dental sound or at the very least training the mind to see greatness in people that's a big thing because the mind the way the material mind wants to see those shortcomings right because if I find your shortcomings it makes me feel better about myself that's crazy thinking it if you've got thousands of shortcomings that doesn't make me better at all so the material mind which is sees one a cell insecure that I have to lash out at other people to make myself feel whole and it's just crazy crazy thinking stinking thinking whereas the yogi trains I specifically teach bhakti yoga which is a it's it's a it's called the yoga of connection or the yoga of the heart and it starts to deal with all the essence of the teachings of the Gita which is you train yourself to see greatness in other people and if I start to note it's good you could take this from a micro like my relationship with you I want to notice all Joe's great qualities now when you hear that you might think well he doesn't really know me I got some bad qualities it immediately makes you a little vulnerable and you start to think well but you appreciate it and and anybody in our life who appreciates us sometimes they even see things in us we can't see in ourselves we want to become like that that's why this idea of changing the world really starts with your self connection as I am a spiritual being Joe is a spiritual being and I start to train myself in not seeing what Joe does wrong seeing everything he does right and it's a great exercise for the brain what does that do person do right what is the good in this person that I that I'm overlooking cuz I'm just I've got these lens it's a lens that we wear of trying to find shortcomings in people and it screws people up tremendously even so-called spiritual people mm-hmm I've said it rolled yeah you could work me anytime you well so you spent six and a half years living like this in this ashram just going to sort things out no no sex no masturbation what are you eating that of it what kind of food they serve you a strict vegetarian diet and and not only that the ID this is an interesting point too and it's debated about in especially you know I was a raw foodist so that these wrong who is there all everyone's got their take on medicine and healing let me share the yogi perspective of it okay the missing ingredient in food the vitamin the superfood that is never spoken about is love food is supposed to be grown prepared and then offered and the offering is not even to a human offering us to God that's called Prashad food is first called bhaga bhaga means it's for enjoyment and then you take that enjoyment but before you enjoy your offering it first back like in sacrifice the idea is that everything in this world is not for me everything is I'm not the center I'm here to serve the center so all the food takes on the consciousness of the prepare of the food hmm so to eat junk food or to have people in very low consciousness cooking your food you're taking that into your body you're taking the consciousness of the prepare of the food do you believe that I definitely believe it yeah I definitely would feel a tangible effect if I walked outside that line so for years I'd only eat food cooked by Brahmans like like the priests of the ashram or I would cook it myself or later I have a very weird story which was I became a bunch of friends that were monks we started our own band and we started a record label a second record label in the ashram I kid you not it's almost an unbelievable story and perhaps the first time historically there was a celibate rock-and-roll band but this band end up ended up becoming bigger than the second band this was my band shelter and so what happened was this band when we started though we were all monks and we would take a candy stove on tour with us and we'd pull over the side of the road and we make kid tree with rice and dal and you know fenugreek and coriander and cumin and we just cook him because we wouldn't eat outside food because if you did you would you would you would feel it you would feel it affect your mind really I kid you not that's like that I can say there's certain things like I don't know there's certain things that they speak about in ancient indian literature that i can say maybe i don't know so you think miletti there's certain things that I know I definitely experienced think most people are just numb to that numb to the effect of taking the consciousness of someone who's on a low vibration is cooking your food you just numb do it you just heat the food cuz you're hungry art people there's numb to it the people that aren't aware that concept yeah people are aware to kind I mean that's an example a home-cooked meal definitely feels yes taste better it tastes different or feels feels different yeah as opposed to some guy just and you know you know making burgers at White Castle or whatever it yeah so so I don't know it depends on that but it's a perception or is it as an actual energy oh and doesn't matter I think it's both mm-hmm there's it's almost like fire is gonna burn whether it I believe it or not right but there's is there is a concept of once you get that food you don't eat the food you honor the food mm-hmm so it's not going to be like me shoving stuff in my mouth which I do occasionally all right if you've seen my eating habits but it should be more of a minute the eating itself should be a meditation and it's been proven I'm not one of these guys there's a thing that's there's a similarity that's gonna seem like it's not it like it's not a parallel but in hunting when you hunt an animal and you kill that animal and you butcher that animal and then you feed it to your family it's a it sounds almost hypocritical it sounds like there's no way that would be a spiritual feeling but there's a connection to your food that's very very different well we've divorced ourselves from killing animals for the most part for the most part most people hire people right most people have no clue where their fruits come from their vegetables come from what a cup what you know what a Brussels sprouts look like when they grow what a bananas look like when they grow what is ground round you know right so we've divorced ourself from our food and that's sort of anyway I understand what you say there's we've definitely divorced ourselves from our food but even agriculture I'm sure if you raised cattle and then killed them and ate them you would feel differently than buying it in a supermarket but there's something even more intense about the quest of acquiring a wild animal you're going into this world the first time I ever saw a wild deer that I was going to shoot I swear to god it was like a psychedelic experience I was like I was looking in the eyes of this thing in its world this wild world in Montana and I realized like whoa this is a different dimension like I'm entering into this wild this thing might not have ever seen a person ever and it's looking at me and I'm gonna take its life and I'm gonna eat it and but in the way I was encountering this thing because it was so intense and there was so many it was nerve-wracking it was difficult I was exhausted we're in the mountains were trekking for hours and hours and hours to try to get close to a deer but the locking eyes with the deer I was like oh I didn't expect like he saw you he saw me and I saw him but it was also there was there was a sharing of information there was a an acceptance of the roles that we both had that made me realize this is his life this is how he does every day every day he's looking at mountain lions and there's a wolf over there and there's a bear over here I get the fuck out of here like this is the existence and that bringing that meat home was infinitely more enjoyable than getting something from a store and also just felt differently it gave me gratitude I had a connection to that animal and made me think about it every time every bite I took I didn't take any of it for granted I meant a lot I wish that everybody that ate meat went out and hunted yeah it's just there's not enough animals there's too many people in the system you know look we we fucked it already we fucked it already with cities we fucked it already with large-scale agriculture we fucked it already with mono cropping we fucked it already with you being able to buy food any way you want is the reason why there's so many of us at the end of the world Joe it's not the end of the world it's a new world it's I mean obviously right now ready everything's fine look feel that everything's fine we're in this room it's sustainable I mean people look at it in terms of the extrapolate like if this happens and that happens we keep going oh my god it's gonna be awful in 10-15 years guess what they thought that when the car came out they thought that when the printing press was invented they thought that when when people stepped out of the caves and and started building huts this has always been the case of people we're terrified of change you know I'm not I'm not terrified that the world is ending that it's unsustainable we have problems we have challenges for sure but one of the big ones is that were divorced from nature in a very very strange way and most people are urban population centers most people don't encounter nature if you're in Manhattan your best bet is Central Park which is the most bastardized zoo like form of nature you're ever gonna find the right it's not real nature like where you live you live in upstate we got bears yeah foxes yeah real nature it's real nature you guys have ticks I don't have Lyme disease but it's a serious thing too huge them it's a huge thing and I pulled off many ticks a bull's eyes on my arms and you get antibiotics right away yeah yeah yeah they're fuckers a lot of kids have lunch a lot of people have it it's terrible so horrible it's they said there's some area of the East Coast where something like 60% of all the ticks Lyme Connecticut well yeah that - yeah you know a lot of people think that that was initially some sort of biological weapon I heard yeah you ever get to the bottom or you I don't think anybody's gotten to the bottom of it but there's enough inquiry that serious people have started researching this and there's an there's enough real concern that that was the original origin of it that it really was some sort of a biological weapon that escaped from a lab because there's no doubt that they've invented biological weapons she no doubt they've experimented on different ways to fuck people up and one of them is mass illness and sickness and it's just a fantastic way especially if you have an immunity if you're vaccinated you can expose other people to it they had a vaccine for Lyme disease but it wasn't effective not only was it not effective it actually gave people arm disease well in fact my managers dad got Lyme disease from the vaccine for Lyme disease yeah fun times yeah like boy I don't want to get this Lyme disease better get vaccinated and then also why do I joints hurt how can I neither and fucking pain every day how come I can't walk right well you know when I lived out here you just have to actively look for nature we used to go to Stoney Point mmm in that place a panga and you know I used to take my kids when they were little all the way down victory I think victory dead ends and then you there's all those mountains and then yep victory yeah you just got to make like a plan you know and in and I will say when people come up to our farm you know we run a retreat center and when people come up there the first thing that thing is oh my god the Stars it's like you're divorced from the moon and the stars that's the stars are big man I remember the first time I went to Hawaii I went to the Keck Observatory in the Big Island and we went up there and we got out of the car and it was like you're in a spaceship like you're in a spaceship and you look out a giant window and there's nothing else just space like a movie you see the full Milky Way and all the stars it's SPECT ocular up there and this is one of the reasons why they have the observatory up there because it's really high it's like the where we were was not the very top there's the top and then there's a visitor so that's right yeah the visitor center I think is like I want to say like 10,000 feet or something like that but then you get even further up like 1213 and then you hit the where they have the telescopes up there on the Big Island it's fucking amazing it's amazing if you get up there on a clear night when there's no moon which is what we got really lucky because I've been back since one time was cloudy and the other time we fucked up and got up there it was a full moon and just wasn't the same wasn't the same but when it was no moon man it was spectacular like life-changing like like you look at it and all the sudden you you have a fresh perspective like oh we're a part of the infinite there's a spiritual experience you get when you just throw yourself under the stars you're like oh I get it yes I'm tiny I thought I was big but that's a that's a real symptoms a real issue and a real cause of why we're so disconnected and why we're so egocentric and so we're not humbled like here's here's an example where do when you think about people that are humbled they're like cool people you think of two things you think of people live by the ocean and you think of people live in the mountains because those people are confronted by undeniable evidence of the majesty of nature undeniable like tiny yes part of something much bigger also you're surrounded by like I lived in the mountains outside of Boulder for a while and when you're driving up there you're you're confronted with undeniable spectacular beauty that really is fuck every painting that every one's ever made it's all see snow-capped mountains with a lake and just trees and you see a deer bouncing across the road you see a fox like fuck this is amazing I mean it just changes your physical state to look at you like whoa like no artwork could ever do but we don't think of it like that we just think of oh there's the mountains well there's something about beauty right there's physical beauty in terms of like you see a woman that's beautiful and you're looking at symmetry and you're looking at genetics and there's something that's a try active about that because of your DNA right your you want to breed with this person because this person has beautiful symmetry and their true but there's another kind of beauty there's a physical beauty in nature that's spectacular that doesn't serve any real purpose for you like why do you feel that way why are you enamoured by this vision of this glacial River running down through these mountains and seeing these birds fly around an eagle soars away why is that so spectacular why is it so attractive that's I don't know but it whatever it is there's a feeling that you get when you encounter those things that's unlike any other feeling and we are divorced from that feeling it's one of the best feelings that a human being can can get when you could sit down like one of the best best things about hunting is just sometimes like you take a break and you sit down on a ridge and you're just drinking water and just look now it fuck right this place is amazing it's just amazing for do the Grand Canyon yeah I've been but not since I was a kid yeah yeah another one of those things it's like is this even real yeah I know I mean but you know what I used to have a bit about the Grand Canyon about people telling you oh my god you have to go you have to go the Grand Canyon is so amazing I go yeah you know what's amazing that look up look up above you is infinity you're looking at a fucking you look at a tiny girl you can see the bottom it's very good look look up you're in fucking space there's actually quite unbelievable Tamim one yeah but that is the one that we're most divorced from so think about the the beauty of seeing nature of trees and lakes and seeing fish jump and amazing this the beauty that I got from seeing the sky from the Keck Observatory with no moon just all stars it was just like humbling just humbling beyond words like reset my idea of where I fit in and where earth fits in where people fit in and made me feel in a weird way at least temporary before where's because it's just you know normal conditioning temporarily more connected to people I felt more more in tune with people more like we are in this together we're all we all need to help each other because we're all flying through infinity and any at any point in time a rock could just come down here and slam into this fucking plan take a quarter just like yeah like this I could do with the dinosaurs yeah and kill us all it looks like the good has done multiple times throughout history and they're constantly recognizing these new areas or impact craters it happened 70,000 years ago yeah they're always finding them they're always finding them they're like oh geez look at this no one no one no one prepared for it no we can't you know there's stuff these reductionist scientists these guys you'll talk to them like we have a solution we could stop but we could do this we could do that but then you talk to the real hardcore people that actually study the the the complications involved in deflecting asteroids and it's not and they're like no we need years we need years and years and years of planning if we find something coming our way and we know it's coming on us we need all the best minds in the world and it still might take a decade to figure out how to do something about this well and then we might see the other one that's coming behind the Sun we might not see one it might write coming from a direction that we're not observing but when you can't how about one you can't receive yeah yeah there's a lot of those too we don't even know we don't even know what we can't perceive right yeah but the vulnerability that comes from that feeling is also very freeing it's not a bad vulnerability was the vulnerability that I got from looking off into space didn't make me sad or scared it made me in awe yeah I felt better I'm my kids went to a Waldorf School yeah they were that yeah my oldest kid went to one in Boulder when we were really there yeah so they went there some graduated from there and my kids weren't there they've been home school for the last two years but there's a strong now they go to this this survival homeschool camp no ruins yeah it's they make fire by friction they're outdoors like all day long flying deer I'll just give it right now flying dear dot-com that'll work but they're outside all day long like nine o'clock in the morning three o'clock in the afternoon Wow they're built it does matter what the weather is it's like I'd even drop them off like in the rain I was like I'm so sorry but get out but you know they become resilient they become strong and you know what they do when they come home them and all their friends got 13 kids it's like 50 degrees out there playing outside in the drizzle barefoot and they're just like strong and happy and connected kids these homes to it they get used to it and when I become like a domesticated dog yeah right we're sort of like you know they're not wolves right they're domesticated dogs they like their food from the jar yeah ever made the bag like Marshall you met Marshall is he domesticated oh my god what do you think he's as domesticated as you get yeah that dog is the sweetest thing that's ever lived Oh Marshall your dog yeah Marshall I'm sorry yes it's true yeah he's well he's well kept he's the sweetest of sweetie pies sure but that is a domesticated animal I know mmm coyotes come into my my property and a sheep and so uh I got my dog all right come on let's get those coyotes to see him I ran outside the dogs just like goes back inside yeah yeah you got to get the dogs used to coyotes just like your kids are used to the outdoors yeah you got to get a dog who knows the Coyotes an enemy I'm living my I'm living reliving my childhood that's interest in my kids how far away you from civilization up there you know the cool thing is not that far if I need to go to an Apple store or something it's like an hour to Albany that's not bad yeah two and a half from Boston oh you're only two and a half hours from Boston two and a half from New York City oh that's not bad yeah supersoul farm and yeah it's uh we do like our yoga workshops and things there and some people travel to you people travel to us we have weekends we have a whole sack you know 5000 square foot house for guests a yoga studio on the property amazing it is cool it's crazy got a swim pond wow there's something cool about when it's hot out like it does get in the East Coast yeah you could just jump in a pond oh yeah yeah but you also get parasites I drink it man comes right from the mouth and I drink spray well you're pretty high up then are you high there's nothing above me okay yeah then your are sort of in a valley and it comes right from the head the real issue is beavers yeah if something dies above I guess well shit - its beaver fever you get Giardia right I drank out of a lake in Alaska and I was like really intense it if Jeff is a lake you can because this lake is a glacial lake or excuse me it's a high elevation lake and there's no beavers of that altitude it was on Prince of Wales Island and you could actually dip your thermos into this lake and drink it it's the cleanest clearest water you've ever seen it tastes perfect exciting yeah it's actually exciting yeah I think when I first moved to the East Coast I was just looking up different Springs Saratoga Springs great place there's just all these natural healing Springs you should test that water the before you drink it though they're publishing it to someone to shake that bitch up there are ones that are just coming out of the side of a hill let's just go - yeah a regular basis we have an artesian well on our property which means it's just naturally coming up mhm or the t-zone I got to get the wiki on that one but I think it says right sure of the the pressure of the downward push is forcing it up mm-hmm what is the work well yeah artesian I always see it used in terms of like handcrafted things artesian yeah it's like an artisan art that's artisan I start a cetacean work I think that's how artisan I'm sure I'm fucking this up what is that a cover of your phone this is our this is a gift this is our podcast we do wisdom of the sages oh you have a podcast everybody's a fucking POG I'm waiting for my mom start one up wisdom of the sages it's uh we do it every it was boy okay it was born at a mission relating to or detonating a well board perpendicularly into water bearing strata Liang I hate when I read something that makes less sense as an angle so that natural pressure I think you're kind of getting it though natural pressure produces a constant supply of water with little or no pumping the water from artesian well okay so I'm I was fucking it up with artisan I was connecting the two of them I spelled it that way when I looked at it first it's that's a RT is a and the aquifer e I and yeah the place that I lived in Boulder had a well was amazing you get this beautiful spring water like straight out of the ground it's just incredible all your water that you drank was just perfect spring water to come on these copper pipes it's great there goes our T's enol versus RT medicine is pronounced artisan a person skilled at in applied art that's well that's arson yes describes water with spouts out of the earth under natural pressure that's it yeah and so sometimes these old houses in upstate New York or in Massachusetts have water that's just coming up and they build a tank in the house to hold this water yeah it's great way to get water yeah you think that's going in your body on your body in your skin in your mouth it's becoming you as long as no one's fracking nearby that's a that's that's probably on its massive probably ever seen that movie gas land no it's a great movie to heartbreak at you angry it's hard yeah because they're doing that right there's people in Pennsylvania that it was just reading a story about recently where they can't drink their water they can't shower with their water they have to get bottled water if they travel someone else's house to shower it's fucking horrific it's heartbreaking yeah they poisoned the water supply with the this desire to get oil but on the other hand we don't need Middle East oil anymore so everybody's like look the United States produces we're self-sustaining we no longer need the Middle Eastern oil but yeah but what about these fucking people that can't drink their water or it comes out of the spout and they could light it on fire my teacher rod not Swami who you would love on the show he wrote a great book if you ever want to breed a good sort of a some modern-day autobiography biography of a yogi it's about a Jewish kid in the 60s travels hitchhikes from London to India Wow you can do that I think yeah but the most part you can you gotta go through Afghanistan all these hmm Khyber Pass and he hits her in Afghanistan that's gangster he's super gangster man yeah he had a good he had a great experience it's an all real adventure too and he ends up in India living in the Himalayas with sadhus Wow incredible incredible stories called Auto bug a journey home autobiography of an American yogi Wow yeah I want to talk to that guy you could hook me up with him yeah he's great I I spent a month with him every January really we do what we do a teacher training a yoga training in India every January I just got back from it yeah I saw it on your Instagram it's great it's super fun we do it we have three academies we have a music school where we study Indian music and kirtan we have a 300 hour training for people who are already teachers and we have a sacred literature she's studied the Bhagavad Gita and all these sacred texts we were talking about that before the podcast I really wanted to get into that eventually it's you know like the the the mystical aspects of the Bhagavad Gita and of the Mahabharat all the ancient Indian texts which are filled with really wild out there shit you know I mean it's all real in what way just like all the things that you say like well that's interesting that's fast fascinating that's fantastic the more you get into you me lies that's for good real like what look what's real everything from like the vamanos vamanos eye things like that I can't say a real but I could I could understand how things can be made of subtle energy explained V monster if you man is like a spaceship yes it's like it's a spaceship from and they speak of spaceships and flying crafts but they're not made of the same elements of this earth right so we have all these things about you know and I get it there's a bunch of people making up shit about about I saw an alien etc there's also very qualified people you know airforce Colonels and things like that I said I've had them in here you've had a bit yeah they said look at it and that they suffer from the same thing these people of these who claim abduction it's not like a type of neurosis or schizophrenic stress since yes like they something happened they disappear they were found two weeks later do you remember the story of Betty and Barney Hill no it's the most famous abduction story it was an interracial couple from I think was the 1950s or the 1960s and just random my interviews always go here I had this girl on the podcast this woman on the podcast yesterday she's an MMA fighter her name was Angela Hill she's a couple days ago actually this badass MMA fighter and at the end of the podcast goes I forgot to bring this up my grandfather is Barney Hill and I was like that guy I'm like no fucking way that guy Barney Hill was the very first like really public UFO abductee and there's ricourt and he describes his craft that's eerily similar to the crafts that Bob Lazar is described and different people described in he and his wife lost time while they were driving and then woke up with these bizarre horrific memories that they both shared of this encounter with these space beings and that they were abducted and they were medical examinations were run on them then they were replaced with missing time and it's crazy we listened the recordings of him being hypnotized and going through it like screaming and fear that they're touching him and the were they taking and what are they doing to him it's not like a guy acting it's not like a scene where a movie where someone's screaming in fear it sounds real and I just the teachings of ancient India is that life exists on all planets it even exists on the Sun and so the first argument we like come on how are we going to exist they just still have bodies of different that are different than yours I'd have a fire body and therefore I'm trying to look at how does a person with earth and water body live in the Sun they can't right you have to have a body I mean I used to think like this when I was 13 years old right I used to think like okay why can't my dog hear those sounds but I can't hear them right what am I missing what sense am I missing that I can't have objective reality yeah you know what am I missing am I missing a sense well I have this this principle called the the fart theory like if someone farted but you didn't have a nose you'd have no idea you'd have no idea of no ID but oh god what is that our theory is the beginning of trans identify yeah because it's there's a sense that you possess that allows you to access ya recognize something that's invisible you can't see it you can't feel it you can't hold it there's nothing you don't there's no way of detecting it other than you're all factory senses but through your nose you can detect uh something's awful what sense am i missing that's keeping me from understanding absolute reality sure I mean that's one of the things that you feel when you take psychedelics like this is opening up some new sense that I was this around me all the time I'm just not tuned into it because I don't have the right chemical composition flowing through my brain when I start to teach a bigger training yoga training and philosophy it's one of the things I do mainly I start with this concept of this is how you understand like when I first approached teachers when I went to India I would say things like I'm reading this Mahabharat I think it's a great book a lot of great lessons here but come on we're adults how am I supposed to understand that a elephant-headed man scribed this entire book can't we just extract a a useful lesson and the answer was very good that I got was and it was very sweet it wasn't like cruel he just said what do you know I sorta like caught me off guard like what do you actually know right what do you know and I and use this example you from New York okay suppose 300 years ago you're living in New York your family's living in New York your tribe is living in New York you have a certain amount of animals and animals that you keep animals that you ride animals that you hunt foods you eat and then one of you go was on a boat to Africa and you come back and you think you're never gonna believe what I saw I saw a striped horse you thinking well I've seen striped horses white head black neck no no no no I saw striped horse if you've never seen a zebra it's almost unbelievable if all you know is ponies right or I saw this horse with a really long neck that ate the leaves on the trees come on man it's all fantastic because we've never seen it right but that doesn't mean it does so to really understand the Vedas the teachings of ancient India you have to go into it like not that it's all real I'm not saying to just blind faith but I'm not saying don't be a blind doubter like it's all unreal that's bullshit that's crazy that's nuts it's got to be could be I don't know but I don't know a lot what do you think the Elif what do you think like Ganesh was Ganesh the being by the way when I speak I'm speaking it's not it's not my feelings and whether I'm right or wrong seeing this is what the veil I'm a yoga teacher so I teach what the Yogi's teach the nationís ganache is a being he's a Jeeva Jeeva means he's a soul like in India they say you don't have a soul you are a soul you have a body so the bodies change but the soul is eternal so that's called the Jeeva tattva you understand that you're separate then your your we are separate than our bodies we were said like you said earlier we're separate from our thoughts were separate from our subtle body or mind so you take on a different row ghen machine a raghu raghunatha machine and sometimes the machines are good at warfare fighting sometime the machines are good at art sometimes the machines they're they're just like a different vehicle you would drive they different so you got a Porsche or you got a 18-wheeler they're both good for different things so in the same way we have some karma as we're karma ties then you have some karma to have this body that has such good fortune or poor fortune or some great success and it's the Karma of the body but you have to leave that body so Ganesh is also a post Brahma is also a post you could have been a Brahma in a previous life or could be one in a previous life and you get a body just like you get a body in this life according to you how you act and how you behave and how you think and the people you associate with they give you a body for example if you and I grow up together and all we talk about is martial arts we got pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger on our wall we start to create a body that emulates those heroes and if we couldn't care less and we just like watching TV and do nothing we get a body according to so in this lifetime we're making bodies then we're making our minds we're making our intelligence but the Yogi's say that everything that we do is a practice just like I just found out today that you were tight Glendale champion by reading your bio I know you read my bio I read your bio on Wikipedia I was like I know more I just know you from just rolling around with you and that type of camaraderie so you got that way from a practice it didn't just like spontaneously come you practiced and you bring that practice with you wherever you go and you can get better at the practice or you can get a little good a little down the practice but the Yogi's say that everything that we do is a practice it's our thoughts our intelligence our skills our spirituality our addictions they don't just fall from the sky we work on them and you'll hit and that's why there's these things which another thing I don't know if you've ever done this on your show study the lives of what are they called savants or like these prodigies it's unbelievable four years old musical prodigies yeah like where is that coming from the Yogi's say it's not random it's not weird it's not quirky it's not unexplainable it's a practice or that was that child chess player from Norway who could play like six people backwards and meet them and not that he was not facing them he's memorizing their board where do you get that type of intelligence the Yogi's say it's a practice or Mozart and Chopin or like virtuosos at for how hmm and you'll hear you'll see like the saints of India they'll be spiritual virtuosos like from a very early age like my teachers teachers teacher like a was a grandfather teacher he was like a master of Sanskrit at age 4 whoa and could give class on it and could imagine that at age 4 he doesn't say you know what I was doing you know when I was doing age 4 I was wrecking shit I was breaking things yeah lighting things on fire you know Shankar Acharya another great like teacher of India age 8 he renounced the world at 8 initiated 10 thousand disciples changed the course of all of India at 8 he wrote commentaries you go to Columbia University read commentaries on the gita by this person who at age 8 walked away from his mother and said I'm leaving for the forest it's it's unbelievable this stuff's unreal you behind this and I tell you when you got it one of the fun things I do usually is I do that school in January the Academy but um in October and autumn time I do a pilgrimage we go to holy places and I take students like 30 or 40 students to holy places and we just meet interesting cool people we go to we go to temples we'll go to sacred places we sing we sing it's fun it sits at the very least it's like a fun experience but it's also like very transformational and you just meet the most fascinating people it's still they are India's changed dramatically since I went there in 88 but huh huh how so oh it's like the whole you know you I mean there was no phones you wanted a phone you go to the village there's one phone in the village you know and also because when the internet came you know if you think about India it's such an interesting place like when Greece was in its infancy India was like a respected hub of learning metaphysics spirituality etc so India it's been invaded by moguls by British by Portuguese so many different cultures came there and they can never really quite change it it was so woven into their DNA what they were nothing changed it until my lifetime and I watched it I watched when cable TV hit India and it was paradigm shifting cuz you gotta think you know people dress you know you go to Germany in the 80s people dress different you go to Italy in the 80s people dress different I mean there was no like globalization of now it doesn't matter you go to Paris Beverly Hills Scranton Pennsylvania there's the same Victoria's Secret there's the same gap you don't you don't want to dress like gap well we got this other store you could dress like and they're just selling us sort of the same thing people used to go places for spices places for silk places bright India was sort of like that too you went there and you feel like I'm on another frickin planet and now you got to dig a little deeper to find that that's why I recommend people go as soon as possible because everything is gonna I mean we're in the valley right now and there's one point up on one of these streets up here we want to follow your heart yesterday I've ever been in that room yeah sure love that place it's great place all your heart great little grocery store - a great grocery store but there's a one little tiny block where there it looks like the valley from 1950 and then there's massive high-rises around it you know and so we've what you know in our lifetime we've watched places just get paved over and it gets sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse but truthfully there is a disconnect with nature often even sometimes in the it's better now that disconnect with nature I sort of just like I feel more connected I mean I now I take people on pilgrimage and we stay at hotels and it's definitely not like the old days when I used to slum it in the ashrams but I miss that slum in it - mm I miss sort of like just being out there in the elements when it was freezing and there was no heat you were forced to take a cold shower you know there was no creature comforts you take a bus and you enjoy it now looking back on it I enjoyed it then yeah there's something pleasurable in renunciation I bet you can identify with that yeah yeah when you have to do something that you don't want to do for a higher purpose but you're gonna do it anyway there's a pleasure you get this is a giant roundabout we went to but I want to get back to Ganesh oh yeah so what so what are you thinking that is there higher beings now you might say well what the hell is that me to higher be the idea in the in Vedic thought is that there's davis or higher beings and then there's the devotee daiva the hot like a judeo-christian tradition would say god how much of what these people were experiencing and talking about in the bhagavad-gita and all the texts it has to do with soma and has to do with psychedelic rituals that they were participating in while they were doing these things so much do you know about so much so funny said that yeah it's a commonly known thing I think yea soma is a beverage on the moon okay the moon is it's a it's a beverage right it's just that it's a combinatory beverage the psychedelic Shore Accra meant that we don't we haven't established by the way I'm speaking like a matter of fact I understand I don't I don't know this yeah well I'm saying it could be true and this is what they like all right that's how we learn the Vedas these are the ingredients it's otherworldly you can't try to recreate it on earth there's plants they say that grow that don't grow here and there's meetings that grow now we just hear these stories and we just it's myth but you know what the zebra is a myth I live a man I live around a bunch of beautiful turkeys but if you ever seen a peacock turkeys look like boring you know what I mean peacocks are unbelievable they're not doing wha Quetzal is unbelievable you know a pencil sketch loses South American bright colors what's his name crazy Montezuma war hat so when you if all you know is Robins an occasional Cardinal when you see a Quetzal or a peacock it's like yeah right so someone could say well you know you're really gonna believe in the wind-god come on but we say hey look there's an ant on the table and I blow on the ant hey ant runs for his life in the ants brain he's not thinking oh ragu is blowing on me he's just thinking Danger Danger Danger yeah I'm actually beat I'm a being I'm a being with a family with ideas with thoughts with a home so the Yogi's say you don't know but there's they say that everything is a personality not just you because in one sense if I look at you you're just a big lump of earth and flesh you know water blood whatever you whatever you want to whatever lens you want to look at the periodic table earth and Chinese elements in Indian elements however they're going to look at matter but you're not the Yogi's say you're not that you just have that so they say the earth itself is a being it's a living being and all the animals are living beings and outside of the earth they're ours living forces that all the planets are beings that's why there's here's a get ready for a detour that's why if you study Geo teach or Vedic Astrology there's different mantras to the different planets because the planets affects your karma so some people want to they realize man like I would love to get your chart done mmm because when you have people like yourself or even myself on a lesser level where we have some some types of extremes in our life you can read it in their chart it's it becomes very obvious same with criminals it's in their chart really if you really knew how little control we have of our life it's shocking now this strategy is is they called Joe Tish or Vedic Astrology and it's based no straw I'm no astrologer I just have had my charts done a lot it's an ancient system it's not based on the Sun it's based on the moon and what do they need to know they need to know you're your birth time your longitude and latitude of where your born like for example I was born on I'll tell you a good story do you mind sure I went to a great astrologer once and these guys are really simple humble like humble people and they lived in an ashram and I said I want to know my chart and he just said I'm not very good I said come on I have heard you're the best he said I'm not very good and I said but I will tell you what Paresh ara thinks of you now Paresh ara was the father of the person they say scribed or spoke all the Vedas vyasadeva was one of the great sages of india so par char was his father and he's responsible for Geo teach or the what's called the horror Shastras where they get the word horoscope from and these are all to do with studying the luminary studying celestial bodies and to pinpoint you in relationship to them so he said well at a certain period when you were born there was a rising sign a rising star and from That star we can calculate your chart so he asked I gave him all my statistics birth time and date and longitude and latitude and then he opened up these books that he had on his shelf this guy doesn't know me from Adam he just goes this is the star of music and spirit and you will spread music and spirit throughout the world whoa it's pretty right on I've been through some very powerful astrologers palm readers mystics who don't even need your palm they say their astrologers or they say their palm readers they look right in your face and tell you all about your life and I kit and I'm not one like I've met many who could blow your minds I don't have to be someone who doesn't doesn't know who I am yeah well it's hard to find it's hard for you but I'm less known but in India no one knows - anyway but write it but but they won't have to go to India it you know it's one of those things and I'm not one of these new-age guys right I'm a New York skeptic okay but you believe in Ganesh but I know I believe goodness could be could he be sure sure could be I think most likely people are taking soma and Ganesh appeared to them then or that because I haven't seen things on psychedelic experiences that are very similar to that very similar to a God I think psyckadeli can bring you into this you know otherworldly realms and even according to the Vedic concept is there's other realms and everything's divine and everything's there everything is a person and there's thirty-three million gods and then of course out and that's within the material universe right and the material universe has higher planets it has lower planets like the Christians would say hell but their's they talk about whole mandalas or discs um layers of hells but they with these differences from Christianity and I don't know where the Christians actually got a got it from or when it was added or subtracted but the Vedas teach about none of them are eternal meaning you don't stay there just like we don't stay here we're just sort of doing time on this planet we do time we're learning a lesson you get some karma you get some good good or bad karma but we and if you don't learn your lesson just like jail if you don't learn your lesson sometimes you get added and add it sentence or they can all have these yeah okay you two life sentences you know right but sometimes people are out early they get they get paroled they get pardoned or they get or that or they just say okay you're in charge of the library you're not dangerous you're not a threat and we're gonna let you out your good behavior so according to how we behave in this world we're perpetuating ourselves we're going way low we're sort of go high and people go high all the time it's impressive and you take that micro and put it on a macro as well and to the degree that you sort of don't learn your lessons you just that's okay I've noticed in my own life if I don't learn a lesson I got to get that same lesson again mmm you know what I mean yeah I've had this conversation with someone about the idea that you will live your life over and over and over again until you get it right and that you will be reborn you'll have the exact same existence and you do it over again and this is this is a concept that some people believe in now I said how do you feel about that now like that's terrifying and I'm like why is it terrifying when living is not right it's the same thing it's the same thing like right like if I had to live this life over and over and look I'm having a great time I have a lot of great friends I have a fantastic family I have a wonderful thing that I do for a living I am very very very blessed I'm very fortunate if I had to do this forever why the fuck would I complain about that when I'm not complaining about it now maybe his life's not as good as yours but am I am I scared of the Eternity of this existence when I'm not scared of the temporary nature of it that doesn't make any sense like why would I be scared of something that's ultimately very pleasurable like I enjoy life I enjoy my children and my wife I enjoy my friends I enjoy my occupation I enjoy I enjoy reading I enjoy watching documentaries I enjoy encountering new things I enjoy these things why would I be upset if this went on forever why would I be upset if I'm gonna be reborn again and then I'm gonna be confronted with the exact same problems that maybe I fucked up when I was 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 but this time I'll have a better insight I'll have a subtly better perception of what is the correct thing to do what's the best thing to do for everybody what's the the moral the ethical thing to do you know and I don't I don't know why that's terrifying to people but it is it's terrifying the idea of doing it over and over and over again illy Oh Gracie believe that Ellie Oh Gracie believed that you must do the the exact right thing at all moments in your life or you're going to live your life over and over and over again until you get it right I don't know what those Gracie's were connected with in right well they were connected with everything man yeah that's one of the most spectacular families it's ever the face of the earth I mean you want to talk about a contribution like the the contribution that the Gracie's have made to martial arts including our instructor Jean Jacques Machado who was Frank that he's a cousin of the Gracie's like they're all they're all trained together they're all together that that family a Leo Carlos you know yeah I mean every Carlson all those people they created this most spectacular martial art out of the origins of Japanese jiu-jitsu and judo and then introduced it to the whole world and literally changed hundreds of millions of people's perceptions about fighting out of this small family in Brazil don't believe it's amazing and they're all champions they're the whole family's filled with champions and look that's what made our you know that's what made our friend Eddie when Eddie tapped out Hoyle er Gracie and Hoyle er was the motor option to the family to artists and I was there I flew I went to Brazil yeah we flew together with uh who else was there the blonde Jamie Jamie Jamie yeah Jamie Jamie Walsh I don't know what I haven't lost touch with him I don't know he owned a moving company he had a fight organization for awhile called Pangea he was putting on MMA fights yeah Jamie was my trainer for a long time oh really he's a really good trainers good writer yeah I remember I didn't know you went I know he went yeah we all flew together 2003 flew down to Brazil and Eddie caught oiler in the Triangle and I'll never forget it I was watching it happen I mean I was right there I was on the side let's get that up on the screen I was watching it happen I was well I watched the triangle get locked up and I'm like oh my god he's got him oh my god I was like I was thinking wheeler probably is gonna get out of this right he's toiler crazy but I'm like that doesn't look like he's getting out of that that was so locked in and Eddie had that masterful guard still does but he always had this incredible guard and it was Saudi and it was unique yes it's if you're not used to somebody's yeah game mm-hmm yeah I don't think it says anything bad about Hoyle er oh but it does say that there to create EDIUS geniuses he's creative like I've heard it like his music is and he tapped another world champion right before he tapped Euler he tapped gustaba dantos right before he tapped Hoyle er I was there for that too and I was like holy shit and then he was a brown belt at the time which is really crazy but then when he locked up that triangle I'll get emotional if I think about it I mean I was there on the side of the mat watching I was like I can't there it is so he tries what he did he threatened on one side and then cinches up the triangle you know what tell me what the crowd was going like that dude total silence let me tell you what happened what they had done before this had happened see he starts pulling the head and once it pulls the head boy this is right where hoes fucked he's tapping he's tapping he had a tap he was going asleep this right there in his corner and then a whole crowd must have been like yeah I'll just happened here who's this he walked off and he made it look like it was no big deal because he had a fight Leo Viera right after that he had fucked up his rib somewhere in this scramble - and when he fought Leo Vieira he was really messed up but when you guys came back that day it was on hand ammonia lievable was pandemonium that people know it's hard for people outside of the jiu-jitsu world yeah to understand the magnitude of that accomplishment but for me you know Eddie's my best friend so you know flying with him to Brazil was like you know epic it's it was just this like ultimate support thing it was like we're gonna do this you know I'm gonna help him he's gonna do this but when he did it do they shut off all the matches while it was happening they killed all the matches outside of this main match and they put it on television because Hoyle er was you know the multiple time world champion he was the most accomplished out of what I mean he was accomplished nogi yeah yeah well even gay I mean coiler in competition had accomplished more he competed more than any of the other Gracie's in straight jiu-jitsu he had competed an MMA a little bit but like hoist obviously accomplished the most in jiu-jitsu in MMA hoist was the innovator he was the first guy UFC one UFC to me that was those are the most important moments in martial arts voices accomplishments in my opinion he's like that's the most significant impact but Hoyle er in terms of jiu-jitsu and juju suggests to Jitsu competitions he had accomplished more than anyone he was a multiple time world champion and when he was competing everybody watched everybody knew Hoyle er was the fucking man right and so when Eddie tapped Euler it was silent I mean silent we're in Sao Paulo Brazil I mean and we're sitting there and Eddie is walking like this and Jaime is just going holy shit and I'm going holy shit we were just like what just happened and we walked off and there's a video of us like going through the back hallway of the arena we're going what just happened how the fuck did that just happen it was crazy it's crazy people stunned no no one could believe it you know no one could believe it yeah but you know I think he gave hope even people like myself like oh I get it you just figure stuff out and there's hope for me it's not like I think that's a great thing about martial arts you you always we're always looking for who's God mm-hmm and you back then Vitor Belfort no one could be felt Belfort and everyone takes turns and then he gets beat right and like almost like breaks your hope I'm like in God okay we're looking for that superhero right but I think the beautiful underlying story is like you can do that you can you can work your way up this ladder and figure out some unique stuff and with Eddie he was like he wasn't even a black belt yet that was the most crazy thing like he just got that brown belt yeah well yet about a year so okay I believe I believe he was a black belt or brown belt for at least a year or so because 2003 when I met him he was a purple belt and I met him in 1990 that's when I met him at night honey I used to train with Hinata okay though he's squeezing the head there that's us that's incredible [Laughter] dream it we just couldn't believe it frame that fuzz just crying he couldn't believe it it's crazy it's crazy I wish I went dude it's crazy to just watch now in there you know they interviewed him after him after he did it it was crazy man it's hard to even watch it wasn't just that he won he tapped him out off his back I mean he used the ultimate expression of jujitsu which is you know in a vulnerable position the man's on top of you and you still tap them it was amazing you know and as sort of loud as a big person as Eddie is he's actually and if you know him what you do he's got no ego about him there's no I never feel like always making fun of himself he's super hey if you don't know him he seems like who is this big male boisterous he's super humble he's super he's he gives all the credit to the Gracie's he loves the Gracie's yeah and he loves John charge yeah that was a you know there's moments in your life where you just realize like wow like things are possible that was a possible motive the things are possible it's a weird things can happen you know I was talking to a friend of mine about imposter syndrome that uh imposter syndrome yeah you know that feeling you know expression no it's you get it when like when people think that you're really good at something and you don't have a lot of self-worth or you you you have this perception of yourself that you're not worthy right you know it maybe as an artist that's it's a big one that you have it as an artist like I had it forever as a comedian and I probably still have it a little bit but less so than I used to because I'm just more accomplished and more understanding of what it is and the more engrossed in the process and I I know what it is now more than I did before okay and you like what I meet famous people if they know who I am I'd be like oh I gotta get out of here this fucking person knows who I am I'm tricking them right trick they don't know and they like hey man I love your stuff I'm like no you don't you think you know you don't trust me let me get away from you right it's like this imposter thing and then sometimes things enough things happen where you go you know what I think I might be legit I think I might be legit like this is so crazy like I thought I was an impostor forever but I think I'm gonna relax and just concentrate on the work and not worry about whether or not I'm an impostor anymore and just concentrate on the work that ego is always there yeah that's always there man and but the ego it's interesting imposter syndrome is often more prevalent in people or legitimately talented and for some strange reason because when you're legitimately talented one of the ways you become legitimately talented is to be ruthlessly self-critical because that's that's how you get really good at something and in ruthless self like I remember Katt Williams was talking about himself once and Katt Williams is a crazy person but a brilliant comedian and he said something that I have always thought and he's like I'm not a fan of me and he goes it goes like I don't you know I don't particularly like me you know it's like that is why he's great because that makes you work so hard at like the worst thing a comedian can be in the beginning is sure of themselves and then incompetent at the same time it's horrible that's horrible because you're not good but you think you're amazing and then you understand you don't know why the world doesn't think you're amazing because you think you're good because you're delusional you have this sort of artificial image of the world that you've put up in in the world you are the center you are the center and you want everything to evolve around you and the worst thing in terms of for comedy you people have you enjoy what you're doing they have to enjoy not not everyone's gonna you're always gonna have some people that don't enjoy no matter what but you're trying to make it an enjoyable experience for the people watching you now if you are delusional and clueless and if you you don't understand how people see you you you have a distorted perception of reality distorted perception of your own your own your own presence it fucks up the vibe for the audience it fucks that they recognize it too quickly because comedy in a weird way is a spiritual pursuit for the person who's making it because you're putting together thoughts and ideas and you're trying to get it into these people's minds in a way that elicits a response that makes them feel good and the only way that you could really do it is you have to hit those notes you have to reach that that resonance you have to find that frequency whatever it is that works on them and you can't be thinking about yourself too much and you can't be pleased with yourself can't be happy with yourself you always have to be analyzing you are you're the the sculptor you have to be critical you know always have to and so in doing that it's really easy to develop impostor syndrome because even when you think doing well you know like if I can I've had like I don't know nine or ten comedy specials doesn't matter doesn't matter how many people like and they suck I got to keep going you got to keep working at it so when perfectionism yeah so when someone would I remember how we even get on to this but that imposter syndrome exists because your your ego won't like your mind understands that you ego will fuck this up if you let your ego say oh I'm the fucking man you're gonna ruin this whole thing you have to you have to be aware of what this is like this this this ride requires you to stay within a certain frequency you have to stay inside that frequency as soon as you start going yeah everything's fucking awesome up it all goes away all that goes away you have to stay inside that frequency and that frequency is not frequency where you're very pleased with yourself I think you've gone for full circle back to the bog of again yeah cuz the bhagavad-gita is the Warriors have to fight the war you think it's good you think the bhagavad-gita is gonna be like here's Krishna telling Arjuna not to fight Arjuna doesn't want to fight he's got his guru on the other side he's got his family on the other side what's krishna gonna say about this and Chris just saying you got to actually fight you're born to fight mm-hmm you just have to get out of your ego with this and you have to do it it's just a service and I think when I apply that type of teaching to my life like sometimes I'm not a great singer I'm not a great you know Indian classical music but I'd like to do it and I'm enthusiastic too and to me it's so it's not about me it's about like sort of like an offering it was like when one of the first teachings I got in the ashram was when you're on stage don't do it to make sure you're doing it to serve God and not be God mmm that statement changed my entire life and I was like oh shit everything I do is to be God everything it's changed the way it didn't just change the way I sang it takes away I parent change the way I like react to friends to fans to my parents you know it was powerful so that I have to sometimes you know I like to publicly sing on this have you heard kirtan no it's so interesting what is it it's it's it's it's chanting back and call-and-response chanting of chanting mantras and you use like this pump piano and Indian drums please I'll place them for you later okay then but it's great and it's popular in America it's been sort of Eric a little bit Americanized but it's but it's good and it's great and so what we do on pilgrimages I have assistants and incredible drummer he's from India and then I played the harmonium which is pump piano and we just sing publicly call in response and all the Indian people in India will come around and they'll sing with us and it's like it's overwhelming so there's one particular temple I go to in one particular holy place where singers come from around the world it's like basically you know Rolling Stones Led Zeppelin it's like the best kirtan singers from around the world come and they sing and I remember one time I came with a bunch of students of mine and they called me up to sing and in my brain I was like you guys are like the real deal I don't want to sing and they say no no no you sing and I was like no seriously I don't want to sing please you sing and like thousands of pilgrims come in at the time and somehow I have felt like I have to do this I have to sing because that's what they're ordering me to do I have to do it in a loving way I have to do in a way to make everybody excited but I can't do with any ego whatsoever and it becomes like this incredible tightrope walking can I do my best with a can you get on stage yeah and not it's not about me as the great comedian you know can I do that sort of as a offering where I feel like people are gonna walk away with something and they're gonna be changed a little they're gonna be lifted a little they're gonna go home a little bit more connected it's gonna help me and it's gonna help them and can I do it when when people we have this thing where we say we deflect our praise the people's hey great shit you're a great yoga teacher this how I train my students you're great you know that was a great thing you did our quick answer is by the mercy of my teachers like we don't want to hold on to praise because praise exacerbates the ego yeah and so we immediately want to say and it's not even like we're being falsely humble we actually are made up of the teachers in my life all the people that have loved me cared for me it may well people is like screwed with me but they also taught me a lesson so the Yogi's conception is everybody is creating what I am and therefore I don't own any of this you want to praise me I'm gonna give the praise back to my teacher now the teachers mood is by the mercy of my teacher I look at back at my life and I've realized I'm just like a ball of energy and generally the energy goes to like feed my ego how can it feed my ego how kind of use that to manipulate girls to people like me how can I use everything I've got gifted for my own self-aggrandizement core and so when you get these teachers in your life spiritual teachers who sort of like give you a loving slap or loving hey and they turn you on in some way they take what you already have and they redirect that North instead of South everything I was doing was just snowballing devastation and now you can you don't you don't give up those qualities that you have but you use them in a way that brings people up instead of brings them down that's what we were saying about movies - or any entertainment or sounds and dined that state of mind that you're trying to achieve when you get on stage where you're trying to sing with no ego that's exactly the the frequency that you have to hit when you're doing comedy you do your best but you don't do your best so that people love you you do your best because that's trying to do thanks your craft that's your this is your thing your thing that you do your your expression your art form you have to manage it and the way the manage it correctly is you have you can't you can't go out there with ego you'll turn people off they won't feel it you know there's moments where you can use that especially with comedy where you turn but it's not ego it's like but even if you're doing it though in comedy you're doing it for the effect of making people laugh you're not doing it for the effect of pumping yourself up and you have to be very careful about that and if they know that that's what you're doing they will accept it that's the that's the art of it yes that's the art of it it's a dance there's a strange sort of dance that goes on I I would notice this is humiliating to mention but I will if I wasn't doing it in a mood of service as an offering if I got offstage and that wasn't my motivation I'd be depressed yeah because and maybe you can relate to this on stage on the sensor I'm the coolest I'm I'm it there's singing song Erick's I wrote on my bed and now they're all singing them and then I'm in another country right now I'm offstage and I'm a nobody so if you're not medicating with any type of drug or sex and any mall you're left with is a bunch of emotion that's interesting and I thought this is true but I think this is why people who are entertainers can can move towards addiction or we yes ways to mask that that loneliness that comes with being the center where the whole world is trying to convince you of the Maya you've heard that word Maya the illusion the illusion of life is that you are the center yeah by legio this is an interesting thing I want to talk to mention to you too because you brought this point where like I like living my life I look great live why wouldn't you want to do that again no because and I don't know I didn't sort of challenge it a little because you were saying in retrospect to helio said doing why would you want to do it over because the whole Buddhist and Hindu thing is that I don't want to take birth again yeah and since we were talking about these higher planets and higher beings they say that that planet like Earth and they said there's other ones like this as well there is some pleasure and some pain there's people who live in a penthouse and there's people are sleeping on the streets or you can be on the hundreth whatever floor it was or the World Trade Center and be a CEO and then a plane can be wrapped you know two floors underneath you you can go from pleasure and pain the most excruciating plane and the most incredible highest of pleasure in a moment mm-hmm so in this sort I mean we've got plant places that are like places in the world they're like the rape capital of the world and then you've got places that are sort of like you know go to Switzerland or Norway where the currency is strong the people are beautiful and the everything you see is like it's from like a postcard so we have like great amounts of pain and great amounts of pleasure on this planet in such a condition you could start to question like why am I here what is life about it gives you a win do to even ask those questions now if there's just so much pleasure in your life they say that higher beings don't have the impetus to evolve because there's so much pleasure higher being higher being so the according to the Vedic system planets the others higher higher planets okay I don't want to say Ganesh but there's a higher planets with higher beings who just living a high life right and therefore the impetus to get out of samsara you know there's weren't a repeated birth and death there's no impetus to get out sometimes people are suffering so much there's no impetus to even see a spiritual light people are suffering tremendously maybe go to prison or they get to they get caught up in more degrading activity sometimes people who have so much so I'm like saying in your life you have so much good karma so to speak but because you're still embodied there always be sort of like a pinprick because that's part of having a body right but the my point was this journey is enjoyable and that I for you got good karma is that all it is because I've had bad moments I mean is it all just I mean if you will your self it is choices is that Karma's like is it the direction did you choose to push forward in the understanding of the push and pull the understanding of the discipline and the work and then the kindness and the generosity and that all these things are connected together and then also the expression the ability to express yourself through podcasts or through stand-up comedy all these things are enjoyable and that there's a pursuit in that and that the real benefit of it is that other people get entertainment out of it and that know your choices perpetuate it yeah obviously but there's other people have done podcasts done comedy and they're just not successful at it yeah but it's a puzzle though it's like it's saying other people sing songs but people don't play them back yeah there are bands before I mean day you're sure like the Buzzcocks from the 70s hoopla who my opinion was better than Green Day but they just weren't at the right time historically to be yeah yeah look there's always gonna be that but my point is like you don't have to be famous to be happy it's just the life is interesting life is enjoyable some it's hard and sometimes it's painful sometimes it's emotionally devastating for sure but the idea if you are alive and enjoying life the idea of doing it forever is terrifying to people that was what my point was like why is it terrifying if it's not terrifying to do it now why is the eternal existence so disturbing to people right unless they have had a traumatic life yeah there's a lot of people have yes a lot of people about a traumatic yes a lot of people have I don't think my life was so traumatic I think I got so let's let's leave them out of that equation and let's just talk about people who have not had a traumatic life who have a fear look if you're in America and you're not sick and you have friends you're doing infinitely better than most people on planet sure you know that's just we're really fortunate in terms of like the environments that we exist in if you're not being abused and you have a job and you have a you know hobbies and things to do god damn are you lucky you could be born in Afghanistan you could be living in the Congo suffering from a host of different pathogens and bacteria and viruses and shit but but your thing is according to that person was it Helio made up that yeah I don't think he made it up I think well Helio obviously was a great warrior as well as a great jiu-jitsu teacher but he had this philosophy on existence and that you had to live your life and do the right things always and if you didn't you would come back again and do it all over again well the Vedic system is is similar but it's not the exact you don't get born as joe rogan again living an unparalleled life and like i didn't take out the garbage that day i should have taken out the garbage it more be like according to your desires and your activities and your thoughts and the people you associate with you moved up psychically you got a little more degraded well you know either upgrade or degrade based if it was simply similar do you think of yourself like that do you think like when you think of yourself and your fortune and the the interesting life you've carved out do you feel like your past life has had some sort of an impact on who you are right now for sure for sure for sure really why are you so sure I'm well it's just sort of like my worldview is that there's not a randomness that everything is building upon something in the same I'm building upon tomorrow today so you guys know why holding on next week why act this week and you could take it bigger and bigger and bigger so that in that sense it makes sense but there's a there's a little bit more of a leap of faith like and I'm building up to a climax where we'll take another body or I'm coming from a place where I have some talents you know we call them your god-given gifts or your my you know my daughter is a gifted art are artists but the idea is that it's been a practice that we've been practicing and bringing with us mmm for lifetimes and both are both good and bad and this is a belief system that you just sort of adopt because there's not really any evidence it's it's not that I've adopted is it's that's the that's how the Yogi's view right karma and and I understand but you taking this and yourself I take it myself because I see it in this lifetime now like I said that I don't know there's there's blind faith and then there's reasonable faith so my reasonable faith lies in this lifetime I've witnessed my body change I witness my mind change my intelligence change I've witnessed myself cultivate desires that heal me make me stronger make me lighter make me more connected I've witnessed myself choose bad choices things that are addictive things that are defiling my consciousness or my body or my health so in this lifetime I know I have I can steer my Karma and at the same time there's certain things that are out of my hands like you and me are on a flight to San Diego and the planes going to San Diego what I what we do on that plane the plane journey is our Karma what we do on that plane that's our free will so that's the difference between freewill and destiny there is there is a difference of the two just because there is karma doesn't mean you're bound to it you can move it but the yoga system is to bring us to this trying to think keep it simple to this it's called sattva or so it's a state of self-control of peace of balance so all the things that the whole culture is based to keep the mind peaceful and for when the mind is peaceful I act less on impetus and more from a higher chuckers or higher thoughts or higher intelligence for example if I slap a panther Panthers gonna bite me why because Panthers bite when you slap them if I slap Joe you could act from a different place hey man what's up or you could be like immediately and sometimes I feel that also I feel like I'm acting from a lower place I'm angry I'm gonna kick back right right and sometimes I feel like I do this with parenting sometimes I get angry at my child I said don't you understand he's just trying to talk to you he's just trying to share how the experience is I have to pull myself back and let go of any way I was parented and try to like act from a higher place so there's always an they say in the human species there's always this chance to either upgrade your activities or degrade your activities and they and they and they snowball off of each other like every good choice helps to make a better choice mmm you know what we said that would diet with exercise how do we get talking about that Joe it's just we're talking just massive detours that were taking no no no it's we're getting into places we were talking about your belief that your karma is connected to what you've done in the past life sure so that's it that's a bigger leap of faith but yeah and you say I see it in this life and you see it in other people as well so when you see people you look at their life and you think this person the where they are right now is directly connected to what they've done in the past life yeah it's an interesting philosophy it's an interesting interesting lens and you know it's an honor you know it's nice about even in Western psychiatry if I go and complain about my husband or my wife the a good psychiatrist will go well what's your responsibility in this mmm is it all your wife or is it you right they take you back and when you really study Vedic thought you realize that there is no more blaming anybody yeah I've just got what I've got for whatever reason mmm now what am I gonna do with that No what am I gonna do today it's all so what am I gonna do tomorrow why me the why me shit never happens mm-hmm because I've got what I got I probably did something and people don't like to hear that but we don't know our backstory and to be truthful I have a blind side a blind spot when it comes to anything atrocious I've done in this life I forget all the times I've hurt people broke people's hearts you know it was rude or cruel or thoughtless so I got to get some Karma to in this life what to speak of a previous life I'm oblivious to right and if I just want to blame the circumstance here's your option you can either be free from that be acceptance and accept that there's benevolent forces that are trying to teach us lessons to get out of the birth and death or you can just be bitter at the world why me unfair so this idea of benevolent forces that are trying to teach us do you feel that this spiritual quest is almost like a divine puzzle that human beings are proposed and that you'll you are given this infinite series of options and in choosing the right way of thinking and behaving you can carve out the righteous path as best you can you will make mistakes but that there's there's a spiritual undertaking that is a part of operating this puzzle correctly and that this is what all these teachings are about and that's trying to we're all trying to relay what we've learned and what what we've experienced personally and we're trying to relay it to other people so that they can relate and so that they can also make choices that will allow them to more refine their approach to life too to achieve better spiritual balance yeah so Paul said I there's there's you know the Yogi's called me yamas and niyamas 'he's sort of like say it again yamas and niyamas do Zuma's yaya yamas and niyamas things you do and things you don't do okay and it's the equivalent of like sort of guardrails on the road mm-hmm right you drive a little bit off too far you scratch your car where's the guardrail but if it wasn't there it'd be complete tragedy so there's sort of like things that we pull in with our sexuality with our thoughts with our words it's how to use the vehicle in this lifetime so the vehicle being the body right what we do what we don't do but we don't what we do you know what to eat what to what to think what to speak how to speak how to relate to people how to relate to juniors how to relate to seniors so the whole Vedic culture is carved out like this that in itself is not spiritual it just assists you in driving a car I still got to go north and so once I can take care of how to like take care of this machine and keep it on the road then I've reached out for connection you know and that's the spirit so there's Dharma but then there's Dharma that that's supposed to get us connected what is that your vector of Dharma what is that the definition rather of Dharma again Dharma means sort of like a Rama right living it's not some people confuse it with while doing what you're born to do because I don't think it's just doing what you're good at because you could be good at leadership and be a dictator and and in and you're great leader everyone's gonna do what you do but Hitler was a great a great leader a great leader is probably in this chart but then you also have great great leaders like like a Christ it was like a great leader right also so it's not just leadership it's leading person towards connection mm-hmm so that your activity has a benevolent effect on everyone it touches that's Dharma that's that's Dharma and it's true sense and that's the Dharma of your body like your Dharma is you entertain your you could say a warrior you could all say you've also Dharma as a father so that's a there's all type of like your carved out for that you know if you weren't doing that you don't feel like a little lack in your life but then there's like an itchy adharma or what you and the nitya derma is actually the Dharma of the soul and that's why in the Vedic system it's not like you're trying to convert somebody to be of your religion it's not like a home run to say okay I got a Christian to become a Hindu that's not what it is the idea is that everybody is a spirit soul you can change it's not about joining the same church or the same ashram it's like a soul as a soul it's a truth truth is truth there's no no no one's got a monopoly on truth there's no such thing as it's like math is that Jewish math or Hindu math or Christian it's like math is math right so we want to apply truth to the life to the vehicle and that's gonna give direction to the vehicle that's gonna be the food for the soul and that's what the genuine meaning of yoga people say it's a balance the mind it's not to balance it's to connect the Atma or the soul with divinity to but with Bhagavad that's the real yoga and that's when the yoga means to come together but in the original text and the original ancient teachings of Upanishads Bhagavad Gita it's all about is here I am lost in the crazy plan I'm driving my car everywhere how to keep it on the road and where do I go and that's that's that's the classical concept of what yoga is mmm how do we keep it on the road and where do I go I like that way of looking at it I mean we go off the road yeah and we need the road we need these discussions people need these discussions we need I mean I need them right now having it with you I appreciate it but a week we we need to hear other people having these discussions we need to have them personally ourselves this is what every morning on my podcast 5 a.m. you do your podcast every day every day for an hour and it's sort of like a check-in and week on iTunes and all that chance it's on iTunes because it's ages and me and I co-hosted with another friend who was a monk for a long time with me and we were both teenagers from the Lower East Side mm-hmm and so we do it together and we have a scene upstate as well as he's in New York City in Manhattan okay so you do it remotely we do it unzoom okay but through it gets taught Lipson yeah thought the podcasts yeah I've done it at zoom I did a Jordan Peterson podcast through zoom I saw that yeah great it works you can do it it's weird though but we have like 90 people join us live and so everyone knows each other and then it's also done public so mmm it's fun it's my I enjoy it there's something about doing podcasts that you you are working out ideas it's made me infinitely more aware of my thoughts infinitely better as smoothie and writing to since I'm right right into books right now and they're both helping me like yeah I always thought that but now this is a better way to say it I'm sure you do that any write material yes for sure but my friend Eddie Wong he had a really interesting take on that he's like that's what I do first thing in the morning he was I right right and he goes and I write every day and he said and then in writing every day it helps me really understand how I think about things because I'm really really contemplating really concentrating on how do I actually think about these things what what is actually important to me and that that activity of writing for his own education for his own you know betterment is very important to him and it made me a like a big impact on me I'm saying it that way I'm like oh okay that makes sense so many piece by the way Joe it's so good that you're doing this so many people I know listen to the show like that's weird it's weird and it's a real wide swath of people it's weird it's a strange thing I'm just gonna sound crazy but not any crazier than all the other shit we've said so far I feel like this show made itself I feel like I'm the person who's been granted the curator position on this show I feel like this show all the challenges that I've had through this show have sort of all the fuck-ups and all the things that I've said that we're stupid though those were almost like were put in front of me to make me understand the consequences of not respecting it or of not treating it with the proper focus and concentration and that this thing is this thing is almost like it's always been here and I'm like an Archie just to just brushing the dirt away and I'm the curator and I have to show up every day an artist lights on artists always describe himself a I think it was Machiavelli or no Machiavelli Michelangelo Michelangelo Michelangelo described it like that I can say myself as a puny songwriter I felt like the song was already written yeah yeah the lyrics are already written I feel like that with comedy when I come up with a good bit I got was out of this new bit that I've only had for like four or five days now and I've been working on it I feel like like it was a gift I mean I know I wrote it I know I wrote it I know I typed it I know I thought about it but where from where from what yeah like what what is that what is my creativity what is that coming from what is the gift and that's one of the things about pot and one of the things about booze and all the different ways that I achieved different states of mind they helped me get out of my own way so I could find these things better that's really what it is it's not as much of an escape from reality it's an escape from me from your thoughts yes from me from my bullshit too so that I can find these thoughts better so that I can go onstage and then my reward is this strange feeling that you get when you know everyone's laughing this is wild but the better I get at it the less I enjoy it in the moment because I'm not thinking this is great I'm killing I am just staying on point you ever say something where you're just laughing at your own joke yeah for sure because things come up that I don't know we're going to say and then I say it and then I start laughing but it has to be organic I'm not gonna fake laugh on stage but I will laugh on stage you know my goal is always to just like hit that frequency the goal is to like hit that frequency where people are laughing and say with the right economy of words in the right order and find the best way to to get it into the people's heads and that's that's the crazy thing is the better you get at it the more effect it has on people but the less effective on me like I could do I'll do an arena and I'll crush and I'll get a standing ovation in front of an arena and I don't even feel it I barely feel it like me like I just did something right I'm like a passenger on a rock like a passenger yeah that's what it feels like I mean it did the better I get at it the more I feel like a pastor but conversely if I fuck up I feel like I fucked up if I screw something up if I mess up a bit if I do so the pain is on me a hundred percent so the pleasure kind of dissipates the more weren't it like a morning internal pleasure the pleasure is not from what they are getting formation it's confirmation that I'm doing the right thing that's what it is it's like confident like everybody's happy I'm happy that you're happy and it's a genuine feeling of appreciation at that concept of the warrior just doing his duty yes I'm just doing it this is what I do now the bhagavad-gita this is the thing that I wanted to talk to you about with when we talking about the Vedas and we're talking about all the the ancient texts you think that all that stuff is real now could be real it could be real remember saying it's real you like this that shit's all real that's my sort of like hashtag that's all real it's because when some you stumble upon this thing like man this is all real like because there's something a rational thinker I'm always holding back some reservation for like this can't all be real right but things always just show up I was like him that's so real I tell you there's a crazy one sure okay I don't want to tell too much about the details because like you at private we're only doing it to two hundred million people I had a person that an astrologer at my teacher training and I was training people to be teachers and one of the ladies was from a very wealthy family she's older than me our kids went to school together and he did this interesting this astrology - this interesting class where he did this class on Karma where he shows how karma is actually scientific and predictable so everyone would have to give their like I said early longitude lat to date and time of birth I was born on January 11th 3:30 a.m. 1966 and you'd have to give that all it and so he doesn't know anybody and he is calling okay who was born on 1983 February 6 they called the person forward and they said and he wouldn't do their hold sharp but he'd show some big hiccup in their chart and he'd say it seems like in October you experienced great loss and the person be like oh my god my father died in October and every person he was calling up he was just read the hiccup so one particular lady she said that was so good can you do my entire chart so he had it done now this lady I knew her she grew up with somebody world-famous I won't mention who it is but it's something a household name and they were best friends and she grew up in a very wealthy family but as she got older she just became she became a simple artist but that what famous person was always in her life and then that person died a tragic death and so she never had much after that financially so a particular magazine like a gossip tabloid found out that she was friends with this person and on the anniversary of this person famous person's death they were gonna put out a special issue and they found that she had all these intimate photos of this person so they offered her a massive amount of money for these photos so I'm Stan I know this story and I'm standing there with the astrologer and the astrologer saying okay it seems like in July you're gonna have more money than you've ever had in your life and she was just like she looks at me and we look at each other like oh my god and she told him the whole story and she said yeah and in July they're cutting me the check in July how did you know that and the astrologer very humbly just goes it's been known since your birth so this is like the ultimate version of determinism right yes and no it's like it's if you use that analogy well use that analogy of the plane there is a determinism but there's also India vidual free will which can sometimes affect sometimes you're gonna just get what you get but how I react to what I get that's gonna create a whole new set of karma for me mmm right yeah how you react what you guys definitely yeah we're all gonna get some thing yeah and by by me associating with people were connected by being associated with people who are a little bit more in tune then when something happens to me some great life reversal some incredible loss some chronic disease whatever I might react to it in a different way mmm and that's gonna create a whole new pathway for me yeah well depending upon your actions you reacted things differently depending upon your physical state and that's one of the things that yoga really helps when one of the ways that yoga helps your karma is yoga relaxes you to consequences and to things that happen like I remember I was driving on the highway and there was this kid behind me he's illegal alien and he was on his phone and he hit the brakes too late and slammed into my Porsche I have a rare Porsche it's a very nice car and he fucked up my car and I got out and he didn't have a license or insurance he had insurance actually I didn't think he did but take down his information I took a photo of his insurance card and I told me I said you should get out of here man like you're gonna get arrested like you can rape you slammed into me you don't have a license you know I'm supposed to be driving they gonna take your car his car was fucked up my car actually drove I drove it to the Comedy Store but I remember the way I reacted to him because I had done yoga throws bills in a row was cool and calm yeah I was happy I was okay cuz he slammed into me man my story I told I wasn't angry yeah it changes how you react first of all it changes how you react in the moment when you're doing the ass in the class yeah it has a secondary effect what you just said and the third way it affects you is at the time of death the idea and I'm I have actually had almost a near-death experience with this too where you are focused in the same way you're not angry you're not freaking out you become incredibly focused as if I'm about about to leave my body and you can say it once I was attacked and I had it probably the most spiritual experience of my life and it was how many attacked it's such a story but it's a it's I was in a show I was why don't we were in the time of my life when I was monks we're all monks and we were traveling and we played in sort of a ghetto part of Buffalo and a big show materially speaking it was great we were big people loved those who sold merchandise and which ban was this was shelter it's my next business and after the show it was about 2:00 in the morning and everybody is getting out of the club and I'm in the alley getting interviewed for some man magazine and our van is parked you could drive the car in the van in the club and all the doors and windows are open and our guys were unloading all the gear and basically only a few people left in the club breaking down the club and I was outside getting interviewed and all of a sudden this car pulls up with these massive dudes who weren't from the punk scene they look like just sort of ghetto dudes and they were ripped and they were big and they just grabbed one of the younger kids I mean our shows everyone was 17 19 you know 20 they grabbed one kit and just beat the living crap out of them and I was like I'm getting interviewed so it's sort of awkward and it's happening about 50 yards away from just randomly awesome picked him up threw him down beat him and then went to another kid and did that by the time they got to the third kid everybody just started running for their life here's like a get there you know you don't think of these things in times of great like fear and anxiety why don't you why don't you do this why'd you do that what it all I did was I ran back in the club to get my band I said you guys got to get out of here there's a bunch of crazy guys outside and all my roadies we're all monks by the way but all the guys who were my roadie said we can't go anywhere like the equipment's half in the car the t-shirts aren't loaded and all of a sudden the bad guys their car drives into the club and parks like like a tea blocking our van so we couldn't get out of the club any longer and they get out of the car and there's not that many people there's a couple bands and sound men stuff like around the club and the biggest guy gets out and he grabs a gun and he just goes in a really serious and unemotional way I've got a gun and I'm gonna kill everyone tonight that was one of these like eerie sort of like eerie organ music he could hear and I was like it just felt like oh this is the day you know the day you always talk about that death day where you don't expect it and you expect it and you get the dealt the at Ace of Spades that's your day now and I was like and I was the older you know devotee Krishna devotee these were Krishna devotee monks or bhakti yoga monks and so all the other guys in the pan came up to me what are we gonna do what are we gonna do now they weren't they weren't right near us at the time they were like they were literally going around and beating people up and all the other monks came up to you know Raghu what are we gonna do and I had already sort of given up on escaping or anything I just look I don't know where I got this from because I'm definitely not an elevated soul but I said we're gonna die tonight and so we're gonna chant and I went into the Christ I know why would you just run I you know what in retrospect I don't know but let me let me let me a circle back with this I grabbed the drum out that I play this Indian drum and we all started chanting these mantras - miss ringa Dave who's an avatar of Vishnu you'd usually chant for a type of protection but we all started really focusing and chanting this mantra it unbelievable story but it's all true and as they were beating up people they finally came to us and all my guys ran for their life some guys were on under the van in the van above the van and I'm surrounded by this gang and the biggest guy just grabs the gun and he goes to me do you want some I was like freaking trick question what am I supposed to say here and so I just you know by the way I didn't look like a monk I had jeans on or I didn't it's not like let's beat up monk day it was just a random act of violence and so I said I just put my hands in like an ax namaste and said hairy Krishna I'm a devotee of Lord Krishna and I have no idea why you are angry and then for the first time in my life I felt completely helpless I was just like repeatedly beaten and just punched and it's just one of those things it's not like you can even fight back you are just getting pounded but what happened was every time I got punched ice chanted a mantra so it's sort of like vishnu narayan chaitanya krishna govinda gopal every time i chanted to the point where I was like oh this is amazing as I'm actually chanting I was actually stepping outside myself saying I'm actually in meditation on sacred names and then all of a sudden my head was down and I looked behind me and there was these three girls coming to protect me and they had baseball bats and then I realized no they're not they're the girlfriends of these guys and then I started getting hit by a baseball bat um unbelievable three times in the head one of the shoulder and two in the legs and every time and this is a random thing there's no reason as far as I know was random I didn't know them they didn't know me they weren't from that scene our show is Ana ghetto you know there's always a cause of something but no idea what the cause was and so every time but but but miraculously and you read these stories in the Mahabharata Rami on all these epics of India the great sage leaves his body he calls lord krishna's chariot in front of him then he chanced these mantras and i'm thinking oh my god i'm chanting these mantras at the time of death i'm chanting at the time of death this is the perfection of my life that was what was going through my head i kid you not and i was like outside of my body and i wasn't fearful and then all of a sudden to wrap up the story everything stopped and i didn't really know what happened but what was happening was all the guys in the band jumped in our car or van and plowed through their car and took off and i can't remember how but i ended up in the street and some ghetto street carrying this indian clay drum I look like ever see that movie carry the girl he's covered in blood I was covered in blood for my head all the way down all over the German I'm walking in the streets trying to flag down a car the cars would slow down see me and then speed away because I looked like a zombie or something and then I realized I'm an something and you know you're running sort of high on adrenaline I remember being very lucid and I went over to some light I saw it looked like a garage where they fix cars or house buses or something when it was open and there was a man and a booth and I said sir you have to call the police because I thought my friends now we're getting beat up or killed or whatever and I said uh you have to call the police my friends are in trouble and they kind of literally looked at me and just said I'm busy and I said listen you got to call the police right now and if you don't mind I'm just gonna hide in this booth because I think these guys might come back and kill me and so I'm kneeling down in this dirty garage at 2:00 in the morning and the first thing that in my mind is no one knows where I am my mother doesn't know where I am friends don't know where I am my band members don't know where I am they could be getting killed everything was so good today like I had a great day and now it's over like a dream and I even have these lyrics that were like this world's like a dream it's not what it seems we think it's solid but it fades I was like I even sort of myself talked became a prayer I started saying I really wasn't expecting to die tonight but that's what the dream is it seems real and now it's over and I started to think like oh my god I was in I was sort of like in a state of like Samadhi when I was getting beat up I was focused I was connected and I was chanting at that time I said but now maybe my if I got I'm just trying to think my my you know Boy Scout first aid is like I might have a concussion my brains gonna swell I'm gonna fall asleep and then I won't be in meditation and I started saying I said I said I started praying sincerely Krishna I wasn't expecting to die tonight but you were so kind considering I'm not evolved to enter my lips so I could just chant so please don't let me die with a concussion if you want to take me please take me right now and with all sincerity I started chanting these prayers that I had memorized these very beautiful prayers from an ancient book but their prayers go you I focused a picture of Krishna in my mind and I started chanting these prayers and then unfortunately I lived unfortunately because I was in such a perfect icings meaning I was at that's how I would want to die hmm so there was no book there's no teacher there's no pilgrimage there was no that taught me more about Mike my spiritual path on that than that beatdown day because I felt like no ever close to dying as you can get as so close to dying but I felt like he had accepted it that and I had been taken care of like in that time of great tragedy I bet I felt connected more than I've ever been connected and I wouldn't wish it again mm-hmm but I'm so happy it happened we still never got to the bhagavad-gita sorry but we got turned a hard I want to know why you think that that's real and what you think is going on in those stories well first you've got the dialogue itself which is cool wisdom for all people yeah and some of its like a hyper bazaar like what Oppenheimer quoted at the detonation of the atomic bomb right I am become death color sweetly Shia creep bravado is that time time that's a Sanskrit how does this a Kalos me look Shia creeper everyt oh is that why I am the destroyer of time I am the Great destroyer and I've come to destroy worlds so that's one man actual translate that's the actual translation in English because his translation Oppenheimer's was I am become death is that because of an issue with the translation between English different people translated slightly different but it's it's similar meaning meaning in that particular section that you pulled out that was Christian explaining like God is beautiful not as charming God is your best friend he's also death personified so he's saying in that particular place I'm actually also the destroyer of all the worlds when we think of the Yogi's explain that God is everything both the beauty and the destruction as well and so Krishna's just sharing his attributes and in that particular chapter chapter 11 he's his the most honest intimidating where do you think all these stories come from where do you what do you think the origin of the Bhagavad Gita of the Mahabharat of of all the ancient texts what do you think the origin was what was the what was the motivation to put this stuff down what was what was the original concepts that led them to write this and where did it all from there has to be an origin of these these wisdoms right yeah what do you think that is you know um to even answer the question I have to take myself out of ragout and just answer like a yoga teacher okay cuz the to answer of what do you think it's one thing you're sort of trained not to do in as far as what is your personal opinion I can give you my personal opinion but I have to separate it from what the stories they'll say we'll give me your personal my personal opinion is I hear what the stories have to offer I find some value in the stories and I try to apply wisdom till my life it helps the direction of my life it helps my escape Potter the stories themselves say these are all real there'd be a way beyond your perception they were orally transmitted at certain time historically they understood people are getting dumber see we have a tendency to think we've got the pinnacle of evolution but the Vedic teachings is that as we go on in this age we get more and more disconnected there was a time where architecture was more evolved where the sciences were more evolved we're gonna stop the sciences were more of a science it's like like for example the building of these Vimanas which when we read them now we just think that's mythological mm-hmm even weapon jury weapon jury they said we're done with sound if you study that there's one book called the Donner okay but do you think this is real do I think it's real I think it could be I don't think it's definitely I definitely only one point time human beings had Vimanas and they flew around the sky and then they had weapons that use sound could could why not with no evidence archaeological evidence that there was a flying craft or was that there was ever any technology that allowed people to leave gravity yeah there sometimes there may not be evidence just like this right let me show you what was the guy's name Hill the the Party Hill what's your evidence he could just say well it's my own experience mean he's just laying that's a totally different thing he's just relaying his personal experience he could have had some sort of a psychotic break he could have had I mean they could have been mass psychosis with him and his what I mean with two people well I'm psychosis with him and his wife I can say that there are things that make no sense to me yet I sort of tried them anyway and then after time they made sense like well wait a second that does make sense it or at different vantage points of my life it didn't make sense when I was 20 but at 50 that makes a lot of sense so there are certain things that are huge leaps of faith that I can't say I definitely know that to be just like chanting on mantras minna sense made knows real sense but over time I realized actually that helps in this particular way but it she has a state the state of consciousness we've known that forever that achieving that meditation in general right achieves certain states of consciousness and you can actually with fMRI you can actually monitor the changes in the way the brain is see this is what I like about you you're one of those guys you get into these very interesting like subtle Sciences and then you find it's like hard evidence for these things and just hearing that thing with James Wilk and breaking all these things down I'm I'm I'm more of a simpler guy I find people where I trust the way they live and they've applied stuff and walk the it's more like I can tell time but I don't know how to take part o'clock and putting together no I think exactly the same way I'm fascinated by watches yeah but then you see all the gears behind a watch like a self-winding watch you know like I don't know what the fuck is happening here I'm sure I like that ended out eventually I'm like that with a lot of things and I'm always impressed when you dig into it with people like this but truthfully if you want to be honest honest truth I was like oh man I hope Joe doesn't dig into it maybe because I'm not that kind of hard science guy you know there's people like even though the stuff didn't turn from with you as a human being what that's why I asked you very specifically what do you think right well I can say like the stuff that you liked about me fighting was endurance flexibility I give all the credit that to yoga you did at the time Ronnie um I've told people that you you had crazy cardio and your cardio was you never did cardio you just didn't every car you just sat down this is great cardio I always said you always learn like really good endurance and my cardio was even better I remember being at the bomb squad once on day 17 of a 21-day fast Wow day 17 and I remember fighting I can't remember his name his cool guy he's like what and you know how juju its jiu-jitsu class ends when we're all tanked tomorrow like huh and I just kept on going and he's like man what is up with you I was like I don't know I haven't eaten solid food in 17 days so it's not like I'm a genius it's just that these are sort of like yoga fasting deep breathing I just been doing them yeah I'm sure there's people that can give you the modern take on what the benefits are and yeah but that's not what I'm asking you what's I'm asking is why you believe the bhagavad-gita is real sure so my point is there's reasonable amounts of faith in these other things that I've applied that have made me take a next step so whether I believe it's real I just believe the truths I can extract from it a real whether the war actually happened there's a leap of faith benefits of those following those scriptures you apply and you feel those benefits so that's enough that's enough to make me move forward towards those just for example the idea of faith and because especially in America we don't like the concept of blind faith but if I saw you walking in downtown neat or let's take it the other way you saw me you're driving your Porsche and you saw me walking in Manhattan and you say hey Raghu how do you get to Times Square and I said so the first step is I could lie to you people lie all the time when you ask them for directions but you have some reasonable faith I know him he's a friend why would he give me bad direction so there's a reasonable amount of faith but even still people get into their egos and they just want to be even know where of directions but I say you go up to 14th Street and you're gonna see a McDonald's you take a right then you're gonna go down all the way to whatever can happen anymore Union Square and take a left and go up third and then at Union Square you're gonna see a park at that part you take a hard left so again you have a some type of extended faith towards me not blind faith but you'd go up to 14th Street and there's at mcdonnell's as you go to McDonald's or that next signpost you realize okay maybe he does know he's gone then you go farther there's Union Square okay I think he actually knows what's going on and all of a sudden you see the Times Square in the distance so faith isn't just like I believe and if anyone was to say I believe this I believe in these Vimanas I believe in mantra is I start to question them but it happens with small degrees of of things being just shown to you that you want to take all right what's the next step here what do they say about this what do they say about that and then you apply and see well does that work with me and so like I said sometimes things didn't make sense I remember when I first met monks and they said a question about or not even monks but people were just like following very strict with her sexuality even even in family and the guy said I don't have sex I was I was 17 I was like you don't have sex with your wife are you crazy no I am do other we do other things and I just couldn't understand that as a 17 year old boy or eighteen year old boy I could understand why would you be with the person who was it because they said we were practicing detachment we're practicing going internal to find our pleasure and he said I said what do you do for fun and he goes we go for a drive I was like you go for a driver crazy but it was where this person was once on his path of really controlling the senses and finding his pleasure internally at different at time in my life it made no sense whatsoever he really didn't like having sex maybe or maybe there was only internal babies like what what's happening maybe there is trauma we don't know the whole story and see what you're saying know that applying this whether or not you break it down scientifically and objectively and try to analyze each and every word and whatever the translation is you could actually apply those truths air quotes into your life and have real benefits yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and other things are just uh does it make a difference if Vimanas exists or not that makes no difference my practical life could they exist sure it could all these yeah it could answer I think a lot of these things we've talked about like life on other planets and aliens they all are very much explained or here's another good one what are these spiritual paths have in common we train ourselves to find the differences in all of them and the Vedic teachings say don't you understand you should be able to walk into a mosque into a church into a synagogue and say how nice these people are trying to connect not that we got to win these people over to our team Brian because they're all an illusion and they're all going to hell forever right everyone's on a type of path and I appreciate them trying to surrender and the only thing that's going to get in their way because people say things like this all the time yeah it's a religion that caused all the problems in this world and it's not religion it's the ego that goes with joining a particular church synagogue ashram etc that we have in our way and everybody else they're a problem then we got to fix it that's what gets in the way because you could say materialism causes lots of problems as well in the world so I don't think it's a mistake II it'll sneak into your diet it will sneak into your God it'll sneak in and that's why there's an appreciation instead of a instead of a condemnation the people that are different than us let's wrap it up right there those three hours man oh really yeah I'm not crazy that is crazy time flies he just started mad and kind of did I hope that wasn't boy was great it was great that's it everybody thank you and Hari Krishna goodbye [Music]
