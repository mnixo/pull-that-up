hello freak bitches yeah and the idea that you know I know I've lived in the city since I was 18 so I've been around gays for a quarter century and I think of these guys I know that have been together for 10 years and I go so let me get this straight this these two are gonna break up according to you an evangelical person and then they're just gonna make out with some chick with blond hair and eat her out and like fucker and have a boner and pray to God come on you know that won't happen I'd I wonder how much of homosexual behavior could be induced by molestation in an early age though yeah that's the million dollar question that seems to be a real factor it's not and this is not denying people that are born gay but I think there's a spectrum and I think there's most certainly some gay acts that are committed on young people and horrific alee those people tend to on a pretty frequent basis do the same thing to other young kids yeah it's really weird in in in terms of like the victims becoming the victimizer yeah I know where you're going with this we're walking into the elephant in the room but what kind of not even I'm just talking about I was listening to the George Takei interview today because they're trying to pull up everybody now that the Milo thing is out they're pulling up everybody who in any way it has condoned sex with underage people and George Takei was talking about his own experiences in camp and it was on stern show and he was just talking about what he the way he was describing it as a positive experience with a kid who was in his late teens I think he said it was 19 and he was like 13 somewhere in that age and you know it's absolutely child molestation it's absolutely illegal but the way he was describing it he was pretty much describing it as a positive experience right which when it's your experience I mean it's illegal the guy did something that was against the law but boy that's a weird area because it's his experience that he was talking about yeah well here's the deal and this is a mistake Milo made you have to ignore that what you're talking about is fucked up and horrible and wrong but you just so happen to have not had a bad experience within those parameters right like say you were raped as a woman and you came right which by the way happens for some stranger okay so if you're one of those women you're about to say that you have to understand that we're going into a very dangerous place right now and you can't say look some rapes are absolutely fabulous and women have come from them you have to say this is fucking horrible rape is evil but I by some weird freak of nature actually liked it or a murder I'm sure this times when you murdered a guy and he ended up he was a mass murderer and it was a good murder right you know okay I'm describing a murder item not condoning murder but in this weird case it worked yeah and Milo's mistake was he said it worked for me and then he implied that it could work for a ton of other gays to be fucked at 13 well he did that drunken peasants podcast and his take on it from the drunken peasants was different than his take on it from mine and on my podcast it seemed more like he was trying to make light of something that most likely definitely did happen to him the father Michael yeah so there's two there's the father Michael thing and I I don't know if I believe that I think that's it's a I've heard him say that joke a few times where he's like I never would have given such good head if it wasn't for father Michael right so you think that might be something like that he's constructed I don't believe it I don't know why this is my gut mmm and then the other thing was condoning sexual relationships for 13 yards and he said especially in the gay world now I I know of straight guys who were a strake I'm thinking in particular who was molested at camp and it was by an older gay camp counselor this guy thinks of that guy every day Falls him on LinkedIn hoping he'll die he wants to murder him so the problem with what Milo said is you end up normalizing this behavior and say it's okay in the gay world next thing you know some older gay who's a camp goes well this is probably a fag that I'm blowing right no this is okay yeah so what I say to these gays these 13 year old gays to go I would be okay with fucking a 29 year old I go well I'm sorry but we're not normalizing that because the vast vast majority of times it doesn't turn out well so no yeah that's a very good way of putting it you know and it's it's really disturbed while the Milan thing is so odd because first of all I think he's got this act and let's call it an act because part of it has got to be an act he's got a wide spectrum of his personalities yeah so on Bill Maher he can be a raging Liberace queen with pearls on yeah dressed like a woman I mean that's like a woman camper than any woman I know yeah and then for the apology he's the conservative with the coke-bottle glasses yeah it's sort of like when a Jamaican goes back to Jamaica and they start speaking in patois like their grandmother not necessarily lying it's just a wide range of use yeah he plays it up and there if there's definitely a performance piece to a lot of what he does what's what's really interesting is he's very good at riling people up he's obviously very good at getting people upset and in doing so he's created these sort of false narratives about him that he's a Nazi that he promotes genocide I mean there were so many people outside the Berkeley thing that were screaming calling him a Nazi and saying he's a fascist when they in fact were behaving in very authoritarian fascist ways that's Anti Fog by the way you said I don't know what an tyfa is that's those guys anti-fascist is that anti flat stands for okay but you're right they're terrorists and they use terror they use violence to achieve political gains which is terrorism and these people it's not like Milo ever set or Trump even ever said anything that is remotely close to genocide but those guys just go anyone that wants to enforce immigration laws is a fuckin Nazi so I need violence because I'm trying to stop Hitler I'm around the first stages of Hitler so I'm going back in time and strangling them in his crib right right but the problem is the way they're reacting to it is the absolute wrong way to react to someone who's saying something that you don't agree with oh yeah the right way is to say something that you feel opposes what they're saying it makes more sense to debate them that's the beauty of free speech like it has no limits yeah if you want to get out there and deny the Holocaust you want to get out there and sexualized I'll go to your talk I want to hear it and I've been in the queue a day I'll shoot you down well not I don't think it even should just be a Q&A I mean I think it should be real clear there should be someone and we shouldn't just rely on the audience to come up with some sort of response I think if you're gonna have someone as controversial as Milo and you are so opposed to it that you're willing to throw bricks through Starbucks windows and like cop cars on fire there should be someone that can speak for your side course and then you should organize some sort of a talk but this is setting it up the wrong way because you go it's like someone said to me once hey man you know like we were talking about martial arts photos block but I'd fucking kick everybody's ass no you wouldn't no you would first of all you wouldn't because you'd have discipline and you'd realize the consequence is that but second of all when you just kick someone's ass they don't they don't just take it like they come back with a bat or a gun or their brother or you start a fighting they want to get it back and it goes back and forth and back and forth and all conflict it pretty much goes that way you have conflict and then someone responds to that conflict and it escalates so if you have this thing where you start throwing bricks through windows and lighting cop cars on fire and stopping people from talking and hitting people that have make Bitcoin great again hats did you see that girl got abused in the face no materials eventually people show up with guns that's what happens and this is what happens when you keep escalating the violence you become of them you become the other you become the enemy and you create this polarizing atmosphere that's so intense that no dialogues kind of fix it now because you're the enemy we should talking about the North worst of the south you're talking about you know the the Protestants versus the Catholics you you create this horrific environment where almost it's almost impossible to avoid violence well so I'm done avoiding it I'm taking the low road I'm punching them in the face so that's what you're doing with this outfit yes that is really what I'm doing this outfit I did a talk at NYU they pepper sprayed me did they real when was this this was a couple weeks ago what did what was it talk about I didn't even have a plan I was they know me as pro Trump or something and they they I'm a Nazi because of that and they do they don't want to give a platform to free speech that's the irony of all this is they pretend that it's gotten so far it's beyond debate now in their world we are recruiting fascists for some sort of imminent genocide so we're like signing up the brown shirts with a form at our talks and you go say that was possible how does that work like we sign you up then you're part of the club then you come with us on the next genocide the fuck are you talking about you haven't played it through in your mind because for these people it's a religion that's why they don't want to debate it's like a born-again he doesn't want to debate about the existence of God he's already on that side so what was your plan when you went there what did what did you want to talk I was gonna say this Nazi that that you've made Milo and I out to be who wants genocide and who sees non-whites is inhuman bla bla bla bla bla homophobic sexist whatever first of all that guy should be allowed to talk if he existed but he doesn't exist your monster is a mythical beast right and you've gone to college you're 60 grand in debt already to fight this mythical beast who doesn't fucking exist well in terms of Milo he definitely doesn't exist Milo is not a Nazi he's definitely he's not promoting genocide and those are two things that just get trumpeted about left and right exactly who is but Milo has said some very inflammatory things about in a very generalizing way about women and about the wage gap and about all sorts of things that he he designs his words and his phrases to be inflammatory so he gets the most response and it's been incredibly profitable I mean up until HarperCollins pulled his book deal he had a $250,000 book advance his book was number one on Amazon just sheerly through controversy yep I mean through pre-sales and controversy so it's a strategy in a lot of ways and it's also a response to this really hard stance that the far left is taking this ant I anti-free speech stance right but always with these cases you go what exactly did he say I always say this to people who bitch about their culture I go what sentence in what book is factually incorrect what specifically are you saying and with this Milo thing said that often sexual relationships with 13 year olds can be beneficial for gays he has since retracted that and apologized but that's not enough and that's about as his egregious as it gets the other stuff that he says we all say in a joking way and then that becomes pure evil and you advocate for this right so the left is willfully ignorant of humor when it comes to Milo and with Trump - you know with Ann Coulter's doing is very similar to what Milo's doing you mean they're their merchants of outrage and that's what they're doing I disagree I think they're speaking in a hyperbolic tone they're flamboyant that's what they're yes there's there's definitely some truth especially with Milo there's some of the things that he says but it's all truth what like again I'm saying it right now what What did he say this factually incorrect well that wasn't a joke not not factually incorrect but extremely offensive to people like the thirteen-year-old boy comment like the thing about sort of normalizing relationships between grown men and thirteen-year-old boys right you know I think a big part of why he even says that is because he's in many ways like a natural contrarian and in many ways a guy who wants to get a rise out of people and by saying that he didn't feel like there's any consequences to being outrageous in that regard right but I think we could both agree whether or not it's factual in his case it's a fucked up thing to say whether the fucked up thing to say it was negligent which is why I apologize but I think the grain of truth to that and with his other statements is a lot more than a grain but the grain of truth to what he was saying is gays have less chastity then straights and if a woman is known as a slut she's less likely to be picked up and I've been sued for calling woman a slut were you really yeah who sued you it was a long time ago back in Vice days it was in do's and don'ts and the the way the the law is it's kind of antiquated but it's like oh you called her a slut now she won't have currency in the market of marriage well she's known as a whore so we're gonna punish you punitive ly for this sin did you have to settle yeah god damn it there no Agilent word for a man no a CAD that's a compliment that's hilarious yeah a cat is hilarious well the fact that there's no equipment for a man shows you that there's a different standard and then with gays it is different to like 13 year old and an older person right if it's a girl and a 40 year old teacher I want to take him the parking lot and beat him till he's has a weird he walks weird yeah I was like if it's a woman and a boy I don't want to murder her grossed out 13 especially 14 a little better and then with gays well I'm not gonna make the same mistake my little maid right now don't ever do it but if a gays known as a slut in the future like say a 19 year old fucks 200 people as a woman no one wants to go near as gay you've been around the block yeah there's not the same consequences for sure and I had a bit of my act about I don't know if you remember this commercial but there was a commercial just for men commercial where there was a baby that was driving a Porsche a baby with a beard and there was a grown woman next to the baby and the baby has like a tuxedo on and it's like you've always wanted the biggest baddest beard and the baby goes to the nightclub and the bouncer looks and winks and I'm like look at this look at this commercial see the babies yeah so the baby walks in just four men I mean I don't know what the fuck just four men if you don't know it is some stuff that guys put in their head when they're getting old so this baby's got a bottle he goes out to the dancefloor there's all these girls with these tiny little skirts dancing around him and he's like he's like a pimp and he's with this hot woman and this is to me my bit was this is proof positive proof positive there's no sexual equality when it comes to child molesting because if you even wrote that down with the sex is reversed if you wrote it down you're fucking going to jail okay there's a little baby girl and she goes out to a roomful of guys who were wearing Tarzan's skirts and they're all swinging dicks around her and she's got a bottle and they're all fighting for her attention and kissing her on the cheek you would go to fucking jail but that was a commercial that aired on mainstream television no one cared about it that commercial aired for years it's probably still on now and that commercial is proof positive that we have a completely different attitude towards a grown woman who's hot as fuck and a little baby yeah well even I was watching big with the kids the other day Tom Hanks is what ate in that movie nine and then that woman seduces him and I guess he fucks her he got a boner and I'm like you're raping a child exactly why are we watching when she's hot she's not hot he looks like a man so yeah and let it ride Wow it up if that movie was reversed and it was a young girl that all sudden was in a sexual woman's body and the guy was fucking her she's like I don't know are we supposed to be doing this you would be horrified you would be absolutely horrified these protests especially the things like the Milo protest I mean maybe now that Milo has been humiliated and at least temporarily sidetracked or put down for a bit while he has to rebuild maybe someone could come along and have reasonable dialog and do some sort of a campus but I don't like I know why is he doing these things on campuses first of all I don't think he gets paid for most of them what my theory with Milo is I think his eyesight's getting worse his glasses are getting thicker and thicker and he's sort of going this is my moment to make an impact so he's just think he's going blind I think so yeah what are you just theorizing this yeah it's like twenty eight yeah but you look at amis they're insane really yeah and they're getting thicker maybe it's stress stressing his eyes worse I don't know I can't think it would be good but I think he's trying to make a maximum impact in a short amount of time because you think he doesn't have much time left that's such a witty seemed healthy in fact when we were in Orlando we made out at the site of the you guys made out yeah at this Milo to offend Muslims Wow so I said bullseye did a big speech about freedom and funny taste in this America delicious like strawberries well at least you freshen his breath up before no gays just taste better I said fuck Islam and then we made out at the site of the Orlando shooting to annoy Muslims but we had guards and stuff and I said all right I want to make sure these guys are scoping out the ruse and shit yes and he goes I don't care if I die I'll happily die for this I was like well I do care actually I've got three kids what is it Neil is amor nihilism I always say it wrong I always say nihilism nihilism that nihilistic sort of instinct that he has he has a burn it all down instinct and I think he has that with his life as well and I think a lot of that I'm playing some serious bro psychologist here you know some armchair psychology from someone totally unqualified but you've got to attribute that to in at least in some ways being molested as a child I would imagine that his experience is that he's calling positive experiences when he was young in many ways those could have potentially damaged him and also being young and being homosexual and being rejected all of those things wreak havoc and you develop this fuck you and want to burn it down and this is one of the strategies that he sort of adopted that strategy to be this guy who was very difficult for like he's he's gay he's an English gay guy who's a right winger I mean it's it's so baffling to them they don't know what to do they hate it because they see blacks and gays as their little pets and they like putting them on the front lines and going look at who were helping and then when one of them defects to the other side they become particularly outraged but very few defect at the level that he's defected right I mean he turned around and started attacking directly [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
