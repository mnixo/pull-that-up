believe it yeah let's bet five four three two Kapow and we're live Shirley how are you I'm feeling alive you look alive Thanks so do you does anybody ever ask you are you really only happy when it rains all the time is that annoying yeah I would imagine so I shouldn't have done it help myself it was a little too meaty Joker that's okay I'll forgive you little yes I panicked I start I never do well at least you didn't ask me are you really legit are you really you know the sister of Marilyn Manson is another one oh is that one that comes up that comes up a lot yeah that guy's a freak I met him I love him he's an odd dude he's you think oh I was kind of shocked by how normal he is he's very smart very nice smart and really I thought really forthright yeah oh yeah she to them I loved him actually I was I was crazy about him well doesn't that in and of itself make him a freak yeah I guess in this world I guess and we were just talking out there about how many people are pilled up and that this way well we were also talking about people who can't tell the truth but yeah maybe even more weird yeah we were talking about transracial people you know the one folks we don't have to say her name you know that chick the one who thinks she's better than that dude who also did it there's a lot of weird people out there but also Jamie Jamie lies about being an Indian apparently an inside joke yeah that's not funny thing you can't Indian is actually kind of offensive to some people now yeah where it was like standard for a long time well I'm ashamed to say when I first came to America 20 years ago I always because it was the way we were brought up to we refer to Native Americans as Red Indians and we time I would see red Indian everybody in me my band would be good you can't see that stop that and I'm like oh god I'm so sorry but you know I was thirty years I know whatever I was so used to seeing it oh is that a Scotland thing you say good thing you say red Indian we used to see red Indian that has now been completely changed but back then 20 odd years ago yeah we always refer to Native Americans as red Indian yeah this I mean you can't save red people but you can say white people you can definitely say black people B can say yellow people yeah it's complicated it's also complicated I get it it's you know if you didn't know if you suit like if you were just learning this language like if you came from China some point confuse you'd be baffled yes yeah I spend my life baffled though that's okay I just gone I just go with it nice good for you to be baffled good for you yeah that is a good way to approach it yeah a month made me happier I'll tell you that it's definitely happier than trying to control everything yeah a lot of people that go down that rabbit hole that's not a good rabbit hole to go down no but I think controlling things are it's fear driven right sure yeah yeah definitely a lot of it I think I'm too old to be fearful I really a wee bit yeah yeah but you are like a see there's a certain thing that happens to people in show business when they get to a certain age either they feel like it's slipping away or they feel comfortable you seem like a comfortable person yeah I'm a comfortable person well kind of kind of yeah what's uncomfortable I'm uncomfortable about a lot of things already - yeah sorry prison you're fine lower your guard by giving you something really beneath me first and I see a woman like and just yeah you don't even know it so go to the lengths I did it and know I'm uncomfortable about a lot of things but I hear what you're saying and yeah I feel like maybe if you feel like you've failed and then you've stepped back up then you've start you at your you either crumble and you can't build your life back up or you you find us a place to stand and you build your career again on your own terms and then it is comfortable is that what you're saying like that's what are you where you're at that's what I'm saying but you never failed I felt I did you know anyhow yeah well you know we haven't we in the 90s were so much a sort of pop cultural zeitgeist I guess right you know and that can't last forever but when it stops I should speak for myself when it stopped I was it was dizzying for me I don't really know what to do with myself I didn't really understand my identity you know I mean I didn't know who was such a ride because it was such a crazy right and I identified with myself as a successful person and my idea of success was really warped you know so your idea of success was commercial success correct mmm yeah did you take any comfort in the artistic success I did eventually but at the time I felt like we were being creatively adventurous and we were getting punished for it and it made me really angry um so you feel like were you getting published I mean was it the publishers though the music publishers that were punishing you like what was no it wasn't even that person although I took it personally it was really much more a cultural shift you know right so that just that wasn't received as well correct you are correct sir mmm yeah so we've been used to being on top of the charts you know and then when that stops all of a sudden you're like well is everything we're doing all our ideas rubbish oh I remember deep down you know they're not but you're being rejected anyway and so you have to find a way through that and that's complicated I think art was complicated for a simple girl like me yeah well I would imagine any time you're as big as garbage was in the 90s me you guys were gigantic I mean it was hard to go into a clothing store without hearing your music blaring yeah you know but yeah I'm a huge fan I love you guys thank you so it's kind of weird sitting across from you hey I'm enjoying myself you seem to be yeah but like II I would imagine they're like as big as you guys were that you either stay that big and then you become a crazy person you probably better off like doing what you did like like taking our artistic chances settling in and then doing what you're doing now being more comfortable yeah okay so I mean we were lucky to had a manager a very wise manager keep my management at the time who said what you want you want a long career a lower level or do you want a short career a ridiculously high level and we were like we want the long career and you know that's exactly what we got in the end but there was this mad blip that and for alternative music which I have never gotten really that much pop cultural success I guess we were like we enjoyed this weird rush of alternative music that for a blip ruled the charts if you weren't under old band you were nothing band yeah you guys caught that wave that post Nova Nirvana we have yeah that's really what it was right yeah yeah I would love to talk to Chris Cornell like what remember when Chris Cornell did those pop music songs like you went from Soundgarden it's like deep crazy dark band - yeah that's - like weird poppy music yes softer and I'm sure he was just trying to figure out a way to survive like we all do yeah it's complicated for anybody with a career yourself included you know you have to like adapt and figure out well okay weird I step to now yeah weird well I think ultimately what you got to figure out is what do you like yeah it's hard to know what you like sometimes no sure because if you don't like something but it's super successful for exactly and you might keep doing that that's very confusing yes surely my goodness we're going to tape here yeah we're going Danny you're my future husband Oh Mary ah my wife's come on so - better keep that on the DL I'm sure my husband will be listening a laugh in his ass yeah your husband is named Billy Bush he is it's a different Billy Bush nothing grab the pussy Billy Bush correct but he really suffered he sure tell him he got like an Hillstrom of abuse via Twitter I mean we find it funny but it was also quite alarming because we were like oh my god I hope somebody hasn't come and punish you well what's crazy is that guy the real grab the pussy Billy Bush didn't really do anything he was there yeah he kind of was a scapegoat in the end goal is him I mean I think he was just trying to be conciliatory I was a TV host you know and he got yeah he got he lost his job no yes yeah and he was sitting next to you know this gigantic tycoon billionaire character this flamboyant boisterous sort of a guy who was going on his usual flamboyant boisterous tirades he probably felt like it was funny you know I listen to this guy dead yeah but yeah boy did he up to pee price.i my husband to you by default but it's funny that you know your husband would get hate from it the or that that guy would get hate from people seem to be like looking for people to get mad at well I think we're all mad right that the hope the world is currently angry and we don't really know why but we get fed a lot of negative information and I don't know if the human brain knows how to cope with it so it's very early on and the sort of technological revolution so to speak and I don't think our brains have quite caught up with how much bad news we're absorbing on a daily basis and so I think yeah I think people are angry and upset and they don't know what to do with it and there's certain figures that are tracked that you know that kind of rage or wrath and they people use these people as hot rods for their own Wow chaos in their brains yeah no I think you just nailed it I think that's absolutely it we've been talking about it a bunch lately that there's just too many people there's 7 billion people and to get all the information especially the bad information from 7 billion people it's on mountain it's intense yeah I mean yeah well said it's just crazy you flick through Twitter you flick through Instagram or look on Facebook every single thing from every corner of the globe is your heating bad news that's all you want to hear because like if you well the good news is not news yeah you know it's like everybody got along great today yeah that's not stories can't sell that yeah I did say it was going to be really curious as to see where the human race goes and how we do manage with all this information because even if you stand up for a cause like you know like today I was I did a post about for Amnesty International who's standing up for the Turkish journalists who are all imprisoned for just doing their jobs and so you stand up for that cause because I feel very strongly in a free press and you just becoming inundated with people's symbol what Venezuela and they have a legitimate concerns about what's going on in their country right by the woman in Argentina you know and so on so forth and Brazil and Mexico and it's just I just don't even know what to do with all the information yeah that is a part of the problem too is that people expect you to comment on every single thing and if you comment on one especially if you count on a one funny silly thing they'll say well what about this how can we not talk about this terrible thing that's happening you know it's almost like you you have a responsibility to alert people of your state of consciousness at every step of the day a second of the day I could I could definitely do that could you no not even I could do that just with emojis yeah it doesn't move geez I feel like emojis of the future I've been thinking a lot about this I think emojis I mean census I think was it Eddie Brown with that compared him to hieroglyphs you was Jamie who's Jamie Jamie Jamie Jamie was saying hey we were talking about it that like they are a lot like hieroglyphs like if you send someone like I one of their words my thought was Eddie's cuz Eddie always sends me like a series of emojis like in a row you know it's funny he's being funny like he'll send me a clown and a thumbs up and a black fist and the aubergine are my two favorites the aubergine you ever seen we should know a gene an eggplant oh I call it no busy did you know what it is I know you mean now but an why is an egg player the favorite one I just like it looks read and funny see I'm Italian so I feel like it's racist I see eggplants I feel like it's uh right your wrath on me I'm so sorry but I feel like there's it's like a racist term for black people okay now you're just being rude no no it is amongst amongst Italians it really is well is yeah when I plant eggplants yeah why what is the word what's that word that Italian word that they use there's a see if you can google it race it Italian word for eggplant used it's like it's a common thing unlike the East Coast what is I don't get the race thing I swear to god it isn't mystifying yeah there's a word that they would always use malini on yeah Mullen Yan is an Italian derogatory slang term for a black person and it's derived from the word eggplant where melons on which is a term which is a term for eggplant you've crushed my spirits right so sorry I made it impossible for you to use eggplant no no go back to the lipstick emoji just salty so we've killed red and in and we've killed eggplant half on one podcast good yeah Indian was the thing that like you could say all the time when I was a kid but now if I even accidentally like slips out of my mouth like you cannot say cowboys and Indians anymore suppose say like cowboys and Native Americans but doesn't roll off the tongue as quickly but we can break our habits count me we can't draw because we're evolved we are we're trying we're disciplined I know you're disciplined I'm trying we work at Esalen how do you know cuz I've read some stories about how you hold yourself together over time and that's that takes that takes discipline and I don't know I think it takes a lot of balls actually hmm that's a compliment thank you see appreciate thank you thank you well you guys say bollocks though don't you did you say it in a positive way that it takes a lot of bollocks takes a little bollocks do you say that we just head that way no I say balls cuz i balls I don't know I like the word balls yeah something to lose my accent bollocks is too hard for me to see but bollocks is like bullshit too right oh well yet that I would use that's bollocks right as we say that but that's also balls right correct but is used in slightly different haka balls be bullshit I'm so confused dude like I said just go with the confusion it's okay I'm going with it's gonna be something I'm totally going with it I'm flexible I try to be more flexible as I get older I work on I it's hard to remain flexible is really a challenge and I think that's what differentiates the sheep from the goats mmm what's better cheaper a girl look like some old the goats the greatest of all time I love the gold but then I'm partial to see I was reading this article yesterday about music and they were talking about how people get very rigid in their musical tastes like what they liked when they were younger they get to a certain stage in their life and then they just lock on in any new music they just saw there's a neurological reason for that right yeah yeah what is it you know it's something to do with in the pathways in your brain I don't know that the first when you first make these insane connections and it's usually during adolescence apparently yeah we make these connections with I suppose adventure and you know independence I mean I don't know I don't know enough about it but they have done all these studies during studies on the brain on dementia they've discovered all these incredible neurological pathways that are formed by music and how yeah somebody can't even remember how to you know button a shirt but they can sing every single word and every note perfectly to some opera that they they performed when they were young I mean I don't know it's crazy yeah it is crazy there's there's definitely weird pathways that get established in the brain and they say that like there's something about music and especially like musical pathways that literally invoke these physiological changes in a person that are unlike anything else like it like when I was kid that rocky I the tiger song would come on he would just he would just want to start running ah you just want to lift weights or just run up a hill or something like that I mean it would make your body change it was like if that was a drug if you could take that drug if you could sniff it like and like feel how you felt when that song came on be like yeah right I mean what else does that there's nothing else it does no that's true there is nothing else that does that I'm currently on this mad obsession with Oliver Sacks oh and I'm reading his biography right now or autobiography sheet I see and he's talking about some of his like really sick patients who have dementia or there's some other form weird virus that shuts them down completely and they can't even stand really and then if they play a certain piece of music someone who is essentially unconscious being snapped to stands up and can dance and like recite words even though they've been mute for years I mean really crazy crazy stuff yeah there's something about that art form about your art music can heal utopians mine feel it I felt it I felt it charged my whole body my hair stood up on it and what here I have left yeah there's something to it there's there's something to it that's like I mean and it's also very bizarre because it's something that people have created right it's not something that exists in nature means beautiful sounds in nature like birds chirping or certain animal noises and things that are beautiful but music is like the the the ability to control notes right the ability to create a symphony the ability to structure a song and put it together with a beautiful voice like yours like that is something that's entirely created by a human being like that didn't exist before human beings existed and it works only on us you ever play music for a dog these fucking stare at you yeah shit dog shitty music taste all my talk response music well maybe your dog does yeah makes sense yeah I suppose she's trained that way yeah well she probably maybe feels like it's important to you too yeah yeah right I give me like a shitty person you know usually they have a shitty dog for the dogs get shit you don't really owe me shit you owner he's taught them shitty manners I mean but then the dog become shitty like if a dog bites your face off that's chitti dog ok fair no that's fair dude that's us although I would argue it's a scared dog but I'll give you that I agree or terribly trained dog yeah yeah it's a problem the owners fly agree I agree but there's that there's something that we've done with this that I think is really um I think it taps into the human reward system in a way that was the human reward system like when people enjoy being around certain people there's there's like rewards there's like social rewards you get from it like save you have like a leader yeah yeah we're having a fun time having a fun conversation laugh but like safe like you're in a tribe of people and there was this one leader or this one you know warrior that saved you from the Jaguar and you would look up to that person like that that's like it's a hero in a movie right yeah like the now when we tap into these ancient reward systems I think there were ways that human beings could learn and ways that we could share energy with each other that existed before media before music or movies and books and I think what we've done with media music and books and movies especially is tap into those human reward systems that's really creating something right now that I'm really into mmm I'm not seriously a la I love this idea there is hope for the human race after all oh there's definitely hope we're awesome people they o'them yeah we suck sometimes yeah someone there's a few who suck but it's not even 1% is that true yeah I think it's maybe 1% I think that if you get 3 a hundred million people like we have in America you get about three million douchebags that's what I think that's fair and then you have also people that are the same victims as your dog that's a bad dog yeah I give people that are born and raised two people horrible environments and abused when they're young and I think that's a giant part of the problem a giant part of what we are and if we we just address that it's one of one of the main problems that I have with our culture is that we don't address really at all the raising of children and the doing it from the beginning as a culture but we don't address very much that's painful or dark or complicated do we not really we don't talk about death which i think is a big mistake because then you rear people to not live their lives fully because they're so scared of dying they spend their whole lives worrying we're getting sick given they like to talk about it yeah but that's my parents don't like to talk about it I just think that's crazy it's as though if you don't talk about it's gonna go away somehow like God want to deal with it no let's not let's talk about something else on let's go get dessert yeah it's weird people just shut off if you mention anything difficult mm-hmm just shuts down a conversation well that was one of the main problems that a lot of psychologists had with hiding caskets like when they were bringing people back from the war that they were taking these photographs of the caskets and they wouldn't let them be released like it was a big thing during the Bush administration in America and psychologists were saying do you understand like this is your you are programming people to have a very specific notion of war then because you're not showing them the actual consequences here I mean in a casket is almost a symbolic consequence because you're only seeing a box and you know that a person the child's you know present parents child is in that box you're not you're not even seeing the body like you're not even saying we should see the body so people can understand what a what a missile does to a person you're saying like the boxes themselves are forbidden to be shown that's crazy yeah let's just it's weird it's psychological warfare in a lot of ways on the people because it allows people to accept the consequences in some sort of a weird almost abstract way they're not they're not seeing the consequences so well so sanitizing everything and allowing people to grow and and expand again yeah it shrinks our minds in a way the less we see the less we can think about the less were capable of thinking about in a way yeah a weird but it goes back to like the idea of rearing children and that goes back to education as well and that we seem to have fallen by the wayside there too well I think we have but I'm my family the human reward system was much more uplifting well I think it's all connected because I think that what we're doing with technology in the form of music and movies and media and all that thing is just one step in this multifaceted experience that we have integrating technology and and the more the more sophisticated this technology gets it seems like the closer it brings people and ideas and I think that that's mean people think that it's I might have too much of a utopian view of it but I really feel like that technology is essentially going to balance it all out I really feel like as much as we want to try to hold back information and we try to hold back education or try to program people I feel like technology is ultimately going to connect people instantaneously with ideas and that you're not going to doing that already yeah sort of but you could push it aside you can shut it off you walk away if you have discipline you could leave your phone at home and go for a walk in the woods but I feel like we are just one or two generations away from being a completely different thing than we are now that's the thing that bums me out by dying that's their really pretty much the only thing is how much we're going to miss of all the great technological advances like how crazy is it gonna get it's gonna get crazy I know and I'm so sad I'm gonna miss so much you might not you might not miss it because you're on the tip right now of the scientific and medical advancements that are gonna allow people to live to be 300 400 years god I hope not it's very possible they really really hope that what is you worried about overpopulation yeah and and yes and the calcification of the human mind I worry that Donald Trump's gonna live to be a thousand oh god we all worry a wee bit it's got a lot of money yeah sure does it's pretty healthy for a fat guy too I was thinking that the other day guys outdoor super active why is this nice why is he so preoccupied with fast food it's really peculiar when you've got all this money and you're stuffing your face full of the cheapest food you can find doesn't apparently he's got a huge fast-food preoccupation maybe it's a president things Bill Clinton did too there was a huge issue Clinton why he was up fast food yeah yeah Harshberger no yeah yeah I'll cut off with per bill so what time press mmm yeah you can't eat fatty foods all time or sloppy well it's real sugary cheap crap this is non-nutritious it is right every night again every now and again Oh get one of those Wendy's double-doubles with those double cheeseburgers I still got the double cheeseburger in my life ever ever why I couldn't get my even I couldn't get my Jo's right back you really never had a double cheeseburger I've never had that double cheese how long have been in America whoo 11 years and no nonsense no one's ready in now here's yes of course I go ten tonight so you get a single cheeseburger didn't know it's that a double maybe a half of a double so I haven't had a double done when I was writing that no I've never had a double double so what do you get I don't know I get I've never ordered it my husband's always the one that served Wow your husband's like your assistant yeah what I want I wish he was maybe he was for like the first you know a couple of weeks that we were together yeah when he's trying to but he's really trying hard to work it that has long been left in the dust I can assure you like literally night I'd like to beg I had a friend of mine before he's married now but before he's married he had gone through a series of like really horrendous relationships and we were sitting around talking once we were super high and he goes uh I think what I'm gonna do is just have to weak relationships he goes because two weeks is like the perfect amount of time you're in love yeah it's a you're in love you want to spend all the time together it's great and he goes and then somewhere around then they just start expecting things from you and then they get mad at you hey those who be he's just picking the wrong a partner's clearly clearly cuz he's married down about two years I think is like a good honeymoon period two years really Oh things can go ugly in two years especially a day an actor oh I've never dated an actor my life before you congratulations yeah yeah I couldn't deal with that did you yeah actresses yeah not no dudes but uh girl it'd be say actor like girls want to be called actors now like it's non gender-specific these days fair enough yeah I get that yeah I make sense yeah totally get that I guess yeah because actress or comedienne that was a big one to me like female comics do not like that don't like being called comedian oh it makes you seem like a cheap and down comic like my funny comedian friends that happened a vagina 'he's they're all comedians yes see that i get that i really do get that and I respect that the only thing is I love the word actress actress is a pretty word a lovely word comedian sounds like a light version of comedian yeah the media doesn't have the same kind of gravitas right low fat yogurt or something you know yeah that way but yet I think the more we get rid of gender actually the bear you think so but it's fun to be a girl it's fun to be a girl of course and I think it's fun to be all genders and whoever however you are but I think when you're when you're you have to be cold something it's like person yeah I don't think we should be living in prisons yeah but we're not living in prisons but we clearly are different like especially you and I course you and I are very we're very different very differen fused if you were anything like me yeah no but I think you all humans we're all different right I mean I I think it's crazy that we get put into these generalized packs we kind of do yeah but maybe there's also just our mean there's a broad spectrum of behavior that is on one side of the fence or the other side of the fence was male or female but there's definitely a male and female when in most people and then there's people that are you know then it gets real weird people that are born or in some way don't want to be whatever gender they are I think it's kind of cool noting is that they don't want to be they just aren't I think some people just aren't and some people don't want to be I think it's like we were talking about earlier about that Rachel Dolezal woman you have to disagree here well this is what I think I don't think we could ever possibly know the motivation for every single person you are correct transgender or trans racial or trans anything well gender though is know as you know yourself under no circumstances do you choose your gender you don't you're not that powerful I don't think most people do but I think some people it's entirely possible that you could be a woman and decide you know what I want to be a fucking man I'm tired of this I don't like it it's it's well within the realm of but that was a different thing isn't it I mean you're right and I'm sure there are circumstances like that but that I think is a different thing entirely maybe but would it be any less legitimate it'd be any less legitimate if a woman felt compelled just by curiosity to become a man versus compelled by her feeling I think that's identity flirtation as opposed to gender flirtation or gender a choice or gender manifestation I'm using the wrong words here hmm I think people could do whatever the fuck they want I am gonna do that I met that lizard dude once in Austin Texas you know that guy is he's turned himself into a lizard he's essentially tattooed isn't no I'm not talking about he split his tongue down the middle he sat in the front row my show at the cap city comedy club knows like well you don't need a lot of attention do you buddy sitting in the fucking front row looking like a lizard very nice guy though seem like a super nice guy but he's uh you know I mean look at this guy well that that's before he did his whole face before he's got amazing mecanim yeah uh definitely weird I'm about amazing if that was my cat it's amazing come on if you saw that in an art gallery you would be like that is amazing mmm maybe you and I have a different sense of amazing maybe we do well that seems like a guy with drawing on his face ah but hey this is coming from a guy with drawing all over his R I think it's very incredible I mean Who am I to say that it's mean this suck that's a cultural thing right like why is it okay that I have tattoos all over my arms and I don't think it's right to tattoo your face I wouldn't say that like you should do be able to do whatever the fuck you want yeah and he has them but it's a cultural thing I mean for some people like I was in Japan and they made me I was in a gym and they made me go and put a long-sleeve shirt on because you can't have exposed tattoos like this well I guess because there are feelings towards your arms or the same feelings that you're having towards it is yes yes a little bit a little bit just for those of you who are not in the studio right now who are listening to just just take my word for it that Jew is fucking with me right now no I'm not fucking with you yes guys he is we're having fun it's a fun conversation what do you think when someone's fucking with you that's like a negative thing all right no oh god no no I often fuck for fun I think we just did a uh we just do a play on words there hey life on us yet exactly yeah so um so what's the latest with you you guys are touring again we're going on to in the summer yeah um that's only like month away or some of the way yeah Todd is fuck here now it's fucking his bass top yeah we always used to rain I I like it cold I must admit yeah yeah but we are going at interior but we're going to do something in my mind pretty sort of historical in a funny way like we government going out now headline tier with blondie well legendary Debbie Hari Wow do you know her I do know her actually I and I love her and she's been somewhat of a mentor to me in a way because she was managed by a very famous music manager called Geiger first who managed the Ramones and talking heads on board and so on and so forth he was the one who basically sort plucked me from my band he saw Matt that he thought I had potential and he was like you know I I think you have potential to be in the music business and he signed me in the end and blah blah blah blah blah an enemy introduced me to Debbie and Debbie came and saw my band opened for the Ramones and the Academy in New York doing the music seminar one year I was shaking like a leaf I've told the story a million times but it's one of my favorite memories of stepping out on stage and the Academy and of course the Ramones fans that were pretty hardcore you know they weren't taking fools lightly yeah and you had to prove yourself so I was very very nervous and I looked down into the mosh pit and Debbie Harry was there and I just was like I will love you forever and then asking me I am your slave who are like for someone of that caliber to do that it meant so much to me and as sort of even in times of when I've dated myself I always think Debbie didn't take me Wow so yeah very excited to be going out with her wow that's heavy I might erupt ear come on to your bet a little bit come on get into the you know the emotional oh I'm saying she was a very unique historical figure in music there was no Debbie Harry before Debbie Harry it's like you can look at some Madonna before Debbie Hadi right there was no Lady Gaga Yeah right she did it all really she's the archetype I think for a modern pop girl and she was very authentic like there was no questioning her authenticity like she was uniquely eccentric she still is yeah I'd imagine yeah I mean to be 70 and to be still making records that's incredible it's pretty badass it's really badass and really inspiring for other women you know who follow in her footsteps II you know we'll watch it's the first time I can think of like a woman has had a pop career over that long well isn't it a new thing I mean if you really stop and think about music really what we're talking about is recorded music and recorded music in modern times has really only been since the late 20th century all right I mean when did people or the early 20th century rather when did people first start recording music we've gone over this before they started doing it on wax like the 1700s is that what it was I took me one of those ones I don't think it was that look I think he's in the early 1900s let's let's find out what C V Thomas Edison had does wax cylinders that they were recording talking and a little bit of Orchestra stuff on okay and those like right those so she just pulled that I know we've actually discussed it yeah but yeah we folded this is one of your favorite topics no we have discussed it like fairly recently within the last year we're talking about how amazing it is that recording things like like Mozart or Beethoven like there was no record you know it was just really work and you know people would duplicate that written work and that's how you would get to see the genius of their ideas here 1877 Wow okay that's a practical sound recording yeah but when you compare that to like a record a modern record maybe call it a record but I mean a recording a modern recording like blondie like rapture or something like that I mean that is this there's never been anything like that in human history up until the nineteen or the 20th century I mean it really didn't exist No so when you think about like pop stars you know I mean Etta may or mean what however far key you can go back to where you can legitimately say someone was a popular music star it is so recent it's been a hundred years I was like Elvis I think was the first popular star right yeah that's why you went fucking crazy no no Road map yeah well none of them had road maps that's what we forget like if youth we were talking about this recently with a bunch of friends is how accomplished young musicians are right now like I think they can be 15 years old and you can watch them perform and they've got all the moves and they can sing perfectly because they've practiced singing along on YouTube too you know digitally enhanced recordings so they can do stuff with their voice that we never get you know and so they're learning at an accelerated rate yeah they don't understand what it means to have any kind of motivation or like have any authentic taste or you know it's really peculiar they don't have a struggle yet they're like terminators ha ha ha no you know they're perfect but they don't have any know inside they well I'm sure they do have an inside bestowal to fishies - almost 15 no one you can abort shut up who is like good it's just you're off the charts ha ha ha but it's true it's really insane like that is they can sing along to these mad records that have been all sort of you know Otto Kyoto auto-tune yeah it's not the next thing and they can sing it perfectly well I was reading about this 24 year old motivational speaker and I was like I want to find that person tell them to shut the fuck up okay what do you know any for you what do you know what do you know at 24 you don't know anything at 50 tell people about life at 24 that's preposterous yeah it's preposterous yeah it's like my friend Steve Maxwell says he said you should never listen to anyone who is under 40 who is a personal trainer he's a personal trainer he's like anybody's Ford's personal triggers what the fuck do they know about injuries yeah running the long haul yeah it's a lot to learn there's a lot there is I am amazed I continue I thought I had also stoked by 30 I mean I remember thinking I'm so old and I'm so wise and I remember thinking that and then you hit 50 and you're like oh my god I knew nothing yeah and then you probably think that when you're 70 my dad claims that's the case he laughs at me my dad laughs at me when I you know say something that he thinks it's absolutely ludicrous you know and he's like just you wait yeah you'll you'll eat those words you know well I feel like that's a big part of what you see today in social media with young kids espousing really preposterous ideas just like you there's so they have so little experience actual life experience for them dude yeah I feel sad for all these like young hipsters that get lauded by you know fashion magazines literally at the age of 15 I think it's the fetishizing of young people right now it really gives me the creeps and I feel very sad for these young people who basically get are like these beautiful butterflies and a you know a glass jar gets shoved on top of them and then they're stuck there being cool in the hip but no with no driver no nothing to fight against nothing to be dissatisfied with I don't know it's peculiar I think meanwhile they're doing adderall and having a great old time they're looking at you like this crazy lady yeah I'm sure oh so just because you made a bunch of fucking hit records you think you tell me how to live my life I like being this goddamn glass jar never for one moment would ever tell somebody how to live their life no I don't like seeing as people not being allowed to live their life oh I saw this kid somebody sent me this thing on Twitter some kid I forget where it was some Pop Festival but he's like 12 years old playing the guitar and he's fucking incredible I mean incredible and they were like saying he's the next Jimi Hendrix some little black kid was amazing like just like just unbelievably talented and I'm just like boy he's checking with him ten years he'll be fuckin crazy that's what it feels like to me no creepy it's like so many people send me you know recordings of young particularly young women artists and they're like you know would you think about you know supporting this girl or what do you think of this and that live your life right I think go out live your life don't let your parents figure out your career for you that's what you're supposed to do you're not supposed to have your parents who happens to have an in with a well-known singer or rotas or whatever pump pimping you you know that's that's how you learn is by actually doing it yourself mmm I don't know I just feel it's creepy and feels pedophilic to me and I don't like it okay I definitely can be right but when you were young when did you know that you wanted to be a singer I don't think I ever knew I wanted to be a singer today you know now yes tonight happened so far along was very recently I mean literally in the last I've seen yes in the last ten years I was lately I'm really good at this actually and I enjoy it and I guess this is what I do for a living this is my thing in 10 the last 10 or 10 years so I what's going on with you like when stupid girl was coming out well I felt like I'd stumbled into that opportunity which I did and I wanted to be first of all I wanted to be a writer then I wanted to be an actress and then by total default I was in a Youth Theater when I was young and I met this guy and he was like would you come and play keyboards in my band for a weekend because we've lost our keyboard player and I joined the band and then I just ended up being in that band for 10 years playing keyboards and doing backup vocals I was quite happy I didn't have I didn't harbor any ambition to be a lead singer at all and then just a billion and one things happened and I ended up being the lead singer of this very same band just so that we could survive because we'd been dropped by our record label for going to Berlin and spending all our money on our record advance on drugs coming back I'm not I've anything to show for it so the record company dropped us but kept me and so then I pulled the band in as my band so we just sort of shifted all the rules oh wow I myself as the lead singer by default and then our via drugs oh it's mostly speed and ecstasy speed how much money you've spent on speed Jesus Christ it was it was an inordinately it was our entire record advance how much was it I can't remember I think it was something like a hundred thousand pounds what is that like $50,000 sing American somewhere on there I think it's double that double the oats two hundred thousand it's double O I'm doing the opposite oh my god dude I don't know I don't know how we did it I mean it wasn't all on speed and it was alcohol and you know going I drink you know drinking and partying and just wasting time and in America we call that going off we went off you guys went off we went totally off and I wasn't one of the the really well I I was one of the silver ones for the other part I mean you know and I know I did my share but by comparison I kept my shit together but anyway we wasted our opportunity there but by default became a lead singer our video got played on MTV and then I just chanced from garbage the garbage boys needed a singer and I got hired and and so I always felt I just fumbled into it by going off so wow that's crazy yeah it was pretty mad and then I never believed in myself for my whole first half of my what I call the first phase of garbage Wow you know that's a really common thing we were just talking about this the other day with somebody I forget who it was well they're saying that so many really talented people feel illegitimate they felt like they're not legitimate or they felt everybody feels like I don't think it's even art aside is everybody yeah who what parents sits there and goes yeah I'm a parent yeah I know how to parent my children and yeah I know how to pay the bills and get the work done and keep the house good nobody knows how to do anything right now well you you definitely question yourself all the time yeah I will do your kids well I have I've three I have one that's 20 I have one that's almost nine and one that's almost eight Wow yeah or almost seven rather and I was hanging out all day with the almost seven yesterday and you know we're just having a great old time like we have days we split up where I just hang out with one kid and my wife will hang out with one kid because I think sometimes when you get the two of them together the young ones they don't get enough attention especially the little one suffers a little bit so we have like specific days where it's just and so the entire time we're trying to have a good time we're having fun but I'm also thinking okay I've got to like figure out what kind of kind of programming or here as is go so every question I have to kind of temper this question well you have to think that these people probably don't know any better so that's probably why they litter you know and see like she gets mad when she sees people throw cigarettes out the window I saw a guy throw a cigarette out the window did you see that Daddy he was Sigurd out the window and I got well it's definitely not good to throw cigarettes out the window but you have to think like this poor person like what kind of a mind do they have like this this the way their brain works they think it's okay they're not worried like if I drop something on the ground I pick it up do you pick it up she's like I always pick it up I go yeah we pick things up right we don't want to litter because if everybody livered we would never be able to get anywhere just be garbage it's stressful being a parent it's stressful but when you're wrong ward is theirs it's really you have kids I don't it's very hard to describe someone the love that you experience between you and this little tiny person like me and the six almost seven when when we talk like and she just jumps on me and hugs me like my whole body has this reaction like the love meter it's like you know a carnival thing where you hit the thing on the bottom and the bell goes ding you know like the the chit sang shoots up and hits the bell it hits the Bell every time whenever she gives me this big hug it's like I can't you can't love anybody anymore obviously the love that I have for her it's great it's weird it's scary because you worried about losing them it's scary because you're worried about fucking it up it's scary because she's good it's so powerful really powerful changes you changes who you are and it's just 100% changed me just made me a different completely different person and it does every day every day I'm a different person I was like a week ago and I talked to a lot of other my friends that have kids and it's the same thing like that it changes your level of compassion it changes who you like Dave Chappelle said it best at me he said it didn't just change my how much I loved it changed my capacity for love Wow I was like that's it I think you nailed it I mean I had a tiny I have a tiny window into cause my sister my younger sister had two children and I felt towards her children differently than I do any other job yeah so that's just a small window into how I imagine it is for her with our children and we talk about this a lot I'm like I just don't think I could handle that would be to I'm to sense it I'm too hypersensitive to I think take the responsibility or not being a parent you think though but you would eat changes you like you become whoever you are now once if a little person comes out of your body you just feel like okay now I'm surely with a person there's like chapter 2 you know our Shirley Jo or whatever it is yeah I'm sure it changes how you view yourself and your function on earth I would imagine it does it does and it also makes you appreciate like my time is fairly um it's flexible in terms of like I can manipulate my time I can kind of choose what I do like I don't really have to do anything I choose to do a lot of different things but people that do have to do things like especially couples where both work and they work long hours that's incredibly hard to raise children I mean you see how tired they are to and they come home from a nine 10 hour day and their kid has been in daycare and the kid just can't wait to see them and you literally only have an hour with them before they go to bed like you're not even raising them my relationship was like that with my dad like when my mom died a few years ago my dad came over here to Los Angeles to to stay with us and we went out for lunch and I'm sitting across from my dad I'm 45 years old and I'm thinking to myself I have never sat alone with you in a restaurant in my life Wow ever I was really weird Wow because my dad worked hard you know and he was always busy and yeah I was it was an intense realization so I think it's great that you take time one-on-one with your kids because I didn't have that with my dad I didn't have that either I try to mommy I'm sure they're gonna learn something that I fuck up that they're not gonna do you just have to accept you're gonna fuck up yeah well just don't try to fuck up I'm fine John your best but thank you your vase but I just sometimes the things that you do in adverted comas get right are the things that do I think the most damaged and sometimes the things that you do wrong the so-called big mistakes can also be really good for children and I'm not talking about when they get at no point should a child ever be hurt in any way and you know I'm not saying that it's a good thing that that's a terrible thing that must never happen but I mean like you know I know a lot of parents who sort of really get down on themselves because they divorce for a random example mm-hmm and I have seen children bloom through divorce yeah you know and I keep saying that somewhat to my some of my friends here going through that it's like you're not you're not making a big mistake you're teaching them to not settle and there's good things that can come from bad things I guess it's what I'm trying to see ya know for sure my parents split up when I was five and it was a very good thing and it taught me that my mom was strong for leaving my dad and they're like you have to make tough choices in life and then things are gonna suck for a while but there's a reason for it yeah but you know pressure makes diamonds just it's I mean you said it much more articulately than I did this is nice but we're getting to the same place I guess yeah well I it's a really it's a uncomfortable moment that I have with a lot of my friends that have children too because we sit around we think about it we say well you know what you try to protect your kids as much as possible but everybody that we know that's interesting came from a fucked up background like all of my friends had fucked-up childhood all of them all my artistic friends all my friends that are musicians all my friends that are comedians they just fucking came from chaos and they emerged from this rubble as this like this person with a purpose absolutely see I've gone quiet and I've gone quiet because it's getting back to the the moment that I have in or the feeling I have in myself that I am an inauthentic artist because I didn't come from a fucked up background you didn't all my friends every single one of my friends when I was growing up from the age of five onwards they came from broken homes every single one maybe you learn from them it's it I don't know but I came from a really happy family my mum bought a penny she baked every day what's up honey a penny you're not apron oh oh I'm waiting right now but and yeah she bought a an apron she baked every single day she like warmed our clothes on the stove before we went to school she cooked us dinners every single night they were always at home they were always there they loved us they were never cruel I mean I came from the most abnormal normal family ever and it's always made me think well I that means that I'm not I'm just not not legit yeah so crazy ah yeah I got fucked off anyway yeah but it's not it's not mandatory like it's it ha ha ha it certainly happens a lot of the time but it can't be mandatory all the time but I just don't yeah I like I I always sort of feel and this is really sick of mild Envy when I hear my friends talk about you know their fucked up about bringing z' cuz I'm like God so normal I used to feel that way about people who are drug addicts what do you mean I used to feel that way because all the greats Mayans were drug addicts Richard Pryor Kinnison Bill Hicks they were all drug addicts yeah they were all had like huge cocaine problems and they you know Hicks was yelling when I got through it with anyone that dying of cancer you know who knows maybe because of that but you know Kennison was a cooking I don't know who Kennison is he's he you don't know Sam Kinison no I've never heard of him really Wow he's Mount Rushmore for sure he might be the greater well he I think Richard Pryor is the greatest but he's surprised he's right up there kinnison's like number 2 in my book I think I'm not heard of this person no no I don't know how he's it was a family I wore a beret you never you never seen and recognized him oh my god this is like pull-up Sam kinnison's homosexual necrophiliacs he did this pit this is this bit was it this is a bit that got explained to me by a girl that I used to work with this is a bit I found out about this is part of us for a second I worked at a this is one of the reasons why I got into stand-up comedy I worked at an Athletic Club in South Boston it's called the Boston Athletic Club and I worked with this girl she was hilarious she's a volleyball player big giant girl she was like 511 big athletic big personality easy easy she's hilarious but what I'm saying is she told me about you've got to see this comedian holy shit was he funny she saw him on HBO and so she starts doing this bit she said she takes me out to the parking lot and she's doing this bit about there's a real news story about these homosexual necrophiliacs who would pay these morgues to spend a few hours undisturbed but the freshest male corpses so play bit play the bit will play the video paper they said that a group of homosexual necrophiliacs I'm going around the mortuaries offering them money let them come in and I spend a couple hours undisturbed with the freshest male course that wasn't trying to sell this as a fucking home game alright it's a story I read folks Jesus Christ give me a chance to do some journalistic reporting their way up I felt the same way I read this thing about ah oh thanks for the best law hey I'm outside for these courses men I mean you think death would be bad enough wouldn't ya I mean the one thing that scares the shit out everybody is dead you don't want to think about it you know joke about it you put it out of your mind but you figure if you faced it that's it what could be worse than fucking down you think I got bass death I mean you hated it but least you live through it you know you got PI on shit about some of these courses cuz I know these guys were laying out on slabs there and they're going well life was tough and that was pretty hard to live up to with the I have half face death and I'm glad I went to it and well I'm just I'm ready to spend eternity in heaven be with Jesus and Rock of Ages [Applause] I mean why I teach fucking laughter [Applause] this girl she's actually was a lot she laid down in the parking lot she was gone I mean life keeps rocky in there see but after you did and I'm crying laughing I was crying that and I was like I got to see this I got to see this and so I think I got it from a video store I think it was back when you would rent it from a VHS you know cassette and that's how I found out about Sam Kinison and that's one of the reasons why I got into stand-up comedy because I didn't know that comedy was ever like that I thought comedy was a guy who just stood in front of microphone and said did you ever notice like that kind of stuff so what was what does what what is being a comedian to you mean no that's a bunch of different possibilities but it was so chaotic his his comedy was so wild and crazy' like it was he was a real ground breaker in that way why else did you get into being a comedian I don't know I got Tommy Juliet no I wasn't really very funny I wasn't detective links yeah I'm sorry what sister yeah I also was just you and your mom and your sister yeah well my mom remarried I've stepped out who she's still with then do you like him yeah he's great guy okay yeah super lucky he's a real good guy okay good but um it was uh I got talked into doing stand-up by my friends from martial arts for real cuz we would well you must have been funny well I was only funny I was like gallows humor we would go to compete like like or we would be about the spar and I would be the guy would make everybody laugh because everybody was so nervous because it was scary you beat the shit out of each other you know and then we would go to these competitions so we'd get on a bus and travel across the country to go fight in these tournaments and it was super nerve-racking everyone was super nervous so you could like cut the tension with a knife so I would always like be doing impressions of people having sex and making jokes and I just this was like long before I ever thought about being comedian I was just trying to lighten up the mood and that's how I got to understand that so hold a minute so see this is a bit of a surprise to me because when people fight you know semi-professionally or otherwise or at school or what-have-you it's nerve-racking terrifying because you're scared of pain violence the anticipation of the possibility of losing you're worried about the just all the possibilities there's the just a full realm of things I can have how do you do it I know I'm sending like a mortal and I just I've never had the opportunity to ask anyone who's ever done this um I was very insecure and I got bullied and I wasn't big I was a small kid and I was really nervous and I did not like that feeling at all and I was always we were always moving around a lot we was moved to new places I was always the new kid Milotic you know my mom married my stepdad we moved across the country from New Jersey to San Francisco and we lived there for a while and then we moved to Florida then we moved to Boston and he he switched careers and he was a computer programmer and then became an architect and so it was a lot of life yeah there's a lot of traveling and I just was always the the new kid and the new kid gets ya and most the time was fine but as we got started getting older that's when it got creepy like most the time was no big deal like at nine and ten it's no big deal but when it gets to be like thirteen and fourteen then it starts getting violent and so like kids we pick on me and I know how to fight and it drove me crazy like I was like god I fucking hate the fact that when these kids want to fight me I don't know what to do and I'm terrified so I'd be like go go home the long way around so I'd avoid everybody and that kind of shit so I decided to learn martial arts I said well what am I afraid of I'm afraid of people that know how to fight well I really know how to fight so I went into it did it became my whole life like from from high school freshman year on really from fifteen is when I went crazy so from 15 on that's all I did everyday like six seven days a week I was teaching I was I became I was I was teaching when I was 17 I was that's what I was doing like every day that was teaching at Boston University when I was 18 and 19 and I was that's became my whole life were you born in Boston no it's born New Jersey right how come you don't have the crazy accent rid of it heard myself on TV haha I won the Bay State Games is this big like an Olympic Festival whether they had all the Olympic sports and ones Taekwondo had not been in the Olympics yet but it was about to be so they had it in the Bay State Games and I won so they interviewed me on TV and I remember tall like very specifically say we will work and really had our there accent accent it was so bad I heard the video and I was like oh my god what the fuck is wrong with me like I had taken on that accent out of insecurity cuz I only lived there since I was 13 right so from 13 to 19 in six years I developed a stupid accent you just wanted to fit in I fall under fit yeah then I realized how Donna was so I banded that but it'll come out a little bit if I get drunk yeah like every now and then so like somewhere it's a little something to me shocks you didn't grow up in it yeah of course it's gross when you hear another girl haha fuck me hotter yeah it's just like it's like too many are the are thing yeah it stretches yeah wondering it comes from like the mix of the Irish I suppose although the Irish don't speak like that no Irish is beautiful I like that accents pretty something about the Boston accents just particularly gross so hold on so sorry to ask you these questions who's going to worry about so you are you're fighting and then your pal talk to you into becoming my friend sleeve Graham to my friends edge shorter and Steve Graham Steve Graham still one of my best friends today he was an ophthalmologist at the time yeah I'm so encourage you to what go to you told me I should be a medium class or like literally grabbed me by my shoulders and said you should be a comedian so then what happened I went to an open mic night I watched amateurs try it and one of the good things about amateurs is if you go to watch like most of them don't know what they're doing they're terrible so I was like okay well I can't be as you know at least I'm not gonna be the only one who sucks so like if if I go up and do that I can do what they're doing they suck I suck too but they suck so it's not like you're going up and Richard Pryor's on here yeah yeah Richard Jeni and although you could take the competition well no I felt like I wouldn't be the only one who sucked like people who really suck inspire you to do it because it'll they lower the bar of expectation cuz like if I went up there and it was all these really amazing comedians and then to me I'd be like oh I can't do this I some fucking terrible at it because the learning curve of stand-up comedy's so long sure and especially when you're 21 you don't know shit but didn't know anything about life or anything well of course you didn't exactly so I was terrible but somehow another these guys talked me into doing it do you still do your stand-up yeah constantly yeah yeah that's great yeah you turn it around on me shirtless you're dead yeah clever girl yeah yeah don't know why that I wish you know you don't think you're clever I don't think I'm particularly clever I can think fast on my feet that makes clever but I have a serious attention deficit disorder yeah see I hear that a lot from people I usually think that what that means is you really enjoy certain things so much that other things suck for you and you just get distracted I bet you know I bet you don't have an attention deficit disorder when you're singing your songs no of course not ah but that again is is not a material you have to retrieve it's just stuff in there you open your might thing comes out right but do you think that it's possible that you achieve these high frequencies of delight and stimulation to see when you are performing and when you're mean you got to think that when you're onstage it was the biggest crowd you were perform for this sounds like I'm making up I don't because even I can hardly believe it but we played in front of 300,000 people in Samara Russia and that was the trickiest experience of my life ah at the time it was the biggest fete Music Festival that I'd ever been but you couldn't see the end of the crowd now I look at Glastonbury gamla small you know how it goes yeah so think of that think of that experience how many people are ever gonna feel that how many but ever people people are ever going to rock out in front of 300 thousand people so I think that some people there the the moments of brilliance that these moments of spectacular experience that they have are so different than most people's lives my totally disagree hmm 100% awesome because I know that people's capacity for joy that it's a certain experience that we all have like I can go out to dinner and if you're having a really great meal and you're with people that you love and are really and you are laughing yourself sick I have the same feelings as I do when I'm having a good show I don't think it like it's not like my career is the highlight of my life it's a it's a joyous part of my life that plays a role in my enjoyment of being on earth that sounds very balanced but I'm not saying that she so I think leave you my point being is that I just think if you enjoy your job if you love your wife if you have great sex with your boyfriend or your girlfriend if you have a baby you know that moment when they put the baby in your arms you know exactly what it's like to play in front of 300 thousand people hmm you know I don't think that's I think that is correct you're the only one to be able to tell us though I'm telling you I'd let me take it from an authority I guess there's not denier you argue with my hair okay I cannot but I was going to say those that you're experienced in the intensity is so high that your capacity to appreciate boring shit is probably very low and that's one of the reasons why people would lay label it like attention-deficit you probably just don't want to pay attention to shit that you're not passionate which that was the case but there is moments when somebody's telling me something and I'm thinking to myself okay remember this because this is important and or this is really cool you could use it all the time I'm going to hold this information hold this fact hold this and then I try and tell somebody 24 hours later but this incredible story I was told and I can't remember anything about it that's called buta person drives me insane yeah but you haven't slipped away at all during this conversation no I'm intense yeah you've been locked on I'm intense and I am a weak you are what you're woke and I'm Oh chuckle hahahaha hear that fucking expression one more time I might get the next person of whose might that comes like oh that is an expression that never had its day Oh was that sure that's Dee oh yes joke from the moment I first came out me hunted with who fools oh yes Only Fools no no like person that I know like ever said that word without being ingested joking no I hang out a lot of comedians yeah you well they're fast and quick and fun but also they think it's ridiculous so it's also your job as a comedian to take the piss out of all US no yes Norm's that is one thing that I love that you guys say take the piss yeah like that is a great expression skaaland has some incredible like yes incredible expressions and sort of the most one of the best things that happened to me lately was I got retweeted by William Gibson really big fan and he retweeted a Scottish a link that I'd done on or done for the NME on Scottish Sweden and the fact that he had reposted my tutorial on Scottish whaling made my fucking life call me sad if you want but it was like the most glorious moment of my career that's what I'm sad at all there's nothing sad about that but yeah the Scots are really funny you know it's a small culture because it's bad weather I mean these are stupefying sir cliches I'm spewing here but because it's a small country because it's bad weather because we spend a lot of time talking to one another passing one another in the streets a lot of humour yeah that in America fighting is not quite as cute you know people are used to Vera bleah sparring in Scotland but you know against people all the time pushing past them in shops you know travelling in the tube being on the bus blah blah blah blah whereas in America everything's more spread out and you're not around people so much so when you are in face to face with them people are a little more polite and Scotland there is absolutely no politeness well you guys have that big comedy festival there every year bro yeah you been there you know haven't booked a you know Soviet - Ari

cliche but sure it plays a small part no it's not it's not cliche at all so yeah there's a hundred percent yeah I mean I'm in Boston the same thing a lot of bad weather a lot of cold snow people indoors people long winters that's - yeah no it's for stupid shit yeah no tolerance we also work ethic like hard work ethic they're very hard yeah you had no tolerance for meandering bullshit no it's very different it's a different way of thinking certainly than Los Angeles mm-hm and my experience resolved out here Chris are are very polite mm and they are soft for want of a better term it's like I find that sometimes when I make jokes people don't know how to flip it back you know like it's not everybody's joking all the time and it's really fast so dialogue yeah people panic people panic yeah they're scared they're gonna offend you and believe me say the wrong thing you know sometimes I have to go on double dates with my wife and sometimes I'll crack a joke and the whole table will be like what yeah but if you've done yeah and I always go home and in the car I'll say to my husband I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you tonight and he says he's almost got this classic he won't even embarrassed me you only embarrassed yourself seriously joking kind of half-and-half I mean it's definitely we both know when I've said something mildly inappropriate hey do you feel like you're like because you're from Scotland that you have like to temper that all the time I do try and temper it a lot sometimes I'm forget you know and then there's the crickets yeah oh my god I'm a poor husband who's very very sort of quiet like he's very quiet oh and he thinks a lot for he speaks and I can just see him in his mind I mean he loved me and he doesn't it doesn't bother him at all he did he doesn't get embarrassed but he esta you can see him guarding his loins you know like oh god did she just say that what it was expression is Girt angus lawyer I think is loyal guard Tang I don't even

is a this is a show of education there's plenty more where that goes oh so are you fired up about this tour you excited about this of course yeah my god yeah I love I love playing I mean I'm sure that is a certain kind of high you get when you go off in the road and you ticket you can stop worrying about bills you stop worrying about money stop worrying about you know the pain in your ankle you know you just have no worries you just go on a tour bus and you get bussed for me to be you get a little email every day that tells you exactly what you're doing you know at noon to a tour manager that handles yes oh that's nice yes yeah um I love going on tour and it's an honor to be playing with blondie and the fans are very excited and how many days you go for I think it's about seven weeks oh whoa which is a small tuna for us that's a long time normally go out for a year a year a year yeah one off you know I mean you come home for bits but generally it's a so your long thing it used to be two years but then the music industry got crushed by music fine shooting so it's a slightly different game night but isn't the touring business the same or how does that work well yes and no I mean the problem with the tutoring business know is that it's the only way a musician can make money so know the competition to score venues in which you can play is getting higher and higher and higher yes I noticed that as a community lead if achill it's a huge issue like I have to book stuff like a year in advance yeah so yeah big Edinburgh Festival next year well didn't I come over you'll love it oh you'll learn all kinds of phrases that you can employ in your standup that nobody's ever used in America lots of original material hmm maybe hahahaha hmm so what you guys though you were in the business when the money was being made yes we were then god it was like what is it around like 2000 when the floor dropped out the floor was beginning to drop out and then 2001 came around and servants and well Napster was a was yeah that was the beginning of the end yeah did you see the writing on the wall do you think they were gonna be able to I took that whole oh I totally saw the writing on the wall I actually wrote about it at the time I ran a blog a music blog which was you know one of the first back then because nobody's Asians didn't have blogs we didn't you really use computers up to that point so I had this blog and I was very vocal about Napster and I was I could foresee the issues that you know that presented themselves but the industry itself was so greedy it refused to adapt you know and what do you think has died been done I don't know it's not my place to worry about it really but they just continue to want to make money via sea and physical sales and they refused sort of to make the kind of deals that they really need to and digital deals yeah yeah it took a while before people started selling things on iTunes and what happe but there wasn't really a venue for it before that they would have had if create like they would have had to create it but the real the only ones who had the power and the financial resources to do so you know yeah and as a result now of course they are the only ones making money I mean the company's record companies continue to make vast amounts of money off artists YouTube makes vast amounts of money off artists and the artist makes nothing I don't think the general public are fully aware of what a crime spree is crime is a crime spree it's a crime spree but who's who's committing the crimes well they're tiny crimes committed against each artist that like compiles a vast library of digital content that through which massive companies conglomerates make money from by just sheer mass but the artists themselves makes you know less than a penny a pop less than a penny a pop you know so I give you guys like I bought your albums on iTunes well we had a bad example too because we are her own record label at this point you are your own record yes what about an example we're one of the lucky ones mmm and when did you figure this out haha buy a lot of getting fucked up they are so you know no Louvre was used and you know yeah we are we were around long enough the art some of our masters reverted to us and so we could make really lucrative deals for ourselves and protect our catalog and you know it's blah blah blah it's so boring but it's not boring it's faster than three young artists I I don't know I despair it's like you know you're hooked up to a record label the record label makes money buy your records getting played on YouTube for an example you don't not really I mean it's like a 0.037 five percentage of a penny that you might get played after buy a thousand million plays on YouTube I mean this it's bizarre but you know it's whole it is you want it what is the justification for record company at this point it seems like what with wistar bution yeah but like where they distribute a lot of the world but - where - and then what in what manner in a variety of different manners I mean they now do 360 degree so they take a percentage of absolutely everything AB and Arun's which was not the case before generally speaking they nice so up your publishing they sawed up your performance rates they sew up your merch these any endorsements you get that seems fucked up to me it is fucked up doesn't doesn't seem like it's worth it like what do they what do they bring to the table all they ours are just a bunch of people stealing money except if you're a massive pop star like you to be on Sara Gaga or Katy Perry or Bieber what-have-you then that company can use its resources to make you even bigger and that's why these these pop stars who continue to make commercial sounding music get bigger and bigger and bigger more and more powerful until they can just buy their way into the consciousness of the of public culture hmm but radio is not much of a thing anymore no it's not radio anymore but its visibility you have to have visibility so what is it that's getting people visible these days like like it used to be a song would be a top 40 hit on the radio and then everybody would hear about and you'd want to go out and buy the record well I think most young people get on the web right but like how does but viral music like if you release a song and you're with your label it's your own thing and you put it on YouTube and say someone like me comes along and has a lot of Twitter followers and I say this is awesome and I retweet it and a bunch of other people retweet it that's all it takes today right yes and no I mean you have to have a song though that's easily digestible which is why there's so few musicians now taking real risks because although if they take a risk they don't have a shade of all song you know that appeals to the masses then so you die but to see what I mean I mean I'm not articulating myself in that Kendrick Lamar guy is that guy he's he independent is he the guy that's independent which cut chanst the rap chance the rapper he's the guy that's independent and he's enormous right yes so how the fuck did he do it well there's obviously always an exception to the rule and he's extraordinary you know he's an extraordinary talent and and usually when somebody hasn't reached public consciousness yet there's a lot of hype around them you know people want to be in the know they want to talk about the new artists everywhere know about so and so forth so they enjoy like a massive swell right um and hopefully he'll be able to build upon that but it'll be harder for them the next time right what I'm getting at is that it's it is fascinating to me the record companies have managed to stay even remotely relevant because like what cuz they made all these deals with all these new companies I know but that's not where kidneys that's where it gets really creepy right I think it's creepy it is creepy it is creepy if someone is not in the business it's creepy because I'm looking at like what they bring to the table and there's not a lot well they bring as I said distribution and if you don't I know this first time because it's very difficult for us to get to distribute our music because we don't have a distribution label that can compete right but when you say distribution like distribute it we're we're we're whatever they can so whether that ads on the street whether that ads on the television whether it's ads on the radio whether it's ads on YouTube and so on so forth it's just an accumulative like awareness of an artist so they're almost manufacturing like Public Interest kind of yeah I mean that they have to have a semblance of something good you know thinking you can't write you can sell shit as it turns out but that's again the exception to the rule right generally speaking they'll have a catchy song and they can if they push it to enough Minds eyes they can have a hit wow what a weird transition they're like vampires they figured out how to remain indoors yeah this may very strange and and it is kind of sad really that's why you're seeing fewer and fewer artists that have long careers because like I said you can generate a lot of excitement when it's your first record that's sort of the when it's easiest right by the time it comes to your second record a lot these artists that we heat up are already dead and buried under a billion and one other new artists hmm yeah I'm sure you read that Courtney Love article that she wrote many many years ago about the music business about how complicated it is and this is pre all this digital stuff she wrote this way back in the day which was explaining how these are get fucked over by music companies about how everything gets written off as an expense so by the time they get paid everybody else has been paid everybody else is like the record company's made money the executives made money and then the artists get money yeah and all the expenses get written off as expenses that the artists have to pay for but you have no control over the expending right so for a random example you can turn up an airport you've flown from LA to London you you arrive and there's a limousine waiting for you and you don't even question it you're like oh this is the transport the record company of cent they take you to this ridiculous hotel the posture than you've ever been in your life you don't think about it the record company's paying for it they throw a huge big party Wow how generous our record company is so amazing well look at this incredible party and they're charging you for charging you for every single thing and yet none of it gets run through you for your approval so you have no power over the economic spending but you get charged back absolutely every single expenditure not only that the salaries of the people that run these companies all that is dependent upon you selling your art that's right and it when things are going well everyone's there good where did we do an amazing job you know worship me you know literally everyone in the record company you you always so thank you and aren't we amazing and I let me talk to you no but it's an inference like yeah I did that we did this look at how what a great job we did for you and your band and you're like yeah great thank you so much that is wonderful and then the second something goes wrong is you're on your own you guys need to figure this out we're just your record label we can't you know I mean it's just like it's it's it's difficult to deal with first but then you get used to it now in the early days did they take a piece of your tour no no they never have with us but they do now with young bands it's called a 360 deal where they take how much does it take I don't know it's different for every band every single band has to negotiate its own stance what's a normal I'd absolutely percent 15 20 percent 20 percent so they would take 20 percent of all your touring so they would be like if you're a person BAM they'd be like the fifth person in the band correct boy the merch your fucking t-shirts holy shit yeah they take everything it's it's pretty weird and pretty grim right now this is what it's weird is like what are they I don't understand what they're doing well I don't think they do either I think I think to be honest they're still trying to figure out what their rule can be in this new world you know it's difficult for them Wow weren't weren't weren't wrong life is tough well it's it's a fascinating time because this digital thing that came along what's really interesting is that you know we saw when the economy fell apart right we saw banks getting bailed out and we saw these music company's going under we saw a lot of issues a lot of collapses and it's all because of these emerging technologies but these emerging technologies also on the flip side make it so much easier for people to find out about you yes absolutely I think things will I think it will bounce itself again right I think younger artists are going to get way smarter than we ever we're and just go hold on a minute we're not signing these rights they have to because there's no reason for that today it just doesn't make it that's what it's so confusing to me like giving away your merch and you're touring like unless they're booking the tour for you unless they're acting on management see though how the fuck are they getting a piece that's what I'm saying that's me I just like that's where else an agent gets a piece because they book it they set it up they arrange the publicity they do all that like they deserve a piece like that's a business deal like it seems like they're just stealing money well it seems a little bit like that I would agree I mean what's what like friends for instance in our business we make 10% of everything we earn so that's basically we know that what we can make a certain amount of money and by the time we've paid everybody will take 10% home for all the band members each band member gets 10% okay forty percent okay 40 percent of what we make this is not even taxes you don't even talking about we're not talking about tax by the time the touch decimate it would be you know you were decimated but we are one of the bands who don't have to pay a percentage of our tooling and our merit and we're one of the bands who get a very high royalty on our records because we only we only give away a tiny tiny percentage of every record to our distribution company so we're one of the lucky ones so we're always thinking well if this is how it is for us oh I could sit for all these other young artists and there's a big thing about young artists they have to pretend that they're rich so everybody has to drive around a Ferrari you have to have a 3000 hour watch on your wrist you have to walk around like a baller I really reject all that and I think I advise everybody else to reject it too I think we're beginning to move towards a new world order because the worshipping of money we can't sustain our lives in our world the way things are right now well it comes from people being poor and wanting to aspire to be rich and then once you make it you have to sort of put that show on right I mean that's but that's a huge thing in the rap community right with rappers it's almost mandatory it's a very rare that someone bucks the trend where they're not wearing a lot of jewelry and driving around a Bentley although I feel that again that's changing too I hope so you know but um yeah I've never fall in love with those kind of acts you know yes fur coats and yeah limousines and I don't know it's just not my style ya know it's uh I mean it's it comes from you know economically deprived people that finally break through and course I understand yeah it's always been but it's uh it's almost like the fun part of like the rap business like a big part of the fun part I mean how many fuckin rap songs are about jewelry and diamonds and cars and mansions and you see what when I was growing up as we were talking about being the same age earlier on it was really uncool to talk about money right and all the cultural heroes where we didn't have money and would never talk about money right and actually often it was heartbreaking when you've discovered they we're rich because they were kind of our workingmen's heroes you know our workingman heroes like go back to Kurt Cobain you wore like converse all-stars and slipped up gene sorry flannel shirts further back the Matt you know like like John Lennon or something right you know yeah all these deaths you know but that's why I was sort of indoctrinated in when I was growing up right which I'm actually it's only grateful for I don't I don't want to be some worships money well it's a foolish thing to worship because you know the the ultimately like what an artist is doing is there they're trying to express themselves in the most unique way possible and connect with people right you're supposed to you're trying to show the world through your eyes you're trying to express yourself and if all you're trying to express is that you want to stack cheques stack what is it what do they call stack on deck when the hell was that stacks on deck stacks on deck that's like a big thing robbers those kids today hahaha stacks I would mind if stacks on deck stacked on deck just to just to have a little cushion yeah it's always nice to have a cushion right I feel like these days are long gone it is crazy though that you guys only get 10% and you really stop and think about it all and then you pay taxes on the 10% I don't think people understand that no III really don't think people understand about the same time like nobody wants to hear a musician whine no but I know many people who live who will have very modest jobs who are way wealthier than we are at this point you know yeah but you know that's that's life I never became an artist cuz I wanted to be rich Ryan well you would be so much happier being who you are then not being able to say and being wealthy exactly yeah and I also met a lot of rich people in my time and they're miserable they certainly can be chasing that yeah very isolated and I know I could cut on my hands they might have really rich people I know who live happy lives who seem like they know what to do with their money and they these people definitely right there you know they have all their happy marriages happy kids balanced kids you know they know when to have fun they know how to work hard you know blah blah blah blah but they're the exception to the rule yeah super rare it's what the pursuit is such a strange pursuit because you know in often times when you're pursuing wealth you're pursuing wealth at all costs I mean that is that the ultimate goal is the score that you put on the board I mean that's the Gordon Gecko philosophy greed is good right or greed will protect me I mean I understand that why people feel and and they're not always wrong either where money can protect you from a lot of tragedies that's our president when our president is essentially the greediest good guy I mean he mean that is who he is I mean that's what he's done I mean he has understood well but all cost but he was also born into wealth a little bit yeah and nothing was a little bit I think it was a staunch element of money he inherited well he was given two million dollars to start his business first business yes and he talks about it a small loan small loan small loan of two million dollars yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean it's he certainly has inherited quite a bit of it we know about no doubt about it but my point is that his philosophy and like what he's always pursued is extravagant like the big gold letters on the side of the skyscrapers that's his thing yeah and it's a sting it's in a lot of ways it's a dangerous ideology for a country to aspire to because everybody can't let's just yes both can't attain that so what use then saying to people who have that who will never have that that's kind of what leaves me in great dismay I understand the pursuit of money and economic well-being by now I feel like what do we then say to the people that don't have that and never will have that right that must be something else other than the worshipping of money yeah it's a hollow pursuit it's an it's a pursuit that's like it's not examined closely enough for for its hollowness if that's a word I was having a conversation once with this friend of mine who is uh he's pretty radical black guy so pretty radical african-american and just very proud of african-american heritage and he he went on this thing about how black people used to be Kings he's like we were Kings to understand that I go stop I go you can't everybody can't be a king because if you have a bunch of kings like it to be a kings to be a dictator okay that means you're dominating people who aren't Kings that's not a proud thing like you got to stop saying that like you're you say it's the wrong thought process but it's the thought process is his in his eye he had examined it like his in his ideas like at one point time we were Africans we were kings we were that we were on top and then you know slavery and all this other stuff so his like his thought process was kind of convoluted and by saying we were Kings like you don't want to be a can king man like nobody should be a fucking king should be zero Kings you definitely not want to see we were Kings like we can be Kings again like don't be a king yeah I don't want to be king I don't want to be a queen well it's a big thing with fighters like some fighters called himself King this or King that they like the part of their name you know it's a weird it's only African American guys I don't know any white guys call himself King oh come on don't owe fighters white fighter oh you don't know about that world yeah like me Bobby King Green King Bobby Green King mo I know I know like five or six King Kevin Casey times when you feel that you're you're a disadvantage in us is society you know words are powerful and they can the words we tell ourselves are really powerful and perhaps you can manifest a power that you need sometimes we all need it sometimes I know I need it myself you know we're you know you think to yourself okay you need to remember what you have done what you've accomplished who you are who your mother is you know I think that there's a lot to be said I guess sure for the casual use of certain words but you're right I mean as we continue to use these words we have to examine their meaning yeah I think I definitely think that's the case I think that it the the wealth at all costs is a foolish pursuit that people look at when they don't have the wealth I mean that's when it becomes an attractive thing is the idea that you know you just got to get that paper when you've got the wealth I think the greediest people are the people who are I've got shit loads of money that's why we see a lot of these these people with money wanting to cut that have their taxes cut rather than inject some taxes into the community I mean I'd much rather live in a more pleasant community than sit in my golden tower by myself with like riots going on history you know I mean I feel like if you make everybody happy err yeah can still be rich but you're gonna have a nicer Garden to walk I into that's a very good attitude it's a very good attitude I think it's a weird game that people play where it becomes just about getting those points up on the board and that they become the numbers become meaningless like you don't sing you don't think I have thirty million dollars I can't spend this this is if I live a normal life I'm good they don't think that they think I need 50 million I need an island well there's on a jet how much is enough babe yeah you know how much is enough and of course the more you accumulate the more your expenses are and the more you want so it just goes on and on and on and on there's an amazing Radiolab podcast that's out now about Bernie Madoff oh there's a show coming yeah see right Robert De Niro was playing boy I sure she's still hot as fuck he's so hot gotta be 80 90 years old now ha ha ha she is still so beautiful so hot it's crazy underutilized actress I'm looking forward to it sorry I interrupted cut no worries but it's just that we interview him and you get to hear him talk and the reporter called him in jail and it's really fascinating way they had to communicate because they're only allowed to communicate for 15 minutes and then they have to the phone is disconnected and then they have to wait 15 minutes for they can reconnect so he's doing this yeah that's just the rules of the prison so they're doing the Amy he's in there forever he's never getting out of that fucking kid yeah but it's fascinating when you hear him he has zero empathy I mean none it's weird it's weird hearing him talk about these people that he ripped off and finding these like oh they're fine these people that you know they they had money it's like his you know they're not it's no big deal like and you listening to the way this guy sort of rationalized but he is essentially the poster boy for that greed at all costs because he was just it was running a Ponzi scheme he's stealing money from people it's funny I was again talking about this with my husband earlier on today because we were talking about what is the difference between a Republican and the Democrat like what is essentially the difference because I know lots I have very good friends who are Republicans who I respect enormous ly and and you know they have taught me a lot and they have changed the way I view the world and so on and so forth but essentially I wonder is it that Democrats are able to utilize their imagination in Republican is less imaginative I mean I don't know I'm using out light I have no answers I'm just curious about what drives someone towards the left and what drives someone towards the right because it's certainly no but one site is good and one side is bad one site is really smart and the other side isn't it's it's nothing to do with that so what is it that drives us towards these embattled positions that are cooking but it's right now in America seems so acute hmm you know there just seems to be no meriting of the two sides and I'd love to know why I wish I knew more about how that all works I think people are very easily influenced I think people are very tribal and I think people it's very easy to influence I'm going to get them to adopt a predetermined pattern of thinking and if that predetermined pattern of thinking is right-wing or left-wing if you're around those people and you seek social status by committing to a certain ideology you get embedded in it it becomes a part of your thinking becomes a part of your life and then that is the pattern that you bore you dig deep you dig deep trenches in terms of your psychology you dig deep trenches in your mind that are unwavering and whether they're left-wing or right-wing it becomes very problematic when you have two teams like that we were talking about Holland the other day that Holland has something like 17 different parties that viable parties you know unlike what we have where we have this one too now you have a few joke parties like the Green Party that no one takes seriously libertarians nobody takes seriously they never even come close to winning and when you have one or two and one of them is conservative and one of them is liberal it just automatically people identify with one or the other and they whether it's from upbringing or the community that they're attached to or what-have-you or life experiences past positive or negative they just immediately gravitate towards one or the other they dig in and then they start talking shit about the left or they start talking shit about the right and you know you got salon.com and you got fox news and everybody's lobbing bombs at each other and it's just fucking weird why have we not seen any break I mean I get that generally speaking like I understand and I totally agree with what you're saying but that generally that is what occurs mm-hmm but surely on both sides of the fence you have free thinkers there must be a few there's more now than I think there's more now than ever before but this is a very weird time in terms of Trump and Trump winning because that he's sort of engaged the like they've sort of there's a bunch of people that are not necessarily political that are really into being a right-winger now it's almost like online trolls and people that just like to be a part of a team and they just like to fuck with people they call snowflakes or liberals it's weird it's weird time I think we're gonna get through it I think it's looking like a Goldwater Republican days it's like I think we need to have like bad examples that we need to go well let's not do that again yeah and then collectively the arc of history is long and the age of the world is infinite it is but the America is young as fuck yeah that's part of the problem it's this weird new experiment and self-government that's really only been going on for a few hundred years yeah it's easy to look at a few hundred years of being a long time but it's really not no it's not especially you guys Scotland you know you guys have been around forever be the right fucking Braveheart days and shit yeah but the thing about the Free Press that's what worries me as a foreigner living in this country and seeing this sort of stuff that's being spewed about the Free Press really is worrisome it's worrisome when it comes to the President himself that's that's good yeah there's only been two presidents our history that have actually gone to war with the press and one of them was Richard Nixon I mean this is so unprecedented time that someone disrespects the idea of the press and and news this is ideal being challenged yes it like nobody likes getting challenged it doesn't feel very nice no because no I disagree with you it doesn't feel good but you know aren't we all at the point where we're willing to at least listen and start I should be yeah but it's very scary I think well he's a dictator in a lot of ways I mean and then he was challenged the other day and by CBS they were asking him about Obama wiretapping and why did he meet up yeah and he wound up both it's either some you say he could say it was a lie but there's some validity to it where there was some surveillance being going on but whether or not it was Obama or whether or not its standard surveillance that the NSA has been perpetrating for a long time which I think was the case I think it's more that then a I think fucking everybody's getting spied on I mean that I think that's really what's going on so you can say I'm being spied on I think you'd be correct but you say Obama spying on me I don't think that's correct yeah so I think we'll take the interview yeah he walked out when they were challenging he doesn't like being challenged you listen you know he doesn't like anybody questioning him and he feels like he could just leave he doesn't feel like the press is important he feels like he's got a strong enough base all these people that will just yell out fake news I mean he's made this this sort of meme when he pointed that CNN guy said you are fake news yeah like what is this is a scary time very disturbing but I think in some ways that's good and this is why I think I think we need as human beings need resistance we need something to push back against yeah and it helps us it helps us sort of reinvigorate our collective ideas and reinvigorate knowing now that this is possible we didn't know this was possible no we didn't think he was going to win if we did if he did win Jesus Christ we didn't think he's going to win like this and didn't think that he was going to sort of dismantle the EPA and do all these different things he's doing kick away the fucking satellites they use for climate I mean there's a lot of shit that's going on that's very problematic to science and scientists and they're being really frustrated right now so now they know now they know and now we know no I totally agree no I think the u.s. press since September 11th have actually the standard of journalism has been sliding now for a decade yes not longer and now all of a sudden journalists are being held to account and they are having to step up their game again which i think is great for the American people to happen to enjoy good journalism yeah I think you're right yeah so I'm not to take something relatively I think it's sad you don't I think it is I think it's the same thing that's kind of happened to the music business I think journalism experienced this new wave of media and information being distributed by anyone whether it's a Breitbart or anyone who just creates a blog and just starts pumping out their agenda Huffington Post salon.com whatever it is they become these aggregates for news that they feel fits with their agenda they agenda that they would like to promote and push and you know whether it's full left-wing like salon calm or full right wing like Breitbart both of them are problematic and that's where the New York Times is to really step up and I think they're trying to I think you're right yeah yeah I think they are so yeah I mean it's it's weird times but weird times create great art no it does it it really creates good people - yeah good for it I think what you were saying earlier on is really true like when people are tested that's when you see them at their best yes so pressure creates diamonds creates diamonds are you feeling that fits my mind he's dealing I don't know it's the old term I believe it's good yeah it's good it's real it's legit haha working fund in here are lawyers and shit we see it a lot a lot of things happen doesn't you got to get out of here um so do you yes I do so um where can people find out tour information and garbage is your Twitter handle and is that do you handle all that do you do that so for the most part I do I try and I didn't like the feeling of somebody pretending to be me and
