[Music] he's a he's like you said he's a straight I'll figure it out what's going on with that cuz I saw he posted Instagram that he's in Big Bear he's in Big Bear with his family enjoying the snow Oh just chillin you know I thought he was going up there to Train I thought it was on got hopeful yeah I know I know but you know what they're trying to do what they're trying to do Aldo and nurmagomedov for a fucking interim 155 and I'm like how do you have a 155 interim when Connor just won the 155 a week ago what about max though what about max hallway yeah well he's got the inter 145 such shit Joe and Holloway inter on cuz all over nigga Murtaugh is sick yeah yeah it's a great fight although versus murder well especially when you see what went happened with Michael Johnson Michael Johnson stunned Habib you know he stunned them he hit him and stung them and Michael Johnson with all due respect is nowhere near the striker that Josie Aldo is Jose Jose Aldo is on a totally different you think Josie's as powerful as Johnson exposed the question because he's not as big he's been fighting in 145 his whole career and he's gonna be fighting a fuckin guerrilla no Russian go where there's a difference between Johnson's bottom game and all those bottom one so all those kicks they're a giant factor because if you if called oh who has amazing takedown defense fucking amazing defense so he's also gotten fucking nasty leg kicks so if never gonna meant off moves at him what is this who is this who is this what are you show me here a beam number coming off slams UFC for lying to the fans about Josie Aldo demands relevant fight against turn well hasn't seen his line to the fans let's see let's see what he says here this goddamn screen dude it's clear to everyone that you hiding Conor from me but stop lying to your fans like I don't want fight with Aldo I'm ready to fight with anyone in my division give me relevant fight so you won't first of all take your phone away from your sister cuz somebody somebody got this phone then making know he's dead she's so loud but I love it it makes it more gangster okay you've never matched up what is it I can't see that Jamie this thing's in front of it oh you never matched up two guys with a nine and eight win streak in the UFC never in UFC history okay that doesn't mean anything see here's the problem slice nobody second it's too expensive I see what he's saying but let me explain why it's wrong they need big relevant fights to sell paper views right that's all they care about here's the deal the UFC was purchased for four billion dollars billion Majan if you bought I mean you have a you own a place right cream you own your house yeah you know what a mortgage is sure mortgages are pretty kunti you look at them every month and go Jesus you know now if you have a mortgage for a nice house and you spent a million bucks that's a fucking nut you got to make every month man you gotta think about it you got to go okay we got the mortgages covered all right and then you move on with all the other bills where I told me about it son imagine a four billion dollar house what kind of fucking mortgage and how do we pay the bills by doing huge fights huge so we got to figure some shit out interim interim interim everybody about the reality as John Jones is suspended and John Jones isn't even the champ right now so when he comes back he's not even fighting for a world title unless he fights for the world title so you got to have DC has got to be healthy or you got to have John fight for an interim because they're just throwing interims out like the fucking Flyers that they're put on your car when dudes are trying to like sell carwash yeah my brother if they don't start getting these fucking cars selling they're gonna be another season the fifth factors gonna be added on pretty no there's not no there's not gonna CCM son for some Brad Pitt just to sell paper B's or some shit I'll do something Doug I don't know what they're gonna do but when you look at when you look at like the the the the title picture who like that card that they have in Brooklyn I mean that is that's a pay-per-view card and it looks like an fs1 card right now I'm sure they're gonna juice it up they'll get more but it's gonna be a die-hard fan yeah pay 60 bucks for that it's hard it's hard to make those cards so we I think we kind of nailed it when we were talking about it earlier like what guys cell pay-per-views I think Woodley is a bigger star now that he'd be Wonder Boy but he still wants that a pay-per-view chill and like Jana now we're having this conversation it's like you can't have Nick Diaz he was Nick Diaz doesn't want to fight since 2011 you can't have him step in and just go right up to the title I know though that's what I said I said but I want to see it he goes I want to see it too but you can't can you sell it yeah well you will know it's gonna take the sport serious if you give a guy who hasn't won since 2011 or 12 give him a title shot people fans who might come on bro season but I think they missed the boat if they wanted to make the fucking big money it's Nick Diaz vs Conor McGregor was too big for he's too big way too big I think that talk is nonsense because Conor's of 155-pound champ Nate fought at 155 most of his career he fought at 170 a couple of times and he's undersized dong-young can beat him at 117 he's a he's a legit 170 though maybe but he fights 155 easy look great against Michael McDonald at 55 tyron woodley if his fucking life depends on it tyron woodley so I could make it 55 the champ can't make 155 at 170 Nate can't so nate is not a real 170 now here's to your point in Dana's point here's one of fight since 2011 and enough Conor your your cash cow fight this monster hasn't won presents a great story Big Brother steps in come on I watch it I'd watch him in but to you to your point they have to figure something out to get these stars it is you can't do it overnight to me it doesn't matter you put Nick Diaz for what he's done out of respect who's gonna complain well apparently offered Nick Diaz Robbie Lawler and Nick passed on it that's the word that's the word behind the scenes interesting maybe I'll say that but I wanted to see that fight I would see that rematch but I think Nick wants a fucking title fight you know I think Nick is like look I want a big big name or a title fight I will they make these demands he's got money McNichol money he's not ridiculous he doesn't spend it all well how about Nate I'm not I'm not answering the call this is 20 million yeah we talked about we talked about that recently in the podcast I was like well let's break this down because like let's say they do a million pay-per-view buys which is like top end right there's only a few people that have ever sold a millions like Brock Ronda Connor sit okay a million is top of the food chain so a million pay-per-view buys at 60 bucks that's you're taking one third right off the bat for Nate it's really hard to justify giving someone 20 million dollars it's gonna be real hard and then obviously I could demand that Connors like one of the only guys that can get that kind of money he's the only guys do you think eventually guys will just start doing I think it's so big like Connor he just does his own show and he gets his own people know you'll see lawyers are too good to let you get out of your contract that if Nate had a legit fight with someone other than Connor that was exciting the problem is there's no one else in the division that's got that kind of marquee value at 55 yeah there's no one in the division that has the kind of marquee value that if you had a look I think Nate is a fucking huge star but in lesson especially now I mean after he beat Connor he's one of the biggest stars outside of that upper echelon pay-per-view like love like him time he's but he's not a world title holder right now so if you wanted to really have a big fight for Nate and have him that would work help him fight all that would work that would work [Music]
