and powerful young Tony in Cliff hello I'm smelling this weed in 12 hours I'll be free I'm excited for you did I didn't do shit for silver October did you stay drunk I didn't stay drunk I just had a drink or two pretty much every night would you ever consider doing something like over October I mean like if you know if I was a part of it and like I got all that promotional push that everybody's giving themselves hell yeah for the business point the only reason you do that's the only reason I would do it I have no reason I mean I mean you know I'm in perfect shape feel good about life every day is good you know I've been cutting back on things naturally like I'm done with my like college years of you know getting wasted at the store and things like that like it's like we're also not smoking cigarettes anymore right I'm off cigarettes which helps a lot by the way you know I gotta say for anybody out there that drinks and smokes the to correlate you quit one it's gonna help with the other big type I mean I'm just saying like cutting back on smoking because the to go so good together yeah you were finding that those pens weren't really helping you that much huh the nicotine dependence oh yeah no I love them yeah they're did it help you quit yeah you were still you were saying that it's not the same it's not the same I mean when you're mean you love cigarettes and both of my parents smoked not my mom quit when she got pregnant with me and then started again like a year later and she would smoke like in a little you know the little house that I grew up in and it was just always like my whole life was I was built to be a cigarette smoker those two were probably smoking ciggies while banging making me like it was like I just love cigarettes I even still love the nice gust of secondhand smoke now that I'm a nonsmoker it blows my mind hearing people all those years say Oh cigarettes stink like it's like I fucking love it oh I just love it it just makes me feel good it's weird and I know because it's pure poison it just goes to show like what a Dark Lord I am is that you or is that just cigarettes in general have a grip on people it's a dark grip it really is so crazy because what else gives you nothing and takes everything and still it's just this is my favorite part of the day favorite part of the night after sex during coffee they said that Johnny Carson when he was on his deathbed was just rotting out from the inside he was just falling apart he's like those goddamn cigarettes yeah it's one of the main reasons why I actually quit was reading about Johnny and yeah cuz it's sort of correlated I still you know go on runs every day pretty much every day short jogs and this and that to wake up and get the day started and there was a while there where I was had a lot of like mmm coming up not really coughing up shit but it was sort of just like it was there and I'd have to clear my throat before going on stage and it started to get like it wasn't on stage but it started to creep up during work hours like it's like mmm well like Joey Diaz just murked a room and I'm next he's Britt you guys ready for your next man I'm like that's like oh I gotta get my shit together coughing black know I've talked to people that have hocked up shit and it was black and they spit it on the ground and they saw black black loogie yeah I was like why did you quit immediately ya know six more years yeah but I've read about Johnny and he was talking about like not only was that a major thing like those damn cigarettes like that's he just kept repeating it on his death but but they also talked about like how he was like swimming which he loved to do and he just like couldn't do it anymore so it was like almost drowning all the time and stuff like it was just like he was out he was gone he just couldn't breathe this guy went through a rough patch like not just that do you ever read the divorce settlements Johnny Carson to go through now he was one of the most famous like divorce rapings where you just go oh my god like you find out how much you had to pay his ex-wife like oh Jesus no he got taken man Eddie Murphy had a bit about it Eddie Murphy had a bit about Johnny Carson's divorce in his act I think it was in raw he did it on one of his special yes Wow it was that bad gee-ya National Enquirer but it says 220 grand a month was not enough Wow Carson's wife rejects settlement and asks 220 thousand dollars a month in living expenses seventeen million is not enough she said what year does that say at the top left eighty what did she look like she looks kind of hot they're not like that dirty forty that dirty 40 year old look I like that back then that's like a million a month closing on their that was the one he split up with he gives up fast life and his secretly seeing wife again oh well that's the inquiry so that's that's the galley was married to that he had to give up seventeen million bucks oh so he's married to her for a long time well how many times did you get married that seems like the same gal their most expensive world's most expensive divorce settlements Johnny Carson and Joanna Holland 20 million that ain't shit now we were going over some last night or yesterday on the podcast Steve Wynn gave up a billion oh oh what could she have possibly have done to earn that nothing there's nothing she could have done she had that voodoo pussy son unless she had all the ideas and he's just not admitting it yeah she started casino how much is a consultation fee worth a billion oh wait yeah well that made sorted look at him by the way he looks like he's wearing a mask he looks like it's horse wind 24/7 yeah third third divorce unlikely for Steve Wynn Wow good lord do you think guys just keep going in that's what's crazy they're like no no she's the one oh no no it's never gonna change yeah he's got it all figured out no no she's the one oh yeah it's a strange thing you know it becomes it comes humorous like Elizabeth Taylor who was stunningly beautiful when she was young did you ever see Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf uh-huh it's a must see it's a great great old movie but uh Elizabeth Taylor was probably in her 20s I guess when she did that and she was just so beautiful but as she got older like she was see if you could see that's that's a pretty good picture of her but if you see like her whole body and everything I mean she was just a bombshell and she was a bombshell and you know what was it the 50s or something like that like that picture of her black and white on the second level where you see your body yeah that's a real body too dude ain't no gym time there that's just straight-up genetics and whiskey look at them look at them legs in ten hmm that's just justice biology but then towards the end I mean she had been married and divorced don't show the old pictures don't show Google Elizabeth Taylor amount of times married because I believe she was married yeah I want to say she's like seven or eight times no fewer than eight times yeah married a couple guys twice eight marriage is only seven husbands she married Richard Burton twice she married a bunch of gay guys too huh allegedly gay guys her first marriage one of the heirs of the hotelier that's a weird word Hotel EUR Haqqani air hotel he airs that I said it Conrad Hilton and in divorce after less than a year yeah she was a wild woman Wow she got paid for all this that's its own business right Rich's fuck you know she was really successful as an actress so she probably had the money in a lot of them because she was dating some guys that looked suspiciously homosexual you know like Liberace homosexual like wait what like yeah I paid a million dollars to play Cleopatra in 1963 yeah a million bucks in 1963 he's probably like 20 million bucks today what is it man Google that what is a million dollars in 1963 worth today that's crazy they paid her that much money damn who whoever her agent is dig that motherfucker up this what dollar times.com says it's worth a point 1 million 8 yeah that's it so yeah Wow I thought it would be like 20 annual inflation over this period was three point eight eight percent that's some and when you think of like like who's the top paid female today said Jennifer Lawrence maybe probably yeah yeah what does she get she probably it's like 20 right I'm right not 15 to 20 range probably yeah so she shits hungergames bitch what yeah yeah but anyway um she married a bunch of gay guys I think see if you find out Elizabeth Taylor married gay guys cuz that was like always a stand-up comedy joke that uh when I was first starting out I remember a bunch of guys had jokes about Elizabeth Taylor but I'm more a chick had a joke about to about Elizabeth Taylor always marrying gay guys like not knowing like that she's so old and fucked up on pills she doesn't know the guy she's marrying or gay that's a crazy wonder why she would do that that's probably one companionship ya know she was I think in the end there was rumors of substance abuse I mean I I'm I'm pearl if proliferate peripherally peripherally associated with these news stories I don't really know him that well yeah I just remember reading something about substance abuse and drinking and yeah the end is always Ralph man it ends rough for a lot of people bro yeah there's those pain pills and everything kitchen fastener the roughest of the rough man yeah people who go out with those pain pill addictions do you think about we were talking about Joey Diaz and I were talking yesterday about Prince you know he was uh he called me up and he was singing to me he was sing me that song do you want him or do you want me cuz how about you he's like Purple Rain cocksucker Joe Joe Rogan what was the last time you listened a Purple Reign he goes I'm stoned as a motherfucker right now listening a purple rain god damn Prince was good and I was thinking about it like Prince was just one of the many greats that we law to pain pills just real recently Tom Petty Prince who else we lost several several big-name powerful celebrities to pain pills Michael Jackson no he was propofol he was um he wasn't pain pills he was that shit that they used to put people under yeah but he was in like a lot of pain right wasn't that one of those things I don't think so I think he was just so fucked up in the head so he had so much anxiety and he he just couldn't sleep you know he's just a mess man what there's rumors that he was addicted to pain pills Michael Jackson yeah oh yeah he did yeah and he he was working to make that big comeback thing at the time too so they had him out there dance and shit looking like a bag of bones I'm pretty sure they said that the propofol is what killed him cuz yeah I couldn't sleep also yeah yeah you need to sleep and what that what he was doing is just getting sedated every night I mean that's the reason why his doctor went to jail he called it milk right the milk it sparked from that accident he got in when he got on fire oh that's right he cut his hair on fire for the pain from that yeah well that's that's what happened to this guy that I know he hurt himself doing construction and then got on some pills you know because he had a back injury they put him on pills and then life is over that's all it takes is one accident I've only taken a half of one pain pill one time and I know the exact day that it happened because it was the day that the WWE Network came out I had my wisdom teeth pulled and they're like take take all these that you want I'm like I don't really you know I'm very reactive to pills bubble boss but I so but I was in a lot of pain so I'm like fuck it I'll take a half of one and man if I didn't go through that whole networks library that day just with a smile on my face drooling on myself loving life just watching all the old stuff that I watched as a kid wow so fun let's see it was the day the network came out it would be nice if pain pills didn't do anything bad to you they just fucked you up but no physical harm no addiction navigation no addiction no physical harm I mean people are always gonna be a people are addicted to washing their hands I mean people are addicted to really weird shit there's always gonna be people that are addicted to things in that they can't quit doing them but addiction like in your bones yeah those pain pills so they they feel it felt so good I remember the feeling of just like oh this is the greatest feeling I could do this all the time this is incredible it's just such a it's incomparable to even like you know a drink or pot or anything like that it's just sit there and smile just waves of heat I was real sick once and I got a hold of that real nyquil in the 90s the last time I took it the real nyquil that stuff I guess it was codeine was it codeine that was in there yeah something like that right it feels aserp it was wonderful it was wonderful I was just I was just my pillow and my blanket was just cuddling me with love and I was just lying in bed with stupid smile on my face watching TV just like oh I'm so happy yeah they don't make that nyquil like they used to you got to get it from a doctor or shady dog ephedrine that's what it is yeah a nasal decongestant right to think I mean says it's what was taken out of it mmm why don't I think is it like Cody is it a codeine we've done this before we were talking about this before I saw there's a a THC liquid something or other being sold like in 1200 milligram but it's sold in like a bottle that looks just like the propofol Jesus yeah somebody tried to give me some marijuana beer yeah THC infused beer like you get that shit the fuck away from me they're making CBD infused beer syn like I think bud white Coors or Budweiser someone invested a lot of money into in Canada or MGD wow that's interesting well it would counteract the effects of alcohol and somewhat because one of the things about alcohol right is that it causes inflammation CBD perhaps could counteract the inflammation yeah what am i a scientist I don't mess around with any of that THC infused stuff I like that I like the CB but THC when it comes to anything other than smoking it I do not play these yep like joints the wrapped in in tobacco yeah it's backwoods jammies these are my favorite because they give you like a little bit of elevation you get a little bit from the from the cigarette the nicotine the tobacco and then you get the weed whoa it's a combo mmm Corona and modèle was the first to take the plunge investing hundreds of millions of dollars into a Canadian outfit in order to bring THC infused brews to market in northern nation now Molson Coors the second largest brewer in the world is reportedly getting into the game the game yeah that's what's gonna be interesting as when like Smirnoff starts investing in marijuana you know because they're going to it's good it's a hundred percent legal in Canada now Canada is just it's just like buying a beer it's thank God Canada and you bad motherfuckers up there and you can travel in Canada and fly with it yeah well I love you can fly to LAX with weed now heck yeah yeah they say whatever happens when you get there is on you right yeah did you see the thing that they have in Vegas they have dispensary like or dispensers for marijuana like at the airport and then people break it into them and they're stealing weed out of them keep it that way and they say they're not free weed boxes you assholes with it crossing international borders with cannabis is illegal it's at the airport there yeah but does that mean going back or landing can bring it in or take it out but I'm saying like if you're at the airport just make sure you're staying here he's not interesting like you can't even bring it in even though it's legal there yeah that's weird yeah there's the box disposal for prescription and recreational drugs is that in Canada so it's in Canada but yet they have them in Denver also I have the exact iphoto of the exact same thing from Vegas I took a picture of a company that's supposed to come around and like pick the shit up and get you little skinny oh my god that is so funny it's a disposal all the times the last second I'm just throwing joint tubes into the into the trashcan like who would actually go up to that thing and throw it in there no one let me tell you yeah super fucked Toronto air cannabis anis amnesty cans that's hilarious is just some guy laying on the ground with his mouth open at the bottom of that story about a girl who was she went into a port-a-potty and she thought she saw something like when she's sitting down and then she realized like she heard like groans she realized there was some guy in there inside the porta potti just laying there watching this shit come out and hitting him in the head was mouth open while she's shitting and pissing on him oh my god climbed in to the shit and piss that is so disgusting and hot at the same time for some reason the fact that a monster would lay there like that he's probably had a fucking snorkel porta potty peeper Luke Cristo suing Boulder for ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars or equal amount of gold coinage he's from Boulder Colorado he's suing Boulder or he's so it happened in Bertram Boulder yeah yeah boulders a trippy place man people been getting really high in Boulder for a long time and there's no air up there so if you get super baked in Boulder like you could blow a fuse look at that porta potty it's like built for that it looks like it's like a float tank you know what it's like it's like one of those first-class seats you get when you fly to Australia oh yeah a little pod get a pod it says what yeah hold on Crisco has made his mark on the Internet under a variety of monikers including Omni rainbow and sky or yon whose youtube channel features clips including this one in which he demonstrates his thigh rubbing technique yeah I wonder why it's been pulled from the internet so this is the guy so he was he climbed in there to have people shit on him and how did he know that there was a girl his reward for susta patients was a sight of a slender black haired white man what wait a minute don't scroll are you going I didn't know what the hell they were talking about but I'm reading that go back a slender sweat black haired white man standing between 6 foot 5 and 6 foot 8 inches tall with cuts on his back and arms wearing only a pair of sweatpants what is this about oh so this is the security guard realized that he was doing something scroll back up yes did that figure out what the other imagine like waiting there under the toilet in the Porta Potty for a hot chick to come in and just like Joey Diaz comes in like 2011 we know that a woman attended the Hammond festival stepped into a portable laboratory in which she lifted totes lid she saw something moving in the deep dark depths below cue shock car and quick escape when she fetched a man and asked him to look inside he too saw some movement beneath a tarp inside the tank and after exiting the chamber he heard the door locked behind them at that point he summoned his security ok that's what happened and then they caught that guy so he's in there with a tarp hiding under a tarp while people are shitting on him look at his face is that the mug shot is there shit all over him oh God son of a bitch yeah it's like the it clown meets the shit clown oh look at this he sat down with Fox 31 for a jailhouse interview in which he referred to spying on urinating or defecating women in quotes the highest creature in the universe he maintained as in quotes praising God and said in quotes it sounds kind of weird but I would just find my piece and go away say thank you goddess and go about my night Wow isn't that the scariest part when you when you drop a deuce in the toilet you hear the words thank you God thank you got a smear off just the other people's in other places around Boulder also just serve restaurants just to know that someone like that is a real person like you have to realize we sometimes you have to see someone like that to go okay I don't know everybody there's there's a there's a long range you know if there's a chart of like fucked up to like totally normal yeah there's a lot of variables in there and there's a lot of people that just don't fit into your ideal who knows we may know people that are into that type of thing we should set up like a trial Skakel right we might know people don't do that off camera and expect me to keep secrets we should put one of those just kidding folks just we like we love those guys just jokes just jokes yeah do you think we do you think we know anybody looks to get shit on Jim Norton yeah he'll tell you we should put one behind the Comedy Store and see if anyone starts to like look it up and down and lay down you know they had this test they did with with men where they took men that were right now before we get any further I don't know who conducted these tests so Jamie could probably find it well they they conducted tests where they put devices on penises who talked about this was christopher ryan may have talked about this and maybe our friend chris ryan talked about this they put sensors on penises and they showed homophobic men Murata and homosexual erotica in particular like guys getting their dick sucked by guys and they got aroused by it they put like these things on it so that's what we would need to do we need to like that be the phobic men are aroused by gay male porn here it is homophobia is associated with sexual excitement by May on male sex that one study is the greatest reality show ever in the making right now no right yeah one study asked heterosexual men how comfortable and anxious they are around gay men based on these scores they then divided these men into two groups men that are homophobic amended or not these men were then shown three four minute videos that's a long time you sitting there watching a dude suck a dick one video depicted straight sex one depicted lesbian sex and one depicted gay male sex well this was happening a device was attached to each participants penis this device has been found to be triggered by sexual arousal but not by other types of arousal such as nervousness or fear arousal often has a very different meaning in psychology than in proper usage hmm wonder what the device looks like it's just some dudes mouth yes pretty sure this was a Japanese game show experimental they had a guy can one buy another dude and hit the last a certain amount of time he had the last without coming he had to go like four or five minutes or something without blowing away he'd win a bunch of money and if a guy was sucking his dick people don't realize the Japanese air factor Japanese game shows were on another level they were doing some fucking insane shit on Japanese TV that was one of the some of the early YouTube clips we used to watch was Japanese game shows those guys are wait they're always ahead of it Ninja Warrior yeah yeah right was that a Japanese show first I think so let's do some stuff yeah it should be I mean they first started like that's how it got on to the way it is because g4 had a contest for like the first American to go over and do it and that just sort of snowballed from there and then they had that show that was kind of a version of it for America called wipeout right remember that because that was the same people that produced Fear Factor produce wipeout and they had MXC where they would like Dada mm or did the voice dubs and it would seem a little funny but they'd be like the waiters versus the service staff and it'd be almost a big joke remember I'm talking about no it's called MXC like I don't remember the full no MXC hmm so anyway we put these sensors on Earl Skakel's dick and have someone take a shit in front like what the fuck what did i do guys nothing girl we're sorry we're just joking around oh that girl got hit in the head now here's the thing I can't help but thinking that that lady's running through shit now after we talked about I don't think I don't see that as mud it's just a silly Japanese show but here's the the other one that's talking about it's don't like I can only find it on lively but it is a gay versus straight blowjob challenge oh my god so who's the gay guy this guy I believe the big guys gay yeah and this straight guy Wow this man the gay guy says those pants are hot and so this guy has to stand there see if we can get Takuya oh my god of course if he doesn't get hard see he might not get hard like this what does the expression mean oh my god welcome to another episode of wind speed vacuum puts his hand in his mouths expression has changed dramatically oh my god Wow it's always those fat guys that really sucked the best dicks I've got like a comment but this guy took his shirt off what happened there thank you I enjoyed that he says oh my god it's that poor guy oh that poor guy just Nutter than that dude's mouth he says that's frustrated a lot came out didn't it he says it's so frustrating though yeah but a lot came out so you guys tell them the guys like dude you you enjoyed that you came really hard you saya is very frustrating he's like yeah but a lot came out like you came hard ya don't like nobody liked it at the time cuz a lot came out like it only comes out if it feels good that is their evil that's a fuckin with the person's mind you know that guys to think about that shit for the rest of his life he's probably gay now he's probably on the other side of the gameshow suck in the dead reason why I would imagine fat guys suck dick better is because it involves food and and gay sex at the same time it's combination things like fat people probably like things in their mouth and then on top of that gay sex and Asian as well Kobayashi is the hot dog eating champion I thought you're gonna go with a little dick well got to yeah get the whole thing that - you're not choking yeah you could deep throat it you really go to town and it might not even make it to your throat just deep now funny blip-it I don't know that's a terrible stereotype but I'm really embarrassed you brought that up on the show yes are you indeed and if anybody knows things about stereotypes its agents yeah and megyn kelly that was an Asian stereo oh yeah okay I get it like Samsung yeah exactly yeah yeah megyn kelly that's a crazy one that's a crazy one because she said dad I never really got it all the way she said that back in her day people used to be black for Halloween she said why can't you dress up as like Diana Ross yeah I guess she essentially said what's wrong with wearing blackface she's like why is it bad for but she threw one in that's not even really bad is it like she started with why is it bad for a black person to dress up as a white person or white person dressed up as a black person well it's not nobody says it's bad for a black person to dress up as a white person Dave Chappelle did it on his TV show forever remember yeah we do that oh yeah nobody cared it's bad because these two have minstrel shows like if she knew the history of it like he'd go back and watch Al Jolson have you ever watched some of that stuff a little bit but I mean we should watch some of that okay other Al Jolson stuff we can really yeah I mean what would happen go to jail PC please YouTube what about white chicks remember white chicks when the Wayans brothers uh oh yeah they had that whole movie where they were like a huge movie nobody cares heavily promoted movie funny movie yeah you could you could be white nobody cares so she her saying that was very disingenuous it was just to cover her ass so that's Al Jolson so what the jazz singer Al Jolson you know yeah and look at what he used to do with his lips he's to like make his lips cartoonishly exaggerated and he would sing but he was like an obviously a white man singing in blackface as a black man it's really weird to watch and he would wear white gloves on is it wrong that I feel weird or watching this then reading about the guy that was getting shit and pissed on is it wrong that you came quicker than the guy man ma'am that's crazy pretty sure that's the first movie with sound also first movie with sound was racist as well you got realized the first movie was sound was that probably 1927 okay so that is what is that 60 years after slavery after was abolished but it wasn't even really done when it was abolished so yeah when was it done with jails but I mean slaves were not immediately released and when one stood the law passed didn't just say you're free that's a good point but what I meant was when when it was a bomb another date you're looking for yeah because of civil war right Civil War ended in 1875 it ain't it at 65 but the resolution to abolish slavery was passed that was 65 and then the civil war ended just a couple years later right space Proclamation January 1st 1863 63 and then the war ended 1865 so that's not that long like 60 years later they're doing ma ma you ever heard it oh it's so weird it's it's weird watching old movies period yeah they've got like the 1920s and shit it's like it's so i-i've watched King Kong with my kids I had them watch the original King Kong Wow and they were gonna be scared this was a few years back like when one was six and one was for look we're nervous we're scared oh don't be scared you know maybe it's not scary just trust me you're gonna think it's funny they were laughing yeah I thought it was so funny it looks so bad it looks so corny right we're just cuddled up on the couch watching King Kong looked so corny like the claymation it's just weird that back then that was a horror movie like people would go to the movie like that was terrifying yes it was I'm gonna go get a sandwich my goodness I'm gonna go coffee for a penny I saw the new Halloween movie the other day huh it was awesome real they actually did it they made a great movie great reboot it was really awesome if you've ever enjoyed any moment or know anything about Michael Myers at all it's unbelievable Wow really great it's like modern day they make Jamie Lee Curtis a badass like she's like she's her age it's bothered her her whole life every all anyone wants to talk with her about is that so she like lifted weights and she holds she holds herself up and this big she builds a compound with fences and everything in case he ever fucking comes back she teaches herself out of chute like it's like real awesome dude you fucking all love it I couldn't believe it the rest of the night I was saying to my wife just just I can't believe how great that movie was and she loved it too so it's like all around Wow Rotten Tomatoes say about it those people are crazy Centanni but any of these people's opinions I went to a yelp review the other day because there's a restaurant that I really liked it's near my house and I said I wonder how it gets reviewed on Yelp and it was like all five stars except one one one star and it was like a crazy review or some woman was she was yelling she was complaining that tips that if you tip on a credit card that they don't get it until the end of the week and then it gets taxed like is that how it always works or do you get it at night they cash you out depends on the restaurant it depends on the restaurant but I felt like that was probably common that some restaurants will give you with your weekly check all your typical yeah that would be if like they're pooling perhaps all the tips of the week together and splitting it amongst everybody which is only a really really really good restaurant would do that seems that seems like it doesn't encourage performance though right well that at that level of restaurants the performance is like a given like they're probably splitting vast sums of money cuz it's a full-blown machine right like a five-star exactly yeah I worked at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse coming out of high school and I learned pretty much you know everything there is to know they make you memorize a stack of cards you have to know everything and the whole thing's a well-oiled machine I was a food runner which basically means that I had to make sure that everything going to the tables was perfectly set up like because there's no fixing it once it leaves the door right so you're basically the final approver of everything and the server's just waiting at the table or follows behind you you sit the tray down and they do it you get 10% of all the servers tips on the floor so sometimes some nights if there's you know say more than ten to one food runner or servers to food runners you can make more than even a server at a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and but each restaurant does it differently in splits tips maybe they pull them that night pooling the tips actually usually means that the service is going to be unbelievable unless it's just a janky restaurant then did they then they probably just do it normally restaurants a very nice restaurant yeah so anyway I looked at this lady's one-star review like one star out of five stars and I always have a big smile on my face when I see a one-star review because that means this bitch gonna have a lot of one-star reviews if you go to her page yes her page it was all one-star reviews this fucking malcontents yeah this monster that was just going everywhere and complaining about everything from fucking nail salons to movie theaters like everything it's crazy I don't think trolls know that anybody is just one click away from knowing from them being completely exposed it's the same thing on Twitter or really anything right you see someone say something crazy you just click on their profile and it's all crazy all crazy all the time to everybody yeah they're complaining about everything after rose Amazon I got a bunch of people that tweeted at me with these wacky conspiracies like wacky mind-control conspiracies and what would it seem to me to be not a professional but if I had a guess a wave of mentally ill people yeah we're contacting me and I was reading this I'm like Jesus Christ how many fucking people are out there that believe like the most nuttiest CIA based mind-control experiments and NSA you know tapping into everything in your home and listening to your conversations by listening to the vibrations off of your window panes like here's what people don't know who's got time for that here's the thing do you really think there's enough people in the world to be paying attention to all the people in the world does that make any sense to you it shouldn't there's no way everybody's watching everybody right there's not enough people see like if you do something like say Tony Hinchcliffe runs for president oh they're gonna fucking watch you for sure they're gonna find out why is Tony hench good friend of a president who's backing is it George Soros who's looking out for Tony Hinchcliffe you know who's trying to whose fourth yeah they'll check you out but the average person is like remember that Mel Gibson movie conspiracy theory remember that he played a mentally ill person who fell in love with Julia Roberts he was like a hot mentally ill person and he just believed everything was a conspiracy theory it said I watched it the other day like out of nowhere it was on TV and I said watch this for a little bit I was like wow I'll fuckin wacky's this movie people that have schizophrenia don't realize that they're schizophrenic exact people with bipolar notice there and they might be aware that they're having an episode people OCD their OCD a dee da dee dee schizophrenia it's game set match you start hearing the voices become a normal thing like you think everybody can hear them and you're not really acknowledging them because they become so natural the schizophrenic person can be in a psych ward and say to their doctor why am I here and that's a breakthrough yeah yeah do you know Matt Marc Maron heard voices in his head for over a year oh my goodness after partying with Kinison Wow that's a hard yeah we're pussies man we really are I was talking to Argus the other day at the back door and it's just like my god I literally said the words like I'm like I wish I was I wish I had started back when you started man really he was talking about we ended up getting off on this whole I don't know how we got there but we started off on this whole tangent about about just you know sobriety and stuff and he's like man you know back in my day and he was I can't remember the exact dialogue but it was just yeah I mean those guys were all it was all just a blur I've learned something from Argus because our you know Argus runs like insane numbers of miles everyday like 12 miles 15 miles a day the addict in him the guy that loved getting wasted that's his high now he talks about it all the time his runner's high it's real death it's real I know now because of this month this month the sober October month dude I've worked out no less than at least two hours that's a small work out a small work out well that's all I could get in was two hours the longest I did I did six hours one day Lord six hours of insane cardio it's like both kill bills I did seven I did seven hours of cardio in the last two days between yesterday in the day before seven hours of hard cardio different stuff riding the hills with the dog elliptical machine with your own heating with fat people right now I'm competing with myself first of all my main competition is Ari Shaffir and whether you realize it or not Ari Shaffir even though he doesn't exercise already has a strong mind he's a very strong mind ari ran 15 miles the other day 15 miles he rode five kilometers and then after he rode five kilometers he he did something else he rode his bike he wrote a bike for a certain amount of miles how long did it take him to run 15 miles the whole thing his whole workout was I think four hours my goodness he's got that power jouging he's got that escape from concentration camp Jean Eudes he's he said you saw a fucking heart he was going on the rowing machine he goes hard dude he stayed in the 80% on the rowing machine for an hour I mean he really did I saw him I was the out there with him I filmed it I put it up on Instagram that's that point when Burt was making fun of him for being it's 75 for just walking isn't that him being out of shape it's not because when Burt and him went walking he was in way better shape than Burt see Ari rides his bike in New York and he walks a lot in New York and even though he's not in great shape like in terms of like a guy who runs in comparison to Burt he's in fantastic shape when they went hiking together Burt how to stop like a bunch of tigers though he was too up and Ari was pissed off he's like why do I have to stop cuz you're fat like he's sick gentlemen yeah so like he wanted to see what would happen if the two of them went out together and did the exact same hiking who's cuz Burt was saying oh that's because you're not in shape so you're your heart is always at eighty percent no re in a week is in way better shape that bird is in this whole life of working out and drinking vodka every night compared to birds but compared to Burt but my point is he was my real competition I was very very much worried about him so up until two days ago everything seemed to be going good I was working out really hard and I was put it was hard it's hard to do three hours a day it's three and a half hours days mmm two days in a row is three and a half hours a day but I started peeing and he started coming out dark oh no like ice-t oh shit the sun's like a guy at a porta potties dream say at the end Oh bless you goddess bless you for your sweet tea I was famished yeah it didn't look good Oh today I had to go to something in my kids school let some Halloween thing and I had to go up three flights of stairs feet long flights of stairs I got to top first of all I barely made it upstairs I got to the top I was out of breath and my legs were shaking well three flights of stairs and I was like okay I might have fucked something man that was today today what does it mean I think my body's breaking down I think I've got like serious muscle breakdown to the point like my muscles are so sore that I'm ignoring that they're sore and even though they're really really sore I'm still doing like three hours of cardio like I limped up to the to the trail when I ran with my dog yesterday and then I ran two miles and then after I ran two miles I did an hour and a half on the elliptical machine and then after I did an hour and a half on the elliptical machine I did 45 minutes of kicking the bag punching and kicking the back I took two naps yesterday two separate naps my point is argos taught me something yeah by telling me about this hide that you get from all this cardio and fucking nonsense is that I knew that there's like an endorphin high but I didn't think it was really specific but there's a very specific high that you get and it's like if you could take a pill that puts you in the state of mind that I am when I work out this munch everybody would take it in the world would be a better place because you don't give a fuck right you don't give a fuck about anything I mean not they don't care about people and friends and loved ones but there's no anxiety there's no all the chatter all the negative chatter that you get in your brain that you have to like push off and ignore that shuts off gone non-existent and I wonder how much of that is there because your your brain is almost trying to create problems and conflict because you're not getting enough exercise yeah because your body supposed to get a specific amount of exercise my dog is I think like eight months old or something now and I've learned a lot from having this dog this time like I didn't notice a lot of stuff with the other dogs that I've raised in the past because in the past because with this one it's very clear and I mean they're all that way but if you don't work it out you don't take it and exercise it she's crazy she can be a nut and she shows you by being weird not necessarily destroying stuff but you know just being weird little things by nibbling at your finger a different way with just her little front teeth like sort of like telling you something like hey dude I need to fucking get some exercise in and we're all that where we are that same way so our brain is gonna make more complex ways for us to be freaked out basically run for our lives right yeah like if I don't just I mean again I barely do cardio but I do do it pretty consistently but it's short it's like a mile or two that's all you need yeah but and it cleanses the palate it's like ginger between sushi slices and and if I go without it absolutely it compiles I'll wake up bitter and angry about something I'll see something on you know somewhere something or something you work wise and stress out about it and like why would this and that and so if it doesn't make any sense at all right yeah and if you were in a good state of mind you but yeah who gives a fuck exactly but instead you dwell on it yeah so your brains like trying to come up with problems yeah yeah wants us to do something my doc Marshalls like that hardcore cuz Marshalls in shape because he runs miles with me all the time so that dogs ready to go yeah and so it's like we're running right we're riding today like no not today dude I got to work what the fuck right he'll just start chewing socks and yeah you know doing things that he's not supposed to do you know he he just you know he's just a ball of energy but at least he doesn't have like anxiety and negative chatter the complex human mind when it doesn't have enough energy output I always think of the brain it's almost like a battery that has a lid on it and there's like energies like flowing out of the battery and spilling over the sides and causing a mess because you got to expand or expend a certain amount of energy every day in order to keep it clean just to keep everything going well yeah did I feel fucking great other than the fact I can't walk good yeah but it's just I went too hard it's just too hard but I wanted to get so far ahead my goal was to get so far ahead that no one could catch up I was like everybody just they could do these big days every now and then I go but it's hard to do a big day and then do another big day and then and do another big day that's what's hard I'm like that's where I'll get them I'll get them into like the like when you wake up like not today that's the day you got to go yeah that's like I wanted to put some distance between them so what I did was I did one day where I did six hours I did five hours in the morning and then I actually five and a half then I did another hour at night so was basically six and a half hours and I got a thousand points for the day and they were like what the 35 actually I guarantee you that when Marin was hearing those voices during that Kenaston time that he wasn't working out no he doesn't work out now and all right it's easy for a comedian to not work out and then when you factor that in that it's not a normal job and you can go from your bed to your car to the venue to sit down at a table to wait till you go onstage then you do that you stand up I don't think that had anything to do with it it was cocaine they had so much cocaine they were up for days yeah that's what it was he broke his brain and physically not doing anything right that too but I mean I think the big factor was the cocaine doing cocaine with Kinison I think he just popped a fuse you imagine fucking up for days and days and kinases like where's the block where's the blah oh I know I come only 22 man I gotta get out of here I have a future I have a life oh man you know he do you know that he Kinnison and Roseanne have something really serious in common they're both hit by cars when they were very young and their personality radically changed Wow yeah yeah and that was one of the things that I really wanted to cover with Roseanne when I had her on the podcast cuz all these people are calling her a racist and all right and this and that all these different things like listen you don't understand this woman first of all one of the greatest stand-up comics of all time yeah ii mentally ill and talks about it openly and is very honest about her troubles and what happened she was committed to a mental institution for nine months after this car accident I mean she was hit in the fucking head by a car the car was driving the sunlight was in her face she couldn't see clipped her in the intersection sent her flying she was in intensive care for a long fucking time in a coma for a long fucking time came out of it was fucked up couldn't concentrate in school and then they committed her to a mental institution for nine months good lad yeah that is a long time yeah the hood ornament spiked her fucking head yeah so when people are talking about her like this is all something that she planned out because she's an evil person that's like saying to a person who has a broken leg why you limping yeah it's really like that like one of the reasons why she was so brilliant as a comedian other than she worked hard and she writes and you know and she's got a great mind for it one of the reasons was she truly was like incredibly impulsive and insane and this is what allowed her to say things that other people wouldn't say especially back then like people have to realize when Roseanne Barr was huge and she was huge before I ever did comedy she was huge when she was huge there was no women like her no one she was fat and she didn't give a fuck she would go on stage she would she would talk mad shit it would be hilarious she would kill she would kill dude I remember watching her kill like on HBO when I was like probably like 18 or something like that she's one of Mitzi's true like success stories right did you guys talk about that her being on in the main room and then being on like Carson weeks later she booked Carson I'm one of her first about that the first time we might not have yeah it's hard to remember she's a comedy store like for Comedy Store fans and historians like she's like an anomaly because I'm pretty sure her first ever spot as a paid regular was in the main room which was a big deal at the time and from that spot she got The Tonight Show like a week or two later like she got booked from her first paid regular spot to the Tonight Show from The Tonight Show got a sitcom Dilek was a huge overnight success so it all went like Bing Bing oh yeah one thing that she talked about the first time she did the podcast was that she lost her mind when all that was going on she's like oh I went crazy I lost my mind the kind of pressure to go from being a housewife in Denver to like a couple years later being one of the biggest stars in the world like that yeah there's no yeah that's it takes it takes oh yeah that would drive anybody crazy the whole thing's crazy because also waiting for it's crazy and working towards it's crazy and the whole thing's crazy so to get it all at once that seems crazier than anything cuz then you're like oh my god I'm not ready for this what am I gonna do at least most of the time in show business right it takes 10 15 20 25 years yeah sitting you're usually I've been ready for this or you do all those years and then you're an overnight success like Tiffany Haddish right Tiffany how much did a bunch of years and then out of nowhere she becomes as John success yeah you know but she prepared by doing all those years for Roseanne Barr was like instantaneous you know the thing that bothered me most about all that stuff was how quickly everyone wanted to just cancel her get rid of her like stop her from working ever again I don't want to hear side of it there's no room for explanation there's no room for discussion there's no room for this just get rid of her we went from wanting to see people become stars American Idol America's Got Talent - watching people's dreams get destroyed that's the new obsession the new thing is we've seen people make it let's watch the dream get crushed you are already rich get out of here get out of here Trump get out of here Rosie and get out of here Kanye it's like these people I mean except for Trump I mean Trump's its own thing but like trying to like destroy people that our artists is it's the weirdest thing well it's people that are on the outside that are watching these people live these spectacular lives and if if something goes wrong they're happy because then that person has to be a regular person again or even worse they have to be a has-been which people love love a husband yeah like I remember what one guy was shitting on Gary Coleman because Gary Coleman was a security guard I was having this conversation when I was like laughing that a Gary Coleman from Diff'rent Strokes that was a show mm-hmm was a security guard he's like that fucking guy's security guard now man and I was like okay but if you saw like a regular security guard would you go hi that fucking guy's a security guard you wouldn't do that right he'd go oh there's a security guard hey what's up man yeah I'm going to building three here's my ID he'd be normal right but because he was famous being in security cards a joke and he's a loser like there was it was joy and glee and this guy describing how Gary Coleman who was born like with the disease meaning he's a deformed he's this tiny person with a fucked-up body his whole body's a mess I mean he's he's physically amassed his health is fucked up this guy was taking joy out of the fact that he was a security guard now I was like wow this is there's a weird tendency that people have to like to watch people that they think had it better than them fall yeah the guy that was bagging groceries from whatchamacallit s'what yeah from The Cosby Show yeah yeah yeah apparently Tyler Perry gave that guy a job Oh shout-out to Tyler Perry thank you yeah he says a guy Kassem is a grocery bagger and some maybe double the money yeah no he said love the fact that guys hustling he's out there work and there's no shame in working right the fact that people are so obsessed with that that there is that there's a shame in it this is a shame and just having a job and working it's very strange first range how how people are attached to that you know that they they they immediately think that this is something to mock and make fun of you know I mean it was almost universal so many people were doing stories on that guy bagging groceries yeah it's the age we live in man people want to see people break if anybody's doing anything there's a chance they're just waiting made people are so mad look if they hit if megyn kelly if we didn't know what her contract was right if it was just some in fact let's say we did know and let's say she was getting paid barely what we would ever guess right let's say she's getting paid I don't know a hundred thousand dollars a year at her new job at NBC she'd probably still have the job she put right I mean it's the whole crazy part is that we all know she got paid sixty eight million dollars for three years for what right that's the whole take so it's like analyzing it you know what ghetto people are watching wouldn't you just say about Halloween yeah did you ever hear it play it megyn kelly check you guys know which comment the apology original now the apology was hilarious this woman said that some woman from Australia said that it seems like a hostage video the only thing that's missing is her holding up a newspaper with a date on it i retweeted so does and then somebody else said well if you there's one of the one of the things about it that's so strange is how instance here it seems like forced like oh I'm a Forester it's her apology yeah oh yeah apologies in the forest yeah now I haven't but the but forget the apology let's play the actual video actually remember if I remember correctly its to comment she makes one of them they come back oh it wasn't a second comment I think was the oh really issue what was the first comment I remember I don't remember oh I saw New York with LuAnn and she dresses Diana Ross and she made it really is people said that that was racist and I don't know I felt like who doesn't love Diana Ross she wants to look like Diana Ross for one day I don't know how like that got racist on hollow white you appeared to be see that's the first one is it but it's weird when you watch it now like you know this is her demise like you're watching the stumble when she trips off the rock and falls off the cliff this is the stumble like I don't get it how is that racist to want to be Diana Ross then play it again that was ok as long as you were dressing up there's like guys characters in that some guys commentary from Wall Street Journal that was a rap my favorite one of hers that she ever said my favorite one of her is that she we're good yeah my favorite one of her she ever said was they were they were doing this thing on Fox News about Santa Claus and someone had something about Santa Claus being black they did something about Santa Claus being black and she just went well Santa Claus is definitely white and she was like I think she said if it kids like kids Santa Claus is definitely right or just kids Santa Claus is real and he's definitely white I forget what the exact terminology was but she basically said Santa Claus is definitely white like Santa Claus isn't fucking real okay that's like saying spider-man is definitely white she didn't get fired from Fox for saying that she probably got a raise for saying that right they licked her toes whole different thing at Fox well it was then they don't want her now yeah she wanted to go back yeah we're good yeah they wanted to take her back the thing is you can't go from being an ice princess and the conservative right wing channel to being like Oprah which she's trying to be like Oprah don't I'll never really get what NBC was thinking there they were thinking she's gonna come over that's exactly they thought they thought she has a giant fan base but she had a fan base for sure some came over but she a lot of her fan wave base was because she was the beautiful conservative woman who was very tough very articulate very smart you know and they liked that she was a nice princess and she would shut people down there incorrect and she wouldn't let people talk over her she was powerful kind of frightening in the hot way yeah ooh Fox News has a bunch of those chicks just waiting waiting in the helm they like that closet ex machina when the dude opens but let's use all these robots with different skin and faces [Laughter] just teleprompters ready to roll big with big letters that they can read it clearly will tell you what you like yeah they're making a movie and these three are the anchors yeah Robbie Nicole Kidman and and major Lee's theorem yeah wouldn't mind be so into that porta-potty see you could get fired for that imagine if you were on a show and you said that that would be the end like that this is a beautiful thing about podcasts yeah nobody gives a fuck that you said that it has zero consequences but like let's let's pretend that you were on The Tonight Show and you were a guest and you're like I like being in the end of that port-a-potty people just trying to go to the restroom you think that's funny it's crazy what's happening it's crazy I've noticed it a little bit and stand-up lately there's been a couple of these road trips I did something that you told me not to do Joe Rogan you ready for this you told me not to do it years ago and I did it and it was rough and I performed stand-up comedy in Connecticut right you were right did I told you he was a place of despair it's really crazy so one of the things that happened was is I noticed this really cool old guy stood out in the front middle of the audience right and I'm like you seem like out of place and cool as hell and old as fuck what's your story dude right and I noticed that there's this angry older lady almost like almost like Dana Carvey like church lady character sitting next to him and I go and who's this angry lady they could sit next to she doesn't want to be here at all and he goes that's my wife and they were the most different seeming couple you could ever imagine this happy smiling laughing and everything guy in just this I mean she was looking at me with hate not just not having fun she hated me it could have been something that I talked about early on maybe it was like a something about Amy Schumer Joe could have been that could have been my me too Joe could have been my trump misdirect joke that people you know what I mean anyway and but I noticed next to them there's this girl who seems even angrier than the mom and they're the only two angry people in the room and it's a gig at a casino show me her Connecticut give me a face just literally like literally like a modern-day like if someone said to a bad actress like play angry play angry anger to a horrible actress like that and and and I go and I go what's the problem and you know there's like dude we're I ignore it for like 45 minutes right and I'm going on and on but the moms angry it turns out that the chick next to them is the daughter and then they're basically mad because of whatever whatever material or whatever and I end up towards the end of my set going off on the girl I go I go take this scowl off your face what are you doing do you think that's going to affect me lady I'm getting paid the same amount whether you laugh or not and I'm back to LA back to the dream number you know and I mean like at this point I'm just my fans are loving it and they're the ones that stumbled into the rock scene for the rock show at the wrong time if they were looking for Christian puppet comedy or whatever and I said to her I go you seem like I I go why I go you seem like an internet troll that just stumbled in here like you seem like you're gonna write about this you seem ain't like the type of angry where you think you're gonna change something or you're gonna do something to my career that's what I that's the vibe I get from you I literally made the jokes the crowds love in it by the way you know what I mean cuz they can tell like it's not saying anything there was one there was one part where I go I go Mike because my goal the the thing that the reason why I ignored them for a while was because I go you seem like a tough lady to the mom right I go you seem tough but I'm gonna break you at some point during this set and when I do I'm gonna make sure this whole room knows I'm gonna say I got you and I'm not gonna tell you when it's gonna happen but I'm gonna make you laugh anyway 45 minutes later I get to the point to where I had in my mind set up that there's no way she's not going to laugh at this and sure enough I got a big smile out of her right I'm not I won't say what the joke is I don't want to give anything away but I got the smile and I'm literally like and the whole crowds already laughing and they can tell that I'm looking to watch to see if the lady breaks and she doesn't and I go how and though I thought I was gonna get you I was gonna get you on that one how is it possible that you don't laugh at that like what do you do for fun lady like at this point I'm just all amped up and I go what would I have to do to possibly make you laugh and that's finally when the angry daughter goes be funny I go oh no I've been killing for 52 minutes now you know what I mean like at this point whatever there's everybody else the 99.9% of the other audience is the witness at this point and they're against this chick right cuz this chicks now just mad because whatever and and I go you seem like the type of girl that thinks that you can even affect an artist you know what I mean this is this little millennial nerdy girl and sure enough sure enough I go on Twitter later that night there's a Mohegan Sun you should not be promoting this comedian bah bah bah bah two days later my manager gets an email and he's like dude we got this email from some lady in Connecticut says you were mean to her on stage she wrote you a letter he's like it's three paragraphs long like what is happening like I mean what is happening in this world where someone's taking the time to write a letter to my manager of all people who by the way is laughing at the whole thing imagine if your manager dumped you for that you know right one audience member in Connecticut and that hold the crowd 99% thought you're funny but that's not good enough yeah I need a hundred percent but man you were right and and Connecticut is weird it's a weird place you could run into a person like that anywhere yeah I mean I've run into people like that at the store they sit in the front row with their arms crossed you're gonna run into people like that everywhere yeah but there's something about Connecticut where it's there's no real cities you got Hartford which is a land of despair and you got New Haven which is worse and it's just a highway between Boston in New York that's all it is yeah Boston's great New York's great Connecticut's like what the fuck are you doing here what's going on here it's become such a running joke the Lex Friedman the scientists from MIT who's on here the other day to talk about artificial intelligence he brought it up as a joke What did he say remember what he said something about like he just wanted you to shit on it did so many gigs in Connecticut so many so many cuz I lived in Boston it was like it you know hour-and-a-half Drive yeah two-hour drive you're in Connecticut we did a lot of gigs there Greg Fitzsimmons and I we did a shit ton of gigs in Connecticut we'd always leave going what the fuck was that it was it felt it felt dirty it's a gig I did purely for the money some are good my good friend Tommy jr. lives in Connecticut there's good people in Connecticut so it's not all bad but it's disproportionately bad that's the problem it's not that everyone in Connecticut is full of despair no there's a lot of people that live in like Hartford and not Hartford but what's that area outside of New York City where although the rich people live Greenwich that's what vince mcmahon lives super rich like estates yeah like job Dave Letterman has a spot out there I mean like you got to drive like a mile to get to the property down their driveway the driveway is like a mile of like manicured lawns they have those Great Gatsby type residences there hell yeah a lot of pills a lot of people pilled up yeah look at these joints is the average oh wow look at these joints that's not real but it's being built damn those are the apartment building gym but it's your house let me see a house see that's a house that's a Connecticut house dude there's insane amounts of finance money like that's Great Gatsby type shit did you ever read The Great Gatsby I I watched the movie I was supposed to read the book as a student the DiCaprio movie is actually pretty fucking good yeah really good great soundtrack yeah and it was weird too because like they took artistic license with like the way the automobiles worked and moved and there was like a lot of flair to it that made it exciting beautiful movie one of those ones are you got to turn out the lights make sure your color on your TVs right and turn the sound yeah yeah but that's that area that area of Connecticut is just unbelievably wealthy that area of Connecticut and there's another area that's similar to that in Long Island like that's the Hamptons the Hamptons in Long Island is all just insane wealth just like Matt Lauer has a house out there that's like 16 million dollars I'm on that today show money mmm ha he's doing it he's not what is he gonna do we think that guy can make a comeback I think no I think no I think he's gonna be like selling things any day now like how like Larry King now like sells like things like on late-night TV ever see that was he selling Larry King's like slinging like the show fake products and stuff Larry King saw the show so it's sort of a mixture of an advertisement is this show on television or is it on the Internet I think it's on the Internet and I was just on it yeah really yeah I'm talking about that on they know what you're talking about the TV that looks like a TV show but it's for not a TV show it's really just he's like asking questions like he used to do but it's just some guy like yes and another thing my prostate medicine can do oh right right right on the same set that's why I would say that I guess here's the set of his show it's on aura TV but like he shoots those commercials on that wooden background said okay so they just have a similar setup who's that girl in the upper right hand corner what is that what is that what in the hell and my watch drag queen what go go fullscreen please oh what's going on there with the eyes I'm confused lots of tense makeup and but wait a minute I don't we're her actual eyes somewhere in there whoa that's a drag queen yeah it's got a drew on extra yeah but she also drew white

that is the nuttiest makeup and look at the cheekbones like how sculpted it is where it's like has an abrupt line before the lower jaw like it's just spray-painted with them just like an insane person

amazing amazing document for one end to amazing when you just realize what because you could be especially if you're living in Ohio like you were or out here in Los Angeles you might not know the history of cocaine in Miami you might not know how fucking insane it was until you watch that documentary and you just go what yeah or narcos or really you know narcos is good but it's a lot of it is about another country yeah like cocaine Cowboys is almost all about America yeah there's one one part of cooking Cowboys that I'll never forget what they said that the entire graduating class of the police academy was either murdered or went to jail they were all corrupt everybody was doing coke there's more banks per capita in Miami at least at the time than anywhere else in the country and it was all money laundering that's all it was fucking hell my friend Steve Graham was going to school in Miami back then he was doing his residency in Miami he's an ophthalmologist and he was there during the cocaine violence years so he was doing his residency you do emergency room work so he was there people bullet holes and fucking brains exploded he said it was crazy the amount of violence that you would say just every night people with bullet holes and gunshot wounds and knife wounds and fucking attacked with barbed wire and chaos and a lot of people with things up their ass really oh yeah all kinds of things light bulbs you know those twisty light bulbs yeah look a pine cone yeah up the ass can't get it out why would uh why wouldn't they while I Paul whose warm little bit up shove it in there start beating off can't get it out oh no better get to the doctor how do you drive slow I'll put my ass out the window I don't know but he told me that that was one of the things they pulled out our guys ass a light bulb one of them twisty light bulbs that's the other things too like GI Joe dolls she liked that that's what happens when you have a bad idea a light bulb appears in your ass that's hilarious how would that be actually really fun a really fun thing in a movie yeah you know cartoon oh my god yeah think how we're not doctors huh yeah seriously you know how morose you would get your everyday you dealing people dying they just get too comfortable with it and you have to save them no matter what I was reading last night about the about the Jewish doctor who had the shooter of the temple in Pittsburgh he had to save his life he had to like make sure that he's okay you know what I mean sometimes you're just helping horrible human beings that just you slaughtered some of your own people now you're a Jewish doctor having to fix the guy no and what our world Tarantino world we like to think that oh oh so sorry to accidentally oh it appears as if though I haven't given you the right medicine you know what I mean but in real life they have to just stitch him up and you know well it also mean that guy probably has a record as in terms of like his success ratio he doesn't want to fuck it up for some asshole right oh yeah it seems like being a doctor it would be very very hard like as mentally yes like racking up those losses and such a lack of control the human body EMT workers - yeah same kind of deal a buddy of mine told me never date a female EMT worker I go why and he goes they're crazy he goes they've seen so much violence they just fuck everyone I go what and he goes yeah this is a bunch of female EMT workers that they work with they're just banging everybody obviously it's not every EMT female worker it's just my asshole friend yeah tell me this is very limited polling my thought on it is do you imagine how fleeting you would feel that life is if every day you're seeing people die every day you're dealing with car accidents you're showing up people's brains are splattered all over the highway their legs are ripped off they've been run over by trucks every day all day long and this is what he said he goes he goes first of all no one's supposed to see that much death he goes if you see that much death it rewires the way your brain works he goes you're supposed to see that it's opposed to that very rarely very rarely in life maybe see it every day it's like something goes wrong and he goes it's been my experience that some of these women where that goes wrong they just there's wild did his fuck everybody I go how why do you think they're doing that he's like too distracting themselves trying to distract themselves from the violence again this is one asshole friend if you're listening is like fuck Tony inch Griff and Joe Rogan I can't believe you brought that up I'm an EMT worker I'm a mom I'm a great person I'm sure you are ma'am I'm talking about you you used to fuck like an animal and you know it that's how those babies were made Wow how dare you that seems to make sense to me that female EMTs would be uh pretty horned up cops too oh for sure cops yeah yeah I watched a porno the other day two female cops amazing thing by the black guy they were supposed to arrest of course that happens happens with guards in jail female guards remember those guys had escaped one of them was banging the guard in upstate New York they flew - can't they flee to Canada some fugly looking female guard dude was throwing dhikr way the guard left with the prisoner uh-huh did she bring him the stuff to help him break out right yeah then she turned herself in she couldn't handle it anymore when the fucking ramp and the alarms are going off and the manhunt was underway like how did he get out [Music] imagine that you're a prisoner it is look at her Joyce Mitchell denied parole after helping killer inmates escape New York prison he's going to jail herself that's the look of a lady that messed up after getting good dick there was a guy used to spar with who was a security guard at jail and that was fucking with his head too he was just telling me about what the experience was like like every day you're just always dealing with these fucking people that they're never getting out of there like he was in a maximum-security penitentiary it's like they're never getting out of there every day every day you're just dealing with horrible people in terrible circumstances and they know that you get to leave they know you get to leave but you're living with them most of the day goes yeah I'm not a prisoner he goes but my environment is surrounded by these people he's like that affects you so I never thought about it that way I thought the guards have it okay it's just a job whereas the inmates you know well those poor bastards are stuck in there well you're in there with them for eight hours a day most of the time you're not controlling them most the time you're just coexisting yeah who's behind the bars which which way is behind right right they're in a cell with a hallway filled with bars people one person on the other side of each bar so are they the same exact thing yeah and then they're wearing body armor and fucking they've clubs and they're always terrified that a riots gonna break out you saw whitey bulger got killed he did yeah when yesterday in prison oh thanks for them in like first day first day a guy that hates rats killed him an Italian guy or like a gangster guy yep that guy I read the Gaia is obsessed with hating rats and hating people that beat women and I guess whitey killed women so this guy the first chance he got Whitey Bulger meant a violent end after a lifetime of brutality they tried to pull his eyes out of his skull whoa I don't know if they were successful or not the thing I read didn't make me larger so I could read that what does it say in a three-foot grave near a river not far from Boston Pat McGonigle's body laid decaying undisturbed until his remains were found 20 years later part of his pelvic bone fractured skull in a decomposed brain matter a ring Wow okay this is all the different things that he's done yeah yeah no he was a horrible fucking killer West Virginia day after he transferred you know I said trained a guy that was one of his fucking mob henchmen hmm guy said to me once he goes you're gonna kill somebody how would you kill him I was there with my bare hands he goes yeah I go I probably hit him in the neck like yeah okay that was see it's not scary until you find out that's the end of the conversation I was 19 at the time I was teaching Taekwondo I was teaching this guy who he was friends with a friend of mine who absolutely worked for Whitey Bulger who wound up going to jail and they told me that this guy used to whack people I was like oh Jesus Christ and I was teaching him talk window he was very serious like he's very intense and I was very aware that there was something different about him I was very aware like Huey he wasn't just a guy that was learning for exercise or self-defense want to take little classes learn a little martial arts he was gonna use it like he was a guy that was in case he needed to use it you know I'm saying like there's there's a mindset of someone who just wants to get better at a martial art and there's a mindset of someone who's thinking about okay it's gonna come down I'm gonna kaito my dear okay and I'm not kidding my dear that guy was like when he would practice there was a there was a certain amount of focus and intensity that he had that was palpable yeah mobsters need to get better at uh at that type of stuff you ever see remember De Niro's kicks and Goodfellas those just sloppy that's straight down mutt what's this whitey Bulger's famous yeah he was unrecognisable mr. Bulger's eyes appeared to have been dislodged from his head although was unclear whether his attackers gouged him out or they were knocked out because he was beaten so severely in the attack this information was relayed by senior law enforcement official who oversees organized crime cases oh that's what it was hmm it was a padlock stuffed inside a sock oh oh that's what they beat him with yep and they also pulled his eyes out of his head at least in part with a padlock that was stuffed inside of a sock at least two inmates were quickly sent to solitary confinement after mr. Bulger was found according to three employees of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Wow couldn't happen to a nicer guy Whitey Bulger do you know he won the lottery twice really yep do you not really yeah scam I mean that was that was how he he would show his income so someone else would win the lottery and they would come to him and he would like give them the money and they would give him the lottery ticket and he'd be like look I won the lottery that's how I'm rich yeah yeah it's dark like they probably would find the person who won the lottery you know they chased Dana White out of town do you know that no yeah yeah they wanted money they want payment from Dana White and Dana White got beaten up by them so severely that he had like tinnitus in his ears yeah he had a fucking and he had a jet out of town he moved to Vegas Wow yeah cuz they wanted a cut of the UFC no wasn't the UFC it was no UFC back then he was a boxing trainer oh I forget what he was doing whether he's running a gym but he had to leave town because the mom that's why he left Boston yeah it was real man I mean this was all when I was a kid I mean I got seriously into Taekwondo in 1982 that's when it became like 81 82 that's when it really became like my whole life and that's right around the time where all that shit was going on and then when in 1988 I became friends with a comedian who was his brother went to jail for being a part of whitey Bulger's Mob yeah crazy yeah it was like everybody knew somebody who was in some way connected to the mob in some way you know I just one dude you wanna hear crazy story who it's one guy he's dead now I could talk about him his name is Richie and he went to jail um while I knew him he was arrested for a murder that I don't think they ever got him on but this person who was killed wasn't just killed they broke every bone in his body with a hammer and kept injecting him with cocaine to keep him awake yeah so he would black out from the pain and they would inject him with cocaine to wake him back up again and then they would break another bone they were breaking all of his bones with a hammer they cut his hands off cut his head off they cut everything off and then when they found you know his broken heap of a body he was somehow connected to this guy that I knew who sold coke and this guy had gone to jail and I knew him before he went to jail he was another guy from Taekwondo I knew him before he went to jail he was one person he was a young guy I was I think when he went to jail I was 16 and I think he was 20 and then when he got out of jail it was I was 20 and he was 24 and he had scars all over his body where he tried to like sand off his his tattoos he had tattoos all over his arms and I don't know what the tattoos were whether they were racist or whether he just didn't want him anymore but he had like either acid burns or scars like what how are the fuck he tried to get the tattoos off all over his arms because arms are covered in scars and he wasn't good he wasn't like a talented martial artist but he was insanely tough like insanely aggressive and insanely tough and when you sparred him you were fighting for your life for your life he would come at me and try to fucking kill me I mean fucking kill you throwing looping punches with every fucking ounce of his being and I'm moving around and I'm like oh we're fighting to the death here we're fighting this is not this is not sparring we only sparred a couple of times before this but a one time he had me cornered he trapped me in a corner and hit me with a fucking bomb on the top of my head just below Mike as hard as he could put he was a strong guy who's quite a bit bigger than me to Irish guy he was Italian and I kicked him in the head so hard it broke his cheek like his cheek shifted over his his face I wheel kicked him so I hit him with my heel in his face and he dropped down he collapsed went down to his like like went down like face-first got up on his all fours got back up again wanted to keep going I said I go Richie I go you got to look in the mirror I go come look in the mirror and he's like oh fuck I go yeah you can't spar anymore dude he wanted to kill me he wanted to keep going he wanted to keep going after I basically kicked his face in half Jesus I hit him so hard it wasn't a sparring session it was an I'm trying to kill you you're trying to kill me session and I remember setting him up setting him up setting him up and I hit him with that thing and he face-planted most people would have just went out but he was so angry and so mean he was trying to get up it's fucking scary that was I was the last time I sparred with him I'm like we're not spar anymore dude I'm not I'm fighting to death with some guy who I'm kind of friendly with I was friendly with him other than that like was you would never guess remember one time we went out it was me and him and these two girls and they were like real weird right and you know this one girl was like you know I quit you when are we gonna get to get this stuff I go what stuff you gotta get and he's like and she's like he's gonna get us some car girl you don't want any coke she goes fuck you like you gonna tell her she doesn't want coke she's like that's why I'm here that's why I'm hanging out with this guy stupid that's so funny you know I was one of the rare times I hung out with him outside of the gym he told me story about how he had a fight off these guys with a broomstick in jail and now he's beating these guys to death with a broomstick just there's a horrible story about him being forced to mop up something in the bathroom and these guys cornered him and he's just fucking attacking them with this broomstick and about how he got extra time for that I forget what he went to jail for I assume is probably drug-related I don't remember what it was but I remember just being so nervous about being connected to people like that like knowing people like that from the gym because there was people like that there were always they always wanted to learn how to fight so because you knew you know you're teaching martial arts you're training there's always those those guys would always come in whenever was kind of spar Oh scary times there's no pulling back there was no like if you were sparring with some friends like I was sparring with like my friend Leroy Rodriguez a good friend of mine it was so fast as lightning his Puerto Rican guy was bad motherfucker but he would not hurt me we would spar we would go hard but he would hold back from hurting you you know like you could trust certain people well you were sparring you knew that was just sparring there was other people it was to the death terrible crazy no only that we did it over a fucking thin office carpet on top of concrete it was just office carpet on top of concrete so when people would fall head would bounce off the concrete oh fuck yeah it was horrible good lord that's the eighties bro she's different we've no good so terrible so terrible Baghdad man people like could people couldn't get confessions back then or something oh they got them yeah they got a lot of them you know I remember people getting them when they were just fucked up for months and months at a time you get it I mean you get that kind of a concussion when you bounce your head off the ground and then you know just the impact is something like that it's just it's so devastating man it's just so bad for you there's a great video not great but kind of crazy if you go to sacks on Muay Thai on Instagram there's a video these two guys fighting in a parking lot and one guy's obviously a trained fighter and he's fighting these gangbangers and he leg kicks one of them and then punches him in the face and it's other guys going oh you think you gonna kick homeboy you think you're gonna kick homeboy and he goes come on kick me motherfucker and he takes a puff of the cigarette he takes his shirt off like he's gonna fight he has no idea fight and he's decide he's gonna fight this guy who knows how to fight and this guy leg kicks him drops him to the ground he gets up the guy shoots a double lifts his legs up in the air and drops him on his head and he just goes out yeah it's so it's watching some there's something about watching someone's head bounced off concrete that is so fucking disturbing for sure it's just it's it's it's saturd you find it anything else sacks on Muay Thai you didn't see it maybe somebody pulled it let me see it I once had a concussion in there yeah see the page let me scroll down a little bit well go to the top again yep that's it go scroll down a little bit yeah somebody must have pulled it I got a confession in a wrestling match one time maybe I'm wrong maybe it wasn't sex on I threw up rice krispie treats everywhere I was out I was unconscious and I was throwing up rice krispie treats cuz I had loaded up on those after weigh-ins away and that's where like an hour before the match I had a peanut butter and jelly and like the back then they had just debuted it was like a new thing the pre-made super processed rice krispie treats like that would just come in individual packages and after cutting you know my weight cuts were horrible horrible horrible and so like I would just be eyeballing all this food all week you know what I mean like I remember I'd be so excited whatever you had well you'd be so excited for and I was way too excited about this whole box of rice krispie treats that I had and I probably had like four or five right before the match and just boom out like a light some dude got my head yeah some dude got my head wrapped up in his legs like it was um it was like a like almost like a double chicken wing like he had he was my chest was on the mat I think he got me in double chicken wings and started to walk around my head I mean I rolled over and then and but but I was really I'm really bridgie and agile and have a long neck that I can bridge up on so when I bridged up on my neck and he's just now there's nothing he can do he took his leg and swooped it and figure Ford my head so now I'm in a figure four with my head and double chicken wings but then when once he did that I bridged up again in the crowd I remember sort of being like ooh you know what I mean like it's like you're not pinning me and then he did this thing where he just bucked back like a bull in my head right into the mat out like out like a light I was taken off on a stretcher to the hospital that wrestling match it's the only time that ever happened how quick after that did you go back to wrestling Oh probably probably a week or two yeah our assistant coaches son had just died so like that that night was like dedicated to him because he showed up we weren't expecting him to be there I was like leukemia or something like that and we weren't expecting him to be there and like our head coach gave us one of those pep talks like Coach Burton's coming tonight if he's comin after his son dies and you motherfuckers better not give up like it was one of those like super crazy like beyond all of our human potential which is probably why I ended up in that position in the first place because I'm just bridging for everything including my assistant coaches son spirit and all of this you know what I mean better not give up right oh this is it this is the video sent to me on that oh here it is watch this he gets it with the leg kick the guy gets up and watch this watch this boom strongly perfectly timed watch this watch this [Music] out go from the beginning now in the beginning you see if long it took two minutes long yeah but the beginning you see how the fight starts so this guy the guys oh come on motherfucker you want some of this get a shirt off and the guy's like trying he's by himself and he's like dough would do one on one one on one one on one you fought another dude first did he yeah yeah this guy this guy this is the guy legs kicks and after he leg kicks his dude the other guy says come on that dude doesn't have a wife beater on give me some volume on this gonna put is it gonna get taken down from YouTube Frankie okay okay can you turn it down so the guys like come on man so it's just one dude by himself with a bunch of other dudes but he steps in this guide knows how to fight look at it's throwing a jab and watch this leg kick oh so they throw quite a bit first hold different guy no no yeah but that's it right there leg kick boom then he cracks them and so then the guys like realizing he's in trouble and so he starts backing away and the guys coming forward is like come on bitch and so then the other guy afterwards goes oh you think you got a leg kick and a leg kick so he comes back he's like tired of this dude walking away from him and he's like I fucked this dude up with one punch and he wants to back up and this and this guy goes you want a leg kick you want a leg kick hear it right here [Music] Miss Sarah watch this he's like I'm gonna try you sticks it drag was sicker at first and then takes his shirt off guy has no idea how to fight which is Hilaire not in shape boom like quick guys but people are so ridiculous with this idea that they think they know how to fight yeah bang out cold but that's dark man the banging the head the back of the head off the concrete is dark yeah that's memory he's gone that fast it's a lot a lot gone a lot gone with your head that's why you say always getting mad at those movies where people get pistol-whipped and nothing what happened to wake up somebody who liked you would pistol-whip you because they needed to shut your mouth like they're trying to get information out of them like where's the money hidden it's like well now I don't remember and then when they would wake up did have no problems they'd just be fighting no problems no coordination issues meanwhile your equilibrium would be so fucked your legs wouldn't work right never been knocked out like other than that not really no I've been in a lot of fights but I've never been knocked out only that wrestling match did it when you find out how vulnerable you are like the human brain the way it's positioned in the head it all has to do is get hit and yanked around pretty D I think I have a pro well I think that I have what they would call a good chin I think so I've taken some fucking I've taken some real pun but at least when when I mean I was younger it's been a long time actually I took a good fucking solid headbutt about ten years ago from my from one of my drunk comedian buddies oh god yeah there's a great video of this girl head-butting that's gone unconscious outside of a bar you probably won't be able to find it but some some guys fucking with her and she's not big she's pretty small and she grabs this guy by the collar and just bang just crumples and drops to the ground fucking awesome so it's a real move man this part right here hell yeah this is where people break their hands yeah they break their hands on that the top of the forehead all the time yeah super hard spot and if you smash someone on the jaw with that or on the that's one move that a chick actually can pull off if she really knows how to do it grab someone's shirt yeah hell yeah high five head butted people have you yeah I've never had button anybody really yeah I've been I've had to because you know I I mean where I grew up it was just fights fights fight so that was just the whole thing Youngstown Ohio damn right everybody was a boxer that's why all the box are you with me with one Kelly Pitts was awesome right we all went out there yeah Matt Brown - bunch of Ohioans hanging out with Kelly Pavlik dude for someone from Youngstown that's as cool as it gets I've hung out with boom boom I had to knock out Kelly for the trifecta and that was amazing we had him we had a spread the size of this table I wasn't just any meal that was everything well what do you want cuz everything's on the table right now yeah we ate a lot of good food that was fun that was after the schottenstein schottenstein Schottenstein out that was fun oh yeah only show I've ever worn a football jersey that one's dude ha ha that was so cool I fucking love Ohio I love Columbus Columbus is the anti Connecticut absolutely 100% it's fun there man the opposite of Connecticut it's I mean people from Connecticut like what would I move to Columbus just trust me like if I would have done that same show that I did in Connecticut in Columbus and there was an angry a lady that looked that angry in the audience one face looking at me and I said what are you so angry about she would answer the question yeah yeah she would tell you yeah you shouldn't have said that about the me too and then at least I'd be able to really put we go back and more than I'd win her over but in Connecticut they just stay staunch oh that's young Jamie's photograph yeah young Jamie photographer extraordinaire number 18 for the Ohio State Buckeyes so what's going on with young Tony career what's the latest I know you've been killing it with kill Tony kill Tony is on a whole nother level we're having a lot of fun it's a blast we're taking them all over the road the road shows are insane Toronto was insane absolutely insane absolutely insane we just did two shows in one night in San Francisco kill Tony mania where'd you guys go chaos cops two shows in one night on a Friday night and sanity the shows at home are crazy we have Whitney Cummings on Monday we have this new cool thing called the Apollo 13 which is uh which is this group of black people that come every Monday it's like really basically like if any open mic or ever does like two racist of a joke or if it's on the line or whatever they're like the judges like I like point to them and it's like oh it's so funny we call them the Apollo 13 because I said that they're like yeah it's like David I'm shirts made that's three of the members right there but it's like how you're always adding new elements and always mixing it up like it is one of the best live podcast formats ever because it's so great it's so chaotic and you're guaranteed to either get good comedy or terrible comedy which equals great comedy yeah just to show you a span this past Monday we started the show off with a former reality star that that was horrible right he wasn't funny he's been doing it 14 years but he doesn't put any work into it no work ethic you know what I mean so it's like we roasted him and the crowd loves it because he's such an easily hateable guy and the last guy we pull out of the bucket comes out of the audience area with a wit wearing shorts and one of his legs is uh his amputated he as a he has like a yeah prosthetic leg and he talks about how he nearly died six months ago in a motorcycle accident and he's a huge kill Tony fan and this is his first time doing stand-up this what we find this out after he has a decent set for a minute it's his first time ever doing stand-up the show keeps them from being depressed and all you know what I mean like so this wide space is what helps make it refillable like what you were saying and you know it's just so cool because we're basically when it comes to that PC stuff that we were talking about earlier like I don't know if there's many places where the vent for that where you can get a real barometer because look we have the Apollo 13 which they're called the Apollo 13 because it's like Showtime at the Apollo but there's like 13 of them so I call them the Apollo 13 this group of black people it's like for example a few weeks ago this one kid like we it doesn't even seem like he's 21 closes on this horrible joke about Kanye what somebody needs to throw Kanye a banana or something like that boy it's the whole place is in chaos groaning in the Apollo 13 standing up like and it's like you know it's since it's such a live show that's sort of like you know if you if you make a racist joke that's not funny you're gonna die dude you know that's the worst type of you know so it's since there's a real live comedy crowd you get a real good barometer for what's going on and it makes it more exciting and it's just so so fun what we're doing keeping it refillable like what you said finding new ways to tweak it here and there and you know every time I go I do it like once every six months or something yeah it's always a new element there's always something new something and the fact that the background guys like Jeremiah and all those guys like change outfits all the time and they're constantly doing new things it's just it's a ridiculous show and that's the kingdom ereira is the fucking King yep he is so good at that shit oh my god he smile a little bit red band look at him so sad so serious those dogs Dahmer where's the king in that shit though he really is he was so good at it he really is said you know if he did it he did this thing a couple weeks ago where he said to a guy like he's like I like how you don't try to do that whole funny thing you know everybody else tries these punchlines these comedy things not you different paths altogether I think he's so great at that he just says it like it's like he's giving a big compliment what's the new thing what's the Hannah gatsby path oh yeah the people are doing anti comedy catchup Tony yeah I guess I will fucking cisgendered white male piece of shit I'm the bad guy yep yeah just doing a lot of stand-up or amping up to hopefully make another special soon and I feel good about things so we'll see what happens life is good I'm pumped beautiful yeah good to hear it's gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna be a naughty special when and if it happens no I'm not gonna be like Nanette you're gonna be naughty yeah hmm we're gonna talk about some things you planning on being naughty or you just naughty all the time it's modern day not eNOS man late night not eNOS built in the darkness this is a good time for comedy like a lot of people are complaining about comedy right now they think is somehow or another this is a bad time for comedy but Ari Shaffir said it best he said you know what's good about comedy right now comedies dangerous yeah there's real consequences just saying fucked up things I agree a hundred percent and in in it makes us some comedians are leaning towards it right like I want that one I don't want to talk about that I want to talk about that I don't want to talk about that and they're they're losing the they're losing the fun because all of a sudden I get up there you know what I mean you have the whole - all of a sudden you're touching the untouchable yes exactly right it's also there's fun in explaining yourself it's fun and navigating the waters like this one of the things that I've made sure that I did I thought very I thought out very thoroughly when I did strange times that my last special I wanted to make sure I really thought out how I can pull these bits off and how I can make them like you Doug Stanhope said it best he said he looks at his material like a defense attorney like as if he's defending his material like oh that's a great way to look at it I look at my material like I'm a hater like if I was a hater how would I poke fun at that if I was someone who's looking to be offended hona so get that out of the way look there was some bits that I did in the last one in triggered that I changed a lot of what they were from the beginning to when I put them on film because of the way audience members were reacting I was like what clearly I'm a problem with this where they're not I'm not even getting to the switch I'm not getting to the misdirect cuz we're upset before I get to the misdirect I'm not it's in it'll be fine if they let me get to the end but sometimes they would heckle or they would get upset like one lady at the county store I had explained to her twice I'll go listen I'm saying it like this because I'm gonna shit on myself afterwards this is what I'm saying and this is what it was a bit about remember that bit I used to do about women can do everything men can do that's not true cuz men can't do everything some men can do that's why we have the Olympics like the idea that everybody could do everything that's ridiculous I go because it was about the woman who guarded the White House oh yeah yeah yeah I was like I can't guard the White House do you know how I know because I met Shaquille O'Neal and his dick is where my face is and I had explained to her like this is see this is where I was gonna go with it if the White House is experiencing a Shaq attack I'm the last guy to save the earth okay he's just too fucking big you know and I I would explore I was trying to get to this but I was this lady was getting upset at me before I was so I had to think I was like okay if there's a drunk dummy how do I keep the drunk dummy from popping off before I get to the misdirect like so I had a restructure things and I had to figure out a way to make it so that it's clear and like you you just have to you just have to navigate the waters more carefully yeah but you could still get just as much juice out of it just as much comedy and just as much shit that's forbidden just as many taboo topics just you have to be really clear yeah you have to be really you have to have good writing that's what's great about doing the clubs on the road before necessarily doing you know bigger venues or whatever's because you really can feel them you know you feel where those moments are sometimes in a bigger venue you know sort of you you just you're sort of taking a gamble you know what's gonna you know what's gonna get a laugh and what not a laugh but you can't really feel there like you develop material in a big club right and well it's like a 10,000 seat room you don't develop material and like Air Canada center the you know the Scotiabank arena that we went to yeah you know develop any material there you better have that shit solid yeah you can't even have it memorized it has to be part of your you're better than anything you have to know it better than you know anything but like what is it the funny bone in Columbus yeah that place you develop material there Comedy Works Denver develop material there develop material in clubs yeah you have to have both I firmly believe that those guys who just do big places and they only play to their audiences they're fucking themselves totally it's like an athlete that doesn't strength train or it's like you know someone who doesn't they don't they work out but they don't watch their diet it's like yeah man you gotta if you want the best results you got to do the whole thing they're out of touch I mean you got it you got to do the whole thing they those people let's just I mean I don't wanna name any names but let's just say a guy that's SuperDuper famous goes to a theater you know one of those big legends mm-hmm what they don't do is they don't experiment not being funny what they should do is they should have a secret 5-minute experimental bit buried in their set that's purposely nothing funny about it and run it and when they hear those laughs that's when they'll realize like oh shit oh shit they're laughing no matter what because I have them trained is that true if it's their fans and their dumb comedy fans I don't think they're gonna laugh at things that aren't funny but I think they're gonna laugh harder at things that aren't as good I think they're gonna want like I went to see a comic I'm not gonna name any names me and Joey Diaz went to see him because we were playing in the place the next night yeah and it was it was one of those situations where someone was doing their material for their audience and you could tell they hadn't been working out in the clubs you could just see it yeah and the people wanted to laugh they wanted to laugh they were there there were fans and they were with it that's the difference between that and say a set at the store when it's 11:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night when they've already seen you and Joey Diaz and Ari and all these other killers like you gotta be funny actually funny it doesn't matter if you're you know some fill in the name whatever fuckin superstar you have to actually be funny they give you a minute or two to get settled in on stage the clap and they're excited to see you come with the fucking jokes barely do they give you a minute really they they really do it's really truly 30 seconds especially in the or it really is it really is it's so hard to recover from a spin-out so much easier to start strong and take chances and fizzle out than it is to not start off on the right foot and get them going so also cuz they're right on top of you in the or they're right there I mean you could just high-five them and they know that at that point they know what's going on they know you better get to it they've already seen six of their favorite new comedians that they're already waiting to Google the lineup after they go home like they're like oh my god this is crazy and they know it the blue light in the corner means all of a sudden oh my god this guy's got three more minutes fuckin stick that landing that they're not that dumb it takes what seeing two or three comedians in the original room which is only 45 minutes before your train and you know everything that's going oh here comes the piano guy OOP there goes the light exactly exactly the weirdest place is the belly room that's the weirdest wrong I fucking love that room so weird the birthplace of kill Tony that's another thing that makes kill Tony fun is it's like it was totally just it was a belly room baby and now you see this big man like having killed Tony mania I drove a van of 14 people up there saw a big giant picture up from Instagram it was one of the coolest things I was can't remember who I was talking to I was like oh yeah and I said it was the coolest 24 hours of my life because I picked everybody up at the Comedy Store I go be at the Comedy Store 9:00 a.m. Friday morning I'm gonna pick you up and I'm driving everybody back that night and I literally did I went and rented this big cool badass fucking luxury van so you did two shows in San Francisco and then you drove back that night hell yeah what time did you get home I think it was seven or eight actually was like 8 a.m. how'd you stay awake um first of all after a kill Tony I'm a freak for like three or four hours so I knew that so I'm like that's gonna be easy and I was cuz like adrenaline like hosting adrenaline like I'm crazy about that show so it's like so much like I'm I'm looking at what we're red bands fingers are I'm trying to get the guest in while the the bait you know it's I'm thinking moves ahead the whole time I'm super wired so I knew I really just needed to survive the last two hours and it was awesome man hot coffee beef jerky cold sugar-free Red Bull is enough for me my my body was like what the fuck are you doing when I got home did you do a Saturday night anywhere damn motherfucking right a main room baby I slept from 11 a.m. to like 6:30 that's so cool that's awesome but the really cool thing is cheesy as this is gonna sound is like taking those 14 people all with different backstories all from different years and different amounts of appearances you know white sarah wine shank and alley makovski were regulars over the different years at different times that all the fans know from seeing them each a hundred times on a hundred different episodes and this guy and this guy and this guy and this guy and the band and everybody was just on fire we met some of the best and worst people you can imagine in all of San Francisco in the history of the 303 episodes of this show there's only been one guy that ever walked off the stage angrily that couldn't handle the heat that happened in San Francisco like two and a half years ago the same guy we did we didn't realize until he did it again that it was the same guy again he walked off I go you know the only other time that anyone's ever walked off in kill Tony history was here in San Francisco and the crowd goes in like 10 15 20 people stand up and literally go yeah I was the same guy I'm like that was the same guy I mean the energy of the show and the fans and everything man it's like so cool but yeah I can't remember what made me get on this but I drove everybody there and back and it made it like such like a I was like I was like the dad for a day you know and I'm and I bought everybody in and out on the way up there like it was so cool everybody's were so happy that fan strawberry shakes the vans limit it's the second row there so like it's me and Ally makovski in the front and this was Jon REEP in the back that's William Montgomery and he's coming for everybody's jobs that's that guy that guy is a genius he's like Andy Kaufman meets a fucking Tennessee trucker he's comin for everybody's gonna know who that guy is eventually he's been doing at 11 years out of Memphis Tennessee and he just got here a few months ago and he's just an improv guru like he just goes like you can add he bullshit's you can ask him anything and he's literally got like that that comedy twitch muscle where he just riffs and it's the dumbest shit in the most glorious shit at the same time this is a second row so you're ahead in the front here drum well Watkins - yeah you got a aphrodite taking a nap look at that fro 2nd row from the back je belt the house artist you got Josh who decided to sit in the middle the continuous grump he gets he's he gets motion sickness and he didn't sit next to a window for some reason so that's a genuine frown on his face Mikey mckernon in the back left I mean all these people did amazing things it was just so incredible George and Christian sling in merch at the front you know love like grassroots created shows like that where it just started out as nothing and then it became what it is now I just love shit like that I love when people have an idea and they stick with it and when you gonna start doing the golden pony hour again speaking of which uh probably probably actually really soon I just got it I just got to do it I have to uh I have to figure out whether I want to do it at the Comedy Store not though it seems like I don't know why not you're really good with live audiences like that off the cuff why not have a show like that and do it in the belly room do it on an off night in the belly room yeah you did one Monday night you were doing Monday night yeah find another leg off time 10:00 p.m. especially if you do a late night like some weird late-night show yeah I think you're right actually that might I do yeah I think I need to do it in front of a live audience it's your forte yeah I mean you're great at that kind of stuff yeah and to do it in a small intimate room like the belly room and to build it back up you could get a logo and a big sign behind you the golden pony hour yeah maybe a gold suit maybe you do every show with a gold suit on I like the way you're talking now I'm telling you right I can fulfill the prophecy the prophecy we the the mastermind remember the mastermind no guy that writes everything and executes that you could do something like that like you have a cool backdrop you know like some sort of a simple portable back look at that $40 it's for the cutout like the suits only $40 I see if you can find one them suits gold black what is that word LeMay what does that word mean L AM II I've seen that word before and it's one of those words I never bothered to look up what does it mean LeMay suit just type in suit hmm unable to walk normally no that's lame bro LeMay is the type of fabric woven or knitted thin ribbons of metallic fiber oh yeah that's your shit a fucking Goldblum a suit dude that's what I'm gonna get hold on type in Goldblum a suit hmm here we go baby jacket no we need to get some custom-made shit that's we need to do

old iron sequin suit I mean mmm that's sequin there's like silver in there that shit's gonna get in your fuckin clothes yeah it'll get in the wash machine looks like I think you need to get someone to make you one of them I think we need to hire all those poor cosplay people jeez yeah we need to get someone to make you one yeah it needs to be like tailored properly yeah yeah yeah it's got to fit

and I'm looking I have 35 minutes now 35 minutes I've timed it out 35 new minutes I can actually do 30 I could do a 35 minute set I did a 35 minute set I'm looking at January January start booking dates I love it you're gonna start booking in January or booking board for January yeah so November stay in LA December stay in LA January maybe we do like the Comedy Works in Denver in the fucking dead of winter what I think I'm going to London for the first time in the middle of February oh shit yeah you'll love it out there yeah they're they're very polite do you remember the first time that we did Stockholm and you thought that you weren't doing well because they're very polite in between sets and I had to say no no they listened they were laughing like I felt like I bombed by the way I didn't believe you I had asked everybody around me that like security like I was I could not I right I took what you said like I believed you but I didn't really believe you like I thought you were just being I thought he were being nice like it's like oh he's trying to give me a pep talk like you don't know do that right now I just know that I know it shit I tell you dude you could do better I know but I know you wouldn't do that that's why it was crazy to me cuz I'm like either the either the world is different over here on the other side of the world or they're fucking with me two things taken in consideration one it's their second language so it's basically it's a novelty they're going out to see comedy which is a novelty I'm sure there are Swedish comedians but I'm sure the timing and the language is just very different going from you know Swedish style comedy to American style comedy but they're just really polite so they would they would laugh and then they would stop and they would listen and you just feel like dead in between the bits I'm like I'm telling you man you did great but then you saw it when they were doing it from my set yeah like oh that's how they really are yeah like oh but they had a great time but they laugh but they don't there's not like all this chatter in between the jokes they wait and then they laugh and again they laugh again but then your second set we did two shows that night you came out and you were comfortable yeah you're fun same brace yeah they stayed in the pockets that'd be I'm like what's going on well they are that way in England as well in England they really appreciate the craft they really appreciate stand-up comedy and they really really appreciate it as a show - extremely polite when they watch shows I really enjoy performing there I like it a lot I haven't been there in a while and I know I should go back and I will I promise but the last time I was down I was like man they're just they're intelligent they're polite the way they watch a show like they go to see a show you know it's uh that place is great Manchester's great London's great Newcastle do a lot places in England at a good time you know what else is fuckin great but in a different way while Dublin you got to do Dublin mmm Dublin's chaos yeah I want to go over there you gotta get drunk have they done a UFC there yeah they've done the Aussies there huh sure yeah and cuz Connor fought there I'm sure I don't know if there's been a UFC in Dublin while he was huge though I don't know that's a good question because they were gonna do like a soccer stadium over there when was the last time Connor fought in Dublin well no man seems like that would make sense yeah it was a cage Wars UFC fight against Brando Oh Brando second fight yeah okay yeah so I think is yeah yeah his first one was in Stockholm then Boston in Dublin yeah now though Jesus Christ that guy can't even walk in Dublin okay I can't go anywhere ooh that's something that we're about to do together we're gonna go to Toronto oh yeah yeah my girls fightin guess who's undefeated with me next to the Octagon your name Jeff damn right guess who's about to be remember when she got that straw weight championship what'd she do she ran out of the Octagon came and took a picture with a tawny issue that's right she yes yeah she reached in your parenting and grabbed Yuma Luke stick yeah and I believe that's what's gonna happen again no she didn't do any of those things joke yeah we're kidding but she did jump out of the Octagon and take a picture with well no that's a different one punch you in the face you're nothing that that was that one bottom right there again and again and again and again bottom right yep right there oh yeah she ran right out she came out and she pointed at me yeah I'm goes come over here look at that when their belt on yeah that is hilarious yeah it's a tough fight man she's fighting Valentina Shevchenko Valentina is a fucking murder she is a monster however I think not having to cut that extra ten pounds is gonna give you on a lot of pop and a lot of extra energy and we're gonna see the old do wanna you know what I mean Rose had her number technically and but that's the only person we've ever seen have her number so yes she she absolutely struggles to make 115 pounds absolutely undeniably she she's it's an agonizing wait cut for her I think it'd be better for her you have fought before you know they fought two or three times in muy Thai and Valentina's won all the fights hmm yeah Valentina is a beast but yeah yeah and she's bigger Valentina's coming down from 135 to 125 but I like it I like it's probably one of the more technical female MMA fights you're ever gonna see yeah in terms of like you know you want to be in world champion muy Thai fighter Valentina being you know at that same level they're just both super super technical I'm pumped that's gonna be fun yeah I'm gonna hang out in Toronto hell yeah whoo all right let's wrap this fucking thing up so rocktober it's been a good time it's over let me see the the standings see if anybody can made a wild push today to try to is it
