hello freak bitches I'm interested to talk to you about a bunch of things but one of the big ones is this idea of effective altruism and this is something that you really promote to the point where I don't know if this is true but I read this about you that everything that you make over $36,000 a year you donate yeah that's right sohow yeah so everything above technically it's about 20,000 pounds from 2009 Oxford so in just inflation cost-of-living changes and stuff but that's about $36,000 so you've just sort of decided that which is by the way the one percent for the whole world yeah not quite not two percent yeah I'll be in the top still be in the top two percent even despite it's out of thirty four thousand I think thirty four thousand puts you in the top one percent I think it's fifty five thousand dollars oh the change and maybe since Trump's been in office yeah that's right no but it's a it's you know what you're doing is uh if that's really the case that's a that's a very charitable thing yeah and it's also I mean it's most of my income over the course of my life like especially as an academic you're not going to earn tons though since effective alters and blew up you end up getting things like speaking fees and you know right is that I give all that way as well why I was going to end up probably being like the large majority of income of course of my life do you ever like want to buy something and be like shit if I wasn't so goddamn generous I'd be able to get this you know I never do and I don't basically never think that yeah I think like this like I think like in contemporary society we just get bombarded with marketing stuff all the time saying like oh you really need this thing if you're going to have a good life and I think like an almost every case that's just not true I think the psychological evidence just shows that once you live above a certain level of income additional money just has a very small impact in your happiness and in my own case like the things make me happier like being surrounded by friends actually gym membership that's like 40 dollars a month for something it's not very much I can afford that being able to work and you know what I really am passionate about and I already have that so my life is so good in so many ways and I feel like there's so much of a focus on money and how money is the key to happiness and it's just it's all bullshit basically but I liked that one moment like yeah we all have these moments where we feel better and that when that girl said that I felt better about like I was glad I'm like that I didn't go okay did you stay friends with her oh yeah I'm not mad at her right I'm not mad at and she told me some sexual shit till I didn't it was almost like the shit you told me that I didn't judge you on that's not like what kind of shit um she had had a fantasy I could say this because she hasn't even living State anymore actually I wouldn't say this I still saw her so bad but uh she had let's just say we had and she'd never done it but she had had an animal fantasy or she had watched a video of an animal fucking a woman and admitted to us something about it that had turned her on hmm welcome a mom it was a pony and some people tweeted it a long pause it was funny I when she told me that we she wasn't being dirty she was literally just talking to me about it well it's a big fat hog yeah I think I blurted that out it was right on Disney's idea with that pony hog but well this up Fame it that's a common fantasy women in horses yeah a horse's dick is so big you can't think about the horse without thinking about dick absolutely when you think about a horse like you jo-jo dick on another thing it's just like it's a giant dick my horse dicks are fucking huge yeah what a great rapport she's just don't know what a great reputation I ha ha ha ha ha what was it like having and having him on here by the way Alex Jones it was a dream come true like sitting face to face and it was awesome talk well I've been friends with him for a long time right on that guy since 1999 I think ok it was fun it was fun for me but it was also something like for the longest time people thought I was avoiding having him on for some reason and he kept saying well I try to get a hold of Joe Rogan never mind Tom mentality blows me off he was always texting the wrong number he's always like he didn't get worried get a hold me that day and I'm like dude I already have a podcast scheduled I can't do it today well I'll be back soon we'll figure it out we'll figure it out then he would go on a show Joe Rogan's been avoiding me I've been trying to get in there to give out this information very important maybe scared maybe he's been threatened the government threatened him he won't open up about Bigfoot I believe Joe Rogan did experience Bigfoot he saw he was there in the woods I was ultimately believe in Bigfoot I guess who knows what it got I don't know what he fries I know you believe he seems to believe in demons these days oh yeah well they are demons they are they're all they're all demons from hell all of them they're damned they're damned I'm sorry and if your red thing we doesn't you apologize yeah they apologize the apology compilation excuse me it's amazing I will stop your head excuse me I got out this is a Christian family show Oh like what I'm a Christian

we had a couple of drinks we didn't have a great fucking time I'm telling you a really nice guy he's a real nice guy and he would start telling you well the barium they've been putting barium in the water and you're like why you want another beer like it's it's I'm telling you he's a great guy but I understand that people are upset that he has the president's ear and maybe the presidents like me maybe the president just thinks he's awesome yeah a great story comes just like yeah barium in the water sounds great interdimensional child molesters are coming in through the cigarette smoke cigarettes with a 599 chemical they're designed to let the gates of hell come loose and interdimensional child molesters come in he just will go on and on and on I love the interdimensional child

does punched me in the nose - shatters my nose blood everywhere I was like great this is again and was right after the Carano fight so I was like I was used to losing which and you never want to get in that space of being used to but somehow I clicked and you know I I did pretty well in a fight and I ended up getting a mounted triangle on her and finishing with strikes in between rounds another corner man put cold water in the back of my neck and I thought that I just farted I thought it was a fart turns out and this poor girl mounted triangle no less I had no idea of this oh my yeah so they grabbed us they put us on this bus I'm still in my fight cause it's a blood couldn't let my gloves on they just put us on a bus separate me and Amanda Buckner from our corner men and everything
