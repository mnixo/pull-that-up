the gyro can experience I'm here with Peter Joseph future king of the world future cult leader for the zeitgeist movement you're uncomfortable with that right well to me going on it listen you gonna accept that Kings are well you'll just you on the front of the ship just like the inner to Cabrio King in the world right there was an awesome conversation man's really evil you're an interesting dude and you've had a very strange sort of a jump into this thing yeah it's been a ride yeah and you're very young guy to be doing this to the only 32 years old right that's amazing I I thought you were much older than that just really young looked at look at that a lot yeah telling you man the CIA's gonna probably come to you soon they're gonna try to either make you one of their own or kill you they could put me out of my misery you're gonna have to make a decision yeah make a decision or use your powers of charisma to convince them to let you run shit that's what I was suggested work that angle we'll sign off on the CIA what you think Brian I think you can do it I think I can do it is this the most fucked down podcast you've ever done okay how many podcasters have you done passes in this setting zero this is the first book oh really yeah I do lots of little radio shows do you call podcast but nothing like this um so yeah so serious well that is right like there's no goddamn humor to be a 32 year old dude out there you know doom and gloom and the end of civilization charlie positive trying positive it's not all doom and gloom but I appreciate the flexibility of different angles but yeah it's fun right you can actually be yourself you know and III appreciate the way that you accepted that and didn't take yourself too seriously that has jumped in and went with it so people need to find you they can go to the zeitgeist movement calm and tzm movement TZ movement and on Twitter and the films are at zeitgeist movie duck yeah don't go to watch zeitgeist movie calm because that's like some scam side it's gonna put up probably shoulda said that shit I fucked up bleep that up right I thank you Peter Joseph's caller take care powerful Ari Shaffir nobody yeah man nothing I don't know what's up so one what time is shrimp fest Sears is gonna be joining in late June or early July gotta wait till the kids are out of school mmm that's important that's available for yeah you don't want kids shrooming on their finals week yeah how do you know who's done everywhere research yeah what did you do it last time it was June those 20 yeah it's to 20th the school's yet out like the 15th public schools got out before that codes before that so every target was gonna be man people like I'm out of school yeah I was like that's a great point it's a great point yeah you gotta construe in a final and should you do three days of showing fast that's what he did it was the weekend it was a sunny Saturday Sunday Monday you can do them at any time yeah and then am I go to one day but I like two days also or three days sometimes people can't do it but they want to be able to you know you know that could catch on oh yeah just calling something Earth Day makes people conscious no way of not littering and you know she's doing on Christmas that's you can't be one refused and shed people have families and stuff it's hard keeping we do mushrooms on Christmas though you can't you're more than what happily if you follow the whole Christmas Santa Clauses a mushroom thing yeah people like I want to make another fascinating when you look at all the different correlations like when you looked online yeah there's stuff I want to see how old us those um those paintings are yeah I see to some of them are not old some of them obviously are new but there's a bunch of really old ones that were like our work comes from yeah it's something to do with that with the pagan holiday they took over like I bet they were that were to worship that it was also something to do with just the Siberian shamans you know the whole idea was that he comes from the North Pole well Siberia is like you know near the North Pole and the Siberian shamans are the ones were no known to use this Amanita muscaria mushroom that's what we're talking about with the reindeer - I forgot to say that when people come out of their huts to pee and they're having these mushroom sunrise reindeers will knock them over to get their piss though not over together there's water disagrees with that thing a theory a beer because they said inside beer there's no they don't have that that the images and stuff they don't have that of the flying reindeer so if it's all based on that than they should have it - hmm that make sense maybe but you know maybe so maybe them too that was also possible to them the idea of those intoxicated well they didn't need to have the reindeer fly yeah everybody kind of knew the reindeer were tripping off falls off who knows you know maybe people heard about it that the reindeer do eat these psychedelic mushrooms that is a part of their diet they actually like them that's pretty wild right very well yeah well you know some psychedelics kill animals like DMT kill sheep really yeah if they find grass that's rich in certain DMT will just die this died though the sheep will eat it and then fall on their back and their little legs kick up in the air and they fucking seizure to death which is pretty dumb participation first yeah I wonder yeah cows don't ever eat rose they have a good relationship just mushrooms okay all these white mushrooms bro yeah there's some fucking seriously poisonous mushrooms man and there's some that look like Sukkot Delic ones yeah don't shit don't worry about the dog I don't worry about you or some small dogs a friend of mine got the most ridiculous dog it's a baby shih tzu and all my god it's so little man it's like this big I mean it's you know it's a baby but shih tzus only growing that big but this is like a little tiny baby water like holy shit he's so cute oh Cabo's of shih tzu dude this thing is so cute it's ridiculous it's a it's you clear you can't believe it's real it looks like a little the hall that's moving around you know yeah that used to be a wolf how crazy is that what did shit Oh engine ever do it somewhere you know anything but you're driving the way it's the way of breeding out it's pretty much what the Holocaust was like part of that was like get rid of the negative trend there won't be part of our site anymore they were doing it to people they do it all over and they say the reason the crime rent in New York went plummeted recently if it's because of education stuff like that no it's because abortion was legalized 18 years ago and that's the only thing to be traced to all the dumb all the poor people instead of having these kids and like making new criminals wow they got rid of them so it plummeted 18 years later when they would haven't started being tried as adults oh my god that's amazing yeah and they were doing it against people's wills in like North Carolina two people sterilizing the like the super white trash doctors would be like you don't need any more just like some amazing yeah that's amazing Wow yeah and they wanna make now it's cuz of the education programs like nope you can't trace the death to anything else but that that's and nobody wants to talk about it where did you get this from this is all from my friend Kurt Metzger turned me on to it but it's all out there open the Internet cool Wow I'll have to read that that's if that is a true statistic that's fascinating that's amazing yeah I wish I knew what the years were was like the Year abortion was legalized and had 18 years later that's so crazy yeah it's like allow fuckin yeah immigrants or whatever it is or the fucking criminals allowed them to get rid of babies Jesus Christ I don't wanna think like this are you really it's just like dogs freaking me out here buddy it is kind of like dog breathing yeah they don't know how the fuck they ever did that either by the way you know the result yeah it's only guessing how the fuck they made all these different dogs no one has the direct records you know no one knows how the fuck they ever managed it to how they made all wolf and turn into a shih tzu you can you could give me paperwork all you want you know no one really knows how to fuck anybody did that that's some silly shit how did they make Bulldogs Dobermans how many job that's all from wolves yeah how many generations did that take how the fuck did they exactly go about doing that how they do that from wolves doesn't have to be over like a billion years I don't know who the fuck knows they you know they had said that it was a really recent discovery that it was it was all wolves they used to think that it was a bunch of that most dogs are a bunch of different wild canids you know I think that's the word for canines Canada's broke oh yeah they thought there was a bunch of different wild pad dogs you know like jackals or whatever and they're all men together but now so I Wolfman could happen fast yeah who knows but it's from it happened because of people it's really nuts because the only thing that's like people is dogs dogs the only thing that's like people we're we're totally not uniform as a species but that we can interbreed with each other you can interbreed with ones that don't look at anything like I ought to do it's like I got salmon can't breed with a bass they swim in the same water but they can't fuck each other Appling shouldn't be able to breed with a Smith what is a Kaplan Kevin's a Jewish mob I've gone with something like green yeah yeah that's it's fascinating shit isn't it no no people are we vary as much as dogs do I mean you have like mini-me and then you have Shaquille O'Neal you know they have they both could get someone pregnant you know you get little tiny dudes let it fight 135 pounds and then you got dudes like Brock Lesnar there's to cut weight to make 265 that's like it ever breathed yeah it's like this we're like dogs we're like dogs in our you know how much we very I think this the reason you get like when there's race and race traits hmm yeah because they keep interbreeding the same way over and over again well it's fascinating that people we still to this day it's so clear that people who developed in certain parts of the world just look different they have different attributes they have different strengths and different weaknesses you know and you know there's certain parts of the world where there's this is there's where the agents come from they'll come from Asia look they're all the same they're the up boom this is where the Africans come from look through the ones that live in Africa just come near the character Yeah right you know and the that's the argument also that human beings are some sort of an experiment from aliens know is that we're just like like people manipulated dogs yeah created dogs are evolved they started us off that they manipulated our DNA yeah just like we manipulated the DNA of the dogs what do you think might I true it's either were nuts man beating off for pleasure yes that's the end of this video thank you very much follow Ari Shaffir on Twitter that's a are i sha FF I are hot boy yeah how we filming Steven oh thanks for coming on man yeah we have yeah that was fine I'm a convert to your program are you I'm beautiful I'd like it even more if I wasn't on it I think you converted a lot of people I think you changed a lot of people's opinions on hunting and trapping and I think you express yourself in a way in the podcast it's like you know we're talking about where it's such a long form you get to really express yourself you could kind of tell like sometimes like you had some really well thought out answers to these questions almost like you had been waiting for people to ask them because this is like something that's really kind of bugging you about perception yeah I think well the same issues come up again and again and I think you know you put him to me in a way that was actually more challenging to me because I could tell that you were like coming to honest conclusions I mean you're asking like real questions that came up and not questions that you learn so there's no anything you're like oh that's it I'm gonna ask him that because that was a good point like you're you're like we're giving me thoughts that popped out of your mind it's a huge subject but it and I know that I wound up doing a lot of like adding layers on things well goes like this but then if you look there's also this and it makes that not so this what the good it's really rational but it's really hard to come in and be like no this is wrong and this is right this is right because it's things are so complicated the same way that it's hard to come in and say that you know it's hard to come in and start talking about euthanasia and accurate you have all these like definite opinions about right the subject right the wulfing was really pertinent there's so many different versions of you know who scare sites where people are terrified of these wolves these wolves are so much bigger that's the way you broke it down made so much sense well they have the Moores more food and the food is not ready for them in the a bigger I guess a you know even after all this I still can't certifiably speak to that issue except I guess I don't know right but you are a you're coming from a lifelong you know a lifelong path as an outdoorsman it's not like an uneducated a penalize not devoted a good partner life is like trying to starting to understand these issues but that is something I frankly hadn't heard of but my guess I think that if you follow what I'm saying that path would maybe lead you to some enlightenment about that if you could live in part of this country if you could like pick any spot in this country where you would have like great hunting and great fishing and a good place to like live off the land what part of the country would you pick I did best and kind of enjoyed that aspect of my life the most when I was living in Montana really yeah why Montana well yes you know it's like 70 some percent public land you have very generous good long seasons the hunt you have a wide variety no al North American big game there I liked it I said I still have family there I hunt there multiple times a year this is a great place also also Grizzlies yeah but this is the no season on those but you can just shoot them all year round no no no right now you cannot right now you cannot they're still under protection fats and bunkers we dig this I see a grizzly I'm shooting that and you will wind up being in tons of trouble yeah I'm stealthy I'm like a ninja hey guys check this out I've fucking put landmines around my property they've had guys bad guys killed they've had a blackberry permit so they're legally hunting black bear and accidentally kill a grizzly and you wind up having your hunting privileges revoked and in all states to cooperate in this agreement for like three to seven years $10,000 fine Daniel it's a big deal and you don't you don't you don't mess the grizzly bears there but someplace they can hunt Grizzlies right yes where's that but let me state the only state right now or there's legal hunting of grizzly bears or brown bears is in Alaska and much of Canada are Grizzlies and brown bears the same thing yeah there are they're not recognized as being subspecies anymore they recognize it being the same thing they used to call myself Susan they've been back and forth brown bear was like so sweet generally is lose the one yet known like in general moment like in general yo popular terminology popular terminology be that people refer generally to the ones in the interior as Grizzlies cuz they again there's like morphological differences the ones in the coastal areas with access to salmon get much bigger they have an appearance they generally refer to those as brown bears huh so the brown bears are actually larger than the intercoastal the coastal bears get much bigger have the potential getting much bigger than the Bears in Ontario but those are the bears in the interior the Grizzlies yeah so people usually call those Grizzlies that's interesting Colston ones brown bears but they're all part of the same species they're not recognized as subspecies anymore the same species whatever it is for evilest I think polar bears are really scary motherfuckers right that's a whole different that's a whole different species but they now realize something had realized before that there is some genetic exchange between polar bears and Grizzlies and something but argue that they can have viable offspring Elmo if that's true really no that's uncommon for hybrid that's one kind of bite someone I think I don't know the answer to that but I know that there's there's a question about whether they can have viable offspring motherfucker and some people think that what's driving that exchange is that as we're losing ice polar icecaps it's pushing more polar bear activity on the mainland where they're running into and hanging out with grizzly bears that's just something that people throw out ammo if that's true enough have you ever counted a polar bear in the wild I've never laid eyes on a polar in awhile it's more than that it's one of the few I think it might be one of the only large North America I think it is it I think it's the only large North American mammal I've not seen in the wild wow there's a polar bear are they common I mean can you go look for me you'd have to go to a certain spot somewhere it's very reliable to go see him in certain areas like on Hudson Bay there's places where you very reliably find them in the winter there's places where you go and check them out and they have you can like book a tour trip and go check them out on ice haven't seen the most frightening stories that ever heard was something some boat crashed somewhere and these guys got off on an ice shelf and a polar bear started getting closer and closer to him and jumped in the water and climbed up on the ice shelf just fucking killed and ate one of the guys in front of his friends yeah kill or dead to me they kill people don't they do I think right I think that probably in a per capita sense like deaths attributed like the death per number of bear ratio is probably highest with holidays yeah definitely second-most high with with the grizzly bears which man is a scratch people oh I would like to get mile he scratched up by a grizzly bear I would like to have no I want to have I would like to have warm weird I would like to have one five cloth scar it's just that we're how would I start wearing my shirt open all fucking you should shoot a grizzly bear and then have a friend tie the part to a stick just do it for decoration so now Helen yeah listen Lana from it was an awesome conversation thank you very much you everyone come back again all these do any time here in town we could do this 10 times I guarantee guarantee you thank you very much hey everybody we're here with Hamilton Morris and his buddy Matt the cameraman Matt we don't need to know your last name right that's right whatever man Matt was there the whole time we had a podcast looming over our shoulders making it very uncomfortable because there's one person in the room that didn't fucking talk so I try to say Matt sit down once you become a part of this but know Matt's just dedicated to his creepy filming you and not talking strategy I'm glad I had iMac in front of me so I didn't have to see how this man how can you just hang out with us why wouldn't just put the camera down for a little bit it's a professional is that what it is you're not allowed to I suppose I mean it's my job hear me talking have a day oh I understand it would be cool if we got you in there though Matt but we're gonna put you on this okay we're under what is this this is we do a little video blog where we just put little clips of people that just did the podcast you know asking they have fun yeah it's just it's just one more piece of content that people enjoy like a post podcast wrap up you think I know it seems ridiculous but they love it right I mean lowest ed woods neutral mood so here it is the next one with you well we were saying before we did this was one of the coolest things about the Internet is that you could watch somebody's stuff like and you know say oh who's this guys fucking crazy what is he doing he's hanging out doing all his drugs and good fucking don't meet that guy in that boom we're doing a podcast killer yeah yeah amazing right yeah it is strange fucking world we live in science computers it's craziness it's probably trap ha ha we should have a show we did the Odd Couple yeah I'll come in and fucking every day the ghosts and you're like listen it's a blurry picture my dude my aunt died in this building to this day uh no ghost at all I don't believe in any of that you know believe that it's mainly like it was the most rational argument that Celeste had was that an experience could be so traumatic that so much energy is released in the form of emotions and fear that it actually extends an area that you can go near that area and occasionally get a little flashbacks or that's like the Stephen King shining idea yeah maybe people hallucinate all the time for various reasons I'm smart for horror movies bro no I love horror movies yeah horror movies because I would think you'd be in there going werewolves are impossible no the parents would not fit in how's the pants work yeah and it doesn't make you you know you have to you know sit there and look at some ridiculous shit no I think it's scary I'm scared of art what are you scared of well it's Lasher films like that kind know we've been supernatural ones I mean you know really yeah kind of I've been wanting to watch them all the time like every day really and then I started to wonder if it was damaging my mind in some way really yeah so you think that would damage a lot more than 100 DMT in 30 days of the rods crazy asshole well you know crazy have to be to be 24 and I've already done DMT 30 days in a row that's something like someone like cancer doesn't like 90 like well fuck hey let's see what happens I don't have to worry about it anymore let's just redline this bitch and see what kind of you know kind of performance we can get out of it you did it how old do you need it there's nineteen probably about 21 but yeah I don't think that's especially damaging but inundating your subconscious with all of these violent images seems like you couldn't and I don't know do you ever worry that someone is gonna see all this shit that you put online and that you're gonna be some sort of a target for an anti-drug activist or someone is what some prove a point yeah I mean these people that are really hate drugs yeah it's possible I'd be more afraid that it's just like academic opportunities job interviews things like that right that you gotta be missing out on for sure listen you don't need that just write books write books use the Internet done you know you can do it over the fuck you want you got the internet man yeah I mean it's beautiful to be able to get you know some sort of a job teaching at some prestigious university that'll be amazing but you know it also be amazing you just fuckin putting out books put out books keep put out videos keep fuckin doing what you're doing man you're doing some cool shit yeah well I'd like to do both impossible yeah is it is it a deterrent or is it you know some whore another christening I don't know unless it's really excessive but there's plenty of people that did st just university positions that have had sordid histories of one kind or another so it's not right it's not like there's no putting a job at a major bank or something like that there's also a lot of fear there's a lot of paranoia I know people at MIT that have prescriptions for a drawl and things like that and were terrified that anyone would ever find out that they take prescription stimulants well yeah what is the deal with adderall is it I have a friend who's on that shit every day yeah and then it just seems to me like that seemed so weird it seems like an energy pill oh yeah that's it so is that a job thing that someone should be taking every day well sure it is a complicated word but I think that certain people benefit from taking a daily yeah this dude looks like he's aging rapidly uh yeah it's possible yeah also I needed me accelerate your metabolism in some way not a big tank right I don't know it's hard to say who think that if you're taking something that's a massive stimuli look at those faces of meth right someone sells Hornet it'll look that bad that's hilarious that is hilarious II Heidi Fleiss the airport johani sabaidee sound like that bad they look better after the nap it's like it's not is that they were extremely attractive people to begin with and then negated that maybe decade aloud here's a lovely character yeah so I kind of chick you remember picking up in a bar yeah just a mistake a drunken mistake this is the perfect end to the weirdest interviews ever in the history of the podcast Hamilton Morris you're a hell of a guy and it was very awesome - how many on the show yes really interactive stuff the you you really most most informed yeah like on psychedelics especially have any I have to get we ever talked it so it's cool it's cool I think a lot of people got a lot out of that man awesome yeah hope we didn't weird you out too much hi everybody what's happening beautiful people Joe Diaz here we just finished a great fucking podcast thank you for listening we are good Tommy I can't believe

fucked up we're so sorry we got Hamilton way too high we got way too high we just completely over modulated sometimes when you go to these dispensaries you forget like when you buy something whether it's an indica or a sativa you yeah and there was definitely a sativa or excuse me definitely an indica which is like the stuff that makes you sleep here and it was way too strong we were all off the tracks and into the woods and we were trying to keep a conversation together but we were just lasted here's an artist rendering of their exact was really preposterous the fact that we pulled together any sort of a podcast was amazing he kept fucking with his woman killer do you he was so high it was like playing with his voice and a half that was freaking me out yeah almost I love that dude though I love anybody who's out there doing wild shit like that I love anybody who's out there just fully embracing the freak culture and you know pushing forward he did a really cool thing with the isolation tank manufacturers who went on there and film there and he took an animal before he got in my device I said just take some Pollock and I don't have before you go under to be perfect you're just for getting their ride it that's exactly did he so it was amazing I'm in for a three-hour ride Wow I'm super high on a pot brownie in an isolation tank that's what you know I got to do next dude you and I and the on it guys we're gonna start open up tank centers I had a conversation today I was doing this interview for our Vegas show next week and I'm doing this interview I'm like you know talking about the woman asking about isolation tanks and I said yeah I go they're really hard to find you know there's a few places in California but I know there used to be a place in digs but I thought about I'm like why are they hard to fire well I just does not make it taste great idea yeah there's fucking panic centers man you think that couldn't be tank centers and by the way those tank centers what a great way to meet cool people yeah huh you know go with a bunch of other people that want to explore their consciousness a bunch of other people that one relax and float a bunch of other people that are curious about those sort of thing yeah that'd be like a great place if you have like a big waiting area that was like really quiet and couches and shit and magazines people probably hang out there after they're good you all seminars yes yes you could have little shows there yeah you can have offers come in and talk about books you know books on consciousness you could have psychedelic that guys like Dennis McKenna could come and speak you know let's do it dude we should do that right yeah I'd see the birth of an idea this is totally what the next Sejal do that's I'm gonna move my friend Tommy jr. from Connecticut to help me come down to our tech centers idea we need to fucking figure out a way to make ourselves completely self-sustaining outside of the mechanism of Hollywood it's totally do I have an idea what I'm not gonna say on the air powerful powerful idea we'll see you soon shit pow we're full two minutes on powerful lasers a camera and your dog's name - video camera it's a Blanche Blanche Eliza swallows crazy dog ladies that brings her dog everywhere she goes women comedy clubs and she brings her dog to the Ice House chronicles the darndest fuckin wanders out around the streets of Pasadena we had to go running after while she was on stage yeah nobody was watching her nobody you left her there nobody was watching her she didn't know what you were you there she went looking for you why are you just leaving your car when you do stuff like that it's not hot oh the only car for a sec was a black horror someone steals your car yeah I guess you could look at it that way someone's a glass half-empty sort of guess I wasn't you think it's right yeah they'd make book bags you can keep her inside - perfect in the car - so a lot of these messenger you're probably the most aggressive female comedian we know what's what's the secret - that can be fired up yeah you're a hero fucker man just let me get on stage the audience came to have a good time I give it to a man of this like I do want like that right dude you get upset when you see people what else what else I know I flip through that alternate product if there's like 12 people in the crowd and you're working something out okay but I just feel like an audience came there drunk it's a Saturday night they worked her all week they want to cry from laughing and that's and I have a lot of energy I like to move around and give it to a proper yeah I hear ya this is well it's good you have a great personality it's not it's not a bad thing it's just very unusual you're an unusual girl you have a lot of lesbian qualities but you know less man drove a blazer I told you that is that good didn't have a bass on the back of it nobody had a splash decal on the side and my parents told me that I picked I have no recollection of that and pick the splashed and chair-like out of all the Chevy's in the lot I was like what the splash decals Tina did you have like a roll cigarettes in your sleeve no but I do have a pen shot first leaves without the shirts really yeah or shirts without the sleeves rather just it's a get out its leaves home son is it it fucked up when you do something like that you reverse something and you have no idea did it never it's like what they make a big deal yeah yeah well not only that like you know you don't even know what the fuck happened and okay I believe you made a mistake like that because you know how articulate I know but then they play you back the tape that's the problem like the podcast myself say something on the podcast like one time I say yeah it's like it's like pcs versus windows which is the opposite yeah but I said PC yes well the worst is when someone gets what you're Slyke Wheatley they get the juice and they credit you anyway correct do you know the difference yeah actually along that what am i what I hate is when you go to give someone directions you're like it's right up here on that road they're like you made over here yeah and like from inside a building you're like who has spatial relations that much on lock yeah yeah none of that fucking assholes let's just be nice to Eliza have you know a nice person she's a good person okay why do you make dudes uncomfortable you think that's all you say no I've seen you know that's not what I said no but there's there's no men are intimidated by intelligent women for not all men but a lot are a lot of men don't want the game to be difficult yeah it's already difficult to get a girl like you and to have to measure up to a girl as well as other men you know it Josh that's why from the get-go I'm like you don't have to be smarter funny as long as you're really hot so you just like hi guys they're just nice to you I think if they're either guys smart in front of him he doesn't have to be hot that's catchy you have to somewhere you got to be better than right so you could be not funny or smart but hot or wanna be funny and

much more complex that's all of them for sure some of them some crazy and what's interpretive script we need so many like yeah you need a guy to be hot but that's like that he has to understand me and listen and not do that and it has to be 25 degrees and I want a fun restaurant and wedges like you're very you're very loving and super low-maintenance really you're not super specific about what you

you're having a baby flipped out I was like you're having a baby with her are you or like I can't do this yeah yeah he really started I was screaming at him because I saw him convincing himself it was

not want a long-term relationship this crazy bitch and you can avoid it please do it's crazy well life is great to do and you know as we develop we realize that we are a bunch of deficits that we have when we were younger then we're still trying to make up for you know shaking like a leaf it's not even the machine this is him thinking about his past that's what it is crazy isn't it yeah isn't it awesome that feels we should feel great and he's feel stimulated when you get off of it and it's also exactly what Christopher McDonald in his book and what's that book Bubba the the the running book Born to Run it's an awesome book you have to Rio I love what is that no no never oh this guy nasus before be like the Irish guy loved to run in his late 40s he heard about this Tarahumara tribe in Mexico that were running ultra marathons forty fifty sixty seventy eight hundred miles in a day and there no not bare feet they were taking down tires cutting them down melting them and they're just having the smallest bit of rubber on the bottom of their feet that just conforms with their feet so basically was like they were running barefoot cuz they're going over rocks and boulders and practicin for a hundred miles in the desert so they melted down ties how they get on the stick to there they just picked up twine and they just took the leather tied it and made a very primitive sandal now I wear these that's kind of what they did they took a very there's no heel right because your feet are telling y'all the first thing and then usually the only thing that's touching the ground when you're walking and so of course it's affecting your nervous system your feet we're telling you what you're sending right now as I'm moving around my feet are sending off they were just of my brain yeah I know that's the idea behind those Vibram FiveFingers no waves we never I wear - yeah I know what else I do I lift weights barefoot absolutely me too I with my arms I don't where I'll go from Steve Maxwell I got that from Tim Ferriss book ah yes I got max well he had me doing everything barefoot kettlebells barefoot yeah because if you from this one and you feel it through your toes to my body fluid you feel better mass your nervous system is becoming negated with the more we have heels the more we have shit on the bottom our feet the more insulated we are from the world not only that but someone created a running shoe what they did is they created it so that when you land s you land on your heel where puts this pounding on unique once you're supposed to land on your toes that's how people are supposed to run who's supposed to lie you've chosen to shop it exactly that takes all the pressure off your knees so fighters now they do sprints and you sprint to those Fivefinger toe things and they run on grass and everyone kept you know it's revolutionized like training nutrition yeah it's taken on a revolutionary step like like the way you guys train now like the intensity the short intensity yeah it's completely different yeah completely there but Nick Diaz don't John's so runs five miles swims an hour and a half guys freak has a freak free turbo sonic ladies
