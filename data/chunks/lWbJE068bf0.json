hello freak bitches two or three stories and so you set up a perimeter around the building keep people stationed in them guns at the windows they're looking out constantly and it would be we take the building down and then they would do a massive construction project in the middle of a combat zone so these army engineers god bless them all would roll down there with their bulldozers and there they put these big concrete barriers up and they put sandbags in all the windows and they build machine-gun nests on top and again they're doing this in the middle of like mayhem Wow and then you'd have this secure combat outpost and while they were doing that this is sort of was our-our addition to this type of operation was while they were doing this big construction project project obviously the situation was very vulnerable for the American forces and so what we would do is I would push our seals out into perimeter buildings that were maybe a 200 or 300 yards away and so when the enemy would come to attack we'd kill him what a crazy scene that must have been to be taking these buildings and then reinforcing them and then turning him into military bases and then one after others you doing this - yeah yeah it was it was an awesome effort and I think a good number we put in one combat outpost and there was the army engineers put in 30,000 sandbags in one combat outpost like three buildings just all good things a lot of sand out there yeah Wow and so how many buildings did you guys wind up taking overall probably it probably a total of like 10 combat outposts each one having two three or four buildings and again let me clarify when I say we I'm talking about this massive effort of the 1:1 ad which is the the first Brigade 1st Armored Division and all the battalions that were underneath them including one Marine Corps battalion and the reason I'm pointing that out Joe is uh those guys were just unbelievable heroes they really were they were awesome you choked up yeah these guys were these guys were awesome they really weren't yeah I can only imagine the emotional attachment that you have to that yeah and you know they you know you can look you can Google Navy SEALs and find you know 20 million news stories about them and that's great but these guys you know to have seen them kids you know because you know you're talking about earlier how the seals you know guys like me this is what we want to do well these guys didn't all necessarily have that attitude and as a matter of fact the guys that were in Ramadi with us when we first got there they were reserve unit out of Pennsylvania the two to eight iron soldiers they were reservists these guys were teachers the like like what you see when they talk about these reservists these guys were teachers and professors and you know bakers and they had real jobs in the real world and wanted to get home to their family and yet they were there grinding it out against a hardened enemy and so uh yeah it's it's it's it's it's a crazy thing to see and it's it's very humbling to be around people like that it really is that was one of the things I would have a hard time coaching for fighter cuz I'll I'll look at I will you know dissect the person I'm like in a blockade let me see you fight me I'm gonna go with you and I'm like okay you have a hole here a hole here so are you looking just a fight to make two paychecks three paychecks if so then I guess you're in the right area but if you're looking to be a world champion if you're looking to be able to provide for your family I mean I would school all the time when I was in the UFC when I fought for the World Championship at 135 I also work on a fucking full-time job and I'm like do it fight for a world championship you should be working I was like yeah because what have you I've lost a fight so now I I made what at $14,000 so it's not what you made to fight for the world title at 135 yes that's well it's it's it's all public record so damn and then that's why I hide pressing so that's why I was still working even when I fight Kiara moto I mean I made my money and then I was like king every simplify I had a UFC up to the Domino crews spike when I broke my leg and my girl Taurus I was like I was in Vegas it was almost like a vacation for me you know when they know when Matt will caught me goes hey do you have C wants to know you want to fight Kiana or else like I'm like kind of call you right back I need to call work to see if I could day off please Wow and I will call my boss people Hawking I'm okay so UFC called that when it was your job what were you doing farming I work in a paper mill at construction so we built basically sonic tubes so and we also built v board so if this microphone came to you and it was in protection mm-hmm it'll be like a V board that would protect it and that's what I was a guy who made it and let's say you needed two and a half inches or three inches 4 inches 5 inches whatever I will take it do the math put it in a computer and sit there and it would go choo choo choo choo and I'll go 1 2 3 4 Gators 10 there you go and do that all day and then when I and now I have my phone I mean Matt will call me those hey do you see myself you want to fight I'm like I'll run into the bathroom and like hey what's up man he goes hey you know the you want you to fight Kyoto on February 5th my debut new your C 2011 I said hey let me see like a day off from work I'm going to my office and say hey Pete what's going on he goes what's up DJ and I'm like hey do you think I have a week off to go fight in Vegas he goes yeah let me see if I can work it out and then I'm like all right now come I was hey I don't don't say yes I don't know I don't know yet okay and he goes I would just let me know okay and then sure enough emboss yeah you get a week off and I was like hey I can go he goes right I'll look sharp I know you can fight that's how it was are you still friends with your boss yeah yeah we still hang out what's to be happy oh yeah he's now well he said he said he would fire me before I quit fighting and doing real job because in reality that's what's paying my fucking bills that check was coming every single week it was keeping the lights on fighting was nice so right that's why I tell kids all the time like man I would be just like it was like no my friend be better than me go to college get education don't try to put yourself in a boat to where this is all you have to do you have you know now it's worked out for me where I'm starting to you know branch out and try to do other things but that's how the reality was and so that's why worked for time the dirtiness the humiliation no shouldn't you talk it on the air I love dark ones no no I like I like my wife is like a high pink I like that okay like it just seems it seems real I want real I don't want to go into strip club and have them be able to get naked like that I want them to like take their shoes off Oh what the realness I want to see like the sock marks in their leg realness Oh sock more like I want real let's wrap this bitch up this is going south marks I just got back from Columbus Ohio you're not allowed to be naked there and so all the girls had pasties but they would have like darker nipple looking pasties so it looked like they all just have really big Ariel at dark Ariel and their host ridiculous you have to have a thin rubber sheet over the outside of your nipple and if you go outside you can just take your shirt off because it's legal in Columbus Ohio to just take your shirt off outside but when you're inside at the strip club you have to put pasties up in Columbus it's legal to be topless if you're once been there forever it's you just walk around with that it's hilarious what a dumb business hey are you upset at all the freedom that you have with girls nipples out there on the street oh come on Christie Teague is the nipple warrior who's that I don't know I just read it the other way she's a nipple warrior Demi Moore's kids a nipple warrior their nipple warriors what does that mean they're like they want everyone to be able to see their nipples oh okay okay like a really sheer
