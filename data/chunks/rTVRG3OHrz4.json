the girag an experience it's one almost common traits among humans man I have a really tough time and there are some really cool people down here but I have a lot of trouble with LA men you should San Francisco is superior well I think everybody in San Francisco is Asperger's so they just say what's on their mind whether it's appropriate or not so which is is really refreshing but can be frustrating but the converse in LA man it's like Jesus like how many layers to this onion of a person who have to peel back to know what the fuck you're actually trying to say to me yes that is a huge issue and it's an issue because of the entertainment industry now the entertainment industry Foster's bullshit because you have to pretend to be something a unique and different meanwhile you're just another fucking person who's gonna pretend to be a killer in a movie or pretend to be a princess or pretend to be at you're pretending and faking it so like you're to be the best at it you have to be fake you know you have to be a big fake person he's good at lying it's really bananas and not only that you start to embody this look look here's a perfect example Sean Penn is a brilliant actor he's very good at that most likely cuz Sean Penn is fuckin crazy okay and Chris Rock was hosting the Academy Awards once and he was making fun of Jude law about how Jude laws and everything goddamn can I see move without Jude lock it was pretty funny it was just joking it's a subject because Jude Law is very prolific and right he's excellent so he's used a lot of movies so fuckin Sean Penn takes the microphone afterward and says Jude loves in all these movies cuz he's an amazing actor I'm like okay I want to beat you to death I want to beat you to death for getting literal about a fucking Chris Rock joke about a prolific actor Jesus Christ you fucking pretentious cocksucker did you really say that did you have friends at all do you have anybody that bust your balls do you know they take themselves so goddamn seriously and the redonkulous awards show where everyone wears a monkey suit you were all we're all gonna agree to wear the same stupid outfit that we never wear if we're being comfortable and real yeah once you put a bow tie on you cunt put it either we're with a white shirt and a buttoned up jacket are you guys rich key dressed anyway the fuck you want why is everybody dressing the same oh we're elegant this evening why we have traditional attire on I just want to say that Jude Law is an amazing actor yes you're here let's go back to being pretentious did Chris Rock actually expose some reality did he make fun of something no we have no room for that here we're helping the world by providing the Arts you fucking twat I want to punch you right in your stupid face he plays like tough guys in movies we fucking like this movie's pretty good it plays a Mickey Cohen in this this new fun movie it looks like horse shit Sean Penn's very good at that but most likely he's good at that because he's fucking crazy which is why you had a explain a joke during the Academy Awards when a fucking brilliant world-renowned stand-up comedian as the host the award holy shit to do a comedian make a joke oh no stop let me explain what's great amazing yeah I think in the same Academy Awards it was when Chris Rock was talking about 50 cent and said this guy's dealt with everything he took more gun shots to the face than jenna jameson and they were both in the audience nobody got up and defended jenna jameson I was very offended you're allowed you're allowed to say that yeah you're allowed to say that but that's a free target yeah make fun of Jude lock he's a brilliant actor said she's protruded laws and a lot of films cuz he's a brilliant actor I just wanted to say I just wanted a straight everybody out I wanted to exercise my ego about some shit that happened earlier that I thought was unjust are you making fun of Jude Law during our special day when we were monkey suits you fuck toke you like this one hand Hey are you gonna do you do the son of a woman like Ranger choke yeah I wouldn't even use my elbow I won't even have like a little rat hold on tight shut it just pretentiousness is really intolerable and it shouldn't be tolerated in your friends and it shouldn't be tolerated in celebrities either that's nonsense that kind of stuff is nonsense you're talking about acting cunt face okay you're not saving the world you're not time-traveling you didn't invent a nuclear weapon okay you and you develop faster than internet either and it's not like you came up with 5g you pretended to be a gangster in a movie and you're good at it thank you however it did entertain me distracting me for an hour and a half because that's all the fuck you did okay you made me sit down and I enjoyed your performance and it made me not think about my life and I got some thrills out of it it was very exciting and enjoyable to follow along that's it that's all you did okay you didn't fucking change the world you're not awesome your guys get it pretending fuckheads drives me nuts it tries to be nuts and that is the one thing that I hate about this town and you know and being a person who lives in two very real worlds the world of fighting and the world of stand-up comedy being a cage fighting commentator I see the realest of the real shit human character exposed people cracking under pressure people rise in the occasion I see the realest of the real shit and then comedy nobody laughs says you're not funny okay if your point doesn't work they don't accept it into their mind it has to really work and you have to be in that moment you can't think about something that's completely opposite and say something funny and have it be funny because it won't work there's something weird going on it's not just the words coming out of your mouth it's you thinking about those words as they come out of your mouth and people recognizing that you're in the moment which makes it funny those are two very real things so when I see someone like pretentious and someone just someone who's like taking themselves way too fucking seriously or wants a lot of accolades and respect to something that's basically just that's what you're that's what you do man you're really good at that this guy's really good at fixing people's eyes this guy's really good at driving cars you don't be an asshole it's really simple don't take yourself too fucking seriously because you don't deserve any extra appreciation you don't deserve any extra respect you don't deserve any extra attention you deserve exactly what the fuck you've already gotten and you should be super duper thankful for that and any time you want more than what you're getting you're a cunt it's that simple if you demand respect you're a you're a cunt you're simply a cunt it's your problem you're you're imbalanced you need to take a yoga class you need to go on a mushroom trip go to Peru take some ayahuasca do something but stop it's 2015 13 oui have no time for you anymore I have no time this time there's so many so what it's rats what that's in a fucking sewer goddammit
