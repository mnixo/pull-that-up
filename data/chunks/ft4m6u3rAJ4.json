[Music] I get I get heavy you know I'm gonna talk about life and death you can talk about life now that is what we're doing we're living and some people are dying that's life and death we're all what's really interesting is that we're all gonna die yes and and that everybody pushes away mm-hmm and I guess that's normal to push away you know thoughts of your death but the real enlightened like the Buddhist I'm into Buddhism Eastern Eastern and stuff they say it's a way to get enlightened is to die if you can check this out is to die before you die meaning completely kind of go into the fear and they claim that the fear is releasing ego which what they mean by ego is like like you have this beautiful studio and you have a career and a wife and a kid kids I guess and and it's like letting it's like you can't be attached to it you have to die to that like in other words you don't own your wife you don't own anything really because we're just the bottom line of it is is we are temporary yes and impermanent and it doesn't mean you can't enjoy you know like you're in the prime of your life right so why think about your fucking death hmm you know what I mean but I think for guys like me I'm a little older and like for some reason we're on right yeah for some reason I experienced panic attacks um and I had a full-blown one coming up here why are you driving Wow I was driving I know we don't feel like okay this is what it feels like is I'm feeling kind of tired I've been doing a lot and that's not to brag I I've in your business what you're in shows but show business Abbot show business you doing a lot of work I'm in show business I'm married I have two dogs I have three cats it's a it's like manage the dogs are intense you know because you laughs I love your dog I have dogs two of three you have three yeah okay but for me and this is I think one of my you one of the you know why I'm a panic attack sufferer occasionally is that I get into these dogs like I I think a side of someone who has panic attacks is someone who cares too much about taking care of things instead of trusting then three things gonna be all right like I didn't get up I'm gonna feed the dogs the dogs will be okay I'm always like doing stuff like hey my dog's names of Charlotte and basil Charlotte does she have something in a rye the Charlotte of something and all right and I kind of blow it up a little you know what I mean instead of chilling and going oh she'll be okay let me just let me just you know wipe the I'll see her like scratching at the eye a little and it can set me off into this worry and I think that's kind of the symptom of Pat attacks like I'm coming up here so I get on the 101 people who don't know the 101 well you should just kill yourself because the 101 is a main artery and you should know about it what if they don't drive this thing other things to worry about I think they're brilliant if they don't drive but anyway it it was packed it was it you know the Google Maps was like accidents up ahead and I started to feel this kind of feeling trapped have you ever felt trapped yes on the highway where oh and and and for some reason I think because I'm overtired and I wanted to get here this first time I've done your podcast I just started feeling an anxiety about and this is what happened I mean I'm doing it physically I'll start feeling I'm gonna be late the war all start closing in yes man yes maybe that's the real scary thing is the breath right like oh it's like I'm missing I'm doing in the car and by the way the one thing I hate about le I don't know about you but like here we are in December 28th and it's hot yeah it's very warm it's like 75 degrees it's like 80 and the Sun is blaring it through by side window and I'm feeling a little fuck there's nowhere I just nowhere I can't get off I can't you know what I mean it's it's so it's a buildup of anxiety instead of just going you know what let your shirt let that shit go let that shit go I I I couldn't I couldn't let it go like when I get entangled in it when it reaches a tipping point right you know when when the anxiety reaches a tipping point where you know I I am like Oh God like like here's the voice in my head that I have to always battle it's like oh god this isn't gonna work out instead of hey you know for some reason I have the Oh God okay but you intellectualize it right like like now like we're talking about it but now the lies now it's after it's over you realize like I I should just say hey let that shit go like you without any stake in the game right you removed if you were giving yourself advice in that car you'd be like come on everything's great you're living in America here is a few extra people on the road some of them bumped into each other let's just get through this you know you text me he's no problem come little later it's no big deal we'll start a little later it's casual right there's no reason to get anxious about that right you don't smoke pot did I would understand more because people that eat edibles and then get on the 101 and get stuck in traffic and then what happens here's your whole world starts closing in on you yeah it's the same kind of thing it's uh I think one of the things that I've noticed a lot is a lot of people that have anxiety and a lot of people that they're generally they're intelligent people and the problem is with intelligent people is that you're overwhelmed with possibilities you're thinking about all the actual variables that are in play whereas dumb people just fucking stumble into walls where they're talking on their phone and you know they like texting and walking out into traffic they're not thinking you know and somehow they get things work out for them it doesn't snow fusion you're not living in their skin if you were inside their 9-volt battery brain you'd be like oh god this is fucking nothing to think about here like was Jamie with you with me with Tony we were at the airport and there's this girl I hat next to her just to listen to her conversation I think it was Tony and she was just talking about Amazing Race and I wanted this team to win and I can't wait until this happens and when I get paid on Friday I'm gonna buy this phone and then there's this this is food I really want to eat and it was just this droning I'm like this might you might as well be a meat robot that just sent here to consume there's no like yeah there's no there's no curiosity or creativity it was just consumption it was just food and buy this and watch that and and drone on and on and on and who knows if it's genetics if it's nature if it's nurture or whatever it is there's a lot of really dull folks out there and we're not supposed to there's a lot of really dull folks but the culture is also geared to consumption I mean a lot of it isn't it it's like it's like you turn on the fucking TV and that is the message sent it's not our culture that's is our culture it's a part of our culture but our culture is pretty vast now I would I would say that one much more of our culture's the Internet much more than light on mainstream media now that's like the reasons why they're grasping at straws trying to stay relevant what the mainstreaming yeah I just that's a like television shows there they're downed record numbers like news is down right I see about that yeah I mean I think it the idea that these it's great if someone is like you know New York Times Time magazine respected journalism someone who that you can go to what you really want to know what the fuck is happening in Syria I need to know I need to know from someone's going to give me an objective informed opinion that's that's huge and it's very critical but once you get past that you're doing a lot of the shows you're dealing with it whether it's CNN or any leads as Fox News you're dealing with opinions and your opinion is just as valid as Shepard Smith's like why is Shepard Smith because he has makeup on and he's wearing a tie and they have ready-set-go and they press the green light and what you're talking about is really interesting how how because it's just on TV because it's sanctioned yes sanctioned sanctioned by the powers that be like like it's really about ownership yeah like like I don't even know who owns CNN anymore so was it Ted Turner yeah yeah he's hashtag ballin is right I think so I mean he's like one of the biggest landowners in United States yeah there's millions of acres yes he owns Buffalo yes he's got restaurants where he serves Buffalo unbelievable hashtag bowling is that Montana I think it's called Montana yeah it's in Montana right they have them in Colorado they might have been Montana as well I think it's actually a chain know know where they are but it supposed to be very good restaurants but what at what my point was is that the structure at CNN says well we're gonna talk about this we're gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about that we're gonna put it on TV and people watch the fuckin you know you have to break it down to the essentials like there is a screen it's being transmitted into your into your home it's me and it's it's very much it's very much with people not realizing it a complete fucking mind-control thing like or it really influences you and it takes a lot to kind of disconnect and and for instance I have said to myself I am gonna disconnect from fucking the grid for a while you ever try to do that like I'm not gonna go online I'm not gonna watch TV like you know TV but it's it's really kind of very difficult when I go somewhere why I go hunting that's what I do I go to the woods for like a week and I have no choice can't get cell phone signal can you no internet connection do you feel rejuvenated well it feels good it feels good to take breaks you know I enjoy the Internet I enjoy the information but it's overwhelming and one of the reasons why it's overwhelming is we're not it's we're not really accustomed to this experience this is a very new experience for human beings like over the last you know 20 years we've these actions yeah it's a little bit more 2000 or I think 94 ish yeah he came over 94 is when I got online don't you sink and I really want to relate this again just like kind of a panic attack I go but up here it's in because this is it's another form of of the anxiety is that it's information over overload 100% yeah yeah because my brain my brain I think your brain is the same way it's like my brain I feel my brain just digging into shit like oh you know like I'll read a paragraph on I don't fucking know hunting and then you know it'll mention something about guns and then I go to guns and then I go to gun control like let go I go and then I go to the scumbags who don't want gun control and then I go to a school shooting like like one thing leads to another on me into that rabbit holes rabbit holes yeah you go down that rabbit hole I was I want to do more of this on stage but like talking to an audience about hey I've only done it once and it went over care okay but it was like hey you ever get you ever going off on Facebook and you just start reading a fee you just start reading your feed and you just get drawn into like people's random thoughts you start connecting yeah into their brains and you're like oh I get that and then where you go wrong as there's 262 comments oh and you read the comments and you there feeds you we know but after you fucking let's say 30 comments in yeah something happens to your fucking Center like your brain just kinda is free-forming it about I forget what what what um what I was Rio I was reading this was a this was some thread somebody started this guy said improv comedy improv isn't bullshit it's half-assed it's um it's you know amateurish it's like they're presenting a product that hasn't been chiseled and worked out whereas stand up he was he was a proponent of stand up and he said stand up you know it's it's chiseled and what people want is a finished product and I you know I I kind of I disagreed I mean I love different things at different things so it's like some people enjoy jazz yes right that's what I love yeah they some people enjoy symphonies some people like to go to see an orchestra they want to see everything that's been perfectly tuned and and just gotten to this point of perfection where they where's great right right - it's all look and you great to watch someone's finished set yeah I loved watching your thing about how America is now a whore and we're driving with Trump like you did that yeah I think we told my bit up but yeah okay to my bit in the fucked up it's no but but here's the thing is that you get sucked in because the way the guy on the internet and this is what happens on the internet a lot the way the guy who said improv socks that's how he framed it this sucks this is good right and then it's a thing then then your then your ego gets involved like I think I even no I didn't engage in that one which is really good here's the thing he's right to him yeah him he's right it's just he phrased it wrong if he said the wet what I like is stand-up right like a polished product I don't like improv because it feels amateurish to me and people could say I disagree I love improv because it's why I like that feeling of being in the audience where someone yells out you know genre World War two films and you know that they're there scrambling and they fucking try to pretend they're into the yeah in the what's that called the tunnels looking for don't wash trenches oh I love trenches i-i-i build trenches and i have mustard gas at home it's great coupon mustard gas Grey Poupon mustard gas I think that there's nothing wrong with having opinions on things but people don't like that your opinions are different than theirs and they get mad at ya like some people get mad at you if you like a certain kind of music that's crazy but they'll get mad like your taste sucks your tasty music sucks but here's the thing what we're talking about is that that's what's going on a lot on the Internet yeah you suck you suck you suck you're wrong you're wrong definitely wrong and and I think it's really reached a fucking heightened state because of the politics yeah in the country like in other words it it filters down insults people constantly that's all he does yeah that's all he's a divisive I mean this is not new but that's how he he operates he's very manipulative in the fact that absolutely he's very praising of some people you know like doing an amazing job beautiful job like the other day he was talking about these firefighters and he had all these firefighters behind him and he was talking about what a great job they're doing as firefighters and it's just like this weird speech and I'm gonna go see each other on TV and like you know I don't think they get enough credit and like bestow it's a very interesting method course he's gonna bestow praise on the firefighters do you would say that right but only if it's convenient for him like about John McCain who was a fucking war hero he was like I like people who don't get captured like Jesus Christ like he had like six deferments like you know I had a hangnail like Oh can't go to war oh he had a gang of deferments and meanwhile he's saying something about John fucking McCain who's a legitimate war hero who was captured and tortured by the Vietcong and he had the balls to say I like people that have been I mean that's the question acting the military at all nobody here's a question how's he get away with that shit just does his justice who he is it's like if you like if you know someone's a scumbag like then the scumbag behavior is like wow that's five Tim that's Mike that's what he does right but if mike is a priest and it turns out and what Mike really likes doing is smoking crack and blowing guys you know you find out you're like oh Jesus Mike I thought you were this other thing but if mike is Andy Dick you found out Andy Dick's out there smoking crack and blowing guy's like Oh Andy yeah it's like it's Trump is Andy Dick he's that's his thing is you come after him he comes after you and we just sort of assumed that once he became president he would stop doing that he would act hashtag presidential he's not at all no he can't help himself making it all about himself and it's interesting back to the internet shit and what is going on you know just for instance taking that example of improv sucks stand-up is the best right it is the guy who wrote improv sucks the guy you know then the guy who started the thread it's like it's like what they're doing and what Trump is doing it's like this shit is all about what I think and I know you're gonna come at me but that's what I want hmm I want you know the attention I mean I really think it comes down to I want to fight I want to fight you know I want an ego fight I want to fight and I want the attention there's certainly a little bit of that but I also think he wants repercussions for challenging him he wants people to feel he wants to punish him yeah he wants people to feel very um Wolffe to challenge him I think that's a big part of his game you know and he wants everyone to know that he's gonna come after you like as the president he's gonna come after you and if he does all the Trumpkin czar gonna come after you too cuz if he comes after you then all these these puppets these people that follow him that literally are on there all day long like you really have to realize that some of the people that are online that are tweeting for Trump or tweeting about certain things whether it's on their all day follow people just to see how crazy they are just to get it in my head like oh okay I see what you do you do this all day you you start tweeting at 7:30 in the morning with your first cup of coffee you're hurling insults and you do it til one o'clock in the morning and then you start all over again in the morning how do they do that because they're Craig go insane I find I don't know about you but if I spend an hour on that kind of rabbit hole mmm with Twitter or Facebook my limit I think is about an hour before I it just something says to me I need to what I need to get out I need to walk I need to do do something I need to get away you know what I think is happening and this I've been thinking about this a lot over the last week I think humanity is in the process of an overwhelming transformation that's something like giving birth I agree and I think that like if you've watched someone give birth like the crazy thing is how much pain the women are in like when I watch my daughter come out of my wife I was like whoa that's a lot of work like it's fucking painful and it's crazy and you're talking about yeah blood and this just it's not even it's my present at a birth it's like this it's like but then BOOM did you film it most unbelievable love comes out of it yes I did but the most unbelievable love comes out of it and then it's like oh my god the way you feel is incredible and it's like I think there's a you got to go through hell to figure out how to how to handle this better and I think culturally we're going through a weird kind of hell and this kind of helps it's avoidable look you could just put that phone down and you could just go hiking go with a good friend bring your dog go have a nice day sit up there you know crack open a cold glass of water and look over at the landscape and go man it's fucking beautiful and it does something to you and you look at beautiful things right you can do that but you might want to just check your Twitter core real quick see if anybody respond to that real witty post that you left there I get he likes oh fuck you I didn't say that that's not what I meant and then he and then you start burn the wheels start turning exactly you know they did a study I don't know if he heard about this one that just turning off the phone like if you have the phone in the room with you and you turn it off you think okay the phone's turned off I'm cool what the scientists said it was a study I'm not sure where the study was but they said no no you have to put the fucking phone out of into another room hmm they said something about some wants to call you what if you get a text what if someone says you know when it's off but if there's a cool Instagram post you miss absolutely I think there's all the chaos that's going on the world now a really thing that we're in this unbelievably tumultuous time in human history where we're not designed to have access to information 24/7 like we do it's all about information it's connection and information those two things those two things are critical it's all about information but I think even more like insidious is the way the information is given like here you got our president just been basically like a prick mm-hmm the way he fucking disseminates this yeah but he takes pride in it right that's like part of who he is I should say it's bully not regular guy see what if you're a regular guy and you're a media figure like some you know fucking who's the guy from American Idol what's that guy's name that mean guy I'm in consignment that guy yeah like he's a dick you know everybody knows he's a dick like that's his brand yeah that was Trump's brand you're fired that was his brand yeah so it's reinforced with public acceptance it was reinforced with the tension it was reinforced with like he knew that that is what got him the credit that he's so gravely desired and so then that allowed him to run for president right he runs for president yeah coming off of a reality show they canceled his fucking reality show while he was running for president hey I thought Schwarzenegger took it over no they cancelled it because he was the prep because he was running for president saying things about Mexicans then Schwarzenegger took it over but his they fired him I should say instead okay but they fired him NBC fired him from the show because the things that he was saying about Mexicans that's really where it all came from he was a fuckin literally an on TV reality star on a shitty game show and then from there goes on to be President so that style of cop he's not gonna like have this moment of reflection at seventy years old where he realizes this has all been a terrible like I have this amazing responsibility now I'm in charge of the greatest nuclear he would yeah you think you would but why would he cuz he's just a person I think you have these narratives in our head these people become like heroes that a president is something different than a person yeah well I would just think too that if that yeah I get who he is but it's like god dammit don't you get also influenced informed by that by that weight of the job like yes you you do have and this is the scary part you do have a nuclear arsenal at your disposal and it is fucking dangerous because you know you're dealing with another fucking lunatic yeah you know what I mean crazy yeah yeah I mean they found each other yeah you know what I mean I mean it's kind of a love story yeah well in a way there's an argument and this is the argument that a guy like Trump is actually good in this situation because a guy who is too diplomatic and it would allow this guy to develop real long-range nuclear capabilities that it would be extremely dangerous and that with a guy who is harassing him and fucking with him like the way Trump does and then you allowed the military to do something to stop this guy from developing these long-range nuclear capabilities that this would be better than having some very wishy-washy president who put put severe restrictions in the military and didn't allow them to stop this guy we would all like to think that the world is like we are here you know we are here in the United States for the most part pretty safe not a bad place to be you know most neighborhoods you know even even in bad neighborhoods most of the time it's not that bad occasionally bad shit happens regularly bad shit happens but not like it happens in the Congo you know not like it happens in Syria right now now like Aleppo not like all these other other parts of the world that are in constant turmoil Libya go to Libya right now it's fuckin Kay it's a failed state it's an Isis hotbed right there's parts of the world that are just fucked and if you're not the kind of person that is willing to do something to protect the rest of the people from getting involved in the kind of chaos it's in those parts of the world that stuff can leak over bad people can come in to your neck of the woods and start treating where you live exactly how they treat Syria exactly how they treat the Congo exactly it's totally possible oohed Lee but I'm a believer that if this bad stuff and it is what you're talking about what youyou mentioned is horrific stuff like if you go in I mean Aleppo if you've seen pictures of it it's it literally is a wasteland now that's been a lot of bombed out you know and the suffering that those people have endured and the amount of refugees in the world has gone up and up in them to me I don't think you can isolate that I really don't I I think that has to come back to roost in some ways and it does I mean it's kind of random incidence of terrorism in other words what I'm saying is that we have to have more of a like unified worldview light like yes seriously have a compassion for it I mean I know this guy no I know we Shane do but but for everybody like like oh no fuck fuck Syria Libya Iraq you know they're bad people because if the world is kind of a small place especially with technology these days you know and if if there are thousands and thousands of refugees because of bombings you know people they seek revenge they see they grow up in hate they grow up of course what are you saying I'm saying that I I'm saying that that does affect us like you you originally said well we live in a nice place where it is kind of basically okay and I say that I don't know how long that can exist with all of the term what I'm saying is if you're living in the United States and you're living in a fairly peaceful place you have to take any consideration that there are people out there like Kim jong-un who do regularly kill their citizens who regularly kills people who are insubordinate who regularly kills anyone who thinks who would challenge him in any way and then he has nuclear powers and he is going to do something and it's entirely possible that he could launch a missile its entire he's so fucking crazy it's entirely possible that he could do it in some sort of a suicide mission and then he could launch a nuclear strike on the United States in a suicide mission if he gets the capabilities some people it really depends entirely on how that's managed but there are people that would manage that incorrectly and he could get to the point where he has those nuclear capabilities and he could launch and he could do something that has to be taken into consideration we've done it we did it to Hiroshima we did it to Nagasaki we we literally dropped indiscriminant bombs on entire cities so that's unbelievable crazy and it just happened just happened hundreds ago not even right isn't it interesting how how most people don't have a sense of time in history 80 fuckin years is nothing that's nothing nothing that's nothing but the modern day person is like you know what a long time is 45 minutes ago on my Twitter feed yeah like that's 45 minutes ago that no one gives you an article they send you an article like bro it's from 2013 just like whoa that's four years ago is nothing I get caught up in that shit like like I love do you know what I love watching documentaries is because it reminds me holy fuck yes a lot of the same shit went down in 1960 you know what I made sure yeah like demonstrations you know Nixon was in power we had Vietnam going on you know what I mean I think there's always been a problem with people feeling like they're represented and communication those those two problems have always existed it just they exist today in a different way almost we almost have like too much communication well that's what I mean too much information a little bit yeah for sure and I think you're definitely right that we have to think of the whole world as being like one thing instead of like walling things off and but the problem is when you drop a little over yes but yeah you get like scared sometimes fuck but you have some was a military dictator like kim jeong-hoon that's a totally different situation like he won't let the people live he shoots them when they try to leave like this is this is a very very bad thing to be seeing in 2017 that's entirely different than someone who's a Syrian refugee who you know those those people are fleeing for their lives and obviously they're incredibly hostile environments and situations but there are substantial parts of the world that welcome those people and want those people to to have an opportunity to get away from what they're experiencing you know there's a lot of people in this country that argue for bringing them over here and helping those people so I think our compassion is still there but people don't want to be unsafe themselves you know I think we yeah I think we will eventually these boundaries will become more and more preposterous these lines in the ground that we've drawn we've decide like this is you know we are Canada and we are against you America and you're connected to us by the same dirt like we were tribes and the tribes it with tribe earth okay you know and I think once we realize that we'll be a lot better off but then we're gonna have to really understand the allocation of resources yes yes are you talking about also distribution of wealth which is kind of another way to put allocation and resources well your I'm talking about fixing places where there's no hope you know I mean it's you could say that its allocation of wealth like one of the things we think about like when like Halliburton got these no-bid deals to go into Iraq and build these things and why can't someone get the same sort of contracts to go in and established established places like in the United States like established community centers in impoverished neighborhoods do the same thing to Guadalajara go into Tijuana and try to like set here's the answer I think I mean this is my like trip not trip but like my bent is like there is just like what you're talking about community building you know going into places setting up education centers it doesn't seem to be a priority when it's not profitable yes right but war war yeah is a huge profitable business rebuilding is profitable so Halliburton is rebuilding that rebuilding is problem what do you need to rebuild you need to fucking knock it down first right and that that's weird right things are already knocked down but rebuilding them is not profitable what do you mean oo what parts of the world are already fucked but going in them and rebuilding you know going to impoverished parts of Ecuador and and rebuilding that and try to you know make it so that these people have opportunities to advance their lives and take care of their families and there's no money in that why isn't there money of that I don't know what's weird that we you know that everything is about where there's money you know and that like look at how much the that's the problem look at China right look at how much there they're their way of life has improved since capitalism sort of been installed like the amount of people that are in poverty in China is just reading this and IV the staggering change since what's close to capitalism I mean it's capitalism but they have a lot more restrictions on what they're allowed to do and not do you know in China they still can't research Tiananmen Square research it what happened out about yeah that's crazy that's crazy and I feel like when you do that to people you know if you say to people look you can't you can't look into that isn't there immediately like I don't trust you like its immediate trader ship yeah and that's that's what that's the crazy thing about kim jeong-hoon that's the crazy thing about China anytime you're in a situation where you have a dictatorship you you have a group or a person who's controlling the information that gets distributed to the people and then the people who are under the thumb of this person and then when this person says something that thing is the law that is one of the scariest things about Trump is that what essentially Trump is doing is is treating his word as law yeah and saying that everyone else is fake news and they're all liars and everyone who opposes him they cannot have a reasonable opposition of him any opposition must be chastised if he wasn't within at our system he'd be a fucking dick I mean he is that personality yeah yeah well you know it's he's in this this thing with the FBI you know about this right they're investigating him yeah okay the night room where it's at he's talking about fire heed fuck and Muller yeah look he's talking about him still I'm not sure I think he knows and and the people around him know that dude you cannot do that because I think that wool I think you're gonna fuck with the wrong people they're like you still could fuck with the world people within this country well he's already fuck with the wrong people he's fuck with the intelligence community means fuck with the CIA and the FBI and they're all like Jesus Christ this guy but here's the thing ideas for him it's it it certainly but the not as dangerous it was in the 60s it's harder to kill a president today but the FBI it's just stopped a terrorist attack in San Francisco they stuff yes you don't hear about it because the president hasn't talked about it the news had talked about it a little what happened there was a planned Isis terror attack at one of the piers in San Francisco and this guy who is a former soldier was planning it and reached out to Isis and was trying to do a former US soldier soldier look at that yeah well you know you get crazy on all sides but that's what I mean about you know when there is bad conditions all over the world it filters and that's one way you know yeah but this is a guy who was an American citizen that wanted to attack random American civilians you know this is a crazy person it's a person who'd blown a fuse and was just gonna do this for Isis and was doing it publicly on Facebook was was reaching out to these people so he was he had a blown fuse for sure he didn't understand what he was doing or understand that obviously people gonna be paying attention to these fucking Isis pages is it a wild that people publicly put this shit out on Facebook it's while but it's not wild I mean people were there's a lot of dull Minds out there but anyway the point is that the FBI warded this attack president hasn't said a goddamn worried about it he's praising these firefighters yeah doing an amazing job amazing job but he's not saying anything I wonder if because I wonder if it's because he wants everybody to think hey look there's no there's no terrorists or activity going on and no he doesn't want to praise the FBI well that's that's fucked up I think that's exactly what it is I think yes against investigated yeah because he has a vendetta against the FBI he's at war with the FBI it's crazy that's great this is a crazy situation where someone of this mindset is running the country and some people love it they love it Magga we're gonna get things done look at the joblessness rate is down unemployment is down there's all this good stuff is happening the stock market is hitting record high what's hilarious about when they talk about the stock market hitting record highs first of all I think it's a fact that 50% a America is in poverty 500 you agree with that stat I don't know so real yeah I mean you could look it up but it's poverty it's it's a certain level of income and I forgot know what it means it's around there and I think they find out I think also it I think it also talks about benefits and there was just an article man at the Washington Post dude about how people in their 70s are having to take full-time jobs because their pensions have been taken away I mean corporate America is taking shit well Jamie was just talking about this yesterday about how like companies are selling you the same product but now it has like a half an ounce less than it used to before and the boxes are slightly smaller and I just bought two boxes of cereal yesterday and they both say they're 12 ounces ones 12 ounces and ones 12.1 ounces but the boxes are not even the close to the same size same cro3 rights checks so it's the same shape cereal and everything let's order that they're lying or do you think that they figured out a way to get 12 ounces of a smaller box cuz you know how you would open up cereal and then they would be like a little airspace and then you can get to the package and then this would be a little air of the packaged cereal might be a bad example but Gatorade for example was a 20 it's 28 ounces now it used to be 32 ounces like three years ago well that's a perfect example of like taking just no no you pay more and get less yeah well they just this it's just a fact infinite growth that paradigm that corporations operate under where you constantly have to improve every quarter you have to make more money you have an obligation to the same it's crazy it's like how come you can't make listen if you make a hundred million dollars in your corporation this year why can't you make a hundred million dollars next year and everybody's happy like yeah I mean isn't that that is it yeah is it that the textbook definition of greed see this three different size cups appear to hold the same amount of soda might be a sponge in the bottom of one of them you can't really tell but he just like I said this guy did this four or five times to sort of prove that there wasn't this is a small medium in like super large size Cup when they all was the same amount of liquid huh super strange this is the Oz text explain to yesterday Wow huh see that's a Daily Mail super sketchy is that in England yeah they're super sketchy with you half they're super sketchy yeah I mean yeah there's definitely a problem that we have with the system that's in place in terms of like how corporations get treated as individuals right they're allowed to donate enormous sums of money now and this is this is a fairly recent within the last decade the way that the their structure has changed and then there's also the diffusion of responsibility inside the corporation if you work for a big evil corporation but you're a good guy you're ready Pepitone you're a good guy you waved your neighbor you know you give money to charity but meanwhile you're making toxic sludge that's killing people in the Philippines or wherever the fuck it is you know you know it's in tactical it goes yeah that's how it goes and that's how it goes also to justify this infinite growth idea this corporation keeps growing and keeps growing keeps growing that's why Trump is late they're they're opening up these national monuments for drilling well that's really fucked and you're an outdoors guy I'm scary scary shit it's a really scary shit but not only is it scary it's it's it's it's it's an affront it's like no no I don't take away our fucking land because to me I get talking about you know circling back to the panic I feel like wow these motherfuckers these corporate corporate greed let's call it right and it's rapacious and it's in it's endless they're taking away our places where we get some serenity we're where we fucking connect in nature you know like that the lifeblood of it you know what I mean they want to me and I to me they're taking they want everything bucked up about it it's it's it is Americans land right is the public's land and so if they're gonna go to these areas and extract resources why that should they have those resources why why are we allowing them to take the oil out of these spots why are we allowing them to take the minerals out of these spots like these these these are not there for your disposal is this is American land this is the public's land these corporations that want to come in and start drilling and mining in these areas it's it's sanctioned stealing and then and then to like jump to an issue one step further what the fuck we're the only country who pulled out of the climate Accord right right wait wait now are you with me that it isn't climate change its climate breakdown that's going on and and and anybody you've had scientists on if they talked of UN environmentalists on you know talking about this shit I mean just here in LA this past summer do you live in the valley - yeah I never experienced like there was 115 for ten days and not 110 for like three days in a row and then it I was stuck to 116 here one day I remember telling my wife hey honey it's only 101 they were beating me down until like sweetie it's kind of nice it's only 103 today right you know what I mean but but but my point is is that they're taking land to do more oil drilling to do fucking fracking do that kind of stuff where the fuck is that why aren't we going completely toward solar when facing shit out especially in California if you you fly over California you see very few clouds and all the rooftops like these rooftops should all be solar panels if they were we would have almost no need for external power it's sunny 24/7 and if it's not today within five years or ten years as the technology improves there would be a way to extract all of our needs from solar power that's I mean that's what I'm saying we should do instead of fucking opening up the problem is like there's so much money in that oil and we still rely on it so heavily right now and they did not they're not thinking about the future they're thinking about right now right now we can get that oh here's the thing they're not thinking about the future do not be a future and I know that's really like like I don't want to be like you know but scientists really well-known scientists are saying you know these hurricanes are the beginning you know the mass of ones we had that buried Euston yeah you know that bury there were a couple that really fucked up and they're gonna be the norm and also the constant heat out here in LA I mean you know what really freaked me out for wildfires in December yeah the big one that's still going on right now haven't even put out in Ventura yeah Jamie was saying yesterday it's not totally contained right it's still in ninety percent so like that fucking crazy it's been going on for weeks at Thomas fire yeah gigantic fire it's I mean it's an enormous fire hundreds of thousands of acres and terrifying by the way the firefighters out here I can't believe what they do animals but you know apparently they have a lot of prisoners that they make fight the fire so I get dollar an hour yeah it's like part of the gig that's fucked up yeah you got to fake your own death oh just run into that fire I think a lot of you have left parking it's fucked up but it's fun Mike Carp can get a fucking dollar an hour for work like why is it okay to like that's slavery it is slavery like if their work like I was used to think that about license plates like that was always the big thing making in Massachusetts there was always a joke that like every two years a new comedian would come up with the same joke because it was so obvious is that New Hampshire license plates say live free or die and I'm like those plates are made by prisoners and that was what was crazy was like that was always the thing so perfect that was always the thing about license plates they were made by prisoners right that was the reference that we would talk now you're gonna go sent upstate and gonna make license plates it was that was what people did but when you make those license plates you're making like 30 cents a day or whatever the fuck you're making well again that gets back to corporate greed like I like I was reading about that stuff like Verizon I don't know there's so many big corporations using yeah to make stuff for them and prisoners also get charged unlike they get charged I don't know where the fuck they come up with the money but they get charged all these shit like if you want to make calls you have to buy your own fucking uniforms it's like yeah well they're being punished I get I get the idea behind it but it isn't punishment you have to be fuckin confined space you know I guess now you have to work well the idea is that someone's profiting from it that's where it gets super squirrely it's like okay I get the fact they're being punished but who's making the money is the money going to the victims of these crimes no okay this is one thing if you made a guy like say if a guy robbed your house right and then he goes to jail and then he makes 30 cents an hour the the state should pay him like what a normal working wage would be like 25 bucks an hour or whatever it is for this job this guy's doing and then you get all the rest absolutely dickheads working for you why he's in the pokey and he's making 30 cents an hour because he broke in your house no no he's working for Verizon yeah that's what's weird he's working for some company that's willing to pay for those services at an exorbitant ly discounted rate yeah no it's not it's all not good Matt and here's the thing you can't keep an eye on all of it you can't keep an eye on what's happening it's accessible and then the private prison structure and then we know what happened with Bernie Sanders his wife is involved in what the college went under because of how is he legit how many vacation homes does he have and then you look at Hillary Clinton wait a minute wait hold on what's his Clinton Foundation how much money she didn't the Pope what she was opposed to gay marriage until 2013 you're you'll be overwhelmed you'll be overwhelmed with all the different people and all the different scandals and all the different possibilities and you're in your car and you're on the 101 and you're freaking the fuck out Eddie Pepitone that's what it is well that's why you have to go into nature yeah you know you have to go into nature kind of disconnect man that the Native American Indians knew how to do that yeah they knew how to do it but that's all they had they didn't have like cell phones it's not like they made a choice you know it was interesting are you taking that that shit away from them by saying that no I Sebastian Junger on the the podcast he's an author brilliant guy and one of the things that he was saying was that during the Revolutionary War or I'm sorry during the the time of colonization where the Europeans are moving across America some of them were kidnapped by these Native American tribes and then when they were rescued by the soldiers they resisted a lot of them wanted to stay of the Native American and some of a lot of them moved in with the tribes like some people like voluntarily moved into tribes what does that tell you but this is what he said no one did it the other way the Native Americans did not join the Western civilization they didn't like they were only forcible did they join the cities and move into these towns they wanted to be with Native Americans well they wanted to live the natural way the way they have been living forever by the way their system is attuned to yeah do you feel it because I originally started started this off with talking about anxiety and as we've been talking I think the one of the biggest causes of anxiety is disconnection yeah disconnection from mother earth disconnect disconnection from the heart of life like disconnection I don't know man but but but but and but on on top of that then what's fueling that disconnection is this incredible technology where you're bombarded with information about everything and you're trying to make some fucking sense of it in your brain overloads and then and then the bigger picture almost is that there are people in power and there are people in power I don't know if it's a conspiracy but these people own everything they fucking own just about everything well they're owning more we're we're talking about a bunch of different issues here that if you're putting all these things together trying to put them together I think that what you're saying that about people being disconnected and being overwhelmed by that all that stuff to think about that's real because you're supposed to be thinking about your immediate area and what the threats are in your in vini environment and where your friends are where's the community in our communities I mean they talk about this community's breaking down like like we have a comedy community do you think that's a big thing like our community especially the Comedy Store there's one of the cool things about the comic stores we all go there and we see each other and it's like very very friendly and supportive I think it's huge huge so rare to I mean III I realized that that is what we're talking about like you need you ever have a fucking thing where you're like flipping out about something and then you make one phone call or see one friend and the problem goes away yeah yeah especially if you maybe you and a friend are in some sort of a disagreement and you thought that they thought this thing and they thought that you thought that thing and you get to talk and especially if you meet each other and your friends like no I thought this in your car I thought you thought that like ha and then everybody's happy so you were stressed out freaked out and nervous and feeling weird about talking to that person but then once you talk to him everything smoothed away yeah yeah that's I don't know if people I think when you're doing that online thing and you're spending your day online or even texting like I have all these friend I have text friends and that's you know see them those are weird I have a few of those a lot of East Coast buddies yes so I just text them every couple months we text back and forth it isn't to say it's like there's something missing no but if they call in one answer time for a conversation right now tell me the text I'm in text I'll get back to you but I'm in the middle of doing my ads here and I've got to fucking write this bit and I wrote a fucking go somewhere and I got to work out an hour and but um yeah but III think you know and and we're all busy I get that too but it's like we we we have to find time for the community I'm gonna find time for being a human an actual human human what part of being a human is interacting with other humans we need each other the worst thing they can do to you in prison is put you in solitary guys think of that the worst thing they can do you're you're locked up in a cement cage filled with murderers and rapists and criminals and the worst thing they can do is to leave you alone yeah is it that it's a date the big punishment is not like letting you go out and hang out with all the guys in the cafeteria no yeah punishment is putting you in a room take your clothes so so just getting back to the technology I think voyeurism is fucking killing people we've become like this nation of lawyers like just like what I was I went to a little birthday party yesterday in a bar it is not to brag and Silver Lake like Canada like bragging about silver like I don't like silver like anyway you don't I'm also that I'm also the guy who like some who makes immediate judgments places without really knowing them I think that's a comic thing to do for sure absolute bullshit oranges suck yeah fuck improv what's wrong with severly no but I just want to talk about voyeurism and technology so so I was trying to do this thing we were talking about fucking hanging with people right around us in this bar were five fucking television screens yeah and and again it's by anxiety like like my tension in me I wanted to go and go can you please and this is how I would say it - which is I never get anything done I go would you please turn off the fucking televisions by the way didn't you have a fight on they didn't even have a good game on because the games were over something and it was just showing random dumb shit like I don't know one was a reality show where people do weird things you know what I mean and it's around and my vision was drawn to the shit constantly and it was like no man this is the problem this is it was right there instead but if you own a bar and you want people to come in and spend a lot of money you got to give them something to stare at I mean dude there's the problem you got a cute community bar like one of them little pubs in England you know it's been around for a thousand they don't have the TVs right I doubt it I don't know I never been to one but I would assume if there are a thousand years old they don't fucking stick giant flat screens everywhere right but what about if we give it a shot where if I owned a bar in Silver Lake fucking someone said it would be funny if I just had one black and white and I'm just showing old Joe Lewis fights on it like really small absolutely cool yeah Joe Lewis versus who is the guy that he he had these great fights with was it matching yeah yeah max Melling was unfairly thought of as a Nazi who's really just a German you just a German guy who's a boxer who really didn't want to represent Hitler apparently from what I've read yeah it was he the big rival of Lois Whitney had these incredible he stopped Lewis in the first fight and then Louis destroyed him in the second fight yeah and the big thing about him beating Lewis was that he beat Louis and Louis was did he stop Louis hmm did you think he did and Louis hardly ever law I mean did he lose won two fights was that he lose it lasts quite a few when he got older in his career I lost to Rocky Marciano by brutal knockout and ooh but that was he was quite a bit older I think he was in his 40s at the time but I think when he had the rematch I think I think max Melling might have ko to him and then when he had the rematch he destroyed Max Schmeling here it is lost by KO yeah yeah mmm does it say what round twelve out of nineteen twelve 36 yeah and then he came back spare was another guy yeah he came back and he was a giant hero when he knocked out Schmeling in the first round scroll up all the way how many years later was that 38 yeah you remembered first round yeah all he smashed him yeah I mean that was when Joe Lewis was Joe Lewis I mean that was when he had really come into his own and then he went on this incredible tear they used to call it the bum of the month club because he was just locked knocking out anybody was willing to get in there with him yeah he bought some legit guys and Billy Conn fought him a couple of times who was actually a line yeah yeah buddy bear was that max bears it says disqualified do you see that forty nine and one I don't know what happened there I would if that's a relation to max bear probably the 1930s must have been he imagined going back to the 30s and 40s so look at this he was the champ all the way up to Ezzard Charles in 1950 think of that and he started in 36 yeah so the fight with the first fight with Max Baer was 36 with Max Schmeling rather was 30 all right there yeah so he rematched him in 38 the first fight was in 36 took to you and he was all the way the fuck scroll all the way up to the top by the time he lost he lost to Jersey Joe Walcott a unanimous decision in 1950 that's incredible that's 14 years later Wow fuckin crane Oh his first loss was Charles sorry yeah he came out Jersey Joe Walcott by the way look at that you know Yankee Stadium was the venue for Les Chicago Stadium I think these were huge events yeah you know when a bunch of fights after that you lost the unanimous decision scroll all the way up and then lost again to Rocky Marciano so you really only lost three times it looks like three believable three big ones in the later stages of his career unless he lost earlier what's his overall record it was 66 and 3 according to that yeah so three losses so one max Mayer the brutal one to Rocky Marciano which ended his career did you see that where else the brutal one yeah you wanna watch it I I love I love I grew up watching boxing did you yep and it wasn't pay-per-view it was ABC 59 yeah it was like it was like Network yeah I got back then and I there was something it wasn't pay-per-view and they were free TV and I really got into the sport like I was like I would be like so psyched to see this shit yeah I'd be like I would watch you you remember a guy named Oscar Bona Bona Bona via yeah yeah yeah he was like a broad he was just like this kind of wild brawler but it was a big guy and he'd fight guys like I don't know if he changed his name yet Cassius Clay oh what's this this is Jersey this is a as a Charles right is that as a Charles oh yeah that's the loss but that's not the one we want to see we want to see the Rocky Marciano one this is the one where Ezzard Charles the first got to beat him and he beat him by unanimous decision but look first of all look how much smaller people were back then like Rocky Marciano when he won the heavyweight title was 15 pounds lighter than me he said right yeah think of that and I think he was only 510 and that might have been bullshit you know like people are a little sketchy about how tall they were like that you know yeah they would try to find that Rocky Marciano won this um yeah I mean I believe at the time I think when he was the champ he was 185 pounds maybe one night and the Marciano was known like like Marciano was known for like just having unbelievable strength and his punches like just fucking is this yeah that's that's what do you want he was like is this is this it yeah this would think of an immigrant rock town brawl like he was from Massachusetts yeah Brockton is that him mask he looks small yeah yeah he's 15 pounds lighter than me man Louis's a lot Louis isn't even that big Lewis is probably 200 pounds back then that was a heavy weight back then it's just a different world people didn't have that kind of food they didn't have enough to eat they didn't have the nutrition knowledge they didn't have steroids and weightlifting I mean they had weightlifting but boxers really didn't engage in that it's very rare they thought it stiffened you up they didn't understand that the stiffening you up is just as you're you know getting sore and that you have to recover from that and that's how you get bigger and stronger like boxers today if you look at like Anthony Joshua who's the heavyweight champion the world now look at him yeah he's a English fellow he's a tank I mean he's a man you look at Anthony Joshua he looks like like a superhero do they do those guys have as much stamina as these guys do without yeah they do yeah because there's conditioning methods that they have today are just so superior they understand rest and recovery and they monitor your heart rate and you know they're they're monitoring lactic acid buildup and creatine in your blood and so the science is really it's it's such a scientific if they engage in that at you know some some people still take it old-school but I just think they know more about what gets you in condition and high intensity you know conditioning drills hi Raja Rocky Marciano had something that you can't teach people which is just brutal strength brutal power he just had the ability to land these bone crushing shots and he also was insanely tough you're dealing with a just a different time with my wife this morning we were talking about old-school keep that going keep that going to see the end it's brutal we're talking about old school cartoons and about her Pinocchio yeah and they are so mean they're so mean and even old school cartoons about Santa and and Christmas elves the elves are all shitty to each other PC though they totally PC down but back then in the 1940s and 50s and these cartoons were originally made the world was a hard place man it was horrible well the talking World War two with World War just over or yeah well here's something that I didn't realize until recently my friend Steve Rinella was actually talking about this on the podcast we talked about factory farming and large-scale agriculture and that stuff by the way when we talk about that the reason why that all got instituted reason why we have those programs set in place in America was because of famine because people were worried about what happened to the Europeans during World War two during World War one and eat World War two it's estimated that millions of people starved to death in the world and in the United States after the war they wanted to do something to make sure that that didn't happen over here and one of the things they did was they started instituting subsidies for farmers to make sure look you're not making enough money but we're gonna give you money just so that we have all this food on reserve so that everyone thinks about it as oh this is this evil thing that the government has done to keep us fat and stupid and no it was an originally put in place to prepare for the worst-case scenario well we're at war again and we're short on food I get it I get the genesis of it but right but now now it sucks yeah yeah now is horrible fucking horrible the worse these animals see that's that's my thing I'm just like you ever watch a fucking I mean I'm I have gone to veganism and I grew up Italian a we ate everything I mean I love sausage I mean I just couldn't imagine it's amazing that I have gone this way and I did it because my wife got me into it big animal rights activists and just watching some fucking slaughterhouse videos and seeing the fear I mean to me animals are the most powerless because they don't have any choice in this shit you know you and beans who have fucking horrible license at least some fucking element of choice and free will I'm also just it's just like especially factory farmed animals right ah dude I mean they're just trapped so I do it you know yeah I have been for I have been for I would say it took a while to like not like slip I would say pretty solidly for three years four years um and how do you get your health monitor do you get your blood levels child I miss you I do my sugars are a little high because what happens for me and and this could just be fuckin willpower I I don't know but oh we just knocked down hit him with a left hook dropped him and this is you know an older Joe Lewis how old was Joe Lewis at the time of this young Jamie did say and rock and Marciano how old was Marciano he was as prime I think Marciano was 30 or something it's a lot smaller than him to say no he was older yeah 1951 he got knocked out by Marciano that's crazy god I love Braddock I love that Cinderella story you see that so crow is like fuck good great yeah but anyway so too much carbs yes yeah yes I do you know I do carbs are terrible for you man little do you in more than anything what about eggs well that's not vegan yeah but why go vegan when eggs don't harm anything if you get like I have chickens if free-range chicken yeah man they they just run around you feed them they have a good old time then you eat their eggs like nobody gets hurt the eggs are not viable because there's no rooster right so you're not taking away a life this is just something that the the chickens almost like oh no they're just eggs no they're only an embryo if it's on if it's pregnant so it has to get fucked by a rooster if there's no rooster they just lay eggs oh no funny that no most people didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know that until I got chickens I kind of intellectualized it but then I was oh yeah yeah there's no rooster how could they of course it's not like the chickens can just lay eggs and those eggs can become new chickens no that already happens if a register gets in the henhouse so I guess I guess the answer to that I guess the answer to that would be the way they house the fucking chickens to make we don't need to get them that way you can get free range I mean there's there's places that you can get legitimate intimate free right I might even visit the farms you know there's a guy that we had on the podcast what does that gentleman's name that runs Polyface farms Joel yeah Joel Salatin I've heard of that name really like he's a real humane yes and he heard of him I think it was in a movie called forks over knives maybe I don't know maybe that movie is very deceptive that movies filled with a lot of bullshit folks overnight yes yes what's it you vegan propaganda movie and they're the same guys that did the most recent one which is uh what the health yeah it's widely torn apart by actual scientists to understand human nutrition oh yeah yes yes real problems like meat does not cause diabetes there's zero evidence that it does when diabetes is caused by sugar and by complex carbohydrates or excuse me by refined carbohydrates this and not processed all diabetes right obviously there's genetic diet right what about the connection between meat and heart disease yes here's a connection when you say yeah people who eat meat are more likely to have heart attacks right you don't saying what they eat the meat with are they eating a piece of grass-fed steak or they eating a shitty cheeseburger that's get on a bun that's filled with sugar with fries and they have a syrupy soda with it yeah dr. Rhonda Patrick was on this recently and what she said is there is a direct correlation between consumption of saturated fats along with refined sugar when you have refined sugar and saturated fats it produces a lot of bad cholesterol and this is one of the things that's been proven clinically to lead to heart attacks clinically to lead to you know strokes and hardening of the arteries and yeah it's the big thing is sugar the big thing is sugar and carbohydrates those are the big things and carbs turn into sugar yes what can we do you know your lives I've Oh ground carbs high very little carbs very little very little yeah don't crave them huh no once you get out of it see a lot of is your gut health a lot of it is what's going on inside your stomach yeah what what your stomach is used to eating if you feed your stomach sugar and processed refined carbohydrates all the time that's what you've got in your gut I mean that's the kind of that flora you're you're cultivating yeah yeah and it's gonna that's what leaks delete leads to leaky gut leads to inflammation you know me I want to pick on you but you're a little overweight no no no no this is a lot of it of a pair of solid carbs you know and my trip has been my trip has been that I'm about the animal rights he's what I mean like like I don't I fucking hate the way they are but that's fine but it's good but you can do better for yourself I mean you can live you can live an ethical humane life with no animal products other than like free-range eggs and be okay and just cut all the dairy out cut all the things you had a little scary yeah but I'm so I'm saying to anybody even listening to this you can you can have eggs and you can get plenty of it from there's there's a lot of plant-based protein that's like very rich and and powerful for you and excellent for you hemp based protein spirulina is fantastic for you there's a lot of really good like sources of nutrients but you got to really pay attention to what you're putting in your body if you just eat vegan pizza and vegan cookies all the time you're gonna get genuine oh I know let's go find out all right you're right yeah and I do find myself craving like and maybe that's because I put it in you know the fucking oh yeah it's gonna that's mean before I came here I had a fucking you know blueberry bagel great right those carbs if you feel good when they're going in you what I don't think that's what gave you the parent act no no not specifically but I but I think you know if you're feeling kind of shitty in general you're more susceptible to I think you're right for sure yeah if you could just cut out the carbs it's harder on a vegan diet but it's positive right but you got to get a good book on it you got to find out like there's there's really good vegan health books that can show you how to eat in the right way do you go that way at all are you you reject it well it's something I reject it for me I eat wild game almost exclusively wild animals that hunt yeah so I hunt the wild animals and if I shoot an elk I get hundreds of pounds of meat and I eat that all year I have commercial freezers in the back I'll show you after the show I keep meat here I have meat at home I give me to my friends and so my meat that I get is a wild animal that was gonna get eaten by a wolf like if I didn't get it I mean this isn't a factory farmed prisoner that gets like a slaughter this year I got an elk in Utah shot in Utah and I also shot one in California in a place called Tejon ranch is this 270,000 acre ranch in the middle of the country or middle the state rather right but getting it that way to me it feels I went out before I started hunting I decided I was either gonna be a vegan or I was gonna be a hunter I'm like I'm gonna figure interesting what I'm gonna do I didn't want to eat you don't want any harm to take part in that when you when you kill the elk right when you shoot it do you have like like what's the feeling there that must be intense it's very intense there's a moment there's definitely a moment of loss where you feel like you know this animal is it's gone now you know and but there's also a moment of reverence and and but you got to do it sustainably like when I do it I'm doing it in places that have extremely healthy populations you get an animal that's past its breeding prime right you get an animal that's seven eight nine years old where they really don't have much time left you that's that's what you target like people think when you target a trophy animal very you're very specific about you know what you're doing very specific and I'm also specific about making it difficult which is why I do it with a bow and arrow I don't you know I mean I've hunted animals with rifles and I don't think there's anything wrong with it but for me I feel like if I really want to make this a more even arrangement and make it more difficult and make it more ethical I use a bow and arrow yeah but there is that moment like you know you've killed it and then you feel a sense of loss there is a sense of loss it's d yeah that's C that's like you know what we've run across a bunch of L there's one of the things that once you get into the natural world and you really start understanding what's going on out there you realize like this is this no one gets out of this ride alive like this this right like the elk that I killed he had holes all over his body all over his body when we were taking him apart holes everywhere from other elk stabbing him oh that's what you look up there all that shit those those elk antlers oh it's real that's real that's the one that I shot in September okay that those things are designed to kill their elk they / each other they clash and smash those horns together and it's all to fight over breeding and the most powerful ones with the biggest antlers are the ones that get to breed and one of the best ways to ensure the health of this this this group of animals is once this animal has reached its breeding prime that's the one you take out you take out the herd bull it allows the younger bulls to have an opportunity to breed you can spray you actually know Jeanette who is these he's a big dog yeah I see the hurt they called the herd bull had you learned that got obsessed about five and a half years ago I got crazy with it yeah yeah well I got obsessed before actually went hunting but I went hunting in 2012 was the first time I went and then once I did once I did that I was like okay this is what I'm doing now like this makes sense this is and it's difficult so it's a pursuit so my food now isn't just food that I got now there's this like this intense connection with that food nobody's got a fucking connection with therefore those people don't and but the weird thing is everyone did until about a hundred years ago that's what's really crazy this is so new yes oh new yeah go to 1917 everybody had probably seen an animal get killed on a farm on farm yeah I mean everybody was or you were around it it was a normal thing you go with 1817 you couldn't avoid it yeah you go to a marketplace you go to a farmer you go to I mean everybody and then also there was no pesticides the genetic manipulation the food was non-existent it was it was everything was as it is in a natural state or in a cultivated state where you know you're splicing things and doing like normal things if you've we've gone like like my dad's my favorite target topic haven't we gone like just the wrong way well we've definitely gone away you know but that way that we've gone in in the negative ways is terrible but in the positive ways of things like gold and rice that's like allowed thousands if not millions of people to not starve to death because his rice that was infused with protein there's a bunch of different things that we've done to ensure the shelf life of food so get the food to home the hungry people be these foods can last longer like tomatoes they they look kind of fucked up now because they're hard and you know that button these also can stay on the shelves for a lot longer like in this it goes back to what we're talking about like post-world War two people were terrified of scarcity they were terrified of famine and they were terrified of the idea of going back to war again and not having a stockpile of food and resources so this is it all it's all bad no yeah it's all bad when you go down the food aisle and most of this shit has sugar in it and simple refined carbohydrates and it's killing people and giving people where do you shop just organic markets or mostly yeah I try to get organic I try to have farmers markets - yeah and I look forward I like the feeling I was growing the tomatoes yeah you walk into fucking supermarkets and the bright lights all the fucking caught it feels like you've walked into that corporate death you know and they call sugar-white death right yeah I mean it's you're not supposed to have a sweet tooth - I have a lot of things to work it's so funny you know I get overwhelmed by that shit I get like God you know and and check this out I've I've been working out with the trainer for the last year and a half three times a week with it with that that's like this guy a lot yeah but you know I'm such an idiot that I work out with him and I'm like well I'm okay I'm good now I can have this shit you know maybe right it's insane what I do like my little reward I like that chime a child who is like you're so funny I gotta fucking change that other part of you and you know it's so funny because we're having this conversation and what happens to me is I'll be driving on gone well that's fuck innit this is my state of state of mind I'll go that's fucking it you know this is the other yeah fucking Brogan you know he just hammered home what I already know about you know it's it's got it the sugars got to go the dough processed carbs gotta go then he said cupcake [Applause] rationalizations and justifications of will install its fucking new year yeah it's almost Christmas it's almost Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is another 360 days yeah it's not a shoot in in June in January and I'm like they don't have any good food here I gotta have something you know what I mean it I'm gonna go have a cookie yeah it's a bitch you gotta write it down write down what you want to do write down what you're allowed to eat some other people told me the write down thing helps write down writing down things helps with everything I write this back because you now you have to you have an obligation it's like one of the things that Tom Segura Bert Kreischer and Ari Shaffir and I did sober October oh yeah you went through all talking about that no booze no pot you like that it was educational I think it's important to do I think it's good to do I think I like pot I'm a big fan and I like the occasional drink I like a glass of wine with dinner I like that but it's also good to abstain to have a little personality huh I do but I don't I do but I don't let it I you will it yeah I keep that bitch in check but I could let it go crazy if I wanted to quit pot because I felt interesting like I just would love to smoke all the time yeah and I'd be like well this movie I'd be like like like to me what pot did it was like but you know I mean so so but what happened was that I felt like I wasn't doing my creative work like what happened was the weed was taking me totally again I'm a child like taking me totally into this I just want to pleasure myself the whole thing I couldn't buckle down and do work well that's a real problem with comic that a lot of us struggle with having the kind of discipline that's required to get work done you know it's like you're really funny but you don't produce any new stuff because you're impulsive because you're kind of you know what Cesar Pelli I think writing thing down helps a lot having rules that was going to say about this subject Oh birthing I knew that I couldn't do any of this thing and I knew that I had to do 15 90-minute yoga sessions in this month we had a rule and we were also accountable to each other so we all knew that we had to get this done community yeah community and and you know and talk and shit to each other on text messages all the time you know like we were constantly fucking with each other and having a good time I mean was really fun it was really fun but it was also very educational but knowing that I have these requirements so I give myself requirements I write down things every day every month every week every week every week really if this is like a big list it should I have to do but like I have to write five days a week I have to write for one hour five days a week if that's where the stuff comes from and if I'd write more hours great that's great but at least five hours a week right if I miss a day something happens the next day I require two hours okay so you know way around to a plan you have to do that with food and you do it with yeah see that's what I do also for food I do intermittent fasting this is my rule where I only eat for ten hours a day so for 14 hours a day I don't eat at all so what went whatever that cutoff is so say if I eat my last meal my last bite at 9:00 p.m. I don't eat until 10:00 o'clock in the morning the next day period so if I get up at 7 that means for 3 hours I'm not eating shit I'll work out well maybe I'll have food in coffee yeah yeah I do a lot of workouts with no food that's that's cool to do I always think all I'm gonna get let pass out no that's bullshit huh yeah you'll be fine you'll be fine it's just harder just it's just you don't feel good what are you doing it yeah yeah if you used to doing it damn coffee yeah press your appetite yeah gives you a little a little pick-me-up yeah it's a psychological boost you know like I have a nice Coffee then I'll go hit the gym yeah but I definitely feel better if I have something to eat first you know it's amazing how I resist structure of course you're funny man this is what this is a reoccurring theme with so many of those funny friends it is yeah crazy impulsive funny but you're also the guy where if there's a group of people sitting around and they're all a bunch of fucking suits and they're all boring people I'm gonna gravitate immediately to you because you and I are gonna talk real we're gonna be silly and you're gonna say some fucked up shit that I'm gonna laugh at and we're gonna be slapping each other in the back and how that's what you do man but you have to you got a managed portly with me I swear to God you know I'm so anti corporate I'm so kind of an I'm anti anti government I don't know what this anti-authoritarian streak you know might have been for my dad it was the Sicilian motherfucker right I any kind of course constriction right but stop and think about this you're talking in a microphone that was made by a corporation you got here I texted you on your phone which was made by slave labor in China you got here in your car which was probably constructed overseas right yeah Honda yeah see this is we need corporations because you and I are not going to build fucking planes okay Boeing is required to make sure those planes get done correctly I just want them to do it in a way that's a gala tereus and not fucking over people you know but it's just like it's really convenient to put that Che Guevara t-shirt on and fuck I have that guy I fuck Society man I mean it's it's so tempting and and I and your inclinations are all correct your heart is in the right place your instincts are all good he's like you you don't want people to get fucked over and you rightly realize that a lot of this materialism and this fucking corporate bullshit is pointless if like you said at the beginning of this podcast we are all going to die and we need to face that and stop just collecting shit and instead work on having a great experience in the because this a moment that you have right now this is all you ever have is the moment you can plan to make that moment better and a future with more discipline and more structure and more happiness and and even more like scheduling community events and scheduling things you think do you know military I don't it's hilarious that I don't know any military I know a lot is the discipline good for them gigantic huge my friend Jocko here old Jocko willing crota book called discipline equals freedom see that's what I beat go toward do you need to follow Jocko every morning at 4:30 in the morning he posts a picture of his watch as he gets up to work out what's his name Jocko will Inc I'll send you his Instagram okay Santa does but he's he's like a bonafide savage Navy SEAL and the guy's goddamn man I'm on every morning at 4:30 he works out and then he goes and watches the Sun come up on the beach and that is his reward that's his reward so he gives himself that and then he gets all this stuff done that he has to do during the day see that the aftermath like he'll you know both pictures of like his go to his actual page you see all the photos of his watch 432 a.m. they raise up and you know his heart in the right place - oh he's a good guy great guy great guy and he spends a lot of his time right now doing these corporate seminars and you know explaining to people like the importance of leadership and discipline and that you know this is how you get things done this is how you feel better this is how you relieve yourself of your demons and your tension and his concept of discipline equals freedom really resonates because if you have the discipline to get things done then you feel like I don't feel good unless I've accomplished this shit I need to do but when I've accomplished this shit I need to do then I like to kick back on the couch and you've earned it yeah watch a boxing match or some television show that I enjoy I can enjoy it where I don't have eggs I have fucking anxiety if I don't get things done yeah I think that's you know it's funny because you know I started the podcast talking about anxiety and and I'm thinking it's all about community and disconnection and if for me it may be this just amorphous kind of days I have instead of fucking you know going okay I'm gonna do this this and this to give me a little structure that would probably alleviate a bunch of need a bunch of it but community is important to me no I mean we fucking need each other you know it's like we were talking about the Comedy Store and I wish everybody had something like the Comedy Store you know I used to have a pool hall that I used to go to that was like that where I would be everywhere I would be I'd be like I can't wait to get back to executive billiards and hang out with all my friends and it was like this freak show where was all these weirdos where what sampler White Plains New York oh okay and all these weirdos and gamblers and strange little outcasts of society and lifelong bachelors who were in their 70s and we'd all get together and laugh and hang out till fuckin four o'clock in the morning and then go get something to eat and you know I was a comic but this was like a home base yeah and I think the comic store in a lot of ways out delis hey let's wrap this bitch up it's 2 o'clock already okay how quick was that just went by that's great Eddie I had a good time man I had a great time and and I think I'm gonna change my life change goddammit follow Eddie on Twitter and on your on Instagram as well yeah Eddie Pepitone on both of those Eddie pepper on Instagram Eddie Pepitone on Twitter Eddie Perez and gentlemen boom [Music]
