welcome to a very special weekend edition a late-night weekend edition if you're on the East Coast it's 11:30 if you're in Hawaii right now you're not impressed it's only 5:00 to 524 so 1124 on the East Coast the Joe Rogan experience podcast this episode is brought to you by on it calm if you go to oh and nit use the code name Rogan you will save 10% off any and all supplements we're gonna keep it simple oh that guy we met him this weekend if a dude who is in the honored power commercial the power lifter very very cool dude with his also very cool girlfriend and it was hilarious cuz they were so happy that we shit all over the part of the commercial where he hangs out with the girls she was so mad about that because at the end of the commercial this is a commercial for a testosterone supplement called t plus and what T plus does is a it naturally stimulates your body to produce more testosterone and it's a commercial with this power lifter dude well in the beginning of it it's just him lifting weights all of it makes sense you know but then the end of it it was him with two girls at a bar and he was like being mr. sexy face we need to get a copy of it cuz I need to see it off the internet so fast I guess I said in one of the podcast I said like I don't want to be like this guy or like look like this guy's he comes up to me goes I don't want to look like you man wait for you and I'm like oh you're kissing my totally stop you're not telling the truth at all you fuck you distort reality he came up to you and told you the whole thing you didn't you knew who he was exactly yeah but he set out and I he tweeted it to you right and I don't want to be like yeah I had no idea who that was I just thought it was a hater I probably blocked and was like what I don't wanna be like you either what the fuck that mean but he was super nice and I accidentally put a sticker in his girlfriend's hair yeah Brian was he thought was being cute by putting desk watch stickers on the back of people's back when I was taking photos yeah douchebag silly bitch anyway honored calm Oh NIT code name Brogan save yourself some money 10% off any no supplements when when is your shows you got a show in San Diego coming up yeah we have one San Diego March 14th we have Billy but now Tony Hinchcliffe Jason Tebow and another person we're working on that's pretty big and tickets are on sale right now and also I'm going to Toronto in July but I don't even bother well that's a lot yes it's it's too far away yeah it's too far away all right dr. Steven Greer is here we are going to get to the bottom of a lot of crazy shit ladies and gentlemen this is one of the most requested guests ever on the podcast choosing cue the music Brian let's get this thing started officially the Joe Rogan experience our guest today for folks who were tuning into this ironically on Sirius satellite radio they don't hear the commercial part of it dr. Steven Greer if you don't know dr. Greer is there's a thing that a lot of people are aware of that came out this was a 20 2011 the disclosure project was it man 2001 2000 was that I say 11 I met one I meant right around September 11th that's what the 11 came from my head 2001 it was huge in the internet a huge point of controversy and a topic of conversation it was you on stage introducing this disclosure project explaining how much information you had access to about alien spacecrafts visiting earth and how many distinguished high-ranking military people and that was where it got shocking agreed with you that was where it got shocking because that was the first time we'd ever seen like high-ranking military officers one after another testify that they had personal encounters with things that are not of this world people who would know the difference between black ops technology the the current military defense projects that might be secret and people that would know also who to talk to about these things if they did think it was a black ops but they knew right they and it was in my opinion that video is probably one of the most important videos ever when it comes to extraterrestrial or the idea of extraterrestrial life visiting earth because the conversations that I've ever had that I've always had with rational people especially rational people who are not obsessed by aliens like I've been my whole life but rational people just you know oh I don't know I don't know if it's real or not but you know where where where's the evidence they'd be I'm sure there's alien life out there has it visit us oh I don't probably not right when you see that video and you see those high-ranking military guys one after another give these very not just believable but they're kind of they're spooky these are spooky stories because the way they're talking about them you could see in their face the emotions as they're recounting the just the sheer to use a word a leonis of their experience right we had never really seen anything like that before it had always been well I guess they probably could be out there but who knows when I watched that video it was a real it was a real shift because it was one of the first things that ever saw that made me really stop and think there's a part of everybody that doesn't want to get duped when it comes to a subject especially an important subject like UFOs there's a part of everybody that goes they want to call bullshit right away because you don't want to be the last guy to call bullshit you don't want to get be the guy who believes belizebelize and it turns into bullshit ah you dummy you believed it you were the first guy I believed in it man you want to be the first guy to call bullshit it's always a way cooler position and if if there was alien life if there was you know life that it visited the earth excuse me what what evidence would they leave behind what what would you know in your day to day existence how much of it would you know almost nothing yeah particularly when it's getting hoovered up by very well-organized and well-funded intelligence program including the the project Bluebook which was run by J dr. J Allen Hynek that was a cover story yeah Project Blue Book was really a little office where they were putting things in there and making it sound like they were really in bed meanwhile there was a unacknowledged project what we call a black project but the proper name is an unacknowledged special access project or use app and the you saps running this have been around since the forties very well-funded working on these issues working on the technology studying how these things are going from one star system to another and that's the sort of thing that we've been drilling down on for about 22 years so the project Bluebook that was run by dr. Hynek is that was his name dr. J Allen Hynek right he was an Air Force guy astronomer that they are forcing gauged to do that later he came out and admitted that that was all just sort of a dog and pony show and he also became a huge UFO believer which is really fascinating because most of the stories that they investigated in Project Blue Book he sort of debunked correct in fact instead of being open about the possibilities they always steered towards debunking first right actually the big problem became when he put his foot in his mouth when in Gerald Ford's home district in Michigan there was a whole dozens of people who saw an extraterrestrial vehicle that was maneuvering at close range and he went up and investigated and and made some reference to it being swamp gas and Gerald Ford went ballistic because his constituents went ballistic and Gerald Ford actually had an inquiry into it while he was a member of the House of Representatives of course later as president he never dealt with this issue because basically the presidential intelligence doesn't have access to those projects when you say that he said it was swamp gas that J Allen Hynek said it was womp cast so you're saying that Ford objected because he knew it was an extraterrestrial vehicle he knew that his some of his constituents who were very credible knew it was something real what was his position then what was he he was actually believed it was real as the Lord I mean in government what is Pripet president yeah well he was in the House of Representative the Congress okay here's a congressman before he was vice president in president and so he was upset that they were saying that it wasn't a real vehicle so he clamped down on it yeah and actually held a hearing where a lot of people came and gave evidence and Meishan but it didn't go anywhere because it's Washington nothing ever goes anywhere in Washington and so you know I started as founder of disclosure project org and now serious disclosure dot-com we began investigating this in 1990 and you know I'm a trauma doctor emergency doctor who was running a very busy ER and raising four kids and I got involved with this because I knew about it since childhood and you know my have family my mom's brother uncle is a engineer that worked on the lunar module and I had an interest in this since I was a little child so the thing that put Neil Armstrong on the on the moon my family had a hand in that so I think that what most people don't realize is that inside the intelligence community the aerospace community there are a lot of people who are very knowledgeable about this but they're not allowed to talk about it it's a career ender for most of them and that was what we did for disclosure project was to put all those folks together identify them so I spent about 10 years identifying who these people were and first I had maybe half a dozen of them now we have over 500 about 550 who was the most credible people just so folks listening to this that haven't watched that video who are the most credible people well we're gonna have some of them in the film serious you know there's a like si RI us serious is going to have a lot of this information at it and some stuff that's going to blow your mind including the possibility of an actual body a humanoid body that we're investigating and we'll get into this in a moment and when you see it you're gonna go really oh my god but you know these witnesses that we have or military go from the head of investigations for the FAA John Callahan to people like Gordon Cooper who was one of the early mercury astronauts who his crew actually filmed one of these extra trestle vehicles landing on a dry lakebed out here near edwards and he looked at the film and centered on a pentagon plane and now the backstory to this now this is giving an idea of how labyrinthine and screwed up Washington's become and what Eisenhower said when he said beware the military-industrial complex because it's going to get out of control be a threat to our democracy Gordon Cooper you know very heroic early astronaut had detailed information what we call actionable intelligence on that event this landing of a vehicle in broad daylight near Edwards Air Force Base in 1956 now when Clinton was president Gordon Cooper asked was asked by the Secretary of Defense William Cohen about this issue and he says yes I absolutely will verify this and I'll give you the information when and where and how it happened so the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America had this information made an inquiry through channels and came up with a dry hole basically this stuff has all been put into a parallel universe that the senior people in our government have for the most part no access to now I would not have believed that if I hadn't been the guy who was brought to Washington during the Clinton years to do the briefing for the CIA director and I was asked to go up there as a service and I did it left my er and I put together a whole lot of these early witnesses testimony photographs some really amazing government documents that we acquired some through channels that I want to talk about and I put this briefing together and so I go up there and here's the sitting CIA director our james Woolsey and his wife was there who was at the time the chief operating officer of the National Academy of Sciences and when I was first invited to go up there and briefed the CIA director I was told they want you to come up here because President Clinton and he have inquired about this subject and they're being denied access I have a letter proving this President Clinton has been denied access so they want you a doctor in who had a family connection to these programs and also to information and so how did they know about you huh well let me finish this southern fresh and I'll get to that because that's what they'll blow your mind even more but what happened is that I really thought this was crap I mean because when his handler the CIA directors handler who contacted me said look they need you to come up here because they can't find out anything but they know stuff's going on well I thought they just wanted to pick my brain as sort of Spooks you know spooks will the spies will try to just get information I went up there and the CIA director was honestly completely in the dark and I was mortified and towards the end of this almost three-hour briefing that I did for the CIA director my wife was with me and I gave him this white paper this position paper that a summary of action that the president needed the take and he needs to take and he my hands were shaking because hang on like this 35 year old guy briefing the sitting CIA director was very intimidating frankly and you know at the end of it I said you know we really need you to help disclose this information because the people need to know but also the technologies that we've studied and have mastered for 50 years could get us off oil we could fix this environment we could fix the world's poverty problems and the geopolitical problems in the Middle East and he looked at me he says how do we disclose that which we have no access to and I just thought I thought I'd passed out I said what do you mean you have no way and this was from his mouth to my ears and so I learned the hard way the very very hard way that when you're dealing with things that are some people say above top secret but the proper name is an unacknowledged special access project and we have about a hundred to two hundred billion dollars a year in our treasury going into these rogue operations and it's it's a criminal it's outrageous that you know just because you're the CIA director just because you're Secretary of Defense or on the Senate Intelligence Committee means nothing and even the president so the reason he those folks invited me to come up there is that the year before I had taken a team of people out on a beach using some experimental protocols to contact these vehicles and the occupants and four of these UFOs popped into the sky just which we have on videotape a great videotape because we have good cameras back then and there were a couple Air Force officers and pilots there and this went up through the chain of command a few months later the former head of Army Intelligence invites to a meeting and then some National Security Agency people do and one thing leads to another and being invited to brief the sitting CIA directors so so that you know that you can you contacted these spaceships well this gets into a discussion when you know that's complex but yes and you can do that at any time well not at any time but I think that under the right you can't do that there are protocols and we developed something called the Close Encounters of the fifth kind initiative which is when you use a set of very very controversial protocols that deal with nonlocality the fact that the universe has various dimensions that you can move through to go from one star system to another but those dimensions that are at higher resonant fields than say linear space-time or electromagnetism also interface with what I call coherent thought so the Moody Blues were right when they said thinking is the best way to travel and there's a component to we're in addiction you're pairing to lose half your listeners right no you want I've got weeks listen all right well hey all you freaks listen up and listen apart you can develop technologies and we have these in classified projects now where you can have a what's called a switch that will interface with very intent thought so it's beyond forget your iPhone now if you're traveling from one star system to another that's what you're going to be using you're gonna be using technologies that are phasing at multiples of the speed of light and those dimensions also intersect at a certain point with coherent thought just like light is coherent a laser is coherent light and so this gets into the whole question of how over the history of humanity have there been so many reports of contact and there are I mean going all the way back to the Vimanas and the Vedas to accounts that you know there's a wonderful painting and the Middle Ages of this exactly looks like a modern UFO over the shoulder of Mary holding Jesus in a picture that's been it's from the 1400s I've actually seen the original of this so I think the question becomes you know we probably have always had extraterrestrial civilizations observing our little planet the question is what happened in the last 50 to 100 years that really got their attention and I'm quite convinced it was when we started detonating thermonuclear weapons but my one of the projects were involved with his disclosure project and another one is sort of a citizen's diplomacy effort saying look since our government is dead in the water on this in terms of the Secretary of State and folks like that and I know I went it went up to the UN and met with back when Boutros boutros-ghali was UN Secretary General and briefed these guys and hid her lay agali though the wife the Secretary General I talked about this in depth he she said they're not gonna let us deal with something like this so I started a citizens diplomacy effort back in 1990 but this is actually but man this is the part that I get ridiculed the most for but it's the reason why the intelligence community took it most seriously is that they knew that we had discovered the Rosetta Stone of contact and they were very concerned now concern from the covert end from the end of a lot of these Washington operatives they were just fascinated they didn't understand it because it was sort of past their their scientific understanding but they were very interested this is something I hate interrupt you know please something that we can't really just gloss over the the idea that coherent thought as you say intersects with these other levels these other dimensions that we can't normally access correct um how did you find out about this and how did you develop the ability where you put down a hot seat early man well I need to be neat yet you have to when you say that you can do that I mean somehow or another you have to without getting anybody killed you have to explain how'd you figure that out I figured it out when I was a teenager and through a series of experiences I had and you know I was I was talking to Thomas Jane you're here in town about this and I had a near-death experience no 17 it was very sick and I had an experience that took me into some awareness about the nature of consciousness and the nonlocality of mind and the fact that the mind is actually a singularity but there's really only one mind and it's just shining through various individuals appearing as many and this experience although it sounds very spiritual and religious was very palpable and I was raised a very devout atheist so we didn't believe in anything and so when I realized that this was real I began to study meditation and through that began to have some experiences where I realized this could happen and I had a contact experience I was 18 as a few months later in the fall of 1973 and I was doing this I was meditating and then I was doing what I was now called SRV scientific remote viewing where you use consciousness to see remote places and of course army intelligence in the CIA of experiment with this for years which you may or may not know about we can get into that but I know all those guys I know all this RV people and but I was a kid you know and I just turned 18 I was doing this and suddenly I had this experience where I thought well what if I try to go into that state of one mind that I experienced when I was a kid six six months earlier when I had this near-death experience so I did and then I had an experience where I remote view too salty space and could see that there was an e key spacecraft out there and I made contact and it appeared and it be literally materialized right near the mountain where I was viewing this 18 no drugs no no I've never done any drugs there he's never done any drugs no no psychedelics nothing ever Wow now are you aware aware of dimethyltryptamine do you know me I do you know it's a supposedly your brain produces it when you're in periods of extreme stress or near-death experiences yeah and it's also the same chemical that's in ayahuasca which has been used by indigenous tribes too right no this was just this was a very natural sort of thing that happened but but what I'm saying is that these people that are having these experiences that are having a lot of people that are having alien contact experiences they are all having them in the middle of the night like most of them are having them at night and I'm not discounting this in any way in fact I may be possibly enhancing the the possibility of people understanding this or the vehicle the the mind produces this dimethyltryptamine during REM sleep and it's believed it's it's still a very sketchy thing we know that the body produces it we know we they believe the pineal gland which is literally your third eye and Reptoids it as a retina in the corneal right they believe that's what fur do but the evidence on and apparently it's like really kind of it's it's hard to figure out exactly but they know the body has it they know it's produced by the liver and the lungs for sure and this chemical when you get it and you give it to people that have had UFO abduction experiences it gives them the exact same experience it brings them into contact with other beings the idea that this is just a hallucination because your your body has some endogenous chemical in it and it's spikes and right stimulates the visual cortex and what-have-you and you have this that is what everyone has always assumed whenever you talk about anything hallucinatory or psychedelic right but what they're not what a lot of people haven't taken into consideration is that you're basically a conglomeration of chemicals your neurotransmitters dopamine serotonin there's a million different chemicals which as their levels vary up and down it drastically changes your reality your happiness level your appreciation love oxytocin all these things proven 100% change your reality you change the physical meet vehicle reality that you have and I think for whatever reason when we think of something in the mind when we think of the mind like you're you're saying that coherent thought can contact other entities from other people like what the fuck are you talking about you know that's like the initial immediate reaction right because we've all been misunder miss educate about the nature of well of consciousness accessory I've always tried to get people to try to understand how bizarre just just imagination is and I don't mean imagination by you're imagining things that aren't there that's not real you're playing game with your mind what I mean by imagination is everything including the language that we're speaking with right now the vehicle in which this language is getting delivered through the internet all of this came from the imagination or everything this table came from the imagination everything is the arm that holds this microphone someone thought this shit up and then all of a sudden it manifested itself in a physical form when they actively created it that seems so normal to us it seems so normal but we're the only fucking animal in the world we know that can do this well and it goes beyond that because you know dr. John at Princeton University had the Princeton engineering anomalies research lab and I knew dr. John and they had proven that you could set up a random number generator machine and put your fault towards it and begin to move whether it's spitting out zeros or ones and that there is in fact been proven scientifically that the mind is actually operating non-locally meaning that it's not limited to the space and time in a linear way and these studies that have been done by Dean Radin and dr. John and many other scientists with very good credentials I mean dr. John was an engineer and at Princeton what they found is that in fact the mind itself is what urban Schrodinger said and our urban Schroeder injury course was the father of a particle wave theory and quantum mechanics and I think it was in 1910 or so he said the total number of minds in the universe is one that is it's a singularity and so that understanding is I mean I know it sounds sort of out there hippy but no I mean it actually sounds very Vedic and the sense of the Buddhist or of a dontoh but it beats well yeah I mean I guess to maybe Sarah Palin but um I say that I'm sorry I apologize but the reality is the world isn't flat and there's a whole area of physics and science that has been drilled down on for years that establish all these things is true it isn't talked about because the high priests of religion and the high priests of science are all opposed to this information coming out so the idea that a part of the secrecy around this whole UFO issue isn't just the physical energy and propulsion systems it's the paradigm because if you if you ask the question in fact going back to this dinner with the CIA director and his wife very smart lady and she turns and we're sitting across the table having dinner I mean I was the cover story was it was a dinner and she says how were they communicating across the vastness of space and of course I had the you know I didn't know whether to tell her some that sounded scientific so it maintained my credibility or to tell her the truth and risk losing all my credibility but I decided then in the early days of this project that if someone's smart enough to ask the question I'm gonna answer it honestly even though it's gonna blow their mind and so I looked at her and her husband the CI director sitting next to me I didn't really understand where she was going I said look take her Milky Way it's hundred thousand light years across all right so that in a hundred thousand light years is a distance that's how far you would go at 186,000 miles a second for a hundred thousand years going at that speed that's just our own galaxy now you take 1% of that say a thousand light years at the speed of your cell phone or radio wave or TV wave or this system were using right here for someone from a star system 1% of the way through our galaxy for them to say hello how are you and for a spacecraft that's at another star system a thousand light-years away say here or earth to say fine how are you doing that just took how long four thousand years 2,000 years one thousand one way in one thousand another so the time since the birth of Christ so the speed of light is too damn slow and so when you when you begin to go through what I call the crossing point of light it's like the the sound barrier was a big deal the biggest deal is the light barrier and when you go past the light barrier you're gonna cross into these kind of multiphasic resonant dimensions part of which hook into the singularity of mind and thought and actually this film that we're working on which is the largest crowd funded documentary in history to my knowledge serious you can find out about it serious disclosure calm it's been crowd funded by the public it's all been funded by people out there thousands of people we're gonna do it we're gonna do a premiere here in LA on April 22nd if you want to come but I would love to okay come well we can't send things to the speed of light right I mean even even that even saying that beyond the speed of light but they can't do that right I mean there's you can't send information in form of light yet can you not well no but I'm about fiber optics and things of this sort but does that move at the speed of light pretty much yeah but but but what I'm saying is that if you go beyond the speed of light right it's a whole new physics of course okay so that's what if if these craft are here and now we have I have over 4,000 cases where they've landed and we have evidence I have 3,500 pilot cases we have over 500 whistleblowers top-secret military corporate people and I have a hundred and ten of them on digital videotape although nobody wants to see it but I have it so the question is if they're here how the hell they get here well they're not using an Exxon jet a fuel and they're not using a solid rocket booster and they're not using an ion drive or anything linear so you have to begin to have this question so in the CI directors wife asked me this I told her about that they had technologies that interface with thought and consciousness and that sounded as may sounds bizarre to people now but if you took your cell phone and showed Thomas Jefferson your smart phone they would think it was magic if you went to Salem Massachusetts got plenty of years ago you'd be burned at the stake so which yeah so the point is is that people have to have some humility about the fact that humans are one-half of one step out of the jungle technologically and we're only a hundred or so years into anything resembling real technology so when we're dealing with civilizations that are ten to the six to ten to the seventh a hundred thousand two million years ahead of us we have to have some humility about what that might look like and so when I explained this to the wife the CI director she just looked at me and said I thought it had to be something like that I mean people are ready to actually understand this not everyone has to be retarded on this and I tell folks that it's what's a shame in my mind is that our civilization has been exploring these sort of what they call borderland sciences for a hundred years and it's all been kept very secret or debunked or ridiculed and it's actually holding us back not only socially and spiritually but environmentally and in every other way because this nexus of where you have these advanced transdimensional physics come together that's how you're propelling through one point in space to another across galaxies it's also how we're going to be able to run this planets energy grid without a grid where every home business and car can pull energy out of the fabric of space-time through this kind of physics and so there's this nexus where electromagnetism and transdimensional physics comes together and then you cross a little deeper and that's where you get into the science of consciousness and this becomes a very very complex issue for most people because it's new to them but once you understand the fundamental science behind it it's really very simple what we need to understand is that no one 200 years ago even thought of a camera right 200 years ago when you want to picture something you had to draw it and there was you know the idea of a camera was so the idea of a movie the idea of sending a video on your phone to your friend you could take a video of you here right now and send it to a friend and they would get it almost instantly that's just a tiny blip in in human history of 200 year blip in human history from riding horses to sending video through the internet for a hundred years yeah I mean when the people that existed back then would have never seen it coming and if technology and we know it does accelerates exponentially what we're dealing with a thousand years from now ten thousand years from now it's completely unrecognizable we live in an area where our solar system is kind of scary there's a lot of rocks out there and they fly around and occasionally slam in the shit and they can they can ruin civilization for a little bit all right but there might be solar systems out there with that doesn't take place there could be a civilization that developed to 3 billion years ago I mean we really don't know we have no idea well the earth has had life for 700 million years and all scientists reckon recognize that except people who think that the world was made 6,000 years ago and I have nothing to say to those folks except to say get over it but I know I'm I think I'm an outrageous person you are a little loud a little bit a little bit outrageous haven't heard anything yet yeah I'm ready all right strapped in so but but if you really look at our technological development you know my grandmother was born in post-reconstruction south in the late 1800s her son worked on the lunar module put the first man on the moon but by time we landed on the moon in 1969 we were 15 years into having classified anti-gravity propulsion devices the biggest mindfuck that I was trying to drop on people with time is between the invention of the airplane it was less than 50 years it's someone used that airplane to drop a nuclear weapon right and see this is this is pretty crazy this gets into the whole question oh I've had a lot of people ask me we have and if you go to our site serious disclosure calm there's a section that has all these top-secret military guys on it and part of it is that we you there's a whole grouping of them have a dozen of them or so who were at Strategic Air Command facilities and nuclear weapons storage areas and processing areas and all this stuff and every one of them were over flown by et spacecraft back in the 40s 50s 60s because they were very concerned about what we were doing because we were going from having these technologies to weaponizing them and our technological development had gotten ahead of our social and spiritual development way ahead and this this is an existential threat but you know as an emergency doctor I used to have you know crazy people come into the ER and I'd have to commit them and you know it's dangerous to yourself or others and and what I found is that if you just take a step back and look at humanity through the eyes of extraterrestrial civilizations we've become dangerous to ourselves but we're also dangerous to others and moreover we become a existential threat to the biosphere the where we're killing the oceans the atmosphere and everything else all this is unnecessary so the question is the misanthropic sociopaths that are running the planet into the ground are going to have to be stood down by the people getting behind disclosure getting behind the technologies and basically saying we're not we're fed up and we're not going to put up with this anymore it's like the movie network and we're mad as hell and I think people it isn't about doing anything violent it's about saying we need to just move forward because Washington isn't gonna do it my uncle's company Northrop Grumman isn't Lockheed Martin isn't gonna do it it's you and me and the other people out there who get the situation we're in and want to fix it one of the things that might have also got their attention was operation starfish prime are you aware that from 1962 where they launched a nuclear bomb into space blew up a nuclear bomb and space well I do actually one of our witnesses Colonel dietrichson was with the Atomic Energy Commission which became the do-e and he was a Air Force colonel and his responsibility was overall the nuclear facilities but he knew of a program where we were gonna lob a thermonuclear weapon and detonate it on the moon and when that okay and they actually worked on this and when it went exo-atmospheric when it left our atmosphere and it was intercepted by an extraterrestrial vehicle and basically dematerialize was taken out and he knew had personal knowledge of this so so they had actually tried to do this they they actually launched it and it was on its way to the moon so you know there have been a lot of really crazy it's like dr. Strangelove on steroids with some of these guys and you know I still work with a lot of folks who are with the agency and aerospace industry and there's a term at the naval research labs and CIA for this whole area of science and it's called WS FM and stands for it's not a radio station by the way it stands for weird science and freakin magic and that's what they call it and there's grown man you should never use a word friggin yeah I don't this is what they call it they need to be stopped they have that access to technology and they using the word frickin yeah you can't be trusting them yeah oh you can't they're held back actually I'll tell you the a lot them are really good people who want to see the secrecy and but there's not much they can do as an individual when you're in a compartmentalize sort of a system like that I got a lot of them come forward you know almost all of our top secret guys had signed security O's but here here's something that once you everyone donateeeee listen carefully Daniel Sheehan who is accustomed constitutional attorney who did Pentagon Papers and so quick case and all this yeah and I ran this by him I said look I've done briefings for here's a short list the director of Central Intelligence the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency members of the Senate Intelligence Committee senior people who are on the house various House committees Government Oversight Committee presidential staff the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff was called j2 personally I took a stronger Mitchell to one of those briefings for the Admiral and Admiral Tom Wilson and and every one of these people had been inquiring about this issue and had been denied access one of them who I will not name I learned before my briefing with him I had given a document that's gonna be in in this film serious and the document is it's on the front of the thing the brief and I put together for President Obama and if you go down the list you put together a briefing for President Obama yeah they asked you to someone senior involved with his team did and so Jesus Christ yeah weird must that be to be the President and then to get in there go okay what the fuck is going on yeah damper has no clothes hey call that that doctor what's that guy's name yeah genius career go get that guy yeah so no but what happened is that when when this Admiral looked at this document and it's gonna blow people's mind when they see this it's a National Reconnaissance Office document and NRO does all the top-secret spy satellites and over their headquarters it says we own the night and the oh yeah that's their motto we own the night it's pretty so yeah it's pretty spooky yeah but so you know these are kind of dudes I work with all the time I'm it what happened is that the one of these compartments it has a whole distribution list cosmic ops magic ops da da da da da da you know all kinds of is about 20 of them and this is a document that was not Declassified that was given to me by a source that I won't talk about and this Admiral recognized one of those compartments so he contacted them and on the other end of the phone they said he said look that I I'm so-and-so and they said yes sir we know who you are and he says well I want to be read into which is military speak for briefed on this project and they said sir we cannot discuss this project with you you don't have a need to know he says what do you mean I'm the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff how can I not have a need-to-know and they said sir we will not discuss this with you Clinton walked in so who the fuck knows who's who's like how many people are there have you determined that yeah I have I know some of the members of there's a committee and it's a transnational it started out much smaller and less opaque back in the 40s when Truman was around does it have a name it did have the name majestic and that is not a myth and so a majestic 12 right as it was yes but the document as of the 90s that I got it still had magic maj IC on it and so a lot of these programs you know they've gone through multiple generations of evolution and now I understand it's a committee of two or three hundred folks who are you know corporate very deep kind of shadow government operations if the mistake the public makes is that they think that just because you're the president or the CIA director or remember the Senate Intelligence Committee you're gonna have access to those and that's cuz they do not understand what Rumsfeld said is true on the day before 9/11 and there's gonna be in the film where he said there's 2.3 trillion dollars basically missing that we can't account for now the Department of Defense budget over the last few years 2.3 trillion not billion now we found out and I discovered this in the early 90s that there's somewhere between 100 and 200 billion year basically just being stolen going into these illegal projects and so when Sheehan and I looked at this this attorney I said look if all these people who have a need to know in the constitutional chain of command are being lied to deceived and what-have-you I'm going to declare all those projects rogue op priori illegal therefore anyone who signed a security oath for them I'm going to unilaterally announce that they're released from them so all of you listening if you've been in any of these projects with Lockheed Northrop SAIC the CIA you do not have to go by the secrecy because if they are denying access to the people who are in the constitutional chain of command which I can prove they have in a court of law those projects a rogue and therefore those security oaths have no enforceability now whether or not you have the courage to come forward is another question but what what I was very glad to be able to do between the early 90s and 2001 with the disclosure project is to pull together the people who did have a courage and they're still coming forward when we have people contact me all the time who are in these projects who give us information intelligence and it's really a citizen's effort I mean I've never been in the government my entire life but I think this is what you have an idea and if the idea two picks up steam and people see the reason for it but the other thing is to do it in a you know in a way where people feel supported and that's why we did this in a way where there were dozens that came out at once I mean I think in the initial batch of people came forward it was about seventy one of the things I always want to get into people's heads when they start talking about the government or the people in charged or you know those in the know the idea that they're exchanging information is been proven false time and time again right not only that what's really blown me away lately is finding out that especially in this supposed patriotic time of war we have government factions that don't like other other government factions that's always been that way I was blown away when Petraeus was outed by the FBI I'd be like are you fucking crazy like that is nuts you're talking about the head of the CIA and there's the FBI is spying on him over an affair and you're gonna bring down this beloved national hero right stupid unbelievably stupid but also unbelievably revealing about how partitioned our government truly is and how difficult it would be to get access to some critical information if this information is in any way deemed too sensitive or too controversial or too - whatever - paradigm-shifting for the average eye well let's make this very simple if you acknowledge that the UFOs are there and they're real and anyone with an IQ over mud it's gonna ask the question then how did they get here if you ask that question we have the answers for it and if the public knows that then they know we don't need ExxonMobil we don't need oil gas coal nuclear power or centralized utility that's assuming though that most people believe that the UFOs are real but yeah about 50 to 60 percent do now I think they say that I think they say when they but I think they most of the time we'll look for terrestrial explanations most rational people well no actually what I'm what now this there was just a poll that came out a month ago and there's actually 43% of the public believe that extraterrestrial life has been on the planet Fitzie here now 51% believed that the earth is less than 10,000 years old you know that yeah well they well I don't know if it's that high I heard it was about a quarter of the population so Gallup poll I think 2010 2010 they got 51% the Flat Earth Society still has a lot of members I guess but you know here's the here's the bigger issue is that if you bring this information out and let's let's say that one of the objectives of what I'm working on now I mean let me just clear that up yeah 46% okay for creationist view of human origins 40 46 well but of the creationist view of not all those people through the world is 10,000 years old I think that numbers about 1,000 years though they're saying 10,000 years this is what in this study the Gallup study these very specifically 46 percent of Americans believe the creationist view that God created humans in their present form at a time within the last ten thousand years oh god you're gonna make me move to Norway anyway good choice right there and they're badass hey you know but just to throw some salt on your idea they make all you want now look I told you them I'm a huge fan of the UFO experience I mean I really want it to be real but just because 47% or whatever the fuck think 46% think that the earth right I know you're right now yeah and but the evidence speaks for itself and I told someone wants but that what does it what percentage okay let's let's just be honest or rather let's open this what percentage of UFO sightings are real what how what percentage are totally made-up and what percentage are a confusion but that's not the metric we're using we're going by government release documents we're going by people who are insiders who have actually handled extraterrestrial bodies so when you're talking without offices you're talking about experiences from people who are a hundred percent credible bulletproof by I don't know said I'm an only that but if you have the the the former minister defensive Canada say that he checked out with a US Air Force general that in fact there was an accident that happened in New Mexico in 1947 which people call Roswell and that what Philip Corso Colonel Corso wrote in his book the day after Roswell was substantially correct and and and this is the Honorable Paul Hellyer and he and I did a press conference in Toronto a couple years ago and he has completely verified this so the either question is and then the same thing happened with five-star Admiral Lord Hill Norton I mean here he was the Minister of Defense and he found out after the fact that in fact an extraterrestrial vehicle had landed at the Bentwaters Royal Air Force Base at Rendlesham forest and England and we have multiple disclosure project witnesses who were there and it came out recently that the Ministry of Defence in Great Britain released the documents on that where they had physical evidence that this thing actually did land and left physical traces etc and so on so I tell people you know usually the New York Times say well we need two or three corroborating witnesses to something particularly and three if it's a very controversial story I say yes but the disclosure project has hundreds of these sort of people thousands of cases like this and we're not talking about just people in the sky this is per event they don't mean like yeah well we have we have in and we have event we have multiple ones for this landing everyone knows report we have multiple ones from the Minot North Dakota it has like how many do you have where there will be seeing some of them you know four five six at one event and they are very read about military people and so why isn't you know why isn't the the lamestream the mainstream news reporting this if you put together this amount of information and then the question becomes how free is our media and how free is our market and how free is our country because I think there's more corruption than people can imagine and I'm not a conspiracy theory person ideal wait a minute yes you are no I'm not how dare you no I'm not but just be honest I just don't hear us okay okay yeah ideally like there when we're not knowing about UFO conspiracies well it's like it always the Mafia conspiracy of a criminal enterprise yes but it's not a theory it's a fact okay so okay so you say there's a big difference between there obviously you're talking about a UFO conspiracy and energy conspiracy you're talking about yes so the suppressing information people conspire in their own interest and if you're you've got a you I don't know I know you don't like conspiracy theorists but okay well no I just don't I think the term is used I I think it's misused is misused and I think that you know just weighted its load it's a loaded thing yeah and it's like you know it's like when Larry King asked me do you believe I said well you know I believe in a lot of things that you can't see and prove but if I have four thousand cases where these things have landed if I have hundreds of photographs and video tapes if I have dozens of Tom secret guys who can corroborate this why is that a belief I mean you believe in God and some other things but I mean this is not a matter of belief most people believe I'll quote Neil deGrasse Tyson who says that eyewitness testimony is the least reliable of all pieces of evidence that's right but what physical evidence do you have that goes along with eyewitness testimony that you believe is the most compelling well I think the most compelling that I've ever seen it's something we're working on right now and it remains to be seen if it's gonna be what we think it is and we're gonna know fairly soon and I'd want to get ahead of myself but I was introduced to an institute that acquired a small humanoid being about six inches in length this is in the trailer for serious I've seen this this little skeleton that's x-rayed and cat scanned and we're now doing the genetic workup at the top university in the world that's doing this pull that up Brian because it's very freaky people on Ustream and Vimeo can see this we'll just well you know what let's just play the entire trailer for you and get people excited about this movie now who found this this alien being and where did they acquire this thing it was I'm not liberty okay I'm still waiting to see if this person would but it's an it is it might be horse shit right it's a possibility you know no no I know all I'm saying is that it is an organic being it is an organic it is the cat scan shows lungs on the inside it has ten ribs and not 12 we have now proven from bone density that it's at least several years old and it's only six inches long so how do you prove that from bone density well you look at the pith Asiya plates and the how much calcium in other words isn't it why you're dealing with a completely alien species no no no I'm saying if you were to go back if you're gonna assume that it's not et mm-hmm then you look at it what would this be if it were human okay so you have to go through an algorithm of and it's a diagnosis of exclusion ricca-san medicine because if it's not a miscarried or aborted fetus which is the size of what this would be about 22 weeks if it's not any known primate it's not a fossil because it has organic material in DNA material we've already extracted I we one of the ribs two of the ribs and to have gotten the DNA material out of the rib of internal marrow and so this is being processed right now as we speak literally so if it was a human it would be several years old so that proves that it's not a human there is no way there is no form of dwarfism or any other genetic anomaly known in the literature according to the world's expert in this area that would explain something of this age that is this and also that has these abnormalities if you look at the skull you don't look at the the fact that has ten ribs there are no genetic syndromes where you have ten rails if you see this thing in person I was the third person to hold it well handle it and I did the I didn't say autopsy on it but I did the the tests on it and how long had it been dead for they have no idea no idea that that we didn't get enough material from we don't want to damage this little thing too much so the carbon dating on it will be the next step we wanted to be sure we had enough genetic material and if we had to go back and we didn't want to destroy in any way so we're working a scientific algorithm on this this is actually the people the public who are supporting the film serious or the reason why we were able to do all these studies how is this how is this thing preserved you know but it was found in a very very dry desert area and it's just very desiccated it's very dried out and it was not in any sort of preservative and now it died a traumatic death and we know it behind the right mastoid Aircel behind your ear here the skull has crashed in and it's a little asymmetric on the jaw jaw and the right humerus is fractured through and through but and it happened at Mortimer shortly post-mortem we think it was the fatal blow to this particular being now what is this being when you look at it almost every scientists that has seen it goes looks like an et but we don't know all I'm gonna say is that we're not gonna be able to sit considered you know even the genetics there's no database to compare it to now we have the whole human genome to compare it to which what we're doing right now and we have all the literature that the world's expert in skeletal abnormalities I mean the expert in the world looked at this thing is that this is nothing that I know of and that has ever been seen on this planet and so the question then becomes what is it now it turns out it was found in an area of the Atacama Desert in Chile that native peoples have reports of these objects luminous objects going in and out of the foothills of the Andes the famous famous for very famous sighting is Gerry famous and also in these remote native villages there are reports of these very small beings upright humanoid type beans isn't that also the area where they constructed the VLT telescopic array one of the the very large telescope I believe I think there are yet because it's a very dark area and they're having a lot of astronomy and we also know of one of our witnesses who was a manning a facility on the peruvian bolivian border that's not too far from this area was there in the early 90s when we were using a SDI starwars system to track ET craft and hit them with electromagnetic pulse weapons and one was downed and crashed on the peruvian bolivian border we hit it with electromagnetic pulse weapons yeah this is so who did this other the Air Force the army like do we know yeah we know but I mean it's this group majestic I mean you know if you were to talk to that the general i briefed who's headed the defense intelligence agency which is almost as big as the CIA that's in the pentagon you know anything about this so you say who's doing it it's not it's kind of almost not the correct even way of framing it is to say you know when Senator annually that he just passed away wonderful senator Hawaii you know he said there exists a secret government with its own Air Force its own funding mechanism its own Navy I'm quoting almost exactly and it and actually which is a great speech by this senator and it's because he had run across it that this was going on so the question is who's running this will they've gone off the reservation there's certainly no congressional oversight or presidential oversight over these rogue elements and I think that is a threat to our democracy but it's also a threat to our security in the world if what we've learned is true from multiple military insiders that we have been attempting to target these extraterrestrial vehicles and downed them how stupid is that you're dealing with civilizations that could turn the earth into a pink mist floating through space and a nanosecond and we're they're firing at them why you know I mean this is what you convinced that this happened absolutely I absolutely know it yes because I have too many insiders who have been present when we've done this sort of the weaponization of electromagnetic signals what about disinformation do you have most of the information out there is disinformation right I would say many of it's ever hit you like any this might be oh yeah I know no not what I'm telling you but have I ever been caught flat-footed yeah almost and but you know we're very careful and I have to say you know as a doctor who got into this is sort of accidentally and then I was tutored and mentored by some really good people in the military in an intelligence community who wanted me to do this and one of them is still to CIA he's a PhD guy and he says you know someone needs to do this because the politicians are never gonna do within these big corporations are absolutely not gonna let it out and this was back in the 90s and I said well what am I supposed to do and you know one of the interesting thing way after we put this briefing together for Clinton and you know Laurance Rockefeller I put the concept together of the best available evidence and all these cases and then Laurance Rockefeller hosted Bill and Hillary Clinton at the Rockefeller ranch and it had me out there shortly before that and mr. Rockefeller was the white hat in the family who wanted to end the secrecy unlike some of his family and and he so he said to me one night I was at home on his porch on a deck in the Grand Tetons at the j.y ranch and he said we really need you to hurry up and do this and I said oh Lawrence I'm just a doctor in North Carolina I'm working in an ER you know he says no no you have to do it I said no Lawrence you you have to get these guys to do he says they will never do it and I said Lawrence for God's sakes you're old you're rich in your rockefeller he says no he says the implications of this are so vast and so profound that no aspect of life will be unchanged when it comes out I said yes Lawrence that's quite secret and then he said to me well that means those folks aren't going to do it and then you know before that shortly after that and I had this mean with the CIA director and and one of the president's friends came to my house and this was a very disturbing story I'm sitting at the table with my little four kids four daughters and this man who's very close friends with the president the Clinton it says to me well you know they're very supportive of what you've recommended in this white paper I said great nieces but and they're not gonna do it I said why not he says they're convinced that if the president steps into this too hard he'll end up like Jack Kennedy and I started laughing thinking what a load of nonsense and he stopped me he says no they're serious I said well don't say this in front of kids so we went to the library in my house after dinner and I said what are you talking about Kevin and he said they really think this is too dangerous I said well what am I supposed to do one of my chopped liver and he looked at me and he says yeah you're expendable so I have always viewed myself as the kind of the throwaway guy and all of this well it's they these guys you know the folks who have enormous political power and corporate power even the ones who support this very avidly and there's a lot of them they don't want to stick their necks out but I'm confused okay why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill Clinton came out and said that we may have evidence that there might be some intelligent life out there in the world you know it's like the REM song it's the end of the world as we know it because if that if that happens when that happens people would panic no no no no the public isn't panic over this unless it's couched in a stupid way well the public definitely will panic if the president comes out and says there's UFOs and then he gets whacked hmm that would lead to panic yeah but there's a bigger problem if the president doesn't have control access over these projects he didn't want to talk about it because then it shows the fact that our democracy has been side lined as Eisenhower warned us I mean the reason isin look I mean Eisenhower was not anti military it was a five-star general but folks don't know the story just fill people in on the speech that he made it was an active sitting president leaving yeah the last day of his presidency yes he basically said beware the military-industrial complex and this is the dangers and he said the dangers of this an enormous power will be a threat to our democracy and our way of life now the reason he said that is that between 1954 and 1960 61 when he was leaving office he was on his watch that the military-industrial complex reorganized under the Rockefeller Commission of 1956 and Eisenhower lost complete control over these projects I have a lieutenant colonel who was on the plane with Jack Kennedy flying to Berlin when he would gave the I am A Berliner speech and and Jack Kennedy was talking about this UFO issue but he turned to this guy who was kind of the chief steward for Air Force one who I know and he said I know about this but the whole matter is the President Kennedy saying this the whole matter is out of my hands and I don't know why and this guy was stunned in fact I'll tell you there's a kind of a gruff Colonel Air Force guy who is crying as he told this story because it hit him that there had been sort of a silent silent coup d'etat on this issue and one of the problems in Washington when I meet with people who are part of powerful committees and and politicians is that you know they're kind of viewed as placeholders that come and go the mainstream media is really bread and circus where they just keep one people to be entertained with shock and drivel the question becomes how are you going to get this story out and that's why I mean a few years ago I left medicine which was a hard thing for me to do because I mean I really love taking care of you know real emergencies and trauma how long did you do that for hmm I was in that er of ten years and I was chairman of emergency medicine and you know the problem became for me the worlds in an emergency so I said I'm an emergency doctor and I know an emergency when I see one and we're in deep proper trouble and and so someone has to do this and but before I did that what you have to understand is I went to everyone I could I mean I went to these powerful people I went to the UN and I went to the British government the Ministry of Defence and basically none of them doubted this was all true frankly this is what people need to understand there was no laughter in the room they took it very seriously but they didn't want to stick their necks out and a friend of mine who's a big business guy he said well you know the way the world works now everyone wants to be first to be second when it's something tough I've always felt that something along the lines of alien contact if if they did have information there's no reason to let people know unless it's unavoidable I always felt like unless they were just gonna try to do some damage control and redefine what's happening I didn't I wouldn't think that they would ever come out about it it just doesn't seem like it would be something that would be advantageous to just start telling people about UFOs the idea is always that the government is our daddy and then our governments looking out for us brave the evidence points time and time again to that that that's horseshit and that's not really what's going on but you know my military adviser made the point years ago that because so many people I mean between five and ten percent of public have seen one of these objects many of them very close range let's get back to that because this is what we had talked about before when we got onto this people think the earth is ten thousand years old I think most of what people see is bullshit I think most yeah yeah no question about that most sightings I I did a show once for CBS called game show in my head and it was a hidden-camera game show I would put it earpiece in people's head and we were send them out onto the street and they didn't know what they had to do until they got there and we we said okay see that camera over there that's where that works for you there was a big news camera you're a news reporter and there was just a UFO sighting right above Hollywood Boulevard the problem is the witness took off so you need to grab someone who wasn't there and have them become a witness tell them exactly what you need to tell them to get them to do this get them to lie on camera then you need to get them to tell you that they were abducted and probed and I'm Sarah and we got people to do it like that well yeah no I have no doubt but you can do a shit yeah you can you can always do that but I'm talking about high-level military and the residual I mean for example we have multiple air of pilots for commercial airlines and the Air Force and this is one of the really great cases we have by the way the Japan Airlines case over Alaska in the 80s and the guy who is in charge of investigations for the FAA it was third from the top during the Reagan era he actually left that agency and brought the originals with him and gave them to us of the radar tracings of this thing that was the size of like 10 747s moving in a nonlinear way over the skies it was on civilian radar which way it was on military radar they scrambled f-16s it was on their radar and the Japan Airlines 747 pilot has testified to it and we have all of that in this case I've noted this okay all right so when we brought all that forward and this guy came for he says I'm one of these high-level government officials who actually has seen all this and has handled it but no one's asking the right questions so when you pull all that together and and then of course there will be events like the this thing that happened in Phoenix where you know eventually the Governor of Arizona Fife Symington came out later and at the time he ridiculed it but he had actually seen it and came out later ten years later in 2007 said yeah that was an ET craft almost certainly and I saw it and tens of thousands of people in the Phoenix area saw it and it was photographed and it was on radar and there were very trained people so you know you have to ask the question how many like that have to happen and you know on the other hand you know the things that we have in physics that are that are inferred through indirect measurements like black holes or articles of belief and faith or even the Big Bang Theory but when you have all of this and this is not just someone will Hollywood Boulevard who's making stuff up we have dozens thousands of people you have radar cases you have all this and so a lot of this is what's going to be in the film serious and because what I said to people is that the fact that people haven't seen this evidence doesn't mean that it doesn't exist it does exist I agree with you there are a lot of people who will see things and it'll be a planet rising or it'll be a meteor or it'll be military aircraft a satellite or it'll be a Canuck you know this is the other part of this there are a lot of things that are UFO sightings that are very legit and that's why I don't like the word UFO there are two categories of UFOs that once you eliminate all the nonsense you're talking about and they're the ones that are ATVs which is what they're called the NSA extraterrestrial vehicles and then there are the ones that are the electromagnetic devices we've been building since the 50s and if people think that propulsion and energy systems stopped in the 40s they need to think about this let's step back for a minute your car is running on an internal combustion engine circa my name is cuz I'm a man okay and I'm gonna drive a fucking sissy hybrid there you go I'm not driving a Prius it makes no noise yeah you should have liked that wasn't our electric one and then you'd really have some power it's too futuristic man I need Led Zepplin on the radio I need a little yeah good avenues of my life yeah well nobody that made this you know and the jet engine people think that was a refinery own jet so I came out here from DC I was 1930s Rockets 1940s Wernher von Braun does do people really think there have been no breakthroughs in energy physics and well sure the portal people absolutely know that we've been working on things like that but to bring up what you brought up earlier about the governor of Phoenix just to point out that the governor last of the Arizona rather the governor of Alaska Sarah Palin was one of those people that believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old so just because you're a governor something doesn't mean you're on the ball and second of all I have that were the in Phoenix and one of them very credible guy told me he saw some giant black triangle flying motionless over the sky he said it was bigger than several football fields he said it made no noise and ever locked out the the Stars and and flew over and he said everyone in his neighborhood was shitting their pants it was enough to me that I would go wow there's something there's too many people that saw something you'd attribute certain things to mass hysteria but that was one of them that I found to be very strange but I never heard any photographs you say photograph we have amazing photographs and video they're gonna be in the film serious you don't have them anywhere else so anybody see online your hardback no no no no no they're out there dr. Lynn khatai who's a medical doctor also took some of them there's other video photos of the Phoenix crafts yes the actual one yes so what should we want to look for one right now to put in this show right now we were online who who does he look for um I guess you'd go to dr. Lynn khatai site and tell him right spell her name ki ta i ka k ki ta i pulled it up right and see what images you have spider google in there you know I've never heard there's been photographs oh yes things what did what is the photo show it shows exactly what people described a formation of lights that were moving together in a massive sort of deformation right and the government said that those were flares right cause a couple hours later when they couldn't contain the news story on this I was there when this happened by the way you were in Phoenix I was there did you see it yeah what'd you say I'm what you said what you just described now you when why was I there okay another yeah did you get your spider call to Batman whatever fucking the thing a UFO just appears over your house like the bat sign remember when he's in trouble we need to send in Batman right no they don't I was actually there at a digital lab that was being loaned to us to put together coincidentally we're not coincidentally to put together the best photos and videos to give to Congress that I was briefing in April of 97 so in March from 97 I had gone there and there was a guy who had a digital laboratory who said look we'll let you use heroic whip assemble this will help you and he'd worked a lot with the military and so I had collected photos and videos from all over the world and governments from all over the world which we call the best available evidence and and put what I was putting it together because in April we were holding a closed briefing for members of Congress who wanted to know and that's when people like congressman Dan Burton who was chairman of the House Government Reform and oversight committee came and a whole lot of other people from the Pentagon and vice president's office and whatnot and and so I was there the when that happened and someone came running into the lab saying my god while we're here trying there's all this going on and it turned out it was on the news that night in Phoenix now interestingly the national news didn't pick up on it till June this happened in March which is very interesting they why did that get held back but you know and so there are so many people who saw it and this this was huge whatever this object was it was not the size of like a 747 a 747 you know you probably could put dozens of them inside the the volume of this thing it was huge I found it about interesting that these stories were very similar it's one of the things that I found most interesting I watched some stuff online and then when I spoke to my friend lives in Phoenix and he told me what he saw I was like wow you're talking about like at least six or seven people that are telling the exact same story of seeing this exact same sort of thing now these are the images that you're talking about these are just the whatever the red lights that are in the sky I think the video is probably more impressive being that the video shows these things essentially hover for a long period of time and much longer than really should be attributable to parachutes and flares it doesn't really make any sense because parachutes are flares they don't really move that slow when you you know you want to go jump out of a plane with a parachute the parachutes you know they these dry they slow your fall down but they don't make these bad wrap of it no and and we know we know how those kind of flares in pyramid but the people who are directly under it and it moved not just over this part of Phoenix it moved all the way from outside Flagstaff through the valley and then down towards Tempe now how did you no you were there working did you hear about it do you well there was a guy that ran into the lab and who had actually been in the military so you wouldn't believe what's going on so so yeah I was there that night and we do this 1997 March of 97 now what's equally interesting if you look at this now the Belgian Air Force cooperated with me very very nicely back in the early 90s in late 80s you may have remembered there was this a wave of things that happened in eastern Belgium where there are these massive triangles that were about 800 feet on each side that were photographed radar traced chased by f-16s and on it and we have all this and the head of the Belgian Air Force actually showed the radar of one of these objects going from hover to several thousand miles per hour straight up into space way outside the envelope of any normal conventional propulsion so they have a video of this radar radar radar of it and we and we have this so you know the question becomes how many of these cases do you need to have before you say there's something out there and and I think this is you know what I the problem it is that on this subject the ridicule around it and that the disinformation and the crazy stories that are out there is what dominates the serious pun intended perhaps the serious stuff really gets left on the cutting room floor by most movie directors and media and even on the internet it's very hard and I think the pick your way through it's very difficult what I've tried to do and it's not that I've done a perfect job of it I've done the best I can with a lot of help but remember we've never been funded we're all volunteer or effort um and so what we've tried to do is get people who have the really good stuff from governments come forward and share it and this is why you know when the space agency of France released a lot of their documents after oh I was having some meetings and in in France and with some of the scene you can't say it both was see the France or fright yes in a pic well is it was France when I was there and when it's here it's France and you know that there's an admiral that that works with us in France who's a wonderful guy and he's an MD and a PhD in an admiral and and you know he knows all this is very real and and so eventually the French government really I believe was about a hundred thousand pages of documents on all of this and and now a since the disclosure project launched it in ten or twelve years ago there are fourteen countries who've opened up their files now Chris the United States isn't because the United States has managed differently on this issue it's a compartment it unacknowledged for Soviet Union has actually been pretty open more more recently in more recent times when it first fell apart not so much now but when it first fell apart we have a great dossier of KGB cases and files and also military and and in fact some of the cosmonauts that had had encounters with these I pulled together in 1995 for a meeting with some of our astronauts like it grew Mitchell to have a meeting out here in California so you know there are some some really solid cases out of the Soviet Union does that commercial claim to have had a personal experience no no he's just investigated it and has concluded that this is all very real and he did come with me I invited him to the briefing we set up for the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff the Pentagon and I think it was a very interesting for him to have learned that people at that level were shaken to their foundations because they concluded this was all real but when they made enquiries they were being lied to and denied access and so this this brings up this question powder who's running this show mm-hmm and and who's over who the Fox is a garden henhouse and I and this is exactly goes back to Eisenhower's warning but you know you were 50 years into that era now and so half a century later as big of a screw-up as it was in 1961 when Eisenhower warned us about it it's ten times worse than that now and and so much so that I have concluded that the way we changed the dynamic on this is that the people will lead the leaders will have to follow we do the disclosure we bring out these technologies we set up teams to make contact and we just bypass the government the evidence that you have this or even possible evidence of this alien life before that this is a more recent thing this is fairly recent right before that what was the most compelling piece of physical evidence that you've ever encountered I would have to say that it's it's these really well-documented complex cases that involve documents radar cases with photographs and multiple corroborating credible witnesses what a pilot's landing sites oh yeah I mean we do and I actually have been given materials from where the sites of land and every anomalous what a great case that's in the French files that they release in the Japan was a Co Japan this the space agency like NASA release was the Provence case of 1981 I believe when one of these objects landed in a lavender field of all places were plus the smell awesome yeah well it was a commercial lavender farm and so cool and it was wee hours of the morning in this thing lands the farmer comes out and it's this disc shaped craft how long I think it was in the 50 foot diameter range and there were these little beans outside picking lavender now this sounds crazy like the motto science fiction like how little like your little guy know I remember like 4 feet 5 feet in that range and then it but it left this spot where it hit landed and if there were nomally x' electromagnetic a sort of radiation into the soil and this was actually studied by the french government included to be an absolutely real case just like the Bentwaters Royal Air Force Base case in England was was determined to be an authentic case of a landing so these sort of landing cases that have also now at the time there weren't many people coming forward now we have all these military people coming forward corroborating they were there they saw this and now the documents are getting released from the UK in France but in the United States it's still a black hole now we're gonna play your trailer for the upcoming film serious you got to pulled up Ryan is it here we sit 2012 with the world still burning oil and gas and coal when we have had all the information we need to have had a completely new civilization dr. Steven Greer is absolutely a hero in the council's of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex you know hundreds of billions of dollars into public with the little annoys alright sit down and shut up I was still Despres not to meditate I was told to talk not to listen I'm learning to listen the primary purpose is to train people to understand these other civilizations and their cultures I don't give a goddamn what anybody else says about it I saw that who do you tell without them looking at you like you ain't wrapped too tight and I was a part of the United States Air Force cover-up for 18 years what we are attempting to achieve is a device which repeats the perpendicular force of gravity when we look at our data we lost seven percent of weight we now have the technology to take e.t home consciousness is at once the most familiar thing to us and the most mysterious it doesn't take much effort if you just clear your mind people are afraid of looking at technology Paul Brown stuff got basically suppressed for many years Peter murdered the problem is not proving that UFOs exists is when you begin to expose the energy and propulsion system behind how they're getting here [Music] that little thing freaked me out really yeah well you know I don't mean to sound callous but being a you know doctor I've seen so many worse things but it's actually fascinating I mean meowww not that it's a dead body of some things it freaked me out that that might be a life-form by the way well it was a life-form we know for a fact it was a life-form what it was is what we're investigating and I think that you know you know one of our witnesses who was on a retrieval team of retrieving extraterrestrial bodies from craft that we had targeted you know it's talked about the fact that there are many different species that had been cataloged over the years and at one point I think it was in the late 60s there were like 68 or 69 or something in that range you know if you look at space and look at the stars probably every stable star system has planets around it they're discovering and there's the likelihood that there's an enormous diversity of life out there is it's a statistical certainty even the conventional astronomers and and the Drake formula will support that the question is you know have they gotten here well you most probably wouldn't be able to just like we weren't for thousands and thousands of years but is there there's such hubris to think that you know we're at the pinnacle of the technology on earth in 2013 we're off I see and I think that and I think that you know when you begin to look at the the progression of Technology once you reach a breakout point as we have in the last century here in fact most of the big breakthroughs and technologies no one knows about they exist but they're in a classified project and that's I think as big or a bigger story than the et story is the fact that there is a cabal of as I said sociopathic misanthropic folks who have decided their macroeconomic grip on power needs to be maintained through this sort of ruthless secrecy and where they keep from the public disinformation not because they think people are gonna hurl themselves off the Brooklyn Bridge because we're not alone in the universe but because when this comes out and this information comes out it means that the sciences already exist so that we can get off oil and gas and coal and you know what a goldman sachs guy said that's a six hundred trillion dollar nut you're cracking right there trillion and because if you look at all the oil in the ground the coal in the ground the commodities trading the petro dollar system the utilities the internal combustion engines all of that is defunct extinct stuff or should be and so here we are cannibalizing this planet for no good reason except that there's a handful of folks and you look at the that the sort of centralization of wealth and power there is in the world now it's the most extreme it's ever been in human history right now right this minute this instant so you know there's 200 to 300 individuals and corporations that have over half the net worth of the world you know the guy in the beginning of your video that says the euro genius David Wilcock do you know when their guy yes I know who yeah do you know that he also thinks that he's Edgar Cayce reincarnated and shows you pictures I have no idea that's news to me Edgar Casey's friends and how his friends look like Edgar Casey's friends really you ever watched any of that guy's lectures no I haven't yeah I mean some the team interviewed him but I do a little editing you might want to do a little editing with that one not saying that anything else in your documentaries bullshit but that guy makes my radar detector go off the the evidence that this this technology has been suppressed is there is there evidence that that like this free energy technology has been just there's a huge amount of evidence and and you did you reveal this matter there's a whole document trail and one of the things we got some years ago was a demand from the Department of Defense to the FBI that they turn over the secret papers of Nikola Tesla that were stolen and we have this document and you know what happened to them and what were they trying to hide the Federation of American scientists a very big mainstream organization in Washington that has a national security research project associated with the Federation America American scientists came out about two years ago with a report that there were 5,000 135 patents that had been seized under the National Security Act and that some of these things were energy related one of them in 1971 was only a solar photovoltaic generator you know we're from sunlight to electricity photovoltaic that was more than 20% efficient now you can't even get that now but meaning that was probably like 40 50 percent turning sunlight directly into electricity and it had a national security order slapped on it and this mainstream scientific group says how could that be a threat to national security it would have been a threat to the domination of oil and coal and the petrodollar system so you know this is not a conspiracy theory mm-hmm there are entities that have conspired and you look at the wealth and power behind these entities I mean people being killed for a lot less than this there really is that is such a loaded word that conspiracy it's unfortunate that it's necessary to use because it's been so co-opted well I think it's really more about special interests and cartels always acting in their interest and if you've got the power you're gonna use it and you know what here and here and here's the problem if the people allow it to happen and it obvious is read an article in The New Republic about this that if you whether you're you know letting Saddam Hussein or the Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi or whatever it is or you have to give them that power we give the power to the government ultimately by our passivity and so ultimately I you know I'm not one of these people who runs around saying oh well you know there's these boogie men that are doing everything and we're just hapless creatures if we're allowing it if we're not part of the solution were part of the problem if we're not if we're allowing it by our inaction and passivity because we're want to be bread and circus people sitting around eating you know Cheetos and watching jay leno which is fine but if that's all we're doing and we're not trying to fix this problem then you know obviously the passivity of the public and our politicians who don't want to risk their career or danger in that power vacuum you're gonna have these sort of people step and and and I think there's a power vacuum that existed for a little while after World War Two they gave an introduced fix and I think that it will continue for as long as we let them do it I think it's pretty obvious when you look at the fact that this is the age of information where information is being distributed more freely and more easily than ever before right yet this is also the age where the government is continuing to attack the bill of rights continuing to slowly but surely restrict our rights and civil liberties and make it so that if they deem you a threat to the nation in any way shape or form they can essentially detain you they don't have to do anything illegal they don't have to contact your family this is all stuff that's being passed now and that seems to me to point to the fact that they're looking at this what what what is that what's where where's it going what's if you look at it on a graph if you look at it if you project the future well it's going towards some ultimate free information space and if it gets to that then it's gonna be revealed exactly how much fucker he's been going on for all these decades and how much craziness has been going on behind the scenes and it's gonna come to a point in time where the government's gonna have to be accountable for where all the money goes every year in tax dollars and right now they're not you give them your tax dollars you don't get a receipt you don't know what the fuck happens there's a congressional budget meetings and they the Senate you know gets together and the president puts out his plan and the financial people get involved but how much access do we actually have as to where you're dr. Steven Greer financial records or your tax dollars go almost nothing no we don't know and you know even the folks who I know an auditor in it for the federal government who audits Northrop Grumman and he said one of the problems is that once you get to a compartment a compartmented project that's eyes only and it's unacknowledged they're not going to tell you anything they won't even acknowledge it exists so how is there any check and balance on that it's essentially a dictatorship yeah when it gets to that really you're you're essentially dealing with a dictatorship it's just dressed up as a democracy but their ability to act is completely there there they have total impunity they can do whatever the fuck they want they don't they don't they don't have to listen we if we let them if we and then here's the other problem with that you know is that the the macroeconomic system you know we're supposed to be a free-market economy well how free can the market be if there have been decades of confiscation and suppression of these advanced transdimensional energy devices in these so-called overunity free energy devices and if the if that's going on it can completely lace to waste the whole concept of a free market so yeah it's a free market if you want to tinker around the edges and come out with an iPhone 5 instead of an iPhone 4 or you know whatever version of this and that right but let's not forget that your computer that you think is so cool you're charging it off a grid that's a 1800s coal-fired power grid for the most part and so you know we really have to wake up to the fact that our society has been held back retarded really seriously by this kind of secrecy and so this secrecy is actually becoming a threat to our continued not just her liberty but it's an existential threat to the planet and moreover it keeps forcing all these unintended consequences where we stay encamped in the Middle East and you know the buzzword in Washington because of our vital national security interests well that's code for oil just forget the BS that means oil because you say well what about Israel Israel has two or three hundred nuclear weapons and they might live there for three years believe me when I tell you they can take care of this I mean you know if there's an existential threat to Israel you know they can handle it they don't need Big Brother America there but don't they mean isn't it don't they get a tremendous amount of funding from us and weapon they get funding but I'm just saying we don't that's not the reason we're in all those vast areas of the Middle East it's because of the oil and of course and and you know and this becomes a question of why well because if you have a device that would fit on the table here that run your house we need to be on the grid or your carpet in the boot of your car and you have enormous amount of power electric how would that work those are called zero point or quantum vacuum electromagnetic generators and basically through very high voltage systems you create a vector into this baseline energy field that it really holds the universe together and you know they start talking about the higgs field and the negative energy of the matter of the universe but for years it's been proven that the zero-point energy field exists through the what's called the Casimir effect and I won't get into the Arcana of the physics of it this is published in mainstream journals the question is how do you tap it and can you the answer is yes and it happened but they keep suppressing scientists and inventors who come up with it there's a man that I know who worked at Lawrence Berkeley labs and he was using a coil array around a barium titanate crystal and using very high voltages with a certain hertz certain pulses he was able to get 10 times more energy out than was going in because the crystalline structure was tapping into this zero-point energy field that is in the fabric of space and time so there's an enormous amount of power it's been estimated at every cubic centimeter of space not outer space of space in this room has enough energy to roam the earth for a day if you could tap it so the question becomes if you can do that you're not going to need to have your car filled up at a gas station or utility took on it or whoever it is and those sort of interests have trumped the technical ones the technological issues I believe it can be fixed it's the strategic issue that's the problem I'm gonna stop you because I need to know about this experiment where was this taking place this is as peer-reviewed is this something that has been it was confiscated the man that had this happen it's a physicist mm-hmm and some goons broke into his lab broke it up at the experiment and then basically took him and put him in a mental hospital hospital for a while where'd this happen Lawrence Berkeley labs in the 80s okay so 70s or 80s know exactly what he did and is it reproducible yep I think so why has no one reproduced this it doesn't make any sense because you have to have a whole lot of specialized equipment to do it right and people have tried what they hear it now here's getting to they're really the reason I'm this film mm-hmm is that a hundred percent of the proceeds from it are gonna go in to build a new energy lab so all this stuff that we've collected can be done I think with the intelligence we've gathered in between one and two years we will come out with at least a generation 1.0 of these energy systems because I have thousands of pages of documents on this and many many physicists who've worked in these programs but you've got to have a properly equipped lab you've got to have security you've got to have the whole world watching and this would not be a secret project like the skunk works at Lockheed this would be I would in my it'd be like this would be streamed so all the work going on in that lab the whole world's watching okay sorry because I don't think you can do this incredibly how come you know about this story how come you know about this experiment tapping into zero-point energy but this is not common knowledge amongst nuclear physicists this is not something that's discussed in the mainstream news this is not something that you can find information online and an any credible source no-one is reka it seems to me that if there was an experiment that tapped into such an unbelievably unlimited supply of energy like that it would be impossible to keep this under wraps that you would keep the be able to keep the conversation under wraps no it's not true and in fact if you go to the website serious disclosure calm there's a portal there to the energy research and there are thousands of documents and pages of stuff things that were reported in the media and then they got confiscated and shut down but Europe you're asking this question is if academia and the media are operating freely none under the suppressive behaviors and and I am actually in the question actually because just the nature of human curiosity and an incredibly brilliant intelligent men that are out there that study energy I would think that someone would look into this and examine it okay well there is and in fact one of the people that we had were funding for a while before he got threatened by a former CIA director who went down to his skiff it's a secure communication intelligence facility was an understudy of William s bender at the University of Washington he got threatened in what they said in 1974 Aarthi was 74 he formed a company and he's a brilliant too one of the most brilliant people I've ever met who and he had developed these transdimensional systems using electromagnetic energy and some guys came in with a national security order told him that they were confiscating his equipment his device his notes they were all going into the vault right and this man's going to very well who stayed at my home and it still works for under contract with CIA in various groups he said that basically of the intelligence community owns his soul and that he can only do only so much take it to provide information and bring this out and you know people who think that doesn't happen are living in a very naive world this is 40 years ago though you're talking about yeah and it would happen 71 oh that was 40 years ago when hit when the thing he started then when he after I developed a relationship with him he checked with his intelligence in what they called his Shepherds his and his handlers in the intelligence community they said yes you can work with dr. Greer not on the propulsion stuff that flies around like a UFO but just some the energy generation part of this and so we provided a grant to him through my project the Orion project so the government limits his ability to do research on specific topics well he actually is on the payroll the government now because he was basically told it's this so you have no career at all and if he had disclosed what he had been Bennett in 1974 under the national security order he was hit with he would been imprisoned so and these exist you can look it up it's section 180 181 of the patent law in the National Security Act these national security orders happen all the time so but whose author I think Oh President Obama or the or the Senate Intelligence Committee knows that these goons were out there doing this stuff no and so here is this brilliant guy but I mean he's not like he's Rambo I mean he's an engineer and a physicist so he develops his stuff a bunch of guys come in who are badass folks okay and he's terrified and so then all these years later it circles back around we get hold of him and obviously look ok here's you know some funds do this for us oh no you know generation 1.0 version of this something and check with your intelligence folks and they cleared him about the time he was beginning to put this thing together a former CIA director with a bunch of goons came down in 2010 this is two years three years ago threatened him threatened his family and so will they say don't like house that you are not going to do this any further and made it very clear one of the guys at the naval research labs I've worked with for years who had some of this information he was though we will kill you your wife your children and your grandchildren if you step out of line on this so I don't think that you know in terms of dealing with this that you're going to be able to do it under any kind of where someone's trying to do it quietly secretively it's gonna have to be in plain sight so what you're saying is that several people have tried to do this in the past hundred every time and every time they do it they're threatened and stopped from doing it right what specialized pieces of equipment would be necessary to produce this zero-point energy field thing well first of all um you know your your computer and lights here running on 110 or 220 all right voltage the voltage is involved in these transdimensional physics is in the thousands to millions of volts but at very low current and so you have to have special analyzers and generators for that so I mean there is a science to this and we understand it very very well actually but building up that lab you know we looked into the equipment just is like half a million dollars just to do that and so what you have to do is it seems like nothing if you're talking about half a million dollars that can promote just the equipment no no there's no no building no personnel no staff no nothing just you know the Machine yeah so but so I estimate we have a budget for about a two-year program around six million dollars to put a lab together but these really brilliant people in it get the right equipment and build up these experiments and do real science but the problem is you have people off on their own doing this that stumble across this phenomenon and they get shut down or threatened or bought out then you know you have the folks who will be instead of threatened they'll just be offered money you know so a lot of people dr. Bearden tells the story of a man that had one of these generators and and he was testing it it was a legitimate over system and then the guy disappeared and the next time you saw the guy he had a Ferrari and an Armani suit and the guy never had a pot to pee in as it were and and and you know what we found with this is that a lot of times folks will just say look you know we're gonna buy this and a lot of people don't believe that happens and they think that's a conspiracy theory it isn't a conspiracy theory and this is why the Federation of American scientists when they said look they're 5135 or something like that patents that have been seized most people don't know that those national security orders can happen outside of the patent process so even if you're not going the patent route they can go in there and just seize the damn thing and what are you gonna do they just seize it based on the idea that it's somehow another threat well there you I mean it's kind of like the flag in the Bible may you be wrapped yourself in these things to do all kinds of outrageous behaviors yes but I mean you can say it's national security but as this one document from from the Federation of American scientists says how could a solar voltaic system be a threat to the national security it would be a threat to the special interests that are calling the shots so the question becomes who's really calling the shots on these sort of decisions is it in the interests of we the people no it's in the interest of folks who want to protect their cartels what is your take on guys who have come clean before guys like dr. Robert Lazar cuz I got full of shit he's the guy from area 51 that came back and said that he was right back engineering some alien craft and very compelling to listen to very interesting guy before I understand dr. Stanton Friedman questioned him and in fact called him a fraud and said that some of his educational background was kind of made-up right but and here's the problem with any case where you hang it on one person like that is very risky and that's why I've tried to resist that and when we when we started putting together the people who knew about the the nuclear facilities with their UFOs coming over I didn't want one or two I wanted half a dozen or dozen that's what we have well you get the more spectacular the cases if it hangs on one person the writ and the other question is where's the raishin so I think that that's why we try to focus on that now I will say that the areas out in the Nellis range and nobody by the way calls it area 51 but will this say that because unlike pollute Mesa s 4 s 3 s 12 and actually this National Reconnaissance Office document from the 1990s lists those facilities there properly you know well that's a blackjack control they had to apply for additional land before that they denied it entire right right they had to apply for additional land because people were getting so close so they could film footage of some of these crafts that they were experimenting on and that's not bullshit if you've ever seen oh there's no one knows yeah no one knows what those things were but the way they were moving was extraordinary they moved unlike any craft that we know I would assume that if you look at what we're doing today in all different parts of the world with drones especially these drones that have Hellfire missiles that you know you can be fairly accurate when you're considering that they're being operated by someone halfway across the world right that this probably has something to do with what they were working on back then when they're making these things fly around and do all these crazy turns and twists in the sky no because the drones that are being reported are conventional propulsion systems either Jets or with what we're talking about are things that are moving in a way that is outside the envelope of normal aerodynamic behavior in other words you cannot take something with a normal propeller or jet engine and accelerated at 20,000 miles per hour make a right-hand turn and we have photos and images of these things doing this so when you're doing that that's gonna you're your brains are gonna come out of your nose if you're a pilot and even a conventional object is gonna be blown to smithereens by the inertial forces of that kind of turn and deceleration I think we'll be talking about two different things though you know I'm not I think sane but you're talking about things that have been seen in space no I'm talking about things that at area 51 at area 51 and also all over the world that have been documented moving in this way those are moving and I'm quoting actually of general de Brouwer of the the belgian air force chief who said this is outside the envelope of any conventional aerodynamic system i'm not questioning that but what i am saying is that the things that i've seen as far as videos from area 51 with these these unidentified objects whatever they were moving across the sky they weren't moving that fast there were no well they were moving right conventional speed oh that's convinced well so that could be but I'm talking about the things that I know that have been imaged out there including a daytime object we have a great video what is this video you showing us this is uh lower your mic forty-nine quadcopters and outdoor formation flight that yeah let me see that it's pretty pretty bad at the video this is these are these are conventional you could actually buy these right not these uh I I'm not sure they DARPA was this DARPA shit this is ARS electronica oh yeah well actually you can buy a little miniature down so we could see yeah if you've never seen this what they can do now is really extraordinary I mean this is all these drones moving or what do you call them what are they're just like little toys almost yeah they are yeah but I I'm sure a lot of people saw this in the sky was like oh my god what the fuck's that and called it you know UFOs yeah how they move I mean this is really amazing stuff they move in a geometric pattern in the sky or it that mimics galaxies alright cool so we know that there's some things that I mean these are obviously terrestrial crafts this is something look at look at they're doing I mean that's amazing this is not UFOs this is identified flying I mean not everything that people see that they don't know what it is is a UFO I mean it's uh nickname ap flying but you know I'm talking about things that are really quite amazing like this one photograph we have of this triangle that's going like this and it makes a right-hand turn eagle and it's going in the more let's now for a video photo would yeah can we see this somewhere it's I don't know where the dark it's gonna be in the film but it's gonna be in a film but it's it's available online isn't it I mean it must I don't know how long has this been around for I'll have to look it up we mean I don't have you I don't have a cut of the film in but I you know this is one you know there are a number of these but this is a very compelling piece of evidence yes is amazing why wouldn't you put that on line immediately and say hey you got a look at this this is a compelling piece of evidence I think it is online somewhere but I mean I just can't tell you where you know we we have thousands of pages on our website you can go to if you go to serious disclosure calm you can click through and there's a whole photo gallery and all kinds of stuff okay go on but I don't know if this particular one is in that photo gallery but for example you look at the the Vancouver Island photograph of a few years ago on everything it was in the 80s day time disc with a dome it is not photoshopped it was studied at NASA Ames it's probably the clearest photograph ever taken broad daylight mm-hmm and you know what is that well you know it's just like these ones from Belgium where you have these photographs of these big triangular objects and their photo and video of those matching up with radar cases and jet pilots chasing them I'm done with those kind of things there's actually more than people can imagine that's out there ok so there's enough of these things where if you look at believe me choukaku said 5% of all UFO sightings are completely unexplainable to find laws of physics and it may possibly be in his opinion something that we don't understand or could be possible so that's what I'm talking about the other stuff you know I'm here what do you think they're doing here it's a 64 trillion dollar question yeah I think I think there are a number of things number one I don't think they're it's new at all I don't think there's a new phenomenon there's enough material out there from ancient times that would indicate that these objects have been around since recorded history I mentioned this earlier in the show but secondly I think this stage of our evolution these civilizations are rather concerned about our potential to destroy this planet and ourselves but also the fact we're going into space we have not become peaceful and in their classified projects we have things way beyond the International Space Station so with that we could become an existential threat to other planets potentially so I think that there is a concern about that and I think that you know what they're all these movies you know Los Angeles and Independence Day and blah blah floral avatar the other way you know it's a yeah and it's such to me it's like okay yeah it's like when I went to wright-patterson Air Force Base where they had the the Blue Room that Barry Goldwater tried senator Goldwater tried to get in and you know the routine yeah yeah yeah wasn't that but but the thing is is that that's on hangar 18 wright-patterson Air Force but yeah but it's this is a different thing at wright-patterson Air Force bright it was called the Blue Room is that where supposedly the Roswell wreckage was something yeah the air material command and then when I was there that by the way very compelling piece of evidence and that might have been something serious going on other than a weather balloon the fact that two separate planes were used to send this wreckage because the in case one of them went down right it was so historically significant I have that that newspaper the Roswell Daily Record I have that page on the wall yeah in my house and I look at it all the time it's a fascinating I mean it's it's essentially a press release by the military saying we've recovered a crash disk before they pulled it back yeah yeah yeah it's amazing because that's um that's a big statement you know I mean you look at all the things that could have been they could have been wrong about like oh it could have been something else and but that the fact that they came out and said it's a crash disk that had never been done before that really was one of the the first I think some heads rolled over that press release but because they had to pull it back well then they did that ridiculous dog and pony show where they brought out this shitty looking aluminum yeah it kind of looks like a mylar thing it's hilarious that that's quite hilarious and the government I've always I mean if you just look at the history deception that the government has in in dealing with the American public from the get-go and whether it's with the Gulf of Tonkin incident or whether it's the what happened with the the Contras and the Sandinistas using I mean you know taxpayer dollars and black ops from selling cocaine and the ghettos of Los Angeles to fund rebel armies if you just look you've got to know they're not telling the truth why would they tell the truth if it was just a weather balloon would they really put on this fucking dog and pony show where they'd have a general sit there and what was a colonel whoever it was on his knees pointing out all the relook at this he is just wrecking right that's what Colonel Corso said yes you know he was there's no question that this was something very legitimate and and in fact you know when Barry Goldwater senator Goldwater who had McCain seat before John McCain took it in Arizona I was at his home some years ago and he had left the Senate and he told me he said look he says it was a goddamn mistake then it's a goddamn mistake now that this was ever kept secret but he was an Air Force Reserve general and he told me senator Goldwater said look I asked Curtis LeMay general LeMay to get me into the Blue Room at wright-patterson because I wanted to see this stuff cause he had heard reports from other pilots about UFO encounters and senator go go order uh told me that Curtis LeMay said look Barry I can't even get into that area anymore and if you ever ask me about this again I will personally see that you were court-martialed out of the Air Force Reserves this to a city settings senator and a guy who'd run for president of course in 1964 suddenly whether it actually happened ya know that's you know amazing those stories well I was sitting there with the senator and I have a guy who was there with me and you know what I'm when I asked him was was was curse LeMay serious he said yeah like a heart attack he says I never brought it up again and so the question becomes you know when you have someone like Curtis LeMay who admits and if you google who he was who admits to the fact that at a certain point even he was being kind of sidelined in terms of access of it this information and then threatens and says something like that to a sitting powerful US senator did they were good friends I mean they were buddies you know there's there's something going on here and I've heard too many accounts like that from these sorts of people and I think it's a it's a time for people to understand that you know ruthless people our out there and they do this sort of stuff so you know when when what happened for the last 60 years continues to go on and on and on you know you the the people who try to move into this who are politicians in depending the same buzz saw the senator goldwater did these incredibly powerful technologically advanced beings that come here from another planet and are concerned with the fact that we've developed the power to blow ourselves up but yet lack the understanding the intellect or the the the spiritual capacity to recognize what the dangers and the repercussions of those actions would be but what are they are they is anybody communicating with them does anybody have a message from them does is there anything that they say will be done if we keep fucking around I mean is there is is is there like any any any doctrine that they're trying to push on us oh I don't know if there's any doctrine I think they're waiting for us to reach you know you mentioned this physicist Mitch about you know a level one civilization or level two where we begin to behave in a halfway civilized way so that we could be quite open in our contact but I think you know I think everyone always says well why don't they just land on the White House lawn or so I said Yeah right who's White House right humans are says we rule America right yeah yeah so but maybe the White House in bogota colombia i think the question is is turns it the whole issue upside down what do we have to do as a people in a civilization to be able to go into space and have open contact with these civilizations quite in a overt way as opposed to episodic way and i think that requires us to begin begin to behave peacefully it certainly requires that we not begin to weaponize space and that we stop doing things that are incredibly self-destructive but i you know the idea that they're gonna land here and in for it's like us going to afghanistan think we're gonna impose Jeffersonian democracy on a medieval feudal society really that never has worked so I think these civilizations are smart enough to know that that isn't the way this is going to happen they humans have but the the problem is that I kind of think we're running out of time to get some things right things that should have been fixed a hundred years ago like living together peacefully bringing out these technologies that we don't the biosphere eliminating poverty in the world you know 48% of the the public doesn't have a pot to pee in literally they went indoor plumbing mmm on this planet 48% of the 7 billion people up you won't know that so you know I think that until we begin to fix some of these larger problems and the good news about all this is that it's fixable and the means the technologies to do that are already in existence so if they're already in existence and this science has been studied and suppressed and studied and suppressed for decades it means that we as a people have to come together and say all right we're gonna do this and and I think this is why the sort of its use the word activist but advocacy part of what we're doing is that people are always expecting someone else to do this mmm you know and I think people have to say no each of us have to be responsible for the planet and for our future and kind of creating a good future you can't look to Big Brother to do it and I don't think you should look through the ETS to do it it's not that they're not gonna help us if we at some point we reach the point of being functional yeah it's supposed to dysfunctional but I I think the prime movers have to be the people we the people and my mom's family were some of the original people in the American Revolution with that terrible to say we were one of the first prisoner of war with the British but um but I think about the fact that you know you had this ragtag bunch of people in the American Revolution taking on the most powerful Navy and most powerful empire in the world of time the British Empire I think people have to see that within the human spirit we have the means to do this and a lot of people give too much power to where I don't think it should be provided to these covert groups and these sort of cartels I think again I'm getting back to this idea of empowerment where we have exactly the power we're willing to manifest and no more but if we're going to sit on our hands and expect someone else to do it we're in trouble and there's been too much of that and and there's there needs to be I guess some moral courage here and I you know this is what sickened me about you know the politics of the media and then all these scandals like you were talking about with betrayus and you know during the clinton era the monica lewinsky thing I called the blowjob heard around the world that it's just so much nonsense yeah where is these big issues are the moral issues and as I see it you know well I think if you look at us as a being as an entity and our progress in this on this planet it's so staggering over such a short period of time that I think our minds our ability to pass down information all of these things lag behind we're essentially waking up in the middle of history as a as a as a race of beings humans we're waking up in the middle of a massive amount of momentum as you're born you are born into a race that is moving in an incredibly powerful direction that it's very hard to stop and it's also the same animal that just 20,000 30,000 go back as far as you want where we were essentially tribal monkey-people right I mean that's that's all of those instincts that allowed us to get to 2013 are all encoded in our genome all of those instincts all of those reward systems are all encoded and all of those awards reward systems that whether you look back to Napoleon or Genghis Khan or look at any war figure any Dominator in throughout human history the people in power have always tried to keep in power and suppress others what I do they do and but I think also if you look at the power of technology to overwhelm everything including the head spook of the CIA I mean he was essentially overwhelmed by email that's what took him over you know I mean it was it was the FBI looking anythings but essentially was all done through electronic means it was all done through he was revealed by the very powers that the CIA uses in the first place they're spies in the National Security Agency spy was spied on it's you know in my opinion when I look at human history and I look at where the try to extrapolate when I try to extrapolate where we're going it seems to me that it's all symbiotically connected to technology and that seems unavoidable that's why I have such a hard time with the idea of someone creating some zero-point energy thing that's not that people aren't looking into enough people know about what Tesla was working on enough people are fascinated by the ideas of wormholes and I just would think that more people would be involved in this and that the government with all its shady nefarious arms wouldn't be able to put out all of those fires but a lot of its self censoring for example I'll give you a really good example there was an academic guy that I was talking to recently and he was wanting to push into this issue and basically he was told no you're not going to do at this university because this is violating the second law of thermodynamics and blah blah blah you know it in a rational world which is what you're talking about I would agree with you but we don't live in a rational world we live in a world where there are a lot of emotions and power hierarchies and all kinds of dysfunctions and so you have to factor that into the equation and I don't think you can underestimate the reach of the national security state not just here but around the world to put out these fires no matter how many times they try to surface unless it's done in a very large way and I and I didn't believe that and I've learned the hard way trying to do it it was in a smaller fashion from the Sun like the story I told you about this the scientist who works in a skiff down near the Huntsville Space Flight Center Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville and and I think what we are going to have to do is organize an effort that is very much outside of government mainstream corporations in even academia because academia if you have never been in it is so political I mean you know that you know you touch these sort of issues and it's the end of your career I'll give you a great story in terms of other institutions you know the National Science Foundation is a very big player and global warming studies and all this kind of stuff and the deputy director of that and dr. Bob Carell and I had a long meeting with with another person who was one of the five directors of NASA that some years ago and I and you know he was very interested in exactly your talk about these sciences and studies and I said look we need some people at the National Science Foundation to really take this on as an area of research development funding etc he says it'd be then in my career if I did this I said well you know here it's the future of the earth or your career what are you gonna choose let's choose the earth in our future but the truth is everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time and a lot of folks are not going to jeopardize their careers and their income a very famous astronomer who worked with Carl Sagan was at our meetings in 1997 that we did for Congress and after he did that with us he was told if he ever ones who be published again write again or have a career in astronomy he'd have to leave this issue alone so he was directly threatened and he begged me to you know keep going forward but that he couldn't be part of it and so I think that you know most people don't realize that this happens every day and it's kind of a miracle that this this many military and corporate intelligence people came together this far but I won't even begin to tell you what we've gone through trying to get this far it's been very difficult and and so for every person you hear about and that you see in this film serious or or in the disclosure project there are a hundred that wouldn't that that have given me the information and even documents and intelligence but they don't want to come out and be identified so there's a lot of fear of either reprisals but also just the ridicule founder you know I have a document from 1953 from the CIA that talked about engaging Disney Studios to make cartoonish movies about this issue so that it would be the butt of jokes and and and and this document talks about the psychological warfare value of the subject so you know people are you know in middle school where you're worried about what are people gonna think about me if I say I think this is real are you gonna lose credibility if you're a doctor or physicist or a ninja project Bluebook wasn't that no it is predated this this this actually predated that when they were first coming together with how do we manage this because it's hidden in plain sight people are gonna see these objects there's no way to really sanitize it you you know people think you can really get rid of this well you can if there is certain number of people seeing this all the time we were highly credible so but if you created a media an environment where it's ridiculous and you're considered a kook or this or that if you're identified with it or you'll be you know Governor Moonbeam or senator space-cadet or something and this is one of the real problems is that the subject has been so ridiculed and there's so much ridiculous stuff out there on the subject that's provably nonsensical that credible people really have to swallow hard have to tell you the scientists that are at this major Ivy League university doing the work on this little body this little humanoid type body you know it's big big thing for them to be working on this and it's even a bigger thing that they're gonna go on the record about their findings what are they gonna do this in the next well you'll see on April 22nd come to the premiere I'll come to the premiere but on April 22nd what if no one has made some sort of a public statement no Ivy League scientists no we're going to so yes you're promising between now and April 22nd there'll be some sort of a reveal what will happen releases major institution scientists of credible history will step forward and say hey this is this is something well we don't know what they're gonna say they're still doing the run on the genome well use extraordinary if it's real if it's it's a if it is okay let me have the rest right now you touched it yeah I've touched it we have the cat scans we have the reports from these top scientists the only thing left that we're doing is running the genome which is the whole genome so that scientists have said that it's absolutely a biological origin that yes not it's not like my werewolf no it's not a Rob no this we know this we absolutely know and you put that to rest has this damaged your credibility in life I mean have you have you suffered because of this in any way shape form sure of course in what way every way yeah you know it's been the hardest thing you know I tell people the worst days in the ER or you know how the three-year-old that died in my arms this has been harder so you know it's harder than the death of a little baby really yeah but this stuff we've had to deal with like way horrible stuff I don't really only go into I mean we've probably on time but every nasty thing that can be done has been done or attempted be done too many of us and and particularly to to us my family and not my family so much is is you know targeting me with nastiness of those just unbelievable ridicules and they're always know beyond that threats rent and yeah people threaten you to what stop talking about UFOs you know problems of what we've had with them a lot of security problems I mean there's an FBI file / open on this because of the death threats and this stuff we've had really and so you that these death threats are from these people that you're exposing that are in the Cabal of this one who knows where they're coming from you could just say it was some nutjob like the people who shot up the the Sikh temple we're writing our directors family as you know yes his father was murdered horribly at this thing and uh but you know I'm just saying that it's a lot easier being an emergency doctor than dealing with this issue when you know it's real and you're dealing with this level of intelligence that CIA has affected your career yeah I've left medicine not because I had to no I mean but because I had to choose how I put this you only have 24 hours in a day and you know at a certain point I had to decide I'm either gonna continue as a physician or I'm gonna go full steam on this now of course it was a big sacrifice for my family I was given up hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a doctor to do this for nothing alright so it's been difficult so I so I'm saying it's been difficult in every way but that's not important I'm not important it's no BUTT STUFF it is important and you're you that's it's a tremendous sacrifice especially because it's something that you would truly believe in how do you support yourself now well I have enough resourcefulness I before I left medicine I bought my home and I'd saved enough and invested enough that I'm okay and then I have a little bit of income from some of the books and things but I mean it's very modest compared to you know what I would have been making I you know I probably in the aggregate have given up around somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six million dollars in income doing this which I actually don't regret at all because I don't care about the money I carry some people say that hmm I hate when people say no I really don't I mean this is why you know now this that you deal probably strain credulity here but a former head of Army Intelligence approached me in 1992 and offered me the kind of control over a two billion dollar fund if I would shut up and close down the disclosure project can see city of control over a two billion dollar funny with a b210 what what did he want you he just basically what I could do anything with it so long as I would shut you could just go Big Pimpin giant yacht Ferrari who knows no no more dr. Greer and then you know and I said no I'm not gonna do that because I really believe that this issue needs to be dealt with properly indeed the guy went to my wife and tried to convince her to convince me and this you know this is the kind of money did he want you to work for him he just wanted you to yes he wanted me to merge what are you were doing with some operation he had which would have basically subsumed it and and co-opted it and and I said no and then he made another run and I said no and then about a month after that all over the internet it came out that I wasn't even a doctor Here I am in this emergency department and it's a bunch of goons put out there that I'm not even an actual MD and I'm there you know up to my eyeballs in blood and guts and in the ER and this thing breaks so you know they do all kinds of disinformation and psychological warfare stuff on people but I don't really mind that that's happened what I'm more concerned about is the people who have the knowledge and responsibility who don't do the right thing because there's no way that I can do this by myself and and what I was really gratified to see and I'm still gratified to see is you're all these people the military men and women and others who have come forward very courageously academics like the ones doing that the work on this potential little humanoid creature which is of real creature whether it what it is we don't know but they it's a really courageous thing for these people to be doing that the the people who led the charge in France that to release all these documents I know the backstory to that that the public doesn't know and there were it was very controversial so I mean this is the kind of courage we need to get the truth out and to go forward as a civilization and so you know you can't buy it you got to have it you're gonna manifest it from inside are you getting income from this no you don't get any income from them no this is you know and you know what's beautiful about serious the movie is that it was all crowdfunded no month no one on my team has taken any funds from it's all going into the production of the movie you don't even take a salary no oh no no it's all gone into but no but you list expenses like that don't you list like the several hundred two hundred seventy thousand dollars or something expenses that you charge to create this this film well yeah or that's the production company you know because I'm not a filmmaker right I don't ask me to turn on cancer so we have people to this production company and yes and then of course we're gonna you know we have to organise the premiere and of course being crowdfunded you have to fulfil all the incentives for the crowdfunding I don't know if you know crowdfunding yeah I want to thank everyone who's listening by the way yeah we did Kickstarter and then our own private program and you know we have like 4,000 people who have contributed funds to this which is really a huge number of folks and and by the way all of you folks who've done that the I just wanted to say this it is the premiere is gonna be here in Los Angeles on Earth Day April 22nd at the LA live the Regal LA live cinemas downtown the premier theater and so that's April 22nd if you want to come you can kind of sign up and get tickets at serious disclosure calm I'm writing that in my calendar right now I'm gonna try to make that that sounds really fascinate we for us and you're inviting your comments my guests please get out of it I love to have you as my guests if you want I would love to go we're gonna have a red carpet and we're going to invite some other you know people here in Hollywood and in the business and it's gonna be an exciting event I mean the theater only holds eight hundred nine people of which about half of those seats already spoken for but but you know those of you want to come you know just hop online and you know the system is set up so you can do it all digitally no it's not gonna meet tickets at the door though okay what is this thing that you're doing where you lead people out into the desert and you have them make contact with something Furio crafts and beings and what what what is that well that's the whole ce-5 concept that was talking about closing hours of the fifth kind that we're using these different protocols and by the way there's gonna there's a smartphone and iPhone app for this that you can get it serious disclosure calm so it has all the it'll actually turn your phone into a magnet magnetometer it has the tones that were recorded in this crop circle of this weird energy that came into the crops on my phone right now yes you can what is it called it's called the contact app it's in it and it's at it's at you can go to serious disclosure calm and there's a an icon there and you can link and it goes to the either the iTunes Store or the Android store okay and tell me what happens when you take these pill take anyone out there do they have to go through a screening process yeah there's an app I mean it's a course it's a we do about a week training of people and remote viewing and the protocols of contact and their sort of the whole concept of it but also how to look at the night sky you go out with satellite charts we have fourth-generation night scopes we have really good cameras and you know in fact we're going to be doing one in Colorado in June in the high desert I have some land up there what is the actual name of this app because there's a couple contact apps well again you have to go to serious disclosure calm and there's a link there for it I you know the name of the name of your own app hey you know why I have so many of irons in the fire I think it's called you contact us oh let T contact me let me try that ET contact up so and explain to me what what happens here you have a course and in this course what are these people do the idea is is that we want to see right that's your your signal yeah but is that it so I just bought your app powerful okay so explain to me where would someone sign up for something like this mm-hmm yeah and we do these expeditions a few times a year I used to you know there are only about 20 people who are allowed to come now money at a time because I can't handle more than that for a week out in the desert or out in the mountains but and I just have time to do it more often than the four or five times a year that we do so you said I do it quarterly mm-hmm you well yeah the seasonally but the schedule is up at serious disclosure calm there's a place where do you bring these people this depends I mean like where the next one's gonna be in the high desert of Colorado at about 8,000 feet there's a remote area near the Great Sand Dunes that's had a lot of reports of UFOs and contact in fact the film director and his crew were out there last June a few months ago in 2012 when we had this disc fly over and then a jet came in to intercept it and just and that's gonna be in the film it's really cool you have a video of that or a moto that both really so you have a video of this disc in the sky and then a jet approaching a discount this be coming out Colorado Springs so it's coming out of that direction but yeah it's really pretty cool and of course I think when when the director saw this he went wow and who put this video together who made it who filmed it the film crew the first serious so you Wow so you know you have this you have like we don't want to make sure that was real clear this you have thousands of these videos where there's one yeah if you go again to this website you'll see that there's a section for the with the contact expeditions and the c-5 expeditions and a couple years ago we were up till now there's a mountain north of here called Mount Shasta near the Oregon border in the Cascade Range and and it's a volcanic Mountain and we've gone up there a number of years and we've had these objects that have appeared and one of them was actually in the field we had our night-vision camera running and it lifts it up and does this and then there's like this corkscrew and dematerialize in the sky we have this on videotape and it was during one of these expeditions and it's a really amazing bit of video is ball lightning a real phenomena oh yes sure sure and that's not this is clear skies no weather but coming up from the ground but don't they but but doesn't ball lightning to have something to do with there's there's certain types of visual phenomenon that have to do with tectonic plates and pressure and stress piezoelectric yeah what do you know what that's very different also that'll be just sort of a discharge like an electrical dish or see it and that's from the rocks and usually it's when there's quartz the pressure of it and an electromagnetic energy will build up and it'll burst out but you know this is an object and you can see it quite clearly and it's though it's right at the edge of the speed of light because it's kind of coming in and out of this dimension it's a really great video and there were like 3040 people who saw this happen so we do this I've been doing this for 22 years and what people do you show up there Brian what is a was one of these objects that came over I think that was at melchester I'm not sure it's my laser and it's this object that came right over and you know we also trained people to always go out with satellite charts know what you know so you know when the settle this is your footage mm-hmm of this thing flying in the sky yep whoa and that's your laser that's my I have a big you know it's a one of these I got one of those yeah it'll go well it'll go 100 200 miles into space do now when you when you were filming this are you trying to contact them like what each other we had so we do the protocols where you do the remote viewing set up the vector to show them where you are we play these electronic tones in the space and then have electronic field detectors out there so we'll have magnetic-field detectors various laser detectors other electromagnetic spectrum and those will begin to go off and then we'll have an object fly over like this object here that was right near us it comes to Triton outside so what people have to understand is that if you have an object that is coming in and out of dimensions it's not going to necessarily look like a 747 or even a flying saucer it's going to be in various inter forms and this is the weird sort of effect most people don't understand that 99% of the time an interstellar civilization doesn't have to be in linear space-time if they have that kind of physics so what happens when you go beyond the speed of light all right you're gonna not have anything visible but if you begin to have an energy discharge into an area of space and it's very close to this dimension you'll start to give off an energy field our corona and so one of the witnesses we have was at a nuclear hot base out in Oklahoma Becca years ago I think was in the 70s and there was this object that was in the shape of UFO but it wasn't solid and it flew over the what they call the hot you know with the Jets were hot loaded with nuclear weapons and the alarms went off he says this thing was not solid like this is like your rock salt it was you could have walked right through it but it was in the shape of a craft but it was shifted so that the matter was all energy and of course matter is energy so the physics behind this gets into some really arcane stuff probably beyond the scope of the show but it's what I this is part of what we're teaching people when we take them out is how do these objects appear what might you see and I was talking to an actor here in town who had one of these happen near his home and it was very palpable very real but it wasn't he tell us who the actor was no throat it no there no but he you know these are there a lot of people who've had these sort of experiences they don't want to talk about it right because they're afraid of you know being ridiculed right and and but you know when it was described to me I said oh yeah that's classic they really I said yeah because if it's if it's not a Lockheed Martin you know anti-gravity and it's really a CT the weirder it is the more likely it is to be et and this gets into the whole question what are you looking for so we trained people to know kind of what to look for versus you know if experimental aircraft normal aircraft you know space objects and junk satellites and then the stuff that's the weird end of it so the weird end of it yeah you're really cool stuff the really cool stuff do you take these people you bring them out to the high desert you tune them into whatever frequency through whatever methods of meditation or what-have-you and these ships are they just waiting for someone they like email them to send them a signal you know what I think I think that they've actually been waiting a long time for people to do something besides just passively look at them do they have that but what I'm saying is do they have to like load up the ship hey we got some fucking people in the desert if everybody get on board now let's go let's go happening how are you getting them to manifest I'm not getting them to but how is anybody getting how is how how is this signal being recognized by them because I'm quite convinced they have electronics that pick up on this what we're Tom but earlier this conscious field of coherent thought and this is again the most controversial end of what I'm doing it to me it's the most interesting also you know before I was a doctor I was a meditation teacher you know that but I didn't know that what type of meditation mantra and Vedic so I grabbed a danta and in Vedic meditation and you know I learned Sanskrit and and learn to teach people meditations so that was my first sort of career if you can call it a career it was an avocation as much as more in a vocation but and I really and it was because of the result of this near-death experience and and and I began to realize that really the the the the thing that that is most intriguing about all this is that free energy is like late 1800s to mid 1900s antigravity mid 40s to mid 50s the science of consciousness and the interface between mind and matter mind and body mind and thought in electromagnetic systems that's the really cool stuff and that's you know to me most people know me for the disclosure project and these other things but to me that's the most exciting part of this because that is the frontier the final frontier is not space is consciousness so you take these people out there's 20 of them or and you spend how many days out there it's usually six days and nights and so we go out but during the day it's more a teaching module and teaching them remote viewing concepts and the science of consciousness other information they need to have then we you know go at it not usually from around sunset to one or so in the morning sometimes - and we're in out on the stars making observation doing the remote viewing practice and then people go home and do it there's now something like eleven or twelve hundred teams all over the world doing this that we better have picked up on this idea it's really a phenomenal thing and people are having an amazing sightings and experiences all over the world there's a global ce-5 initiative going on and it's really is like you saying ce-5 which is visual know what is let me explain - I'm sorry I you know I know the movie the third time yeah there's Steven Spielberg yeah movie yeah that's how I know this together and most people are probably like me then okay the fourth kind is when when someone feels they've had contact and been on board the fifth kind is a term that I launched and the concept of in 1990 which is when humans instead of passively having so all those others Close Encounters of the first second third and fourth kind are passive could you sorry either seeing it or it's a landing thing or what have you a closer hair in the fifth con is when a human does something interactive so it's like you know it's like the internet versus something passive over today where you're you're actually making contact and inviting these civilizations to appear make contact for a diplomatic purpose or where they interact and dr. Haines at NASA Ames put together a great book based on on my initial research on this called Close Encounters of the fifth kind ce-5 where he collected cases we both collected cases but he published this book some years ago about all these people who had done this and some of them were quite incidental for example a craft is there and the person sees it and instead of just gaping they actually signal to it with say a light and it's sitting back and comes over the more interesting ones are the ones I discovered that which is what happened to me when I was 18 where you see a craft and you just think move to the left it moves to the left move to the right move to the right and they're showing you that there's a link up between intent and thought and their electronics and that's the really cool stuff you ever really young Carl Jung yes what did you what do you think on Carl I mean he wrote a whole book on the physical manifestation of UFOs through the conscious thought yeah well I mean the world is as you are and it's been to men's on the level of consciousness the person reading what he wrote I think that a lot of people said well that means that your everything is being manifested by your mind well but in a sense all of reality is one conscious thought if you won't look get back into the hole all this is that concept of the Vedic but I think these are things when you have 30 or 40 people see it and it's interactive you know that's a close encounter the fifth kind so it's not your imagination doing that I'm particularly didn't get video and I don't think he was necessarily saying it's your imagination no no but he was you know a lot of people don't understand what he was saying and I think that he was talk really talking about some a deeper aspect of what is mind right what is MA his mind what effect does consciousness have on physical matter right what's huge yeah and huge and in a sense he could have almost been validating it without totally understanding the possibilities of contacting something making right thing I agree I agree you you seem to be convinced of and in fact teach people to do it I think that if you've got something like that how is this not like on 20/20 or what are those stupid new shows are how are you not going after would you be willing to do that with a film crew oh we did with CBS with Dan Rather had a show back years ago what was it called we went down to Mexico in the popo and we did this and a craft came up by the by the volcano flew and they were filming this with professional stuff and they ended up completely debunking it and even though the camera guy and and the reporter who is there with me said anyone who sees this will know this is real and CBS sanitized and when I then said look you agreed in writing that any footage you get you would share with us if we did this expedition because we did it on our own expense they the the person in charge there said receive ES and we're part of a corporation as billions and you don't we'll fight you forever you'll never get this would why would you need CBS though it seems like you'd be able to film something like that yourself and in really high quality you don't need their footage what we do I mean we have a certain amount I don't operate cameras but we've had volunteers but we've never had professional crews with us and I mean some point it'd be nice if we could do this and in my profession I have a crew I have a new show it's coming out on the sci-fi Network oh really what's its called question everything good one of the things yeah and one of the things we're gonna do is we're gonna explore things like UFOs Bigfoot I'm gonna go to the Pacific Northwest and look for a Bigfoot but I want to go there let's go to that Akama desert and see if we can find way to go let's go ma'am I would be more than happy to go and bring a professional crew and and see if something like this can happen what kind of success rate do you have in doing this well you know we've never actually gone out where there hasn't been some kind of a sighting or event happened that had been seen by everyone really never so it's a hundred percent not every night and not all the time but yes something a five or six day period and are these people camping out there no no no we don't stay well I mean I guess if someone wanted to easily stay in condos or houses or something in the area we usually go to fairly goes you know remote areas that are quiet it's very hard to find locations where we're not going to be intruded upon and usually when we do this we do have people who intrude and and so we try to keep it you know so that the group can be coherent because the whole concept of this is coherent thought and coherent mind and that's you know very difficult to do when you're being disrupted by a lot of folks now what if you pick 20 people to go and and how do you know that someone's not alone you take some crackpot oh well they're happy you know but no usually the people you know we have an application process and and I you know I'd say 99% of the time they're just wonderful people and you know they're very sincerely interest learning about this and I think the science of consciousness component of the whole what J Allen Hynek called the high strangeness part of UFO encounters it becomes very compelling for people who had contact and understand that when you go beyond the speed of light between star systems you're dealing with something that's way beyond your your cell phone and a Ford Explorer and and people who get that who get out of the linear box and begin to look at that and then begin to experiment with a lot of the people who come on these are people who have gotten the app or learned about it and they try it it try this at home and they have an amazing sighting an encounter with a small group of people or a family and then they want to come and try and do it more so it's it's it's a it excites me that's the the next phase of all this is you know disclosure bring out the energy and technologies but then it's about the public understanding that why doesn't everyone just go out under the stars sort of sitting in looking at television and try some experiments experiment with with thought and mind and light and tone and beside kinds of exploding things in space haven't you encountered things that are in closer proximity to the ground oh yeah and some very odd photographs of what you might call transdimensional images that look like almost a hologram of a beam that floated right outside of our circle at Joshua Tree National Park not too far from here back a few years about oreos of this thing yep yep where could someone see that it's on the website serious disclosure calm if you link to the CG five part of it there's a whole section of this strange luminous thing and you know the photograph of that it was a three or four second exposure and what was seen right before this happened which is really important for people to understand was something about half the size of the about the size of my fist or a little bigger that was like a spear that floated over the desert and a November of oh nine and several people saw it and then we heard what sounded like a group of people talking but with our nice guy there's nothing there and then so a woman on my team took a camera and just had a three or four second exposure took a photograph and in that area where this had happened there was this beam that was up and did you see this with your eyes or just no because this would have been in a flash it's in the digital is it possible that's just an artifact no it's not an artifact absolutely not why is that not possible I mean flashes always produce artifacts they produce no no no no she did not use a flash oh it's visible the flash was it so in other words this was no flash bulb no we don't allow flash photography when we're out you got to have good night scopes you have to have good cameras you can adjust the ISO and the aperture and all that campfires mmm no we never campfires there's a complete darkness the most you're gonna see when we're out there is maybe an LED on a camera so whatever this thing was so we know what it was you think it was very confident about what it was have you ever been aboard a spaceship well you know I've had some really amazing contact experiences that are classic and they you know I had one when I was having this when I was 80 years old up on this mountain up in now and and it was it wasn't at all what you hear about in the literature because it was more in this transdimensional element area and that becomes the whole question is what part of what people are reporting is real and what part is Memorex and this is something we haven't talked about yet but what is the capacity for the intelligence community to hoax contact and it's substantial really yeah you think a lot of people they're hoaxing contact yeah for scaring the hell out of people like in one way how do they do that one of the things we learned about a number of years ago is actually not something I discovered it was a man here who was looking into what are called military-related abductions that are made to look et but aren't and you get into this whole question of what are they able to stagecraft to for its psychological warfare value and I have a document that's actually gonna be in the film and it's from the Strategic Studies Institute talking about the staging of abductions and other scary things to create fear around the UFO issue so they created an artificial spacecraft and abductee well they might use that they may use what's called an ARV an alien reproduction vehicle that's man-made they may use robotic things that are called PLF program life-forms that are man-made that look very programmed with life forms yeah pls they have oh they have life forms that that are like robots essentially they move around like people there are reports of that and in fact reports of that and I think there's a you believe that though oh yeah I think Stan Romanek if you look at the photograph he had of this thing I think he was on Larry King or and some other shows in this thing boo that goes up and down he's got a photo and then there's a video that he hasn't released but I've seen it in other people in student team I've seen it and it's this very robotic looking it looks like a quote alien but I we know it isn't I mean so I you know the question is why would they want to do something like that I think if you can put enough information out there to scale scare people why not scare well it seems to me though that look that the highest level robotics experts in the world today are pretty open about their work because they're showing I mean they're showing periodic improvements that general publicly that DARPA robots what they're doing in Japan no no one has come anywhere close to doing something along those lines not only that they all have an external power source well you've you're assuming that the things that you know about or or all that they're in existence but it's like saying that because you haven't flown on one of Locke heats or North ropes anti-gravity devices they don't have those either I think they do they have those yes they do 100% yes what happened been rich all but said so you know who's that over Lockheed skunkworks so these are a lot of the things that people see out near the Nellis range or so called area 51 that are moving in decent ways we were talking about earlier those are man-made there's Arnie T and if you go all the way back to the 40s in in Germany during World War two and after they were doing a lot of experiments with things that do electromagnetic lifter effect and going back a little further you look at T Townsend Brown in 1919 20s and then also the koloski frost experiment where they actually were able to create this effect of the levitation and movement so you know again there's a whole science here and in the open aerospace literature in the late 40s and early 50s they were saying the next big thing is gravity control and anti-gravity stuff and dotted that it out and then it went all went black you can't find it and one of the guys that I've worked with at the naval research labs which is the largest department defense lab and told me that it was October 54 when we really mastered gravity control and all those projects went black they just disappeared but up until then you can go back and find and there were in the literature now the fact that your average person at MIT to know about this doesn't mean it didn't exist and and I think that there's a whole history of aerospace and technology that's hidden similarly there's a whole history of robotics genetics and biological studies and what-have-you and that that have also been kept very classified you are either one really nutty dude or you are a guy who has tapped into one of the craziest pieces of information that's being suppressed from the American public and there's no room for a middle ground you know that's this well I'm I know that all everyone I'm telling you is true I believe W you believe that every word out of your mouth is true right do believe you but this whole thing is so it's so strange credibility all that's all the time and you know what I was told years ago that if you really told the whole truth about this that'll hide itself because no one can believe it mm-hmm so you know it is kind of through the looking-glass and down the rabbit hole on this subject and it's a real problem because how far do you go in terms of telling what you know and have discovered well it seems to me and hacked into like a way to show people yeah well I mean if but who's looking at me it's like this FAA guy John Callahan who said I've got the radar tapes I got the pilot reports but who's looking and who's asking right well in not 20/20 you know I mean you asked about 20/20 the guy who's executive producer of that came out to my house I gave him thirty five hours of digital stuff of all these top-secret guys all the documents all this stuff he said this is the biggest story it's either all a hoax or it's the biggest story in history I said yeah well I think it's the latter and he says I want to do this story I said I don't think they'll let you and so we went back to corporate ABC and yeah a couple weeks later he's a dr. Greer they won't let me do this story I said who are they IRA and he said well you know who they are and I've had producers they like this crazy motherfucker what ups this was the executive producer in charge of the show of both the primetime live in 2020 and he's now with 60 minutes but I think that what I'd love to talk to him what's his name yeah IRA Rosen I love to talk to him on the or the question everything show I'm being fascinating well you know I think that this is the other big myth is that when you start dealing with the big media that it's a free media it's free to a point I mean there's no problem if you want to drill down on someone's sex scandal but if you really want to deal with this issue there's gonna be a phone call and you're one of the documents that's up on our website I wrote an article called media play and in it is a document I got from the 1990s from the CIA that talks about how the CIA had embedded in all the major media people to change alter or stop stories and this is an official document so you know if the public listening out there think we really have a free market a free me you know you know wake up this is simply not the case so I think that one of the one of the challenges we've had is that the it's kind of a an article of faith that if all this were true wouldn't the media just really want to cover this and I say yeah there are some really good people in the media who've wanted to but they're not allowed to and so then there's good way who controls the big media I'm not talking about your show how many shows are out there dedicated to looking for UFOs there seems like there's quite a bit and those those shows are owned by you know big media companies and networks that promote these shows it's just bullshit and what they're doing is paying lip service to it and not really looking and they're just covering the controversial aspects of it to get viewers yes I think a lot of its shock and Robel and bread and circus and I think that you then ask the question of you know years ago when I was on Larry King and afterwards I got this note from historicity there's one of the most popular shows we've ever had and so if it was just about ratings and just about whether there was anything legitimate there to cover this would be in the news all the time so there's something weird going on here because they'll cover all kinds of sensationalistic nonsense but you know you have dozens of top secret witnesses you have legitimate government documents you have photographs video or you have teams like ours going out having these sort of experiences that isn't covered you have to ask the question why and I think the wonderful thing about 2013 that didn't exist five or ten years ago Twitter Facebook video on demand you know you don't have to go to a big distributor where and actually by the way we're planning to distribute this film at the night of the premiere maybe we'll livestream and if we can figure out how to do it maybe you can help us I'll be happy we need help with today so is work we're actually out of funds started option Brad and Ustream yeah live stream the shows but yeah and so what we want to do at the premiere is live stream it and then have the thing and then it will be VOD video on demand so that you know there's no choke holds in the big media and then you couldn't have done that five or ten years ago with any kind of bow you now you can do high-definition you can do really good good video and demand and we're gonna do this so that everyone can sign up to be an affiliate distributor so that basically if you want to distribute the show you can you can distribute it and the people who see it you know there'll be a small fee to see it and then you'll have part of that and you just build that out because what we want to do is make this thing go viral so that we don't get into the chokeholds of the big media because you know I my experience with it is that I'm very very skeptical of the big media doing anything with this until they have to and and then it becomes where you know there's too much noise out there we have to give it a little bit of lip service and then we'll take it off again so that's why by the way that's why we did this crowdfunding to this it was that we really want the people to have a stake in it and to move move the film serious forward because if you went to a studio or so a group of investors you don't know what they're gonna do with it if they control it this way the people on it well listen man this is a fascinating subject like I said it's one of my personal interests and has been since I was a small child and to talk to you was a real treat I really appreciate it I really appreciate put your neck out there man you say a lot of nutty shit and it takes a lot of courage to do that or you're crazy I'm willing to believe you I mean I'm willing to be completely open to the point of I'll go out to the desert with you I'll do whatever it is I'm you know I'm fascinated by all this stuff and if what you're saying is true it is you know one of the most mind-blowing things our society is ever or had access to has ever been able to encounter I mean it's a pretty crazy shit man well welcome to the new millennium because now it's time here we go here we go I hope you're right I mean I hope this isn't just crazy talk April 22nd is the day it's in Los Angeles at LA Live which is where it's the Regal LA Live the Regal LA Live and how can people either find out about this or get to this or go serious disclosure dot-com and you can go there and you can you know get the tickets and everything and sign up right there everything we've done online and is the film done it's it's going into final completion in the next three weeks or so yeah okay so April 22nd is when it's all going down and that is hopefully you will already have the information from this Ivy League Institute about this alien being by then correct or this humanoid being you don't know what it is yeah whatever it is yeah and we will we already have a lot of it but we're waiting for the the final genetic sequencing okay and if people want to follow you on twitter it's dr. Steven Greer Stevie t st e ven not with those weirdos that says Steven but it's with a pH it does it somewhere knows no pH you yeah well weirdos Steven pH that's Stefan right Devon okay dr. Steven gear ste ve and Greer and one more time the website is serious disclosure com si RI u.s. disclosure com this has been a fascinating conversation thank you very much has been really interesting and uh you know I mean I'm really looking forward to seeing where this goes we'll see you at the premiere absolutely will you do this again we come by yeah love to premiere yeah we have to with all the new findings yes please alright we're gonna have some fun listen folks thanks for tuning in we have a crazy week this week we have Tom Segura is gonna be on on Tuesday David Lee Roth is going to be on on Yeah right David Lee Ross here on Wednesday and on Friday dr. Amit Goswami theoretical physicist so we have some some crazy science we got a rock star and we got one of the funniest people on the planet and we have dr. Steven Greer thank you very much free time I really appreciate it thank you to talk to you and I really appreciate all you're doing it's it's awesome stuff I love it I'm fascinated and I can't wait to talk to you again in April and I can't wait to see your film alright folks that's the dealio yo if you want information on that show that Brian's got going on in San Diego go to death squad TV is March what Brian 1414 at the American company which is an amazing club in San Diego really really cool place thank you also to on it calm if you go to o N and I T use a code name Rogan you'll save 10% off any and all supplements alright we love you and we'll see you tomorrow or Tuesday or whenever I don't know Tuesday I'm not telling
