I like the art bill bill so everybody likes the art bell build up the art bell sound you know what do you say from the kingdom of nye and I write pomp Nevada I used to always loved art bill because someone would call in and say I'm a werewolf yeah did he go oh my interesting tell me more yeah he didn't care he never he never called you out on it just let you let you ramble he had time traveller lines love the hope people loved it I never learned anything from it though so you're obsessed with UFOs right uh was that safe to say I safe to say but it's it's not so much just the UFO it's self I mean they're I don't call them that anymore we call these advanced aerial threats they're different but Rhett's you were you honed in on word we weren't supposed to really get into here in the first part of the show do you have a plan I have a ver I have a very long plan detailed plan we're gonna start with my body we're just gonna talk about my body for a lot okay what do you want to talk about what terms your body well my body is interesting it's unique okay it's it's it changes shape and what I've noticed is it's just changing yeah it's getting larger eyes are getting wider heading upon what you put in it but you're off can I cut yeah yeah for sure we're on the Internet you still fucking fit you shook my hand are they gonna break my hand I'm sorry yeah just be strong I didn't mean to don't be so just I know well it's one of those power moves you ever see when Trump shakes people's hands that he pulls him in and he's oh yeah he does do weird check this weird shit like that yeah no I didn't mean to do that I just meant to shake your hand like a man well I took it as like know your place motherfucker oh this is my show I didn't think so how when did you get obsessed with this aerial threat thing why do you why do you call them threats we'll get into that I guess but I got into it when I was in junior high but for some weird reason I had like some time off in on you know and I went to the school library and like seventh grade and I was like damn I read some boring shit what am I going to read and I saw this one book I had a picture of the Loch Ness monster in like a UFO mall that looks cool and I read that I was like holy cow these are like real it wasn't all science fiction I mean the way the book was late I was like these are like real events I'm all there's no no way really and then when the band started doing its thing in the back of the van there were no like smartphones we were buying books and and I would just lay there we'd have like 20 hour drives and and so I started buying books on the UFO phenomenon and I was once you do that it's a black hole you're done yeah it's definitely a rabbit hole you get sucked into it I house I have a frame poster that's the cover of the Roswell Daily News yeah that shows the day after the Roswell crash where it says that the Air Force came and recovered the wreckage and you know the whole day I've been obsessed with this shit since I was a little kid yeah I think I think that's I think that's by design I think that this generation is was meant to have this stuff come out on but you know I can't prove that that's just my feeling what would makes you feel that like because of exactly what you said there's a lot of people I don't believe that some of the I don't believe that some of the events happened on accident you know I think that there's been a lot of events that are on purpose some have been for show some have been for any man there's a variety variety reasons but I think a lot of it is a control system that's really pushing humanity in a very specific direction and so like they've got a time frame where they had these events take place is that what you think yeah and they also time travel which is different than what people think in like a movie where they sit in a machine in the Austin you're in the 1930s and you got to go save humanity when you use the technology you have a there's a time difference between where what they're doing inside of an artificially created bubble of gravity of sorts and then what's on the outside so if you're on the inside of one of those machines everything would be skewed more black-and-white there would be like a red shift and everybody would look frozen so you literally could fly around and grab a coke out of someone's hand and put it in someone else's hand it's really where you in this room well take a wild guess look at the people I was surrounded by you know so that so the people you're surrounded by are telling you this is that what it is well I don't want to get into that but people I'm surrounded with and myself you know are very close to this stuff but the physics you know the the physicists that's a co-founder of my company to the star he's a Nobel nominee he wrote the book on plasma physics he wants his name Hal put off dr. Hal put off and he he created remote viewing do you know what remote viewing is yeah he's the creator of the CIA psychic spy program but he also has done like really exotic advanced forefront propulsion work for the past decades and decades actually I mean he's the he's deep into the like quantum this and that so he's the one that actually told me about the redshift yeah and so they have experienced this physically or is this just theoretical or they know that it exists like the technology yes I that the technology not only exists we've figured out how to play with it but I'm not gonna really get into that here I what that is what we're doing at my company though that is the announcement so Steve justice was head of advanced programs at the skunk works and the skunk works or who built you know just the famous secret bases you hear about skunk works did you know the u-2 spy plane the sr-71 blackbird the f-117 teen stealth fighter and it's all groom Lake out there all that kind of stuff and and he literally was in charge of all the advanced programs so you know you got the boss and you got him and he came he just finished his career over there within the past two months I think it is and and he was on stage with me when we came out and and said we're gonna be building one of these things so when when you say that this all this technology exists have they explained this to you or have you seen it physically oh I haven't seen anything physically like that I'm not I wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere if that does or doesn't exist so they've just explained to you that this exists and that this is in the hands of the US government I think no no I see I don't want to get into that kind of stuff but um if you don't mind why is it that you want to not get into certain things well I don't want to speak actually you know I represent more than myself these days right so I definitely have to watch what I say who do you represent when you saw the team that I'm with so when you look at the people that are a part of my company its Under Secretary of Defense's and defense and senior intelligence service these people like that we could see oh yeah I thought you guys would have had that yeah but I mean is there like a list where folks could see it online uh yeah they can go to to the stars academy.com and scroll down and you'll be able to see who they all are so so how did you get linked up with all these people that story might be a better way to start because a lot of people don't know this part of the story and I think you're going to find it pretty fuckin odd as well but uh okay so we'll back up a couple years so I was obviously you know I I started the band blink and blink went places and and then but we always had a weird band relationship like most bands and we also thought that we would never be big so we started companies on the side and I had a company that incubated a lot of small startups like software and apparel and hardcore skate surf companies and stuff like that well I learned a lot from that and I pulled out an entertainment startup called to the stars and I knew I was going to be doing kind of like science fiction franchised stories just like Disney but science fiction for adults and what that means is you know I make a story I title it I brand it and I put out the book and I put up the merchandise and I go make a movie you know and it's so it's a vertically integrated kind of model well one of the stories I knew I wanted to put out with secret machines which was kind of a historical fiction but based on real events about the UFO phenomenon but I also knew that I knew shit that most people don't know because I've studied it for so long and I happen to put some pieces together that most people don't put together so before I came out with that book and before I came out with the plan to take that make major motion pictures and a lot kind of stuff um I I knew I needed to ask permission so I flew I flew around to places I can't say who they were but and they they listened to my pitch and and then I got a I got a email out of nowhere that says meet us next to the Pentagon at this day and time and I did that and from that an email from just random person no I don't know I just can't tell you who it was from okay and so then I go out and you next to the Pentagon so you just out of the Pentagon I flew out to Pentagon City yeah yeah and say dude this guy's freaking out I'll tell you when I started freaking out there's more shit kids away course this is nothing so that started me out and out near DC taking some other high-level meetings and there's somebody at a very high level that that closed the door look many I says okay I'm going to introduce you to somebody and that person comes to San Diego puts me on the phone with a general and the general is listening to my little stump speech about what I want to do with this franchise because it was I I definitely didn't want to you know I wasn't looking to like force disclosure and I wasn't looking to be rogue and break secrets I was like look I know what's going on here and you guys are doing a kick-ass job and I would have done the exact same thing should I have been the guy at the top that had to make some really hardcore decisions 70 years ago so I'm I want to support you I think people are cynical because there's a vacuum you guys can't say what you're doing so all these people are just coming up with a bunch of bullshit to say oh you know they don't want us to know or we can't handle it or it's all about oil and money and all this weird shit I'm all you would put these pieces together yet independently I did and so based on books that you read yeah people think you know people think that like places like the CIA and the DIA all these intelligence organizations have you know a monopoly on information they don't they get their information from the real world too you know they do have access to - you know archives of information they do have access to some amazing you know satellite data and stuff like that but if you're smart and you take your time you know where to look and you find patterns you can pretty much put together all same shit they can kind of you know and that's what I did and so when I pitched what I wanted to do he said come up and meet me tomorrow and so I flew up to NASA actually on NASA Ames and had a two hour meeting there and after two hours that person says he looks me in the eyes I'm gonna introduce you to someone else and he did and so I got on the phone with this person and this person you know go I'm a skeptic I'm a skeptic and then at the end of conversation he goes he goes fly out and see me and so I did and that's when things really started happening so I'm now I filed to this Airport and I I sit at a table in a restaurant at the airport no one's in there and this gentleman sits down and the waiter comes up he waves off the waiter and he looks me in the eye says he was the cold war and we found a life form and that's when I started shitting my pants because I know a lot about this stuff but I you always wait to talk to somebody on that is one of the inside people you always want to so he sits down at a restaurant with you at the airport and tells you that they found a life-form yes and during the Cold War during the Cold War and everything that they did and every decision they made at the time was because of the consciousness of the Cold War why is this guy decided to meet with you at an airport because the only way you meet with these people the only way you ever would have anyone talk to you is if you can provide a service that they need and my service was pretty interesting to them because I I said look you guys you know you you struggle with saying disclosure you want to tell everybody everything which I don't think everyone should know everything and then you say they can't handle it so don't tell them anything you know and I'm like there's there's a middle road there and here's the way I would do the middle road and it resonated with them you know and so we had a pretty epic conversation for a 2-out why you like why what is it about what your message was because your idea was on that made them something tell you some top secret shit that they've tried to keep away from the American people when you take a guy who's like a big celebrities and a huge rock band like you and you just say hey meet me in an airport I'm gonna tell you about a life foam that we found during the Cold War because you're famous for because you know things know because I have a service so it's not it sounds easy when you play it like that but a lot of us a service like what can you do for them okay they need help with and what you do communication they don't have a way to make a movie a book they don't know how they not don't have a way to make documentaries they don't have a way to go on on a big show like this and communicate with young people they don't do that and nor should they there they look at you got to look at what they're doing so they look to you for a spokesperson role I went to a spokesperson role on occasion they're all a communication role it makes so say it would give some information to you and you would get it out to people and now why wouldn't they do it themselves because they wouldn't have the same platform they don't have the same platform I don't have and the other reason is as people have tried to do movies and stuff like this but none of none of them know I was fortunate enough to know the core story and most people don't explain that then if you don't mind going back like I said you were able to put things together that other people weren't what are those things essentially it's the book secret machines where you have a lot of private finance you have some world bankers and you have a lot of people internationally working together to figure out a plan of how to how to push back against something that's been coming here for a very long time but using off-the-books finances and using mechanisms that that were not totally aware exist and what people have to realize is you know the UFO phenomenon isn't a phenomenon there's the the universe is fucking gigantic and there's life everywhere every fucking where and when there's a lot of life that's way more advanced than we are and just like we are solar system a little dinky satellite from the 70s there and and just like my company is going to be building you know this this electromagnetic craft that really can do the same thing to time that I've been telling you about other civilizations have that too which means you can traverse those distances of space and what you have to think about is what happened when we first discovered that and what did we do about and there's no you know you got a look at 47 in a very peculiar way 90 days after the Roswell event with CIA was created the Air Force was separated from the army the National Security Act was created and all those things are mechanisms to start learning more and to start getting private industry off the ground so that nothing to do with World War 2 you think it had to do with aliens oh I absolutely think it well it both because what what I believe crashed at Roswell was well I believe it was German from Argentina but it had hallmarks and technology based on alien technology so we put out a story saying it's alien and then we put out a story saying it's a weather balloon but the real thing it was we didn't want anyone to guess and that's why we put those two things out there and that's that's kind of how they do it I think they did that with the moon it's like you know we went to the moon and then they put out this meme kind of thinking like we can't we didn't go to the moon but I didn't want people really going well what's on the moon that you know so these things are managed until they can figure it out because you've got a bunch of normal dudes in suits sitting at a big table like this and it's their fucking responsibility to figure this thing out and this shit is monumentally big but how would they manage this then how these regular dudes without access to communication like you have how they've managed to disseminate this information and and and sort of confuse everybody I think well I can tell I don't know how they did it I do know that they infiltrated UFO groups that was the very first thing they did in the 50s I would've liked how FBI agents and undercover cops it´ll traded occupy wallstreet yet pretended to be radical hippies yet started fights yep they did that they get access to what the civilians are learning how information transfers from one group to another and then they start deflecting all their knowledge and putting in leaks and this and that right and getting them off the main track not because of a disdain for citizens and not because of any other reason then picture Isis we don't know what Isis is they got a nuclear bomb and we caught a guy trying to sneak sneak in this bomb right are they going to stop and come sit on your couch and tell you all about it no and if you're like on the radio and there's all these people going oh my God we're gonna die oh bomb a bomb a bomb there hold up a second you know you're not gonna fuckin die but we need to learn more about this and we got to figure it out before we sit down and talk to you about it so what was the connection though specifically that you had figured out that they knew that you had figured out people hadn't put together well let me just okay so let me go back to my story so I put out this book and this book deals with was a book called the secret machines and it deals with secret you know international finance private industry a secret space program and a bunch of other things that your researches book what do you mean how'd you get the information it's just 25 years of reading shit and watching videos and studying physics and studying you know the secrecy acts and all that kind of weird shit you know you put it together a lot of it's bad information but after a long time I realized I just realized what was going on there I just I've studied enough of international finance some mechanisms that happened after World War two what the Nazis were doing technologically that no one really talks about to this day there were a hundred years ahead of us about what their guys did at the end of the war in South America that's in the paperclip paperclip was like there's two levels of paperclip paperclip is is the operation that brought over all these X Nazis into NASA and into all of our aerospace programs why did we do that well because they knew some shit that was very important and we said there might be a bigger issue out there to deal with so why don't we side with the devil or side with someone bad because there might be a devil out there it's that kind of thinking so they come in and thought it was about competing with Russia to try to advance rocketry the I believe that there was you know I believe that there's a reason what the Cold War never got hot is because we were working with Russia on this specific issue you think the reason why the Cold War never turned into an actual war so you're saying yeah so it had nothing to do with the fact that Russia was a communist Empire and essentially we did spent them and they really went under and collapsed yeah but there's different there's different levels it's like when someone goes you know the US government did this well what do you mean what does that mean does that mean the CIA did it or the DoD did it or Homeland Security did it you're dealing with the it's a trillion dollar organization it's like if somebody an Apple leaks an iPhone you know are you gonna say oh my god Apple is doing apples like well shit we're a 800 billion dollar company we have so many things going on worldwide it's impossible to say the entire organization believes one thing and the government's the same kind of the same kind of way it's just like that's just a word the US government's two words right three-year three words how do we want to count this in the United States government okay three I guess okay u.s. is a calculator you know you're gonna shit out but and you have many many layers of what's going on in before some people worried on technology some people worrying about what's happening that happening to the civilian population you have some people worrying about you know how to keep everything afloat how to keep everything going and you have a whole bunch of weird military excursions and they're bumping into each other and and all these people aren't read in to what's going on with the UFO thing so as all that shit so who gets read in the that's a good question if I had to guess very very senior technical brass and rock stars and rida wasn't read in trust no they didn't tell you anything no they possibly did but I wasn't read and read and I wasn't brought in to ask if and they said this is what's going on even though I've been in ask if a few times okay do you want skip it a boat a skiff is a is a special compartmentalised information facility it's um it's where top-secret shit can be to sky I thought maybe they did talk on boats cuz nobody can hear you they do that too they do that they do that they actually do because you can sweep for bugs on boats a lot easier than you can on a building makes sense yeah yeah so they tell you what okay so I'm sitting at that restaurant and as he found the life-form they found a life-form during the Cold War right and and I said well they find it oh I didn't ask him that question in many places I did time bring up I said you know I'm thinking about talking about what the crash in the late forties and they go why just that one that was the answer so I had to figure out a language to talk to these guys did you ever think maybe this guy's bullshitting you fuck no no you got that's why you got to hear the whole story so okay so I'm sitting with them we talk about a lot of things I bring up the incidents with our nuclear weapons I bring up the incidences a few other things that I want to get into and and he goes what do you need to do your project what do you what are you looking for and I said well I need advisors you know I need people that are from different areas and the government because everyone has their own own perspective you know you have people at the National Reconnaissance Office that have a perspective based on the satellite feeds they're getting and these things are coming in and out of the atmosphere then you also have people from the agency that are worried about in collecting information of what's going on with people in different countries and here but then you also have you know engineers that have a perspective on how the technology is made and what that might mean because there's a lot of consciousness stuff that falls into this case right there so there's satellites that track them coming in and out of the atmosphere absolutely yeah absolutely what kind of satellites are these uh how was out fuck I don't know usually forward-looking infra-red but I don't know what spectrum of the infrared they're looking at so there's some sort of a camera or some sort of a detection device that they have in the atmosphere just to check for UFO I don't know if it's just for UFOs they can pick up very very specific heat signatures and they have algorithms because what you have is a satellite as a device that can pick up what you what you program it to pick up now you know you put a sensor on there but you got to tell the sensor what to do right so if the sensor says look something traveling at this speed with this kind of heat you know you got to record that you got focus on it and that that's what we call an ICBM but if something comes in and zigzag stops and turns left and it's traveling ten times faster than that we need you to record that and focus in on that as well but if something just is moving low and it's only going 300 miles an hour and it has these big wings and a low whatever they're all just a plane you know so the what it captures is based on you know how it's programmed in the first place but you can differentiate between meteorites and absolutely yes absolutely so so how often of these things coming into our atmosphere oh shit I don't know but I I've had quite a few discussions one of the people I I've been I've been in contact one at one of my advisers from the National Reconnaissance Office high up high high up and they call it episodic visits that's all I know episodic like they have time periods were they like there was I saw paper where they semesters I figured out the Department of fence figured out a physicist they're an algorithm of how to compute when the things fly in and collect smaller ships like mothership small ships what what at what longitude and latitude and and what essentially what orbit it would land at when it would collect these other machines and so they tested that and in all I know is it was successful you think this is happening on a very frequent basis well let me tell you the rest of the story so I and this is it's important because you'll see so he goes what do you need I said I need to buy advisors and then so next thing you know I leave and two weeks later Bam Bam Bam my email starts I have all these Admirals all these generals no no intelligence people other than other than brass that were connected with the National Reconnaissance Office but natural connaissance office is half airforce and half CIA but they're all they're all military hmm and so I start talking to them I start meeting with them I fly out to Colorado Springs and there's a general and a colonel and they look at me and they said they said okay do you need anything else are you good and I said well I think you guys should talk to the Defense Intelligence Agency and they go why I'm all I just don't want to upset them I want to make sure everyone's kosher with what I'm about to do and the colonel looks at me and he goes do you ask your dad for permission after your mom's already given it to you and I go no and he's all you've been given permission shut the fuck up and get to work and I was like alright so I did so I go out and I put the book out there and I start doing national radio like the art bill so coast to coast or I do all that stuff next thing you know I get approached by somebody with a an agency and that guy comes to San Diego and puts me in a small room and I got what you would call interrogated for two days straight saying we need to know who the fuck you are you know shit you shouldn't know and what like what specifically should you not have known I should though what that you the book what's in the book everything I've been telling you today when you're dealing with their there is a there is a concerted international effort to deal with this stuff and that was in my book and that is it's not like Roswell crashed and it what's not like you know like all the typical UFO shit that people dwell on isn't the story it's just that there's something crashed or someone sawed got abducted and saw this or someone pulled a little piece of metal out of their body but no one's put together what we're doing about it because our countrymen since world war ii aren't stupid it was like what set them off they're like what was the thing that you said that you should not have known the in my book it is my belief that we have an incredible we've made incredible strides creating assets to deal with this stuff that's that's my belief and I'm not speaking for my company it's just a sense yeah means some sort of a government agency that's been designed or now together international international okay so some sort of an international collaboration to deal with the threat of alien life and that was enough that they pulled you aside from wouldn't let you go for two days and just yeah so it was the --it it was more it was an interrogation but it was a pretty heavy debriefing of how I got to where I was and it's not like they didn't make a home this took place at a hotel near my home but they made you sit down talk to them oh fuck yeah I had there was six of them I think six until they let you leave and go to sleep and then come back get something yeah and came back spend another eight hours because I wasn't rogue I wasn't like trying to hide anything I was trying to explain to how did you have all this free time though what do you mean I mean oh yeah like if somebody said hey we're gonna have you in a room we're gonna talk to you for two days I'm like I'll have two days oh that's that's well that's maybe you don't but if you do I fuck yeah when you have these people that want to get a hold of you you don't run I'm not saying run I'm saying like what are you guys looking for like you they're gonna just sit you down and ask you questions for two days because you put together this idea that somehow or another there's some sort of an international collaboration and you with the threat of a million life no they they they looked at it they didn't know they thought I was Ed Snowden they thought I was they thought there was a group of people leaking me classified information they didn't know that you're from blink-182 they didn't know that you're like a huge they don't care about Rockstar yeah that's what they don't understand they they don't care about Who I am they just care about the material right but it should take them like three seconds to realize like you're not Edward Snowden you're a rockstar but I have but I'm saying some pretty provocative shit you got to realize no one else has gone up there and talked about uh you know once again I I'm in a tricky spot right now because a lot of what happened back then you know I can't really get into now because of the positions and the things I'm involved with but read the book and so it's just because you printed the stuff in the book that they wanted to pull you aside and talk to you about this for two days and I was all over radio and talking about it and I was saying some other crazy shit that I can't repeat so people listening if they want to go back and look at those interviews that's a better way - okay so you had said something in those interviews that you can't say again because they told you to stop talking about it absolutely yeah they tell you to stop talking about the fact that you can't talk about it no I mean I don't think that's the issue they the the more of the issue was what are you trying to achieve right and once they found out who I was working with they were like holy shit and they only found that out when WikiLeaks broke into John Podesta Z mails and my I was having video conferences and the conference calls with he was Obama senior advisor at the time so the Wall Street Journal broke the story like what's this rockstar talking about UFOs with Hillary Clinton's campaign manager mm-hmm no he was Obama senior advisor so I had nothing to do with Hillary you know so we were setting these up and when that broke I had a call at my partner from the CIA and I said you know I gotta say I know I got now I can talk to you a little bit more about who these people are and and that's where I gained a really large amount of credibility with them but also where they realized that we got to figure out a better way to do this and what you see is me and some very important people coming together to do something that I think is really beneficial to society but a lot we have a lot of work to do because a lot of people think they don't know what to think of it at first they thought I was nuts when I was talking about look I'm all i got these advisors you know and then I'll send the Wall Street Journal broke this story and there's all these multi star generals and and a head of some really big aerospace companies and then then the big news organizations were like holy shit this is this might be real a lot of kids still don't know and they're having fun on the Internet and then I came out a couple weeks ago on stage with all these people now it's like now all the big huge I'm dealing with some crazy big mainstream press that that we're trying to keep at bay for a variety of reasons but yes it's all true and what to the stars is really after is how do we how do we bring the public in on this and work together to to communicate and educate this stuff how do we bring the technology out of the shadows and build it for the world and how do we you know tell the story in documentaries nonfiction fictional works over a period of years and if we do that the public owns it the public has to say they're a part of it and then people will start to understand over time why they did what they did they didn't lie to people just out of like ego it's it's they're like okay there's this group called Isis and they're here and we need to understand them and we need to fuck and figure it out quick but the problem is these are extraordinarily advanced civilizations that have been coming here forever that's why it's all in all the ancient fucking scripts and texts and carved into rocks and all that shit but trying to figure it out trying to connect the dots and trying to I mean looking at debris that they probably still have in a warehouse ago we have no fucking clue how to make this or back engineer this stuff I mean there's a piece of metal from a crash that I've seen and I've seen the science on it and it's it's so it's atomically aligned in its layered and Malta like 80 layers within just a few microns of purities of metal that aren't even in our solar system and they think it needs to be made in in a area where there's no gravity so number one has to be made in space number two even if we were to create a machine that can potentially do some of this stuff 3d printing layers of different metals that of obscene purities it would cost hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we don't even have that why did I think it was made without gravity because uh I think it's the atomic structure so what happens is is when you radiate it with terahertz it loses mass something weird it resonates some kind of harmonic and then it gets lighter and if you hit it with enough terahertz it'll float so we're gonna be showing people this stuff we're gonna be bringing out the hardware some of the hardware gonna be bringing out implants we're gonna be bringing out videos we're gonna be bringing out showing people this actual physical piece of metal that was constructed in a zero-gravity environment in space and if you hit it with enough energy it becomes weightless I wouldn't say weightless I don't know if we can make enough energy to do that but yes that is our plan and not only in show the experiment so yeah well if you can't give it enough energy to make it weightless can you give it enough energy to reduce the mass yes so weighs less yes and you can prove this yes and that's why I didn't have a scale and you can put this piece of metal do scale I'll do you better it's not it's not even that it's warping the space-time continuum around the object so you shoot what you can do is you can shoot an electron over it why it's why it's not a single electron a high and you collect it in time that how do you shoot a single electron if I know I'm not physicist they just do this shit that's what they do so and I was actually on a phone call today about it I like talked for about 45 minutes in the car on the way up here about some of the some of the how would they even be able to regulate whether or not they have a single electron well dude fuck they're doing crazier shit than that at CERN at CERN they're taking particles of atom and they're speeding them up to light speed almost lights yeah and you know slamming them into each other so I'm not too worried about electron life this is an enormous building that's I think it's was it turns like ten miles you know yeah but you've seen an electron microscope right and it's like the size I have this but I'm saying they're launching a single electron at this thing I know I think that's what they do yeah hmm they do that with photons too by the way I read I read a really cool study about single photons and consciousness was interacting with it just just by thinking it was changing the way the photon went it's crazy hmm so what happens is is you shoot this electron and you know how fast it is to travel over this piece of metal then you then you radiate it with terahertz and then you shouldn't mean radiate it with time you're you're electrifying and charging the piece of material you know to what it's a terahertz it's it's a it's a high frequency wave I don't want to pretend I know that much about it I just know that the earlier tests were with radio waves like RF and and they need to do terahertz so I I don't know much more than that so and so by radiate by shooting terahertz at it the piece of metal can lose mass and then when you shoot an electron over it it'll be a different time than the other one when it's not turned on does that make sense no the time it takes for an electron to go over the piece of metal what's up Jamie this is why I type in terahertz imaging laser guided codes advanced single pixel tella terahertz imagery and this be the images sampled upon instructions from a laser a the terahertz light passes through the object and then see the information is collected to reconstruct the image look at that so with this stuff just an imaging technique but your your timing how fast it takes an electron to move over the surface of the metal then you charge the metal and then you're timing the exact same thing and there will be different times and the positive result is that it lost mass so it traveled faster or slower or whatever the help is supposed to happen so and so I would imagine that this just this piece of metal if it exists would be kind of game over if you brought this piece of metal to the most advanced scientists and metallurgy or whatever they would be that would understand this kind of shit yeah it's already been there but the problem is is there anywhere online where people can read about this there actually is there's some some of this stuff not this piece in particular that came out as arts parts on arts Bell a long time ago and they're different layers of bismuth and magnesium but I but this one came from a crash in 48 not the 47 and I know nothing more about it but I don't think it's anything they're coming here with a Chain of Custody you say this came from Air Force or something like that you know I don't know who has this so you're gonna bring this and demonstrate this to people yeah and the reason is is because we need to we're also going to show videos that just got Declassified from our most advanced systems I think they called the aegis system it's a radar system and forward-looking infra-red of UFOs I have those in possession actually already and so we're going to show the videos that just I mean the first time in history by the way that videos of UFOs have been Declassified there's been leaks and there's been people catching shit on their phones but I have all the chain of custody all the documents and everything and we just got those a few weeks ago and there's a shitload more coming and so we'll release the videos and we'll show the experiment as a proof of concept so everyone knows this shit's all real because right now they're just looking at a drawing and they're looking at this guy from the skunkworks you know and just gonna how the fuck are they going to build a machine that plays with time and plays with the fabric of space-time and so we have to kind of educate people and say it's possible it's possible yeah that's advanced electro gravity gravity propulsion is that I say that electrogravitic grow vidiq so what that does what the machine does that we're building is there's a there's an electromagnetic wave that is the foundation of everything of all mass of everything like it's some people called it zero-point energy some people call it the vacuum energy but like one inch of air could power the United States for like hundreds of years kind of thing or maybe more so what they got to do is isolate very specific atoms to where all the noise of all matter and cellphones and everything that's going on on earth can be can be separated from this one atom and if you can do that with the right material you can get access to that electromagnetic wave that's powering the atom the the invisible wave pattern that that's under everything of all existence and once you do that it's not like splitting an atom this is the power behind the atom it's extraordinarily dangerous but it's also what will turn that thing on and it'll turn into a ball of light and just disappear and I could show you a video of of something doing that that's actually on YouTube you know okay I tell Jim what it is I would have to I could search it for a second oh you how about this well there's no commercial breaks is there no fuck just search it just describe it you know what if you type in astra the tr-3b astra tier three B and I'll walk over that guy walk over there for a second so much wonder is good they'll be able to see it put it up on the screen so what what this is for you this is the craft by the way Astro that's why sorry Astro Astro we're looking on YouTube ladies and gentlemen if you're in your car right now going what the fuck is going on in the show most the vast majority the people just listen to the show so for the people that are just listening and you want to go check it out TR thirty-eight Astra Aurora project through this AF o3b sorry this is the craft and secret machines book that's all I'm gonna say and this thing is floating in the it'll take a few seconds till they turn on the engine that looks pretty badass no wait you can see little lights dancing around on the bottom but I think this was leaked on purpose because the guy's making it just hard enough to see moving the camera around in and out of focus yeah all right look it's got like he's barely focusing boy that looks like a drone well it looks small too it's not it's that's pretty big I would think that one's about 40 feet really look see the tail fins on the back that's how you know it's not alien per se it's built off I think technology that came from there but you know they don't need vertical tail stabilized what's that big like okay this is the engine they turn it on so right now they're act they're accessing that energy I told you about no and watch what happens it's gone there's a pilot in that if that was in a movie I'd want my money back nice movie can suck my dick why why so fake oh you think that yeah what is that tiara three beers yes real these ones other ones are the same one but these ones are stacked and that's a drone that came out of one that's a drone the small one is of the little thing that came out the side yeah but if you you can look at black triangle UFO and find hundreds of these videos so these are people like civilians that are getting this from the ground I filming this I don't know I don't know where this one came one came to Jaime this is not the same count as the last video up next because it's probably uh highly valued tr-3b V alright how many views is out four hundred and seventy four thousand there's a hundred there's how many people know now there's hundreds of these out there oh no it separates from the other one but everyone thinks everyone thinks it's alien and that's not my belief so you think this is something along the lines like when they have the stealth bomber program we're experimenting with these things what do you think of Robert Lazar do you think that guys are real I'm putting out his autobiography so you do think he's legit should Ria's buck yeah yeah absolutely yeah he's a fascinating character right um he is he is his story is really interesting to where he really fucked up though so for the people I don't know that are listening he's a guy that came out he's the reason we know about 51 i'm he literally is the is the guy that broke the story of its existence he got brought in for a job and the during the interviews they said we have another idea for you and they put him in a place he claims how all these disks and he was on a back engineering team as a physicist but what happened was they rushed him in there because per his story they tried to cut into one of the propulsion devices and it exploded and killed a bunch of scientists so the Nevada Test Site which is the area where area 51 and all that stuff is released a statement that they were just doing a small little nuke test but it was really because of this thing and so they rushed him in there without doing all of his background checks because it takes six months to a year and during those background checks he was already working on this stuff they on they found that his wife was going a little haywire because he couldn't tell her what she was what he was doing and he would leave in the middle of the night he'd be gone for a week and she was getting fed up and so she started having an affair and so they're listening in on all the phone calls and checking him out and kind of going his home life is unstable so they stopped calling him to come into work why they figure it out he knows I mean he's working next to a guy with a machine gun he knows that that this is no fucking joke it no one knows what he's been doing he thought he did something wrong so at the nervous individual he is he runs to the to his friends and says this is what I've been doing this is what I've been working on there's alien craft it's over here at Groom Lake and the tests are every Wednesday night at eight o'clock and his wife goes holy shit and his friend goes holy shit and he goes come on I'll show you so they drive three hours north of Vegas outs on public land and they videotape and watch these UFOs come up and be tested and dart around and disappear and he goes that's the one I'm working on and it's almost like well how did you know what time because I'm working on it well he does is three times I think it was three times and on the third time they got caught because there's I've been there there's security that that travels those mountains you always hear about those guys out there in area 51 and when they caught him they're like holy fuck he's he's like what the fuck is he doing you know why is he telling everything so he runs to the news station with George Knapp who's another another he's a host on coast to coast and he tells him what he's doing and he just goes live on Las Vegas news and it caught like wildfire across the world and so then these guys grabbed him put him in a room put a gun to his head and said when we told you not to say anything we didn't mean say everything you know and he got really scared they started fucking with him I was actually in a meeting two nights ago talking about some of the things they did one of the things he did he went to a gym he used to he didn't have access to a lot of guns but for some fucking reason he had like an Uzi it was in his glove compartment he goes to a gym and he comes out and his car doors are open the glove compartment is open and he's just sitting on his chair he got a got shot out on the freeway and they erased a bunch of his records and he still to this day really nervous about it he always claimed he but for a while he claimed he had part of this is what I will say he claimed the energy source was an element that was very heavy and it was like uh appending him or something like that 115 element and 25 years ago he talked all about it he's old and then literally three years ago maybe four they added it to the periodic table what is this stuff called again I think it's called unup ne emits one element 115 it's odd and that's the other thing is people don't really shit 25 years ago he says this element comes from a binary star system and its really heavy there's a certain isotope that's stable they'll find it and then all sudden I remember one day I was driving my car and I heard it like I'm seeing that new element added to the periodic table also holy shit you know but it's a pretty interesting crazy story yeah well they erased his his daughter would the widow's the claim that he they had erased his educational record well I think he might have people I don't know if I think this because I don't even I don't know I never researched it but people that I know that have research to think he might have kind of upgraded his resident his resume a little bit and maybe he didn't go to MIT right that was a claim but they also said that he really did work for what's that lab in New Mexico oh well Lawrence Livermore and JPL JPL yeah Jake Hills and Pasadena yeah but but well whatever it was it was in New Mexico that they had found that he actually did work in the building even though they tried to say that he didn't yeah maybe he did something with somebody and however much of his store was true always gets fishy when you find one thing that's not true like that he didn't go to MIT stand free yet you know Stan yeah yeah Stanton Friedman who's a very famous UFO researcher he's one of the main guys arguing that Bob Lazar is full of shit yeah you know what's interesting is there is there is a I know the guy that did all the research on that and I know the guy that studied it for decades and he's actually writing a foreword on the book it's the the journalist has won like eight Peabody Awards and Emmys and shit but uh George Knapp who I told you about and he's just Scott like he could speak for hours on that one time so it was on the coast to coast show right he doesn't like a couple Sundays each month did you find that element what is it element 115 so what it's called Popular Mechanics welcome element 115 now what's your real name researchers create element 115 the lab for the second time over the first time Oh overall in the first time in a decade paving the way for its official status as a member of the periodic table and so Google Bob Lazar and went 150 yeah because I would think that if he knew that like that long ago like that alone would make people want to take him more seriously yeah all the stuff that he said well first of all we know that there is a groom lake we know that there is an Arian 51 we know they denied its existence and so they wanted to expand the perimeter until they wanted to because people would sit on a Ledge and they would watch all these test flights of whatever the fuck they had whatever it was they were doing whether they're working on stealth bombers whatever it was people would film this and so they wanted to expand the perimeter a prohibited area and so in doing so they had to admit the existence of the base itself I believe that was in the 90s right it was in the 90s they expanded the perimeter something else that the government had to do is they had to admit UFOs were real because there was a some military people look at yeah he talked about 115 all through this it was years this Jamie doesn't say the video on the bottom what are the ones it was was this put out this video well this one here is 25 team but the video was taken on VHS what was fuck this is 1990 maybe it's on the sci-fi channel do-do-do-do-do back when it was spelled sci-fi yeah everyone uses a lot of yfy yeah that's old as fuck yeah played some of that though cuz that dudes a trip because he's one of those weird guys where if you're even if you're skeptical guy you listen to Bob Lazar talkin like this guy's obviously smartest fuck came in the top of the reactor and the base of the reactor apparently is the small something similar to a cyclotron it's a particle accelerator a particle is accelerated to high speed and then deflect it up a small tube and it's aimed at the 115 this transmutes the 115 similar to the way we do that in a normal particle accelerator this causes a reaction a radiation emission that we really haven't seen before it produces antimatter this antimatter is guided down a tuned tube and reacts with a gas when matter and antimatter react they convert to a hundred percent energy this energy is converted heat energy is converted to electrical power in the reactor itself this is done through a thermoelectric converting and this electrical power is used to power other subsystems on the craft though there is no wiring you know as we would know it also that's almost a byproduct of the reactor the reactor also sets up gravitational wave from the 115 being bombarded this gravitational wave was present at the top of the reactor and it is essentially guided in the same way microwaves are guided through tuned tubes and this goes to their amplifying cavities and through the projectors that are in the bottom of the craft god I wish I was smart enough to know what a nice full of shit well I can so what he's saying is that there's a gravity wave that's accessible on a large element that extends beyond the perimeter of the atom and when you bombard that that element with one particle kind of like what we were talking about before it goes through a tuned tube like a very tiny miniature CERN it sounds like a big magnet holds a particle in a very specific spot it hovers it shoots and it hits that it decays it becomes this matter any matter reaction these generators can convert all that energy into power and then they can amplify that wave that's coming off and emanating from that element and they amplify it like you would amplify a radio wave now there's no wires in the crap because most likely it was 3d printed we didn't know about 3d printing back then I've talked to Bob about this but not just three 3d printing you know just the materials but atomically aligning the elements so so consciousness and other types of things can move through those materials to operate the craft it's really so operating it without buttons right operating it so that was one theoretically he said theoretically right was that there was handprints and that you know there were much different shaped hands and ours yeah and this craft that he had found inside one of these bays in area 51 he realized very quickly that it wasn't something that we had created and that it was somehow another powered through intention yep that would go through like touch or feel or put their hands would be on this thing and consciously you would somehow another control all the various aspects of this machine exactly exactly so it sounds good doesn't it god I want to believe so hard well I I hope you do because there's gonna be there's gonna be a lot of stuff on but I want to know what you've seen though so you've seen this piece of metal what else have you seen I've seen many many documents on the studies of these things and I've seen a lot of the science associated with what the technology is and what it does like I could show you if I fold up pieces of paper and stuff what's going on with it but basically I you know these craft well you know when when you travel in a straight line but they're folding spaced like in event horizon where they explain it by folding a piece of paper and punching a so through it you ever see them yeah yeah it's kind of like I've been moving but it's more like you know here I can draw it for you here not that this is a it's kind of like when you have two points you know we're used to traveling in a direction like that mm-hmm and so when we look up we see a plane that goes straight right but these these UFOs fold space-time like this and so it looks like to them they're going in a straight line so if you're in the ship you see that but if you're on the ground you see that okay that's why you see them blink off and on a lot of those videos they're on they looks like they're jumping it's just because of this so they're having space time some way of interfacing with space itself that's very different than our idea of traveling in a linear way from point A to point base space the fabric they call it the fabric of space-time because it's like a fabric it's malleable now let me ask you this how often into a conversation do people look at you and think you are fucking crazy when you start talking about this and how all the time all the time right but do you ever get to the probably like I don't want to talk about this no because it's it's you I always tell me you don't know what I know you know and there's a lot I know no I mean like do you ever get to the point where you're like I can't do this anymore people think I'm fucking crazy no because I'm involved on the most important shit I've ever been in my life I think this is like the most important thing you've ever done fuck yeah like I have meetings with senators coming up like oh fuck yeah with senators I can't tell you damos all this I can't tell you stuff I know this is some fucking trend shit when is all this gonna come out like it seems like this is like animate eminent rather disclosure type shit watch what my company does that's what I'll say so what is your company what do you what are you trying to do well we created so if you look at the people involved we have senior high when you get to the senior levels of government you're either called an SES or SAS senior intelligence service senior executive service or your brass but either way the civilians have the same kind of ranking Charter that that the brass does so SES three SAS three would be the same thing as a three-star general so alright that's what if that's who these people are around me so I had the head of the skunkworks engineering I got you know sis to star from the clandestine Directorate of operations I have a guy Undersecretary of the Intelligence for the Senate Intelligence Committee and was these guys are retired the quasi retired quasi record well they all they all left they are our current look life they an hour involved the way you're doing the way they are current consultants to the Internet the intelligence community okay that's a probably the man involved in this project with clearance they they all have their top-secret SAT SSDI clearances yeah I'm the only one that does it on my entire team I'm the only one that does actually loo that just came out I hired him away so he was head of all he was in charge of all classified operations for secretary defence mattis so he was what's called a gs-15 right underneath the one two three stars he ran the advanced aerial FET program and it's still continuing to this day and he's with us now so the advanced aerial threat program under the United States government is essentially a UFO that's one of the mission gathering yes assessment assessment of all of the of what those machines are doing that gives off all these types of effects that people are witnessing but there's also a very large group of people that have had within government that have had close contact like hundreds and it's connected to my group and there's just more coming in that way so that that program is trying to figure out what those technologies did to those people and how those technologies work even though in its more saddle it's more about tasking you know our assets like satellites and other things to be able to find these things better but um this is different than the secret machines book which is more of another thing also is their communication between the United States government and alien life-forms I I personally I mean I don't know any of the stuff because I'm not invited to those types of meetings but I personally wouldn't doubt it yeah you wouldn't doubt it but they've never alluded to it or discussed it with you in any way not yet not this group of people no is there any speculation as to what they're doing resource extraction resource extraction Lamar like minerals entire building I tell people arm these no I think it's changed I did think it's tacos I think you know they're here for the same reason I am but I tell people like a good way to look at this is like look at Syria and Syria's and chaos because the United States and Russia are having a proxy war there now look at the earth it's the exact same thing different races are coming here and and they're trying to win and against each other one oh yeah yeah we're talking about all right I don't know how many I don't know but there's a bunch of different creatures and they all have the same sort of technology yeah and some are very human some are looked just like you and I really absolutely yeah now is there any sort of speculation as to why life-forms from other planets other galaxies of the solar system's different kind of gravity different environments would create a life-form that's exactly similar to us or are they imitating what we look like in order to infiltrate our world and hang with us I think probably following I think all the above I mean look if you look at if you look at like Syria are you just gonna say it's only Russia and America there are China's probably there France is probably there you know yeah I personally think the little the little aliens of the big black eyes those are androids they're biological robots they're just programmed there's no different than us cloning sheep they just clone a being that can travel through space cuz space or some sort of artificial intelligence thing that it is a life-form right I've heard that idea before and it kind of kind of makes sense a little bit right I mean if if you're a living thing and you're traveling through space obviously you have biological limitations in terms of the need for oxygen and gravitational interactions and all these different things that one of the scariest hallmarks of those ones the the room or is it in the back of their head as a transmitter so you got to wonder where it's sending shit but at the same time you know I can tell you that when you look at the Bible the angels and the demons of the Bible would be the humans androids that I just told you about so you think the greys are the androids right so you think they're like some sort of devil no I just think that that's how we characterized it because they come in control your thoughts control your body - yeah demons you know um so do you think these things are traveling from where do we have any idea there's things that have been put out there but I've never asked why would you not ask them what the fuck I did tell me star system like 483 and what you know about element 115 I would want to know about Starship Enterprise coordinate 115 nine six five Polaris wherever the fuck it is yeah I don't know I don't know I do know that there's Collette there's connections - um man you won't even fucking believe it I'll tell you that please Atlantis Atlantis the sunken city yeah there's a connection there's a connection what's the connection that there is a very advanced group that left after a catastrophe and hung around in a small outpost here and and throughout time would push civilization forward and not so the Greek gods were whoa yeah and that's why it's very interesting when the Roswell wreckage there's Greek writing is there there is I've never seen any of the wreckage from Roswell view it's online yes yeah type in Roswell wreckage you can see it whatever scene as the dude standing in front of the bullshit the weather balloons stuff look laughing yucking it up Roswell wreckage Roswell I beam you'll see it and uh and it's got these Greek markings as far and the witnesses that were there did did what do you call it where they go on seiyya on oath until so that actual eye beam showing the word LF theory which means freedom in ancient Greek so I saw it from Jamie let me tell you why I keep me popped up with it well I'm going to tell you something else so I went and met a former director of CIA and NSA he was director of both I won't tell you his name and right when I sat down and told him about my book pull the picture up again lose little hands and right when I sat down and told him about my you gotta this is a big deal okay so I'm sitting with this guy he was like not that long ago was director of CIA and he went on to be director of NSA okay well I think we can find his name maybe but uh right when I sat down and told him about the book you know what he says to me what he goes I didn't read much science fiction as a kid but I've read a lot about Greek mythology and looked me in the eye said well you're gonna love the last page in my book then he's all mi and when my book was about ready to go to pressing I had a very important person call me up he says can you stop that pressing and maybe insert something about Greek mythology and I said I sure can so once something you got to realize is for example the sixth biggest defense contractor in the world at least the u.s. b6 is it kind of called science applications international corporation SAIC their headquarters are actually in San Diego and in the front of the building you have a an oblique coming out of a fake lake and two Atlantean on Thrones and they're both holding pyramids and one says the past and one says the future it's in there 8-foot tall statues it's fucking nuts by the way in SAIC they just they win over Toledo's Michael Hayden former director of NSA and the CIA what about it no that's I am hmm but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tell you if you try and find out okay you guys are fishing around over here I'll say a name you blink yeah I'll show you my dick like if you whatever you get I'm gonna show you my dick what do you think about all that zecharia sitchin stuff I think he was close I don't think he was exact but its interpretive you know if I was to show you some symbols for people who don't know what that is zecharia sitchin is a Palestinian scholar that decoded a lot of ancient Sumerian texts are written in Akkadian sumaré was like kind of the first civilization that was advanced that we even know of just out of nowhere here like 3500 years before Christ there's mathematics astronomy and all this different shit they knew all the planets they said there's an extra planet but zecharia sitchin was the was the one that really spent a lot of time doing that and there's there's a lot of other scholars that disagree now he can say you know in those texts is the is the story of the Garden of Eden the the flood of Noah like all that shit but his take on it was those who from heaven to earth came called them angels but they were an advanced race they fucked around with genetics well that was the his take on the definition of Nephilim was the was yeah what you find you find that in Genesis the Nephilim so you know he was able to tell a really interesting story based on these texts and but some people don't agree with them but at the end of the day I think it's the closest thing we got and in my early conversations when I was speaking when I was being given some interesting science fiction stuff for my book the the Greek mythology part I brought up the Sumerians and they showed me one particular King they said this we find this one very interesting and I can't remember his name but it fired so quick when I asked the question it came right back with this whole thing on this one Sumerian king really interesting well what's fascinating about them is that they really did know a lot about our solar system can you think about the fact they're around five thousand years ago they had a detailed model of the solar system with all the planets and they were all relatively close in size this is a clay one of those clay cylinders that you would what you would do is you would put out a flat piece of clay and you would roll this cylinder over it and that's how they would print things yep and this in this really sort of kind of primitive way of doing this this somehow or another they knew a lot about astronomy I mean they knew about the structure of our solar system they knew where the planets were right well you got to remember Galileo was almost killed and confined to his house house arrest because he said that the universe doesn't revolve around us we revolve around the Sun and that was way after that's four or five thousand years after the Sumerians that already knew that you know we weren't the center of the universe so right it's interesting we were really smart and then we went kind of backwards you know and and there's probably a bit more to that story too that hopefully one day we'll get into it well it's just it's really interesting when you look at these ancient civilizations and their attempts to decipher the world around them and you try to figure out what did they know you know how much did they know the the Sumerians are one of the more interesting cases to me because of the fact that they had this really bizarre map of the solar system yeah when you know we didn't they found out about Pluto they had an image of Pluto and I don't think we found out about Pluto until like the early 1900s you know the Pluto might have even been like 50 you can find that out Pluto was found like like not even that long ago I don't know if it was as far back as they might you see if you could find that out and then find the image of the Anunnaki when they show the solar system because the image is really fascinating because it is what it is I mean you look at it this there's a Sun I mean it's clearly a Sun it has like it's a large circle it's in the sky and it has like those little Sun sort of raised around this picture right because yeah yeah that's the picture there you go so you know they they have an idea of where to look for this extra planet they thought in the early 90s JPL announced that they thought they found a companion to our Sun yeah look at that I mean that's fucking radical right there yeah that's crazy they have Pluto in there now go to the discovery of Pluto when when did Pluto get discovered I think you're right I think it was in the 1950s I know it was sometime in the 1900 which I need 30 1930 crazy crazy shit yeah so these people somehow or another knew about Pluto Falk and way before us and this is not something you can see with the naked eye so somehow or another and nor were these other planets I mean you could see a few of them you can see Mars and sometimes you could see Jupiter and maybe Saturn right do you see Saturn what are the ones you can see some naked eyes you see Saturn yes yeah but ever after that like they had Uranus you can't see just the other keys like the one time of I don't know every 25 years you could barely see it with the naked eye we ran it last week or something like that your range that we're at a Griffith Observatory it was like super crowded because of that are we not gonna we're not gonna make jokes and shit about Uranus right no because it's so all is expected yeah and were they looking at with the naked eye observe because windows there was a bunch of telescopes already set up Friday but that makes sense for telescopes but why would the naked eye because it's one of the best places closest in LA here I don't know okay yeah always weird because of the light pollution right no so it's a big deal like that's why you know when you go to the desert and it's beautiful it was last week October 19th you could see with your naked eye that you're in this unit you guys are talking about naked and Uranus a lot here and I don't want to make any jokes I'm not but I'm just telling you we're talking about see your ass with your naked eye this week giggle if you must know what a goofy name - like what all the different sounds you can make with your face and they chose your butthole what if they just call it Buttle yeah butthole planet but all be just as I would go there fucking crazy fast be the first place I go that would be the first place you visit and plan a puddle yeah do you think that there's life in our solar system I do what do you think it is Europa really mm-hmm so you think there's some sort of a primitive life-form that's under the ice I think there's life on Mars and I think it's will start from I think there's life on Mars I think it's small little animals and microbial or you know insects shit that's kind of learning how to live with its radioactive environment which by the way a bunch of scientists from JPL found that there was some atomic weapons that went off on Mars because the the the radioactive signature is can only happen if you explode a nuclear weapon that's artificially made not like a like something that happens naturally like a moon exploding on the surface so it's interesting so you read that oh shit that's that's been all over the place I forgot the guys name the doctor's name he's a he actually was a one of the lead scientists on Clementine mission which was mapping the moon with JPL so he's a big time dude and he thinks there was nuclear war yeah he did huge well he doesn't say that he just says that nuclear weapons he just says we have this signature he all peer-reviewed science that the signature of the radioactive activity from this very specific isotope that only comes from artificial nuclear explosion or something shit I don't want to that's something long those lines yeah well I had heard before they thought that somehow another Mars was impacted there's something hit it like some sort of raster or oil impact and it destroyed the environment I think it's the NIF you type in nuclear weapon Mars or nukes on Mars or some shit you'll find it you go to Richard Hoagland site he kind of disappeared though yeah that kind of was wacky as fuck like he was one of the who's that one of the main proponents of the face on Mars and all the pyramids that they found on Mars they would find these weird yeah connections between one point to another point and somehow or another they made some arbitrary distinctions that those were indicative of intelligent design you know yellow mice going to drop nukes up there too good move Elon Musk elaborates on hosel to nuke Mars how's that picture he's probably bored he put on his Instagram last night he was cooking the hot dogs and marshmallows and singing along with Johnny Cash drinking whiskey that's what fucking scientist yeah that's you want much for president I'll vote for you buddy come on let's do it why'd you talk to him and he's already got SpaceX once you guys the second thing we're doing he might really actually be interested in and so the two aerospace projects to the stars is doing one is we're building something that will in effect be anti-gravity but it's actually that's actually not the mechanism it does in building a spacecraft but the second thing that we're doing is called beamed energy propulsion which is something I think musk will be very interested in it's launching cube SATs with lasers so the Air Force Research Lab kind of broke this science back in the 90s and a bunch of people associated with that program got it Declassified and they're working for us on building it so it'll take a handful of years to do but what you do is you use very strong either microwaves or some other kind of wave and it ignites and explodes the air underneath a mechanism that carries a CubeSat and so essentially what what happens is is you don't use any fossil fuels and it can bring the cost of launching a CubeSat from like 50 grand down to five grand it's like crazy so that means colleges and neighbors and and anyone else can launch cube SATs quite easily now if you had any debates with people about this stuff if you ever like had someone who thinks that this is all nonsense and sat down with you understands physics and understands rocket propulsion space and elements and all that shit um no I have it I wouldn't be able to debate a physicist but they can read all the papers you know right but I mean has anybody been skeptical yeah everyone's like oh yeah and what's your response to that you don't know what I know right well you know though I can't I don't know I can't tell you some of the shit that I know and I can't tell you but what could it be that's so crazy if you you know I mean what you've said well think about what you've said you said that there's some ridiculous sort of propulsion system that allows you to move through time that they they visit this planet all the time and extract resources right that there's people in the government that are trying to disseminate this information but they don't know how to do it they don't know the right vehicle do it they're doing it in these sort of controlled chunks mm-hmm think of all these things that you said what could possibly be crazier than that well you're asking me how do I know and no no I'm asking you what do you know that could possibly be crazier than that well I that's the shit I can't tell you it's not everything's hunky-dory is it something were you worried about the fate of the human race I think that's part of it where should I move move it's not existence rip your dick out if I should go to Australia I mean where's the spot I don't think there is one unavoidable spot this is what I will say there it's not existential in the sense of they're not gonna come here like Independence Day and nuke the place but they're you know there are things to worry about and that's why I think do you think there's anybody that's famous that's an alien oh I don't know do you think there's any influential figure that has been sort of shaping culture that might not be one of us Oprah for sure it has to be Oprah yeah but if you go back to the early days when Oprah's do that stupid show we should have like KKK members on everybody sat on white plastic seats when were those days it's not Geraldo is that Oprah Oprah or early days man me and Al magic oh I'll never forget this it was like when I first met al probably like late 90s I think we were in San Francisco doing bong hits watching TV and Oprah was on and it was old Oprah narrow Brera hair oprah find out about the 90s might have been early to thousands of aliens from men and black they were watching at the beginning member yeah you know i don't know i mean i again there's there's elements of this subject that are that are disturbing and you know I don't think people need to know all that shit so do you subscribe to the idea that human beings are the product of genetic engineering I do yes so you think that they took some lower hominids and that they did something to them to create human beings that is a very popular theory among UFO fanatics well and ie boat A's I I don't want to speak again for my company but one of the people on our board scientific they call it a SAP scientific advisory board is a lead geneticist from Stanford who I think he was up for the Nobel this year what's his name dr. Gary Nolan and he would be the Jeannette he would be the guy to ask about that at him in here but he would be he's he's only gonna tell you what's what what he can prove with science he's not going to speculate right now so what what makes people think that like what's the science that makes people think that well there's a lot of junk DNA there's certain parts of our DNA that seems to have been turned off there's there's a bunch of things in there that we don't understand and we don't have the leaps of humanity over the past five thousand years to really show like where did what happened in the past 5,000 years that wasn't happening for the hundreds of millions of years before that they just found a footprint that was on like 100 million years old or something like that that was just a human footprint but they did yeah I just don't know I don't know I can't remember but it's like a fossil and now they're like fuck this totally throws everything upside down I'm talking to Sarah Palin that was something to say about Palin said remember that like there was a librarian that said that she she didn't believe that she was a young earth creationist she thought that there was a picture online that showed a human footprint inside a dinosaur footprint that approved that people walked with Dinosaurs I wouldn't doubt it i I think out that people walk with darkness oh not at all I think there's been cycles of civilizations and I think the people on the inside know that and that's why at that defense contractor multi Multi multi multi-billion dollar defense cotton the one that shows the government of Iraq after we took over Iraq and the ones looked over after all of our nukes hey looky there they had inside a dinosaur footprint she's right but they have on but they have at that place remember I told you they have the past in the future with big pyramids in their hands let regions you know that they're try it's like it's a spooky when you look at that do you believe that the asteroid hit the Yucatan caused a mass extinction that killed off most of the life on the planet I don't know I can't believe me I don't know fuck I've never studied that shit and I wasn't there but that mean it's like physical evidence for that it's more like ability well yeah but I haven't read anything about it but sure okay I mean I can believe in things I can't prove a lot of things you know right but that's like the whole reason why we were supposedly here that it killed off the dinosaurs and allowed whatever that they think there was some sort of a mole mole type creature that evolved over 65 million years because bullshit I think it's all bullshit I think you think evolutions bullshit um no I think that at some point in history they came someone came here and tampered with existing creatures and made us and upgraded us at very specific and who tampered with them and what came first the chicken or the egg you know question yeah I know a single-celled organism we all kind of agree like that was like the beginning right most scientists not we I'm too stupid for this but obviously somehow or another that became a bird right why couldn't it become a monkey why could that monkey become a person I think it yeah I don't know I mean look evolution changes I mean we could we know that people that like beat their kids their kids DNA changes based on getting beat you know so when you were fighting you were changing people's DNA and you were a geneticist you know you went after it for science you know that's why we were doing the fighting right lab coat on so if you if you think about it that way if you think about that all life somehow or another continues to evolve an advanced and through natural selection genetic mutation and random mutations that things move from one stage of existence to what they are today right that what when you look at you know a condor or a hippopotamus sure that it used to be something different and now it's that sure why wouldn't that be the case of people - I think that is the case with people I just think that the quantum leaps in our evolution are symptoms or effects of being genetically upgraded the way I've heard it explained to me though is that those the only leap that's really confusing is the doubling of the human brain you have the big leap and it's over the period of two million years apparently obviously I'm too stupid to really understand this but from what I've read what I've heard people talk about that's apparently one of the biggest missing mysteries when it comes to the human fossil record but there's a pretty clear line apparently from Australia Pittacus - you know - the whole season big words on me try a Pittacus is not a big word sounds like it what the fuck is that stuff again penis your anus yeah so what is your company aiming to do and when are you trying to do it so the next steps so to the Stars Academy of Arts and Science wisely in Academy because eating people yeah there's there's teaching there's science there's arts major you know there's film franchises so what this don't say musicals no musicals right it's only musical everything's cool but yeah really stupid art form object it's it's a musical but it's very salacious very very sexual musicals but okay so what we did essentially is you have a senior engineer chief engineer from the classified aerospace world build and shit and then you have a guy like me that's putting out some stories and making some movies about some things and then you have my physicist can I stop you there I'm sorry to interrupt but why stories and why fiction like why not just gonna be both there's me both but why fiction why not just concentrate entirely on revealing the truth um because it has to be managed in a certain way for people to understand and I think that someone sitting down and watching a debate play out and having an idea of what what went on over the past 70 years they'll come out of that with an emotional response and more of an understanding and then want to go watch the documentary and then want to buy some of the non-fiction works that we've done I've already put out one of our non-fiction book of secret machines now the that movie what is it a rival yeah is that the movie where there's like sort of weird time shit in that movie yeah does that movie have any basis in reality mmm secret people behind the scenes no I don't think so but uh there's nothing in there that's familiar to me other than the fact that the the dream sequences and the time stuff and her having flashes of the DOTC it's absolutely on par and the idea of having an international group work together to figure something out that's absolutely on that's happening right now oh and everybody's keeping their mouth shut oh fuck yeah why are they doing that why aren't people spilling the beans um well it's not every look at Lou Elizondo the guy that works for me they just came from the Pentagon literally quit the Pentagon two weeks ago like I was I can't can't tell you where I met but I oughta can tell I know I'm sorry but um but uh he's with me and he was on stage with me on the live event we did on the 11th saying I left the Pentagon days ago I ran this particular UFO program and this is what we know and they are real and we're going to continue that program here to the stars now but what's your so your goal is to release this information through documentaries through films and educate people of the existence of this and is it to make a ship well no so we're bringing it so this is once again look there by putting together you can't attack this subject by just like if you make a movie so that's a crazy movie if you make a science paper on it and no one's gonna read it and the technology will never see the light of day because it's been modified as weaponry or whatever it is that the only way to get people to understand what the fuck is going on is by first present them the story so they have an understanding that Israel and it is happening and lay it in a way that's grounded in practical and but still moves you and then follow up with the science and then show them that that thing you're watching in the movie can be engineered and created so we are doing it all together but there's a thing called a community of interest so to the Stars is also building a portal with the Department of fence to share information to educate people to put some Declassified now Declassified videos of UFOs some science some documents and have open forms and have current military people talk to young adults so you're gonna expose people to this narrative and explain to them through stories what this could be that sets the stage then you start to introduce the actual real elements that actually exist yep and then eventually what what's the end game well the end game is to the technology itself is like so when you make when you when you create this energy source the power is a spacecraft it's called an overunity machine so it puts out more power than what's put into it you can desalinate ocean water with it you can get rid of atomic power so there's no radio no more Fukushima is you know it could do a lot of different things but it also will rapidly rapidly transform our entire transportation and communication network so the end result with that is that will get spun out into a company that's probably partners with major aerospace organizations which with whom I'm already talking and we partner on it I guess you can't tell me who they are no fuck no I can't tell you and we bring that out to the world but the only way that can be brought out to the world as if the public owns it and we build it from scratch by the public why is the public have to own it because well I guess you could be in a way a private person but the technology it probably has an element of what they call eminent domain so we're gonna get to a certain point where certain agencies will probably knock on our door and go what the fuck are you doing and we're gonna say the public owns this you can't take it from them they're gonna say fuck yeah we can take it we're gonna say we're gonna work something out because it's like building a nuclear bomb in your basement kind of thing so so when you say the public owns it like how will that be possible how the how the public owned it the you can go to our we've we reserved a small amount of shares of the company that people can buy stock in the company right now so a year ago this is not the public that's private it's no private ownership right if people buy the company can go public but no it is public so the year-and-a-half ago maybe twenty four months ago the SEC wanted to democratize going public with companies just like an IPO but not spend millions of dollars and do it so they launched what's called a regulation a direct public offering and we had a file with the SEC so we had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this and we spent the last six months doing it and our live event launched that so you can go to change you did this just so that you can tell the whoever the fuck it is that will come after you that hey the public owns this you can't take this that's one element of everything that we're doing yeah that so your anticipate you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to anticipate someone coming in and closing the doors and they yet you're talking about it in advance we're like you're essentially telling strategizing that you know but you're letting them know that you know that they're gonna come and get it be much harder to shut it down when the whole world has paid for it invested in it owns it and so you try to get people to buy things I'm trying what we mean you try to get people to buy stock well yeah right now we're public you can buy shares of the company you can only we only put up a very limited amount that we only put I think we only put up five five million shares or so so that seems like a lot of chairs how many shares are there all others looks like a hundred million probably or something like a hundred how does that Cher's work shares like you just work like say if we came up with young Jamie incorporated yeah and we wanted to start selling shares when you file as a corporation you can issue shares and you can sell those shares to people and those shares have a price based on you know how you want to value your company you know okay so you could have like a hundred million shares of young Jamie incorporated yep you sure again okay and so then the government can't shut you down bro yeah well you guys maybe because you you say a lot about words no no no Jamie doesn't but I'm warmin we do a lot at the company right so we're building essentially a science fiction version of Disney okay so we have four film franchises not all of them about UFOs one is kind of this Blade Runner night all about nightmares kind of thing one is like an old Amblin Spielberg who's making these things oh we are I mean who's writing them I wrote the first one I'm directing that you're directing too I wrote this script and you multi-talented motherfucker look I'm that's where I'm going with most of this stuff but the company I had to get up and get going and set it up and we bring in a CEO this is my kind of shit that's a bizarre formula right an entertainment company that's also gonna do aerospace and science well the heart of it is when we do what's called confirmation not disclosure confirmation uh-huh the heart of it is is how do we tell stories that galvanize the human race and let them know a little bit more but what's going on and how do we present them science so they understand that consciousness and a lot of other things are real and how do we build a technology associated with those stories and with those science that can change the world and that's why it's an academy do they have any pickled bodies anywhere from malya Hyde I believe they did yeah you believe they didn't nobody's ever told you that I believe together I believe they do you believe they do you can't say any more than I'm not gonna say any more than that she said so much I know I know what you can and can't say well I could tell you other shit offline probably okay offline I can't wait to end this podcast kick me out anybody play some weird shit so now what what's the timeline for moving forward with all this stuff okay so in the next few weeks we're going to be releasing the first declassify videos of these advanced aerial threat UFOs and they are current videos that were just caught and with audio and everything of the people tracking them and we're gonna launch the beta version of the community of interest which is the partnered website that's going to be hosting all this Declassified information where we're gonna be having the hard core conversations with people that want to understand the stuff we're going to be also doing an experiment with that piece of metal to show the world that the technology is not only real but its it's demonstratable and the videos are very much a proof of concept you know it was showing you look at works you know so we're going to build it and do you think it's gonna be weird for people to take you seriously because you're a rock star like maybe were like some sort of a physicist maybe scientists I would listen to you more well you know I remember when Elon came out years ago and he started SpaceX and then he started Tesla here's this dude's saying all this ambitious shit I didn't buy any of it I think guys a hundred times smarter than the both of us combined he's fuckin gnarly I know but I'm just saying he caught Issa lievable once a year maybe maybe I think he is I mean shit he's badass but look at the people you what's interesting to me is you haven't seen who are with have you looked at the BIOS on the shit no yeah you got to read the BIOS of the people I wanted I didn't want to be tainted I wanted to talk to well one of the on my on mice at the scientific board advisory board is you know one of the guys at CIA that headed up the entire bio warfare program in the Director of Operations a clandestine division so all these guys have found use how various ways so they've come to you because they you're like the beacon I I did some things as this is the way to go I did something that no one thought was possible what's that was tying together a mechanism that can perpetually fund itself and can communicate and can innovate all with people that sit at it see I created a roundtable with engineers scientists until high-ranking intelligence officials and and some others I can't tell you about obviously and the this in the defense world it's called stovepiping so when they when they compartmentalize a secret they put them into these vertical categories that can't talk to each other I created a horizontal structure where all these people in these amazing accomplished positions and government were able to come together at the same table and they can discuss what we want to teach the world and how we want to do that and but the but the way to do that is including the public and making it a public benefit corporation and what that means is we're able to spend money and it's in our Charter on things that can benefit the world and not just provide a return to the investors but what we're doing happens to be extremely lucrative my my engine lucrative for investors our investors and the company sews it like save young Jamie wants to be a part of it what is it what is you have to do you just go to the Stars Academy comm and you buy shares whatever you want to buy and I will be lucrative for him because the first of all the technology it sells like a trillion dollar thing it we can figure that out over the next eight years and they think we can so they who's they the the engineers that are building this thing the guy so Steve Justice that was head of advanced programs of the skunk works we talked about that they build all of our they are the tip of the spear for the most advanced spacecraft an aircraft that the United States national security apparatus has period period hands down and he was the big boy there and their model we we think we have us you know this is a this is a guess but I think there's a 60% chance within thirty six months or so we'll be able to demonstrate something pretty kick-ass and as long as there's no major obstacle there we think within eight years we'll be able to have something but it's expensive and we got to work with the government and we're gonna have to work with major aerospace for example this one meeting I have coming up with with a big-name aerospace company is offering their material sciences division we need that we need to be able to create certain metals that can resonate in certain certain frequencies shit like that the other way that the company makes money is when we build this the the satellite launching system that's like exactly what Elon is doing now putting satellites in orbit but we don't have to build rockets we can launch them with lasers that's a big deal you point lasers at the bottom of a CubeSat which is like the size of a shoebox and you could put it into low-earth orbit and you can put it up even higher without using any fossil fuels with using light that's a big deal that's a multi-billion dollar gimmick right there it's just been proven yeah I told you seeing a proof that there's this video of this happen yeah it's it's in our launch video if you watch the video at the top of the to the stars Academy comm page you'll see shots of it where little things glowing and it's getting beamed up into the sky that's the Air Force yeah my guys were on that project little things glowing but yeah like mass though like a satellite yeah yeah they're called CubeSat you know to CubeSat is no a CubeSat is a modular box that you you put together as modules based on what you need okay I need a thruster I need a sensor and I need a fucking RF signal thing to send the data back home so now I got three little boxes attached that's a CubeSat they call them cubes so it's essentially it's probably 80% of satellite business but now they got to put all these Cube sets together on Musk's rocket that's also launching giant satellites for DoD or whatever but it's super expensive because you have a rocket and you have all that fossil fuels and all this stuff if you launch these cube SATs with lasers because they're not that heavy and you can like I said it would take a cost of launching a CubeSat from 50 grand a pound down to five grand that's a huge it so the idea of this actually happening that's on your what's the to the Stars Academy com1 it is and you can watch that you can watch the video and then you go to the entertainment division which is my primary spot you know making movies and selling millions of books and licensing the stuff out is the differ is the reason why Disney's 300 billion and Warner Brothers is five billion Warner Brothers just makes movies Disney's make Frant they make franchises and they're vertically integrated we put out the book we put out the t-shirts we make the movie so that's really where we're going and we have we have three television series that are probably one of which will be announced probably in the next couple weeks the other two were a little further out on that the first film our first film is first quarter of next year I wrote that one and I'll be directing that one it's called strange times which is like a hard-r version of The Goonies but funny but scary and fucked up but with 17 and 18 year old kids and then and then secret machines the motion picture that's these are all franchises so strange times has an animated series that's coming out we have a wonderful writer from sorry at live that's show running the thing we have an unscripted show coming out on the entire company just following us in a very National Geographic way as we do all these things and as we build lasers as we're on the movie sets as we're in the lab you know pinging that those uh those pieces of metal I told you about so there's a lot of things like that going so that when you ask about how do we monetize all this shit we have a full functioning entertainment visions been up for a few years that's what I've been doing and that's how I made the book and we've put out seven novels already but your end goal is ultimately to expose all this information my American my end goal is not that my end goal is to build a company that changes the world and by doing a traditional IPO in the next five to seven years and to do that I grabbed very very high-ranking people from various areas in the government to achieve all this stuff and they don't need to come in on the movies I have that unlock that's my thing but it can it can function as a way to help people understand what the fuck is going on so some of the movie some of the TV series some of the non-fiction works that we do will all be about that subject but the rest of it won't be all right dude well that's a very ambitious project and let us know when you're ready to go to the Moon or Mars or wherever the fuck you're gonna go Uranus yeah you can go to Uranus all those places and I hope it's all real I'm excited cool thanks true thanks for having me oh thanks for coming on brother yeah so much thank you bye everybody [Music]
