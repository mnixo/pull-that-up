the gyro gun experience there's a whole article I just saw from somebody posted it I think on Twitter and it was it was they asked they pulled a guy as an old newspaper article he pulled guys whether it's okay to spank a woman and the answers they pulled like five or six guys there's an old article and they were all like absolutely like she needs it she's out of line and she doesn't she's doing you just trying to help her I thought that was hilarious hysterical yeah if a would need zit should she be spanked the best part about it was Ritz read it let's read it so fucking funny why not Jesus Christ if they don't know how to behave by the time they're adults they should be treated like children and spanked that ought to make them grow up in a hurry if it doesn't at first they'll soon get the idea this is incredible get the idea hey yes when they deserve it as a barber I've got a lot of faith in the hairbrush oh my god I think there are certain cases when it is advisable when it is there's no reason why you shouldn't go right ahead and do it I can't knock the idea in my business a man sets a lot of the sub store sets a lot of store by the results he can get with a hairbrush properly applied nice little smack now here's the countess I mean no sets a lot of store maybe wasn't the business term back then man sets a lot of store are you ready for the counterpoint yes okay there's none everybody yeah that's it the best part is everybody takes the point of view look at this guy parking lot attendant from Brooklyn you Teddy galell you bet you bet it teaches em who's boss a lot of women tend to forget this is a man's world and a lot of men who stepped down as boss of a family wish they hadn't spanking might help get back some of the respect they lost look at Teddy look it's Joey Diaz his cousin if I gotta listen cocksucker spank him if they want it William Davis what is Williams a toy factory owner yes most of them have it comin to them anyway if they don't it will remind them of how well-off they are I subscribe to the theory that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure holy shit look at him look at that evil looking fuck looks like Rutger how's brother Wow does he look like wrecker Hauer and Robert De Niro fuck that looks evil sounds like that one uh holtzman oh yeah it does a little like Holtzman imagine that guy spanking your wife let's hear what

that and I seen that was a bigger prison than the one I just got out of and I really didn't care to go back to prison see prison doesn't begin and end at the gate prison is in mine it's locked in one world that's dead and dying or it's open to a world it's free and a lie hold on this guy sounds like me that's democrazy you should have a podcast this guy's great they this one part of the documentary they talk about how they delivered babies at the ranch and they talked about one part where they got like a pair of scissors and just fucking did it homestyle oh Jesus yeah how we had babies like that what a sick fuck but it discharged a long time ago when I did The Tonight Show at one of the one of the sets on there and I had a joke with a setup kids are like homeless people and they go oh uh could you not say almost people I go the jokes not about homeless people listen to the joke it's about kids and and they go uh maybe just say uh hobo I go well here it's a problem I'm not a comic from the 1800s ah fucking hobo hobo then they came back hobo that's a great word love hobo it just didn't fit and then they came back with wino I go so it's okay to make fun of alcoholics but homeless people they are homeless that I'm not judging right it's what they are it is f what's the context how's the rest of the bit go ah is a don't judge it was a long long time ago I feel like I don't have kids my sister's got kids if they're not yours you realize what kids really are they're tiny homeless people there's chase you around the house all the way I would Hank I have a dollar hey guys oh I'm missing a shoe and I need a ride hey I have a ride okay it's silly it's stupid and that's where they they just lost their mind over the word homeless and well then because I said I always give homeless people money maybe shouldn't my brother goes don't he's just gonna go buy more alcohol and cigarettes and I go oh like I wasn't so I'm bringing it still back to me I'm still making fun of me right yeah I go so what am I supposed to say don't give that why no money oh yeah I know a hobo I'm sorry I don't have any material about riding the rail well Kathleen we've done some polls and people are very uncomfortable with the word homeless I guess so yeah it's not funny okay there are victims involved here and it's not funny but fuck winos it's a societal problem that we're trying to work through winos you're locking it yes it's not just people can walk this is the guy was talking about iconic outfit video is called eccentric apartments in Park West man and halfway they
