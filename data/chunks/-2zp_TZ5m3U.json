hello freak bitches like my friend Remy Remy Warren was in New Zealand and he used one of those and like wrote in the log you know where he was from when he was there and I guess it also it helps identify people are missing exactly I think it's a safety precaution so it's you know you can kind of track down where was the last person seen you know or where were they last seen so if they were if they logged in to you know shelter and then you know they can't find anything it's okay on this date we know that they were here so you can give a given radius and know that if they are missing they're within at least within a certain you know 20 while distance wash bags are there but yeah and I think there's things actually turned into like just fun you know some people just go right full-on poems in there some you know confess like life stories and they're like oh my god yeah the trail logbooks are entertaining that out Wow here warning was this a harassing bear in camp night of five eleven swipe claws in two tents hmm stepped on my tent Atilla collapsed on me please be careful he didn't even try to get the food hanging low on a branch oh look at her name Ashley flower passion flower with sad face and there's another one bear ripped this is a different this is a different person's handwriting they ripped the bag hanging on my pack which was hanging on my hammock I was Moses a little shake balancing bouncing up and down he stole my toilet paper exclamation point was it's a subway that's his name subway eat fresh yeah MTS the TV is great what's a pity we're pretty it's the prison it's just like an outhouse oh okay compost toilet how about this one dat shit cray all's ghetto Saviour Baltimore looks like for me all balls ghetto Savior Baltimore okay okay well you're dealing with like fringe people right I mean these are people that are just not fitting into the corporate module I don't what what you're talking about with the New York Times and I don't really I'm not going to step out and take a view on it but what I believe you're saying with The Times is that they were pro Clinton and anti Trump that's different from having a position on climate change well it's not well no because they have a position on Clint just just take the lens as climate change you have one candidate who's denying the reality of climate change where who's just claiming that they ignite Mandela Chinese multi Trump well no because it was when Trump says climate change is a Chinese hoax you have to call him he really said that yes yeah yeah oh yeah he said it's a Chinese Hope yes so she should go to China and see those people that are walking around with gas masks from cambree's by Beijing okay but that's a minute that's that's the pollution all right which i think is actually much stronger because it is just you can't go to Beijing and say this is how we want the air to be right but and I just I think something like 20 thinks something like 25 percent of the air pollution in California on some days is coming from China maybe there's some amazing could have that slightly wrong Jamie could check that out but please do there's some some extraordinary amount of air air pollution that we get from China that's insane I did not know that yeah makes its way across the ocean yeah yeah there's there's no wall you know we got to build that wall but no but at a certain point I mean there's some there's some level of dishonesty and misinformation is so egregious that if you're a journalist commit at all committed to being unbiased or a disinterested broker of information and a conversation if you set up a conversation between you know the Shan Spicer's of the world or the Kellyanne Conway's who have their alternative facts and someone who's honestly talking about whatever it is climate change it's very you know you can't split that baby but I don't think you have to create mock unnecessary debates around climate change what I do think is that with the Trump administration that it is imperative for journalist that journalists call out when things are said that aren't true but that I don't think it's constructive for mainstream journalistic organizations to have an openly hostile anti Trump attitude or Pro somebody else attitude because then you lead that just leads to further polarization but which exactly we don't need but you call them out on all the times that he said things that are just absolutely not true that's a little like your anti Trump classic yeah yeah no question there's no question and and I think that's a an issue we're dealing with tonight but I think this is a time of real soul-searching in my industry because I firmly believe there is a very powerful place in a functioning democracy for a press for media that people generally view as fair I don't know how they do it but they figured out how to splice things and change things and selectively breed certain plants and they came up with different strains that's why corn looks the way it looks old school corn was like the size of a hobos dick and it was it's all knotty and fucked up look it was like four inches long tiny thing it tastes the same no I mean it's a hobos dick not elbows dicks weird man they're so variable you never know what you get it could be a recent hobo like that guy who punched you just old school snot blowing veteran yes this dick tastes like battery acid okay yeah dick that's been through the Pacific Southwest for guys just doing noise well Danny comes in your mouth what do you think that too yeah cuz I say that like a guy drinks orange juice has come to taste better Yeah right have you heard that yeah whenever I heard that I was like how many dicks do you have to suck for you figure that out you get away from me you always wear your fucking scientist he's suckin dick with a lab coat on taking notes hmm asparagus not recommended swishing it around your mouth like you're a wine connoisseur you always yelled right if a guy eats pineapples the guy eats pineapples and tastes better right but conversely if you just do nothing but smoking meth your loads have to taste like hot death yeah and it does and it's fucking lumpy Oh pesticide man loads tastes like roundup it's not good when you have to tailor it's not much either it's like a fucking Hershey's kiss swallow get your first paycheck first no no motherfucker first that she's immediately trippin on meth she's out of her mind by the time they came back then they were different enough from coyotes that they not only couldn't interbreed with them anymore but they sort of are mortal enemies of one another I mean when we reintroduce crate wolves to Yellowstone in 1995 coyotes had had 75 years in Yellowstone without any wolves I mean that served as a wonderful laboratory to study them too because it gave us a sense of what happens with coyotes when nobody is harassing them when people are harassing them which of course we didn't in Yellowstone Park and when wolves aren't harassing them either and what we realize is that they create these really stable territories they create very stable packs and their population rises to a particular point the carrying capacity of the landscape based on what they eat which is mostly rodents and rabbits and things and some fruit and and berries but it doesn't they don't their populations sort of levels off and stays at a carrying capacity and so we got to watch that happen in Yellowstone for like 75 years and it's become sort of the the example of what would happen if we just left them alone I mean some people think well if we don't try to control them hell they're gone you know they're just going to be millions upon millions of them running everywhere but that's actually they only do that when you try to persecute them and they go into this colonization mode and generate more and more and more pups and have more and more pups survive so Yellowstone in that period from 1925 to 1995 was this sort of model of what happens when you just leave them the hell alone and they just kind of rise to a particular population level and are really stable at that level and and don't really go beyond it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
