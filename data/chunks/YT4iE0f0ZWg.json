I didn't know I talked about it before I did it I hung up do you or is this like online now oh yeah yeah dude your internet legend right now it's online oh yeah oh cool wait this is on do you see that old couple who couldn't figure out the webcam no there's a funny like viral video of this old couple trying to figure out how to work their webcam and the webcams run it's recording the whole time oh wow yeah it's like cute Jim ajan being an old person dealing with the internet now they must feel ripped off I already find little things that I'm already getting annoyed about like I'm doing that thing where I don't want to learn it big type thing you know like how like my dad doesn't want a iPhone he wants a phone and he doesn't want anything else yeah this is a crazy people right those people I don't look at I don't want no Texas yeah I used to be I don't want a camera are you know I don't provide anything though I mean I find myself thing like like maybe video games maybe or something like that the the swarm of Technology overwhelmed my life so quickly I embraced it so quickly I used to joke about text messages I had a bit about it why is it oh my goodness it's been a long time since I left the fucking phone on ladies and gentleman and I do apologize maybe it's a collar it's a late night podcast folks and I had been doing Fear Factor all day and I know you're tired I don't know what's going on let's hope they don't call back I like this fucks are I like to hear who it is it's kind of this one doesn't tell you it's a better phone though mmm I gave up on it just constantly telling you who's calling I was I don't give a fuck I don't want to have that voice that electronic voice that fuck's up everybody's name receiving call from Brendon the bubble has it repeated over and over yeah do you have any able to answer machines laying around no you should if you if you have one find it like if you have one in your basement or your garage plug that shit in and just listen to the messages of your life from what seven years ago or something like that and it was almost creepiest shit ever I was like wow I was in a weird place right there you know like hey Brian I need you to work two double shifts you know here and there and I think that got my girlfriend pregnant we're gonna go over to the bowling alley later what used to talk to when you were in Ohio yeah like people from Ohio and stuff yeah it was so fucking weird do you look back on people from Ohio like they don't know like the dead Ohio is like I think they're asleep I think I think people don't know how I just feel trapped like it's more like this little trap hey I think I don't think yeah I felt trapped when I was there you know because you don't make a lot of money when you live in Ohio for the majority of people you know I mean you or at least the class I was in I would I was just working like job the job getting laid off you know whatever do another job and it was just like wow $13 an hour $14 an hour something like that and but I they have enough money to like move or go to California that seemed like out of like it's ridiculous you know it's it's hard to move from like that's everywhere that's like the neighborhood I grew up in is the same way like when I moved to I lived in Ireland for a year in like 96 and it blew people's minds they were like how the fuck do you go to Ireland like what do you just bought a plane ticket and I was like yeah you can do that so that's what you did you didn't know anybody in Ireland you just went out there yeah I just went that's pretty Savage I love that I love that idea that's awesome that must have been a hell of an experience it was fun yeah you learn a lot you learned that things usually work out what was the motivation for that uh I actually you know I did talk about this on meirin's podcast recently just play Mary's podcast yeah she's playing go back and I think it was I mean the short story is I was uh somebody I knew drowned and I knew and I had to identify their body whoa and and it just kind of like I was like 23 and she was pretty young she was like 22 or 23 and I was like and she was going taking classes in the summer to graduate college earlier and I just thought like oh she's taking classes like doing all this shit she didn't want to do I don't know I just was like oh you can just do whatever you want like and life short I guess or I don't know but I just that was kind of the motivation for fucked and I saw a cheap ticket to to Ireland I think you might have told me this story before but it's fascinating nonetheless but we did we very rarely get to see dead bodies you know we get so rare that you get to see one I remember when I saw my grandfather my grandfather died of cancer and when when I went to the morgue you know what they have Walt dressed up and shit yeah yeah you standing near the body was like in the casket realized I was like this is the first dead body I've ever been around I've never really been around a dead body it's amazing that all these people died but we do such a good job of keeping bodies away from from people's eyeballs yeah yeah because it's so disturbing well like viewing oh but what doesn't doesn't never kind of tweak you out when you think about a dude who'd be a mortician I mean I understand that it's a very important job I understand it's an important job I do get it and and you know forensic medicine the idea of you know solving crimes and you know checking people's corpses and shit like that dr. Michael Baden I love that it's that's an amazing show that HBO show yeah but doesn't it fucking freak you out that they're handling dead bodies there's something about that man that tweaks my hair just touching dead bodies the idea just the possibility and I know this is not the case with these doctors I know it's most likely not the case of 99.9 percent of the morticians but the fact that there's like the 1% that it would enjoy fucking he's moving him around and smacking him and putting on little shows for himself that I know Sam Kinison bit yes fucking that like Oh made me pee my pants the first time I heard it that bit got me when he lays about doing stand-up comedy that bit and it wasn't even told by Sam Kinison it was told by a girl that I worked with ah I was working at this health club and this girl came in and she was just fucking laughs and she said oh my god is that heavy Boston axe and I saw fucking this guy on TV Sam Kinison oh my god he was so fucking funny oh yeah whoo she goes and she did on the floor she got down on the stuff life keeps fucking you this she did it she did a pretty good job of it because I was laughing hard I was like wow he said what like that's the craziest thing I've ever heard of and then I got a hold of the VHS tape and I remember watching that bit going god damned like that's comedy - that's comedy - I thought colony was that evening at The Improv stuff yeah I thought comedy for white guys was you roll up your sleeves and you talked about pet food yeah you know I mean that's really what you saw on TV a lot and as a child I'd saw that and you know occasionally you saw something on The Tonight Show around you know I saw delirious I don't know I'm a little younger than you when I was 14 I saw delirious and Andrew Dice Clay that his special from the TLA yeah that was yeah delirious is another one I didn't think delirious might have been so good that I never even thought I could possibly do stand-up at that time oh really ridiculous I think was I was getting older when Kinnison came around I was more confident I think delirious was when I was younger and I remember watching on my friend Jimmy lawless his house me and him and his sister where we're watching this and it's fucking it's it was so funny knows not Jimmy John banner Rocco's sister for the record haha around and we're watching and it was so fucking funny that we were like embarrassed to be sitting next to each other and it was so good for the time you know were teenagers in high school Eddie Murphy raw was just like or delirious rather was just just rock really good I rented raw recently again and it's it did you like it I did cuz I wasn't super solid a couple times when I was a kid and just rented it because I couldn't really remember any bits from it yeah and and it it's pretty good I don't know it's some nostalgia to it too or some nostalgia to it but it's like God he's wearing like this leather suit yeah it's awesome fine suit was awesome yeah Martin Lawrence had some fucking awesome suits - yeah black guys could pull that off you know could you imagine if some white comic went on stage you know if Patton Oswalt started off doing shit a leather suits yeah you know there's a hilarious it's something weird about that man black comics can go way more sexy they can go way harder ya know that suits funny when my friend do you know chelsea peretti in chelsea peretti i know the name she's fun she did a half-hour for special for Comedy Central last year and she was gonna wear the red leather suit that Eddie Murphy war we were trying to find something I don't know if she really was gonna do it but did you watch the Roast of Charlie Sheen when Mike Tyson held out his fist and steve-o is facing it broke his nose that was that was funny but you know what was the funniest part was that woman who was that car that one that just attacked yeah the one who went after yeah who is that Amy Schumer Amy Schumer yeah yeah that's who it is dude she's hilarious she's really funny oh my god she attacked Mike Tyson it was one of the most bold and vicious insult attacks I've ever seen and Tyson tried to come back like tried to go out there he said something like I think it was it's many dicks out of you that within you you were a porcupine like that yeah that's exactly what was that what he said yeah yeah and she just goes does anyone have a translator for you yeah yeah I thought it was good I didn't even I didn't watch it but I heard her shit they were playing on Opie and Anthony I was fucking howling what she said about Bruce Willis and Charlie Sheen being really similar because they were both big in the 80s and now they're having their old slots filled by Ashton Kutcher Seth MacFarlane good that's fucking hilarious yeah that's a great joke it's really well worded - yeah she's hilarious oh my god that girl's funny Seth MacFarlane was an offs it was awesome on that - I'll have to watch I don't have to watch it but I honestly I don't enjoy roasts for the most part I usually find them to be mean-spirited and fucking weird I know I've never wanted to do them I don't want to fucking shit on someone that hard right in front of them right you know it's like I don't it's cute and everything I mean it's fun to watch but no thanks man I don't want it if everybody knows each other really well - you know yeah like if you're all friends you know run us in each other's balls but sometimes it's not though man did you watch the ones where they went after Pam Anderson I didn't I don't think I saw the Pamela Anderson Wanda I haven't seen that Joan Rivers money the ruthless ruthless it's ruthless shit like you sitting watching I don't know why very possibly I don't remember specifics but I remember being like listening to a gun oh I don't want to hear this what are you doing are you voicing what the problem is it's funny that's the problem the problem is it's good stuff yeah you know I mean you're insulting the fuck out of someone hurting their feelings for no reason but to me it's kind of hilarious and it's not it's unfortunate that it is you know but when you're hearing her tee off on Mike Tyson she was talking about Mike Tyson having a a slut tattoo on his face you know that Mike Ben don't know whether to punch him or to finish on him yeah I fucked it up I think - yeah but he's great stuff but it's so mean like whoa if any Jeselnik had a couple really good ones good again towards Mike Tyson he said I'm paraphrasing but the joke basically was the best way to describe Mike Tyson is the same name of a Richard Pryor album meaning that nigger's crazy yeah nobody really got and Jeselnik he's a white guy but he cheated but he yeah but he didn't say the name of the album oh no he didn't bow oh I've said as in and that was the joke that he was gonna sell it out to everybody no he didn't spell it out he just left it at home because I was like wow no the same way whatever yeah he's the best way to describe him is the septum of a Richard Pryor album and then Patrice O'Neal it doesn't go over very well patrisse says he goes out there's too many too many white people here man they're not gonna get that and Jeselnik goes have you ever heard anybody say there are too few black people here that's hilarious yeah those roofs those rows can get mean man yeah I don't know I haven't seen a ton of them I heard the Joan Rivers one is good I heard when she comes back it's really funny yeah Oh it'll be a cat them yeah Wow she's great that documentary was pretty good did you see that I have not seen it Lee a lot of people recommended it what is it called again the Joan Rivers documentary I mean if you google that it'll come up I think what the fuck is it called gooseneck is that what it is no do you think she writes all her jokes who do you think she has like she buys jokes she different people but she probably writes I mean she's pretty quick on piece of work a piece of work that's it's really good huh I know it was some kind of euphemism on facelifts yeah it kind of is um a lot of people it's totally worth did you see her on Louie no I didn't do you watch do you guys watch Louie yeah I didn't see her and Louie though I got there's a funny one too that's she's really funny it's a funny episode season finale or something uh no surly in the season I gotta get into Louie I cut way back on my TV watching I cut way back to the point where I'm only watching like documentary shit yeah I just stopped I mean occasionally I'll watch like ancient aliens yeah I love that show man I love that idea are that Breaking Bad Louie Breaking Bad is awesome Breaking Bad's at best you know but Patton Oswalt said it best he said I feel like it's homework you know when you get into a show it's like it's homework it's like you got to keep up with these fuck the DVR man that's what like it's a godsend you just fucking yeah I could have you know you hear about luring madmen everybody keeps telling me ten Mad Men is amazing I'm like no we missed it so crazy unless whoo unless we get a wicked flu but you are you compare the four seasons I mean we're four seasons behind that's 48 hours of television I miss lost though I can't stop I wish I could talk about lost in theosophy go fuck itself and Jack killed it for me who's sending it in by the end of the show yeah there's like oh I guess they brought him back to life he'll be like completely phoning and then towards the end of the show Jack he killed it for me that was the doctor doctor and doctor killed it for me I had to stop watching I just I watched him like this guy's not really there he's not in the moment here okay I'm not believing that you just dumped the body in the fountain and then brought in front you barely paid attention dude right you know I kind of fell off with I yeah I kind of fell off with lost pretty quickly it was fun for a while but it can't fuck with Battlestar Galactica Battlestar Galactica was one of the best unexpected fun shows to follow that's a good goddamn show that was a really good fucking show if you want to like sit down I think they went a few seasons how many seasons do they go for five or something like that or watch either way it's a badass fucking show yeah that's a good show I watched the whole thing on DVD almost after the fact then caught up right at the very last scene you just have to be in the mood I figure it's like when you tear through a book or something like some sometimes I'll have like three books that I want to read and they just sit there and I'm like I don't want to touch him yet but then when you do make the commitment you just fly through it use a lot of people probably angry at me for what I said about lost yeah I used to love the shark people yeah I used to love the show I loved the show but it did bug me for real it did bug me I think they explained a lot of that okay I believe you but you know what I love the fact that I never wants to ending you don't live it down because that means you didn't get me I snuck away clean I no longer feel your pull yeah yeah no longer feel your pull I'm a dealer they're all dealers bro all these people with TV shows I mean included I'm guilty as well we're all dealers yeah did you hooked on some fucking crazy shit I loved being hooked a bad man that's a great fucking job yeah I don't want to be spoiler alert spoiler alert but when he had that dude locked up in the basement and he had that moral decision to make did you watch that you know he's had like he's had some altercations with gangbangers and stuff but yes yes a meth dealer and do you remember the one we had the guy locked up in the basement he had to figure out whether he should kill him or not yeah yep this season was last season last year the thing was last season yeah either way it was like one of the most intense scenes like I think I've ever seen in a like a made-for-television show it was like a movie it was a movie scene yeah I can intense man yeah that guy can act his fucking ass off they're great everybody's great I was the lead guys named Bryan Cranston yeah and I really like Gus man that guy's really I don't know how up on it you are but the last few episodes Gus is really which one's the head that like god the guy owns the chicken shops the head the black dude with the glasses dealer okay guys the guy that that Walter and Jesse worked for it is this the best time ever for fucking television I mean it must be right if you stop and think about some of the show I mean Mad Men people are really into which I'm sure is good obsessed people obsessed with Mad Men people are obsessed with even if you watch anything on NBC like any of the new shows they fucking all suck like they can scare me how bad is they have laugh tracks again they it's it's like what there's a show life tracks are awesome with precision I think if you use laugh tracks you should have to not be good at it you can usually do it but you you can't you can't like let it fade off like this here if you're gonna use the last track stop yeah really obvious it's a people probably start losing their minds like oh these are driving people crazy there's an idea man the idea of a laugh track we're gonna tell you that it's funny we're gonna we're not even gonna do it in front of a live audience we're gonna insert some fucking this is where we want you to laugh stupid mm-hmm I think Tim Heidecker tweeted her he's got somebody removed the laugh track from an episode of Big Bang Theory I think How I Met Your Mother or something and I didn't hear the him and Duncan were talking about it the other night and I haven't seen it well in all fairness but it sounded delirious a lot of those takes could have very easily have been second and third takes of a scene that you do in front of a live audience and they just don't get a laugh I think he had somebody go in and just remove it well it could be but I'm saying you know sometimes you have to do a scene you know you know if you're doing like a live sitcom in front of an audience yeah like on Newsradio we would fuck up or you know we would have to do something over again because they wanted to rewrite something and so we would do the same scene several times yeah yeah so it could very easily have been that even if you don't hear the audience laughing it could have been that yeah we would the film stuff after the fact like there was be scenes it wouldn't work pickups so yeah and we would we would like make totally new lines and the producers would like fake laughs on the side uh-huh they were like stand there hahahaha it was so alien Matt was so bizarre I'm surprised you weren't offered for two and a Half Men were you well no way man yeah I think you'd be I'm not alone I set out for that I'm not famous enough for that how long were you on Newsradio five years different that's a different level of fame they're looking for they're looking for that Ashton Kutcher Fame that's several in it Ashton Kutcher not be the guy from Jackass why is it so ridiculous this cuz yeah actors or yeah it's like it's like I think his Twitter followers has gotten to everybody's heads that he's not the guy on the camera commercials you know well you know listen the kid is a fuckin business genius he's got a lot of shit going on man he's very smart and very I'm not saying he's not I'm just saying I'm saying that's so ridiculous how like like he's looked upon like a Brad Pitt or something well he's a handsome guy there's a gorgeous dude he's like six foot bone structure night yeah whoa no for real I mean he girls love that guy there's a reason why they love him he's delicious yeah I mean he seems to be pretty well liked across the board yeah he's now I get no I met him get it from I worked for him actually there was I did a game show in my head this show that was his production company produce I mean I only got to meet him once very briefly but he was a nice guy he seems like he's got his game together let him do this crazy show yeah okay game show in my head it was it was pretty good in the show though I'm not saying I never watched two and a half men in the first place but you know did you watch the new one uh the new episode with him it was very dark very like whoa they they took a weird approach where they're making fun of his hey yeah I kind of want to see it I was gonna say I never watched it before but I want to watch it because of the controversy you know I want to watch it I watched one episode once and I thought it was kind of lame no I didn't think it was kind of lame I thought it was terrible I don't remember what was going on but I remember like like what is this know when you see something is just like alien it's like it's so not funny that it's just to torture your insides like what yeah and it was like that so I never watched it again but that happens on any sitcom there's a lot of weird sitcoms out there I left I like I I I watched a couple recently and yeah they just they were baffling I don't wanna say their names oh it's hard to do those it's hard to have a sitcom right now and then I watch and most of them really a lot of people get involved in the mix yeah it's only when someone has like awesome control over things like when one person's artistic vision can truly shine through like the South Park situation yeah those guys are so awesome that no one fucks with them so they just do their shit yeah which is why their shows so fucking brilliant it's like there's no more clear app like point like of of reference if you're like thinking about like one prime example of a show where you can tell the artistic minds behind it don't have any influence by anybody else it's out far right yeah that's cuz it's such a money John Lewis he has that free yeah yeah yeah yeah I would say he's right there yeah yeah I wish Louie was longer I wish they would pay him five times more in two half-hour have does every himself yeah but when you watch that show it's so short like you really start getting into it and then it just drops out it's good two minutes long do you think about doing everything yourself and doing it on a laptop that's what he does yeah he does it all he edits it on a fucking 13-inch MacBook Pro unless he's like trolling everybody he's trying to play the like fuckin super hard work or doing but really is like a whole crew if it changes it goes from like edited by Lucy Kane and sometimes it's not edited by really has other people work yeah so I think maybe well yeah that's good that he can trust people enough with his baby like that but because I you know I talked to him after he did his first show and Louie CK everybody knows if you don't know stand-up wise is one of the the best comics alive he's like the elite of the elite he's just a great comic you know but his his HBO show just what didn't click you know some people liked it lucky Louie some people like this I just there was something off about it there was something there was to to ham-handed and I talked to him about it and I said if you could do it all over again what would you do differently he's like I would I would fire everybody I think it was I'd fire all the writers and he goes I'm saying I'm sorry you know you're my friend I love you but I need someone else do this I got one shot at this I got one shot just to do this right Wow and so you know what he did he did he fired everybody now he's doing it all themselves you know yeah that's amazing it's so weird how his show doesn't follow any kind of guideline like like one day his daughter is somebody else are pretty consistent I know it changes there was like a totally different girl there the other day and I'm like who's this girl are you sure yeah are you sure know about that man almost pricy 99 percent sure really I would think to doubt about that if I was Louie a fairway I got a deal with his daughter I would think that he would work out a deal with the daughter yeah because they have a handful of episodes that revolve around the dog yeah I think sure there because I think that would take me out of the show a little bit the daughter's kept changing that would fuck with my head hey it kind of freaks me out that's I mean I'm a huge fan of that show so no I'm pretty sure unless I was just dreaming the whole thing google it Rogen was kissing some guy hey fella google it don't don't keep bringing them into your fucked up world dude I won out yeah the guy the other guy was delicious I need to take less of those there's alpha brass son oh yeah I excited about taking those yeah I'll give you something so they're back got stock right yeah it's good to go yeah good stock did you see your website by the way on the banner yeah there's a banner on my website if you go to Joe Rogan net and click on it I looked at that during the code name Rogan you get 10% off your alpha brain it's juicy it's becoming an alpha brain commercial I think we better stop before it gets great now I'm excited about it they're gonna find out it's interesting stuff but people you know know just kick mine Ben three domes on there's a thing on the page to it there's a new like medical editor wrote some editorial with references as to why this stuff works is the same Joe and Cody as dr. Joey listen cocksucker made this shit myself my special blend so I was over listening to a gay guy the other day at the Ramsey story were over listening to a gay guy over listening over hearing like I was paying too much attention and he was going off on one of these like how everybody's gay like you we were looking at the billboard which was that guy from CNN I just moved to like Fox with Anderson Cooper yeah and he was nice it's like I can't believe he hasn't come out yeah he's super gay I know a lot of people that say he's assumed I thought it was oh yeah oh I see I had no idea like fucking knows and you're trying to out him look at you and then and they were saying how then here's the word he was saying how the new president of Apple is gay and well they know that so now I'm just wondering if it's so now max really will be gay yeah we're going back to shiny white people are always like Mac's are gay so it's LP the cool line man yeah those are the best kissers online the message boards and shit Mac's are always treated as pretentious slobs yeah who can't work real computers like the vast majority really it seems like that there's a camp there's a PC camp and there's a Mac camp and one of the things that people always say is Macs are gay but now max really I wonder what gay things are gonna happen to our max they're the best what you're embarrassed I have I have a PC and I'm because I feel like people with Mac's just really look down their nose at people at pcs and I know it's a cool to have one way better but you know what man I don't I don't fucking edit music or videos right here Jessica check this I can get my grandma fucking kick-ass PC like you weren't a given but if you were given a Mac yeah you would use that Mac yeah never go back the same way if like of you that I phones you might be the biggest talk shitting shit talker ever saying Joy's the best and everything everyone person I know that that used to be that person got in I thought listen Lily you're just like crazy I'm just gonna you're just like all those crazy Windows people I'm gonna here's the real like I don't care that much about stuff it's crazy that we didn't even think about it it's a weird thing that people are have this amazing desire to be on teams yeah yeah that's crazy this is never gonna make those bitches and the startup times quicker than ever I was watching something online where they're showing how quick the startup time is a Windows 8 n from the time you press the button eight seconds and when those eight starts up in like it's like really quick yeah it's like so what when it runs it sucks yeah okay but we know who's freaking out about how long it takes your computer to start you know is that isn't it on most of the time 99.9% what the fuck are you even my computer's a piece of shit and it starts up fast enough for like do you get viruses no never you don't go to 30 dirty sites and then also every time a brand-new arouser a fucking pop up pops up no I do now it happened with my girls laptop II she had this thing called malware or something like that I'm all well where I don't even know what it is cuz I've been on I don't know I've heard about we're all you're thinking about is just a 40 but it was so bad that that that Norton didn't didn't do anything none of the kids are Jim Norton come do any kinda games like uh it got so bad that like there was nothing you could do is yeah I just art had to do registry edits in like fucking try to add do safe mode things just to get this thing off and it was like sending information it was reading passwords it wasn't tricked itself as a Windows of virus protection so on top of it it was like saying here's the way to get this off your computer click here to buy this virus scanning software and so then now you're giving your credit card information and sending your shit just to get that's far anything to unlock on your computer to get your computer back like I even I followed all these instructions I finally pretty much just had to wipe the whole thing and it was so common I found out like this is a normal thing that a lot of people get this is not like some crazy virus you got out of nowhere holy shit what is it called something antivirus I Rea know everything I read something insane I got the number of what the number of computer viruses out there what would you say it is oh there's a ton of them I don't know it's four hundred and eighty thousand five million so I would say huh I've heard say to the millions millions I'm trying to find it because it's so ridiculous but apples sucking a dick lately so I might be going back to PC I just got that Final Cut Pro and I had to pretty much relearn everything I feel dumb because it's a that's just one that's just one program though well that's that's one of their main programs they pretty much decided to take their main I'm gonna be mad at all of Apple because of one clone oh well I mean if that's the direction they're going where they're like making everything more I don't know like friendly or have look easy looking or you know simple cut and paste you know not like I mean the old Final Cut Pro is like you had pretty much you could do anything you want and this is like your you have to do like backwards steps and do all this extra bullshit just cuz it looks prettier so how crazy this answer is - how many computer viruses it's not exactly known but most likely in the millions the real problem is that new ones pop up every day yeah yeah yeah I guess millions millions MIT well from oh that are out there right now or from the stealing your personal information right that exists yeah I don't know is that possible I can go somebody might just be talking shit I need to get verification Milligan's you got to think how many people does it take to make one computer drivers wise because one dude alone just gets crazy and makes this on his own or is there other people involved like how many people are making these things well I think what it is a lot of these viruses are just all variations so like you'll have one virus that some people change something small in it like the ports or whatever in acts called something else you know I don't think it's like all new other people get out of it just like mischief fuckin with people well apparently there's one solution there was a that's all their goals is to steal your information yeah you're trying to get your credit card information a lot of people have all that stuff stored on their on their computers you know they have you know you have the the the e wallet set up so that you have all your credit card information so if you want to buy something you just use that oh yeah I don't do that I just I memorize I know my credit card

play with Michael Vick right isn't that the story what are you gonna go on the Eagles I think that's what I'd heard I know nothing about football though I might have heard that from Joey Diaz they're gonna get that cocksucker he's gonna show him how to play fucking football I was that Michael Vick's gonna make him billions dog billions New Orleans New Orleans you should have to have a passport to go to that fucking place man that's another country New Orleans is another country that's a wild ass place I have never been in a city that has such a unique personality as New Orleans it's like the whole city is small and it's cranked up to nine like everything's cranked up people are friendly as fuck everyone's drunk as shit yes I feel fucked up if you're not drunk you know Duncan and I were doing shots with dinner right we never have we got the honor so I feel like having some fuckin whiskey cause it's New Orleans man it doesn't do you fuckin doing shots while we eatin crab cakes we went out we had a show a House of Blues it was fuckin awesome yeah it was the there was the energy in the room was just whoo it was fun what's the hot chick level for New Orleans they're beautiful do a lot of beautiful girls we there was a burlesque show on after us we stayed and watched a burlesque show which is very strange like everybody like dresses up like they're from the different time period yeah and they kind of like dance around and some of it did you although beautiful is quite aimless yeah just a lot of dancing around and like I guess you're just celebrating how she's dressed and dancing around it was kind of fun because everybody was drunk and getting into it yeah it's so many drunks and so many fucking happy people like I didn't see a single angry drunk it was weird it was like there was so many people drunk though here's one of the things that our driver was the coolest fucking guy this dude Jeff and Jeff took us around and Jeff was talking to us about how he could only live in New Orleans because he had lived outside of New Orleans only for a little bit and he got in trouble with a cop because the cop he's talking to the cop about something and he was drinking a beer on the street a cop was asking him where he's coming from and he didn't know that you're not allowed to drink beer on the street right right yeah you can drink beer anywhere yeah drink beer on the street so while he's talking to the cop he said he opened up a second beer and the cop was like are you stupid is there something fucking wrong with you he knows where you from he goes New Orleans it's like alright you can't do that anywhere but there right yeah yeah and he was like well fuck this and he went back dude New Orleans is the shit man that is and we were in Metairie too that's why we went and me and Goldberg and and Telegraaf a karate went and had dinner out there and Duncan and it was fucking what a great town and people are so fucking friendly there on this honky Tonk slash sports bar on a Friday night we're eating cheeseburgers with these people you know and they're like their local haunt or Saturday night like where they hang yeah it was badass man because people you met there and Leah's fight man friendly is fuck like what a great vibe that town ass happy vibe you seen into ghost town I don't have much time dude I had very little time you know that's the problem with you know I fly in somewhere it's like boom first thing I gotta go do the weigh-ins and the my comedy show and then in the morning I get up and work out I do the UFC there's no time really for like too much sightseeing unfortunately it's the greatest job of the world but there's no time for a lot of shit but we did get to go down the French Quarter we walked around Bourbon Street and like this is crazy how is this legal yeah this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life it's beautiful first of all it's a fucking thing it's it's in a really a national treasure the fact that a place like this exists and this uptight stuck-up fucking just scared country we live in now that you can go to a place in its strip club bar food strip club bar food strip club bar food this is the recipe yeah chickens voodoo all up this street and it's just a swarm like salmon spawning of humanity with cups in their hands and everybody is fucking blasted yeah and we're just wandering through the streets checking out the scene and the bars I'm amazing quote that don't contain Juris to them fuck out here no one's closing means no close and this shit just stays open they're just open yeah open that's tough though like we I did a show a Stanhope there a few years ago and I don't think our show got started until like 11:30 or something so by the time we got out of there was probably about two and we're like well let's go get a drink at a bar and we go to this bar and there's people from the show hanging out and I'm like playing pool with the guy and we're getting pretty drunk and I was like what time is it and I look at my fucking phone it's like 7:00 in the morning and I'm like duh it's like 7:00 in the morning we got a like we had to leave it like 9:30 what do you need I can make some for you you have the cream yeah you poured it for me remember is it in that fridge must have put it away did we even finish the story of what you did - so we're like no I'm one of the most funniest things ever most funniest most almost the 87 37 yet look I got Internet talk in my head man I don't talk in full sentences anymore like more it's more gooder marketer but you pretty much on I love the part you have all this big thing with practical jokes like you did this thing where you print it out I think we talked last time where you petered out on top top chef and put it on billboard this little thing of him you're pouring stew and he put it on you know this thing and then then this time you what the last there's in my neighborhood there's a vacant Circuit City that's been there it's been vacant for almost three years and I was talking with a friend of mine about how there's no Whole Foods in our neighborhood and you would silver Lakes a pretty hipster like it would be a perfect place for a Whole Foods and he was like yeah that would be a good location and I was like yeah it would so I made these banners that said coming soon Whole Foods Silver Lake and I'll show I have pictures of them and I hung them on the fence around the Circuit City so everybody thought that uh so that that's Silver's like what like all they use like you know hipsters were gonna have a Whole Foods in there in their neighborhood and it blew the fuck up on Twitter it was on like websites like Los Angeles Weekly and shit like that it everyone thought Whole Foods was coming that was a huge deal people oh that's beautiful it's got really excited Union and then and they've well you know you should talk to Whole Foods and say listen the demand is here great oh I'm sure they've talked to them already I mean that place has been vacant for maybe too much money to convert it to a supermarket something I know it's too expensive yeah have you always been a practical joker gonna have your whole life like do you have any like like biggest joke you ever did or favorite one that you've ever done there's there's one that you can actually hear they played it on another podcast everything I know that's well I mean great stories I played the I had this card where you can Sonny though you have to say that though you do kind of have to say well yeah I don't want people to like you're failing tells the same fucking we're assuming that they're listening to all these different podcasts yeah I don't think people have enough time to listen on the podcast I think we're deluding ourselves maybe I don't know yeah it's one radio you and be like yeah well I said just on mark and Brian like two months ago you know no one else I might depends I don't want to sound like them all right so what happens well you can hear it online I called my five this card it's called a spoof card where you can call someone and make it look like it's coming from any number in the world like I could call you make it look like it's coming from the White House and so I called my friend from his uh wife's number his newly ex-wife's number and I would make jokes about one to bang his wife all the time and stuff so uh so I call him in the middle of the night and I think I was telling him that I was that I was gonna go out on a date with her and I wouldn't really tip my hat my mother I was joking or not and I so I call him in the middle of the night from his wife's from what looks like his wife's number and I use a voice disguise or did make kind of sound like a girl and basically I tell him I that it's his wife a my gun and of course he thinks it's her you know he just got woken up at four in the morning and I say you know I went over to your friend Brendan's tonight it's fucked up man and I'm like I think he raped me and he's like what is his mind but then but it all ends like it all ends in left he goes cuz then he goes where are you right now and I go I'm in the hospital and then there's like a pause and I say there's jizz all over me and then he goes fucking Brendan I knows you the fucking card I can't believe you're wasting your card on me what how does that card work is that shit illegal just you call an 800 like there's an 800 number that you call that's a cross is legal there's probably less for it yeah there's actually it's it's a lot of people use it Lindsay Lohan was known to always use that for whatever reasons but it's like when you use a calling card like an old-school calling card where you call an 800 number and put in your code right and it's but instead of a code you put in whatever phone number you want and then you put in you hit like pound then it calls Wow making it look like it comes in a bowl and it'll even say like well yeah obviously if it's like read ban if you put in his number his picture comes up on your phone or really crazy man how is that legal I don't have their show that's crazy you could you could cause divorces fucking murder you people you do all kinds of crazy shit to so many was I've never done anything like I've never done any friend of Blake malicious or we think all the mean people in the world would something like that oh god yeah they could do some damage there's probably some recently divorced motherfucker googling spoof card right now like yeah yeah I probably just got them like 10 grand in business you should start your own spoof card company yeah you should Brian yeah yeah okay oh maybe I'll go away from this comedy thing and you need to really get involved in helping people ruin other people yeah I've secretly be the Ashley Madison some cloak-and-dagger shit it seems like they shouldn't be able to do that I don't understand how that could possibly be legal how could you possibly be able to pretend you're someone else and call someone I don't think that's legal I imagine that that seems like fraud you know yeah I mean it seems like there would be some sort of a weirdo a terrorist law to protect you against shit like I think it falls in the same categories like if you write a letter saying that year you're writing it from the White House on the returns you know lady I don't know I mean I you know hopefully I don't get in trouble but I think there's an app no I think that it's something that's out there and I don't think it's illegal yeah Thursday actually an app it's the voice because you can also do like unknown number I don't know there's an app that you can buy that's a voice recorder it is called recorder on the app store and it's the same kind of idea where you put in your credit card information and then it filters the call through this app or something like that and it records it for you so you can record phone calls using your iPhone it's called record yeah Sam to record phone calls using your eyes so yeah record other people's phone yeah it uses like the same thing where it's actually card illegal yeah this is illegal but it yeah how is it legal but 3d mall recording on creepy apps on your phone kid might want to rethink your app there was one point in time when I had four fired apps on my phone but I got a new phone they were derelict for a bunch of free gets old pretty quick but I mean whatever free fart apps yeah what satisfaction to someone have will they make a free fart app one dude put a Joe Rogan I i phone applications some somebody made one it's not me it's not mine but he's selling it what's it do I don't know I've looked at it but he's selling it well there's a lot of is he allowed to do that I don't think so well you're the guy who should probably look it yeah I just found out about it there's a lot of apps that you have like you know for celebrities that have like the Britney Spears fan app where it's just like improve your home address that's probably what it is it's probably something like that really good joke but it's like a buck cost a dollar so something selling it you want me to buy it yeah fuck it I'll buy it don't do it let me say we're advertising something that's done for the wrong place kids don't buy that we don't have a dump there's no seven second delay no we're live dude all that creeping shit you said earlier the world knows ok well that should I said 7 seconds ago all the fucked up shit you were thinking you know it brings me up to that the roast thing again there's a funny thing about that style of comedy man that real mean fucking ridiculous style you know I'm a big fan of that kind of style of comedy that's one of the reasons why I was kind of upset when that Tracy Morgan thing went down and I was like you know yeah what he said for sure he shouldn't have said that but he's out there swinging yeah crazy pitches means out there saying the most fucked-up shit possible it's not that he really means most of this right this is his act his act is ridiculous and extreme and that's what's so funny about it yeah it's like this is weird line though where people start judging in as a statement you know instead of just as something ridiculous I think people are just looking for shit to get upset like people are so like we're so fucking ripped off and fucked in this country right now it's like Oh Tony Bennett said something about 9/11 let's have 9,000 news stories about that yeah and not about like I and whatever this might sound like a bitter son but like you hear about all this job creation stuff like talking about we're gonna create jobs but just stop outsourcing them is that like as anybody said that is that like a popular belief that yeah well I think yeah a lot of people think that the economy would be much better if we stop doing that but then I think bones would be $7,000 well and okay maybe everybody doesn't have an iPhone I think they've you know so many places have been established so many electronics have always been cheap yeah well it's not because we're making them no oh yeah I mean how many electrons do we make over here barely none but like telemarketing could be done here still yeah that's that no my point was it I think those people work too hard I think if you look at those what is it Foxconn those all of those things online about that the people who make those iPhones like they would never do that here that shit would never get done here would never get done so yeah you know just it would it just wouldn't happen well no they can have the Asians can keep all the electronic stuff they do a good job in that well just do it you know like the sitting in a chair yeah trying to sell people shit over the phone what was the point about why did we get on the discussion of how much those things cost to make why turning to you Brian that's when you know it's dark out oh man that's me no the end is near I'm turning to you did you hear about this fucking computer towers who figured out the we were talking about people I'm sorry about people being outraged about the met Tracy Morgan people are definitely looking you're right and looking to be able to have you heard about the Tony Bennett stuff like when he was on Howard Stern he said something about he bad the singer the singer what'd he say he said something about that terrorists like 9/11 was kind of like we've been fuckin with people it's like you know it was bound to happen sooner or later I don't remember exactly what he said but he was like well you know we done fucked up shit too so you know I'm supposed to say that though no he got a lot of shit but I think it's overblown which is you know like the Tracy Morgan thing there's just always something with enough buzzwords like 9/11 or faggot where the news can latch onto that and just keep everybody like oh look over there you know while they're like fuckin stealing all their money and yeah it's uh it's amazing that the other thing that we accept like pretty openly is that in times of war you're not supposed to do anything that's gonna possibly damage soldiers morale or upset the way they look at things like you know what you're not supposed to say things that would you know write possibly upset them you know you know it's kind of it's which you know totally makes sense but when you stop and think about it like what are you asking them to do yeah that's just you're already in the water you know don't you think they're figuring it out by now like wait a minute this is fucking bullshit yeah do you think you know I mean some people can keep it together some people look people are meant to do everything now there's people that are meant to do that it sounds ridiculous but I firmly believe it I think there's a broad spectrum of human beings in this world ya know it's I don't want to bring anybody's morale down why would you even think they're right I do ever think about joining the military and importing your life no not at all I've always had a problem with like Authority and stuff and I do too but I also thought that I needed discipline yeah when I was 18 I almost joined thought about it I wouldn't say almost joined but I thought about it like as a strong possibility for a couple of days well as to me at 18 was with my fucking heavy a DD was a big deal I think it would have done me good but yeah I wouldn't know why I always admired people that did it I had a few friends that were in the army and I have a few friends that have been in the Marines and they they definitely came back like more there was something about them you know they had more confidence you know they like been through boot camp and all that there was a passage a coming-of-age sort of a thing that I hadn't experienced and I was like I think there's something to that you know I think like boot camp is good for somebody oh I was always trying to figure out what's the the best way to think what's the best way to maneuver your way through life what is and I was the thing that I was most uncomfortable I'm like I'm fucking lazy man I don't like this I don't
