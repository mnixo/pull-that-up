the girag and experience now when you structure your stories do you use a software program to use index cards on a bulletin board like how do you set up where you're moving all your pieces in your Tetris game I used two things we do use I got a magnetic whiteboard in the office and write on the index cards and put them all up with that and sometimes you know strings between the cards that kind of thing that's the general getting it all down the flow and then I use a program called Scrivener which people can use from Mac or PC and it's basically the same thing it's little index cards in the computer and there's an index card that represents a document each document is a chapter but it's great it's better than Microsoft Word because Microsoft Word once you get a bit past a hundred pages 200 pages you're copying big chunks and moving around and becomes a nightmare cuz you're gonna screw something up mm-hmm but Scrivener you just grab this icon and drag it before this icon it rearranges everything so I've gotten pretty adept using that I highly recommend it it's great for scatterbrain to keep everything flowing and then a lot of times it'll just be you know I get overwhelmed with the screen and everything going on and I'll just pull out the 3x5 index cards and start writing everything down again bullet points on those put them up on the board and go through it that way so you'd like to do it digitally you like to do it manually you like to just mix it up and constantly keep doing it in a different way that keeps your brain moving yeah what I find is when you get stuck there's a couple different things number one if you just staring at that screen you're stuck just getting your hands involved in a pen and not you know like just an ink pen and paper is a tactile experience as a different experience it activates different parts your brain sometimes can like oh now I get it now I see what I was stuck on so that's part of it and other parts of it is there's only so much screen real estate so you can only see so many things at one time if you really stuck you pull back write all these index cards you put it up in this you know 4 foot by 5 foot whiteboard and you kind of look at everything that can spring your brain free at times too so it's largely it's grabbing whatever is if I get stuck in one area I'll start going to other areas and when I get really overwhelmed and frustrated I am more comfortable slipping back into you know the eight-year-old version of me which is a little piece of paper and some notes or no next card and go back and just write it out till it all kind of flows out of the page so as long as the process is just continuing over and over and over again yeah that's uh Scribner yeah yeah I use that for jokes I usually yeah really yeah I use it I use a couple of different things one I use a real chalkboard a real cork board rather and I have index cards and I put them up with pins and I have bits I have one star two star and three star one star is a completely new bit two stars a bit that's still improving three stars is a bit that's pretty close to being done okay they always grow and change and get weird and there's always like new directions they take on certain shows and because I mix them up too I'll mix up the order of like the different pieces inside the bit try to figure out which way works and I like Scrivener because I could take those cards and just move them around and sometimes when I'm just studying just thinking about my act maybe I'll listen to recordings it's one of the most uncomfortable parts of stand-up but I think one of the most important you gotta listen and see yourself and and listen to like oh I don't like how I did that like there's too much too much bullshit in that joke and that this joke is kind of clunky and the wordings not good or the inflection is too fake or what have you you know so that process is aided by that and one of the things that I really loved was gonna ask you about his write room you ever use write room I've used it just to look down the phone no write room is the one that takes your entire screen it makes it black and gives you that green letter will do that to you Oh does it really scriveners got a white out or a black out feature gets rid of everything on the screen except what you're reading so kind of the same okay cool yeah well that's right room doesn't give you access to anything you can't go to the toolbar every time it is you don't get shit yeah that's that's right room that's what it looks like I really really like it it's my favorite it's something I probably need to start using more in Scrivener because I get distracted trying to stay in touch with social media and everything else and if you're on the computer and a fan is asking you a question the natural impulse is to go answer that question so you know getting to a point where I can just ignore all that but um I was just in Vegas for the New Media Expo and when I really get into it and I was under deadline so I started writing at noon and we're staying at the Rio don't have the seafood buffet at the rail I will tell you that how dare you oh my do that oh my god I've got the top the best vomit of my whole life there's been a lot of bombs like my clams and a musket oh I don't know I don't know what it was but it was it was Linda Blair shit it was what a crazy but I'm I'm writing and it's like noon out and like there's the window and the windows open and by the time I got finished it looked out and it was pitch black outside so sometimes I can't imagine it's the same thing when you're writing more of the short form jokes and moving around from the jokes but for this long for him things like 50 page story my own screen came up and I all I was working on didn't look at anything else just wrote the whole thing through yeah you can get in those zones I don't write jokes like joke jokes what I do is I write about subjects and I find the jokes in what I write about it when he went what I find is that when I'm writing about things it takes longer for me to write the word history than for me to think of it or know it exists if I'm thinking about history I can think about it but I have to say each I asked you I mean I have to actually individually type all the letters and in that you you have much more consideration to every sentence that you write every every chapter every concept because you're you're thinking a lot quicker than your writing so as you're writing it down you're considering deeply each end it's like it's forces you to pause and consider each individual word consider the the concept you're actually talking about far more than if you were just having a conversation you're having a conversation it takes more it takes it's much quicker to get the words out right I think in that slowing you down it makes you consider things more and then sometimes you'll just miss like really obvious shit that you would have missed it if you were talking but when you're writing like oh and what about this and then you'll go off in some of the directions so you give your brain like a different rhythm the rhythm of writing no talking no no no distractions no fucking music sand off all the nonsense lock the door hit it hit the right room and just go yeah do you find do you find you have to go for a certain amount of time before all the sudden shit starts to take off I'm useless for the first half hour yeah yeah I I don't even take credit for the things I write because it's not me writing them you know your interviews we'd wrote it we'd wrote that one no I don't have that one in me I I'm like the first 30 minutes are usually just trash absolute trash work and then at some point something just takes over in here really good stuff it's interesting isn't it that that weird switch that goes off where you find yourself really Zen and what you're doing for me it is probably around the same time about 30 minutes and 20 30 minutes the first 20 minutes says I don't even think I'm just trying to smash keys and write things down yeah and just thinking but kind of getting into it trying to and then somewhere along the line you catch traction but my ad D is so bad now I've got a technique like I'll just set the alarm on the phone said it for 30 minutes and then I'm like okay I'm just not gonna look at anything else I can do this for 30 minutes it's just 30 minutes force yourself to write for 30 minutes doesn't matter what you write and then almost invariably by the time the buzzer goes off you're just like turned off and you're just like because you're you're rolling at that point but you have to force yourself to be like I have to get into the groove my groove is usually also to move around the house I like to pick up my laptop and go sit so outs go sit in my you know sit in my living room go sit upstairs go sit in front of the TV you don't even watch TV you sit on a couch you know I think that when I do that instead of just being in my office and stare at the screen sometimes just being in a different space sitting in a different place just oh we're here now and that just that changing of your routine just a little variation on it sometimes can spark the mind in interesting new direction yeah you get you get down these wormholes and just getting any other kind of sensory input which goes back to now I'm gonna write things down instead of type them out anything like that can cuz it's all in there all that stuff you want to come up with is in there it's not like you're you know it's not like you have a factory we have to make all this crap it's already in there you're just kind of getting figuring out how to mine it out of your own brain and put it onto the page you know what I also find super beneficial a walk a walk yeah walk you know and I used to bring a recorder but now with these new cell phones you don't have to do that your phone can record amazing notes and I just go for a walk walk my dogs or something like that go down the street and just when I'm thinking about something and I've got something in my head and I'm done writing and then I'm reviewing the things that I wrote and like how would I I've you this if I was a person who's reading it like how would I how would I take this like I'll take it into consideration as I'm walking it's like the fat you know there's something about forcing yourself to do a mundane very obvious task left foot right foot left foot right foot and then you can get into that groove of introspective thought yeah yeah I need some of that to me is like I've got this little tiny office but there's like a loop there's like four rooms and you actually go from kitchen to this room to the entryway to the writing room and I just just don't do the laughs so I just start doing laughs and it usually doesn't take very long cuz you're turning right all the time every two steps and it's there's something about your brain has to put some level of attention on and not walking into things and that usually comes from the part that's blocking you the part that stopped me I can you're convincing yourself you can't get this shit out and now okay all right boom now run back to the desk and start writing things down really quick have you ever tried using speech recognition software for writing it wouldn't work for me only because I'm by the time I block a sentence down it's probably already been rewritten three times start the sentence go back start suns go back and I'm fortunately a pretty fast typer I learned that a long time ago as I knew I wanted to write and yeah I just changed things so fast like it's all muscle memory now it's like copy this pace let's move this around I I cannot imagine speech recognition would ever work for me the Mavis bacon teaches type-a that's the 1i oh I know that Mavis bacon yeah yeah that was from me man I was the poker guy yeah this looking right at them it took a long time so genius product like no just play video games bitching like what I'm just playing video games and all that I can type it was amazing as amazing and it's they're fun games like you're racing and shit you're doing all kinds of different stuff and figuring out where the little keys are that's that's so important man I just have one of those goofy keyboards it was like separated split ones yeah and your hands rest on it it's just shit yeah those died off what happened the economic this was working I don't think they worked for crap you're supposed to be good for you I had the one that actually was like a transformer it actually had a hinge did you ever get the one where you sink in you sink your fingers in there was a weird one like this or your fingers like did in a cradle I still have to look like every now and then I'm still glancing down to get some kind of tracking going on which I don't need to do anymore but it can't break myself as a habit like I can I can close and I do this sometimes when I'm overwhelmed with an idea I'll just close my eyes and just start typing so I don't need to do any more but I'm still I can't break that habit of looking down at the screen that's a I had one of those yeah there's those and then there was the Microsoft ones are a little bit more curly and they had like an actual space and which mean didn't separate they're just it's more like lumpy they called them ergonomic keyboard nobody makes those things anymore I don't think I don't know you know what the problem is you get used to those when you go to a laptop and it feels weird yeah you know a lot of people are typing their stuff on laptops now so like the way you learn how to type on a laptop is you want your fingers to be right in that position of J&F the fingers across the board right from there you go.you if you go back and forth from laptop to keyboard glide this is like a thinking more you have to like a quarterback changing your throwing motions yeah didn't change everything around yeah it fucks with you yeah but the speech recognition software is fascinating to me because I wonder if that I'll ever be something that I'm interested in because I for the walks I have to imagine you know right you're walking you still speak everything down no I just record it right and go back and yeah I go back and listen to it I I really find that there's a completely different state of mind the actual writing state of mind and I find that I'm way more creative when I could just sit and in total silence not hear my voice or anybody's voice and right I'll allow my brain to go in all sorts of weird directions when they're not it's not attached to flowing moving language ideas can sort of emerge instantaneously and I just try to follow them and capture them in writing I think I limit myself when I'm actually talking hmm yeah yeah no it comes to writing things yeah I did it's for me but at this point it's just down to it's a process now I got the process going and getting more and more comfort with the process so hopefully I'm growing towards that you know Stephen King's process is just so fast but your process is also very creative I mean you have to have this idea you have to have the story if we eat this story yeah that part's never before people some people talk about writer's block I've never that I've had the opposite which is just this onslaught of cool ideas like this would be a good book and this would be a good book in trying to try to keep track of everything so the creative part being a scatterbrain little kid fortunately just has never been an issue for me it's all it with me it's always been the discipline of being able to write it down and trying to fight the a D D and you know and like I have to keep working on this to make it the best it can be when after the first draft I'm kind of already done with it I'm like I want to go do something else but you can't you got to go back and keep hammering on that sword and making it make it a good weapon yeah that's that's really interesting that it's the different types of creative processes that all try to achieve the same thing whether it's a song or a movie or a book or or a joke it's it's completely fascinating to me the different ways that people approach it and different met the different mindsets they have in approaching it too you know that's that there's there's no one pattern which is what's fascinating about the human brain everybody's got a different way of doing it and just keep working at it till you get to that end product or you can hopefully look at what you finished with and I think all creative people kind of have the same thing you probably have it too like that's a pretty good joke that's not the best it could possibly be but I think that's pretty good that's gonna go in the arsenal for the next standup and with me it's like that book is pretty good I would work on that book for the next ten years every day to try and make everything perfect but you know at least for me there there is no perfection like I hear some others go I keep working until I have absolutely the perfect the perfect phrase and the perfect sentence in the perfect paragraph in the perfect page that's great but you know we got to put a book out and sell some books so I can't work on a book for ten years
