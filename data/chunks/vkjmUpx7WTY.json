hello freak bitches who can whip those people up and get on their frequency and then there's smart people that could be manipulated they can be manipulated once they attach themselves to an ideology yep like we were talking about like people on the left that are avoiding all the craziness about Hillary like you had a quote that I really like that's on your Twitter you know that if like Hillary was a man that had done all the same things that she but what is the quote what is it your exact I said I said if Hillary was a male Republican with the exact same voting record all of her supporters would hate her with a passion yeah it's true and it's 100% true hunter percent true I mean it's not this is not controversial he's our way or shape or form Hillary is is you know I mean in the stuff I was saying before but she's she's like courting the left she's quoting people who are supposed to be liberals and you'll go she supported every single war of my lifetime every single war when and again they can get past that she didn't support gay marriage up until 2013 even their pet issues yeah it's good she's she's a weird one man she's a really really weird one that fucking Libya thing we Came we saw he died like that's okay like are you kidding me what you remember when the fucking Vermont guy screamed and then we're gonna go all the way alas Howard Dean Howard Dean and that one yell did him in that's it they saw and like fuck this guy we we Came we saw he died ha ha ha ha like that doesn't you don't think that lady's fucking crazy yeah you don't think that lady's fucking car honey you're down for her that's that is a completely an ideology thing you she's she's on your team you're gonna you're gonna go along with it just like it's a religion just like you're you're subscribing to some predetermined thing it's it's just it's weird for me to see first of all it's weird that she wants to be president like aren't you old like you're an old lady how much energy do you have got a ton of money you just had your first grandkid you're like perfect yeah like what you're trying to do is trying to make history as a woman is that what it is I mean do you want to just like get back your husband for getting his dick sucked in 1991 or whatever the fucking was yeah I mean I don't even think it's that I think it's it's I mean who knows who you know I'm not in their head but I think these people are like power brokers that just want more and more of it and it's a real it is probably a thrill unlike anything we could imagine to have that much power and they've they've tasted a little bit of that you know yeah just it seems to me that she's like so old but she would just want to chill you know it just doesn't make any sense to me yes she's an old lady like she doesn't have good health I does the other thing they concerned with she had some health issues right I'm sure like concussions or something yeah there was hit in the head I forget what it was but it was Wendy to fuck out of her imagine that turns out the bill just wailed on her and she wants to keep it quiet bill fucking kod hey wouldn't he's been accused of violence wow she has suffered from fainting spells since at least 2005 and that year she passed out presumably sober while giving a speech in 2012 she passed out yet again and suffered a concussion holy fuck presumably sober is something that if they ever have to say it it's just not good yeah you got issues we're always presumably sober I'm not usually presume abut all right you know but this idea that she fell asleep and it hit her fucking head like when people fall and hit their head it's one of the worst things about getting knocked out is not getting punched in the head it's you falling down and getting hit in the head with the earth yeah like they're their heads bounced off the ground that's like a big issue in street fights and stuff when you watch someone get sucker-punched fall down and their head gets bounced off the curb and I think people who have like epilepsy and things like that like that's the big fear what happens is that you end up cracking your head on the ground it's not just the the seizure seizures um yeah there's there's something I don't know you know she Hillary Clinton said recently this is probably one of the tactics she tries to use against Trump but she said something along the gut she goes you know I just I don't know if he's the type of guy we would want having control of the nuclear codes and it's just like an interesting thing to look at what you're like how crazy is it that any one person has control of those nuclear codes like we're just counting on one person to not snap to not kill the whole world to just yeah hopefully you don't ever just like I've had enough I'm fuckin yeah it's the the cigarettes and coffee thing are the staples of the alcoholics right a lot of people enjoy those cigarettes and they enjoy those uh those coffees but you know and generalize yeah but but in their eyes they feel like they've got the alcohol part under wraps now because this stuff just kind of keeps them going and this stuff is not ruining their life right you know a lot of alcohols use cannabis the same way and that's not really accepted by AAA so I know a lot of people who have kicked their alcoholism by moving more towards cannabis but again within the AAA community that they don't like that that's you know still considered a drug so but you can get addicted to anything you know whether it's set porn or Big Macs or were weed you can get it psychologically addicted to anything Jamie didn't the guy who created Alcoholics Anonymous didn't have positive experiences with LSD that would be feel like I feel like you did assets the only thing you're allowed to take well I feel like I feel like that was something that happened like maybe even after I don't want to speak out of school yeah am i right yeah so what the fuck well that's why the government needs to look testing on a lot of things that we know scroll it up please Alcoholics Anonymous founder believed LSD could cure alcoholism Wow well you've seen so much research now in psychedelics that clinics are opening up there's a clinic in in LA for for kademan you know I'm you're seeing MDMA clinics opening like this what most of them do not realize the programs co-founder Bill Wilson credited the psychedelic drug LSD for alleviating his alcoholism and believed the drug could be used to treat others as well holy shit so those Friends of Bill they didn't get all the information it's kind of my friends of Bill if you're in the Alcoholics Anonymous right that's what they call themselves like yeah it's a bill that's like the coil W the get that experience it's kinda like the mushrooms like quitting cigarettes yeah but do you think they tell them I never heard this before today how could you not tell these people Wilson first weekend we began experimenting with LSD in Los Angeles at the Veterans Administration back in 1956 but after taking his first hit of acid he realized that it was not the aspect of terror that could help remedy alcoholism but rather the insight one could attain from stepping into a world of simulated insanity whoa Wilson believed that using the LSD could help the alcohol discover a Power greater than ourselves that in turn could restore us to sanity however he was adamant that using acid to combat the demons of alcoholism was not something that he could that one could expect from a single dose it was like more research is required then snacks Wow hmm that's interesting man that's interesting yes psychedelics I think as we experiment with them it's like medically our gonna reveal some secrets good luck this guy's this guy's a heavy-duty tripper is there going further down he was trippin with Aldous Huxley like this guy this isn't like one experience he had interesting there's documentation that indicates Wilson was involved with many supervisors LSD trials including some with psychology psychologists Betty Eisner and brave new world author Aldous Huxley which led him to believe that the visions and insights given by LSD could create a large incentive at least in a considerable number of people huh and so this was with like a leader yeah in fact though they left this out of the AAA pamphlet I mean how could they leave this out that's crazy because this seems like this had to play a major part in this guy's ability to kick alcohol [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
